When honourable senators move to vote at a later stage, it would be misleading for them to think they are voting on strict liability when in fact they would be voting on possession. Without putting too fine a point on it, discussions last night suggested to me that my amendments on strict liability would not necessarily get the numbers, but I understand there is some degree of sympathy for the issue of possession.

Senator Abetz's amendment proposes to introduce strict liability in relation to each of the prohibited practices. Strict liability offences are entirely inappropriate for offences that carry penalties of 10 to 15 years imprisonment. The Criminal Law Division of the Attorney-General's Department has a general rule that any offences that carry a penalty of more than 50 penalty units—that is, $550—should not be strict liability offences. </para></talk.start><para>This general rule is based on the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee standing order No. 24, which draws attention to provisions where strict liability is imposed and, in particular, ensures that the provisions do not unduly trespass on personal rights and liberties. On the basis of this standing order—and I would not want to pre-empt what the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee would say— it is likely that the Scrutiny of Bills Committee would be extremely concerned to see offences in legislation that are strict liability offences which carry a penalty of 10 to 15 years imprisonment. I have been advised that this is entirely unprecedented in Commonwealth legislation and, therefore, we will be opposing Senator Abetz's amendment. I can go into that in more detail if required.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>6174</page.no><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HOGG</name><name.id>7L6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I raised with the minister the question of a penalty for those who intentionally place—and I want to come to back to that in a moment—the human embryo clone in the body but that there seems to be no offence committed by the person who receives it. It seems to me that it would be quite a deliberate act on the part of the person receiving it. There would have to be complicity on the part of the person receiving it. It is not something that would be just a one-off, unfortunate incident that took place. Minister, the bill seems to be deficient in that area. Could you respond to me on that, please.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>6174</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Health and Ageing</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am going back to do law, Senator Hogg. The reason the legislation does not target the receipt of possession—which is the argument you are putting—is that COAG decided to target the more serious, high-level offences such as creating or implanting prohibited embryos. The significant penalties attached to these offences indicate that the Australian community views these sorts of crimes extremely seriously. If it is an offence to create and develop certain types of embryos and it is also an offence to implant, import and export those embryos, it is unlikely that people will be in a position to ever be in possession of those embryos. </para></talk.start><para>The aim of the bill is to deter those people who have the greater capacity to commit the offence—namely, scientists and others with the technological knowledge to create prohibited embryos. It was not considered appropriate or necessary, for example, to create a separate offence to punish a woman in whom a cloned embryo was implanted. I note, however, that the Criminal Code extends criminal responsibility to other forms of action such as aiding, abetting, procuring the commission of an offence and conspiracy. Persons engaging in this sort of activity may be found guilty of an offence. These provisions should go some way towards satisfying members of this chamber that people who deliberately participate in the commission of an offence will still be subject to criminal sanctions. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>6174</page.no><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator ABETZ</name><name.id>N26</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—At a later stage we will move an amendment to the amendment that I have moved in relation to possession. But I respectfully suggest that the advice given to the committee be somewhat more robust. If the explanation that has just been provided is to be accepted by this place, can the government tell us why it is a crime to be in possession of narcotics? Having regard to the reasoning that has just been given, there should be no offence of possession in relation to a whole range of crimes, be they involving narcotics or, indeed, as simple as the offences of unlawful possession under the Excise Act 1901, section 117C. For example, a person must not without permission possess or have custody or control of tobacco seed, tobacco plant or tobacco leaf. </para></talk.start><para>For simple offences like those involving tobacco, mere possession is an offence. If the rationale that was just provided is to be sustained, then one wonders why we have `possession' littered throughout our legislative regimes, be it in narcotics, tobacco or, indeed, in a range of other areas such as forged banknotes. You are not allowed to be in possession of forged banknotes. You could run the line: `Well, it's a crime to make them, it's a crime to export them and it's a crime to import them; therefore, we do not need the crime of possession of forged banknotes.' If that is the approach that is being taken in this debate, I think we will have to have a rewrite of all our criminal legislation. I say this now because I think this is pre-empting the debate on possession, but I would expect that when we do come to that amendment there would be some more rigour involved. </para><para>In relation to penalty units et cetera and the Attorney-General's approach to these matters, I have a discussion paper titled `Model criminal code' of 1998—not all that long ago—which deals with offences against humanity. There is an offence here relating to sexual servitude. It states:</para><quote><para>A person who causes a person to enter into or remain in sexual servitude is guilty of an offence. Maximum penalty: seven years.</para></quote><para>There is no requirement for intention in this draft discussion paper circulated with the authority of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. All of a sudden we are told that intention is absolutely required if the penalty unit is above $550, yet here is an example of a crime against humanity where a seven-year prison sentence was being suggested. I do not mind sound arguments being put up, but not ones that are so easily blown out of the water. I know there is not support for strict liability, so chances are I will not speak on this again, but I would have expected that the arguments that were put up would have been treated with some greater degree of rigour and with more respect rather than their being dismissed in such a manner that, if I were so minded, I could have embarrassed those who are providing this advice by indicating that what they were saying is in fact contradicted by numerous documents circulated by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>6175</page.no><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HOGG</name><name.id>7L6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Minister Patterson, I heard your explanation on the issue that I raised. When I sat down to prepare my notes for this debate, I envisaged that there would have been a wider range of people speaking in the second reading debate on this bill to flesh out some of the more contentious issues than has actually taken place. It really seems to me that the explanation that you have given, whilst I understand where you are coming from, nonetheless leaves what I would consider to be a flaw in the bill.</para></talk.start><para>I have no intention of moving an amendment to the bill; but, if this issue is placed on the public record, then, when it is revisited somewhere down the track, as it undoubtedly will be, people will be able to look back and say that it was an issue at this point in time. Minister, I heard the advice you gave in respect of people aiding and abetting a crime, but we are dealing with probably one of the most serious issues that people are going to be confronted with—that is, the creation of a human embryo clone and its implantation into a human person. Whilst I hear your explanation, I do not think that the bill goes far enough.</para><para>Having said that, I also raised in my speech in the second reading debate the issue of the word `intentionally'. I understand that Senator Abetz is going down a different path, but it seems to me that there is an inconsistency in the bill as well—not a great inconsistency but an inconsistency—in that the word `intentionally' is used in some places but that clause 22(3) of the bill says:</para><quote><para>A person commits an offence if the person intentionally places an embryo in the body of a woman knowing that, or reckless as to whether, the embryo is a prohibited embryo.</para></quote><para>I know that the issues of recklessness and negligence were raised in the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee hearings on this matter. So why have we seen in this bill the word `intentionally' inserted in all of these various clauses yet a reference at one stage to recklessness? Why haven't recklessness and negligence been included as part of the drafting of this bill? If they have not been included, is there some reason why they have not been included? Will those who sit down later on and interpret the meaning of this bill say, `They didn't include recklessness and they didn't include negligence or other similar terms; they only sought at that stage to include the word “intentionally”'? Can the minister enlighten us as to why only `intentionally' has been included?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>6175</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Health and Ageing</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>— Some senators have asked why the bill requires that the prosecution establish that a person has intentionally done something before an offence can be established. Last year the Commonwealth introduced a Criminal Code which attempts to codify criminal laws. The code makes it clear that in relation to conduct that gives rise to an offence the prosecution must establish that the person intended to engage in the conduct that gave rise to the offence. Thus, even if the <inline ref="R1624">Prohibition of Human Cloning Bill 2002</inline> had not included the word `intentionally' in relation to the conduct leading to prohibited offences, this would have been implied by the Criminal Code. </para></talk.start><para>It was also thought prudent to include the word `intentionally' in the offences because the Commonwealth Criminal Code does not apply in the states and territories. Even if the Commonwealth did not include the word `intentionally' in the offences, the states and territories would have had to have included it in their legislation because they do not have a code that outlines the default provision. If this had occurred, Commonwealth, state and territory legislation would have looked different even though it would have had the same effect. This was not considered desirable in the interests of promoting perceptions of national consistency.</para><para>While a notion of recklessness could have been introduced into some of the offences in order to describe the circumstance of the offence rather than the conduct of the offence, this was not considered to be appropriate, because of the very high penalties that attach to the offences. In these circumstances, it is important that the prosecution bear the evidential burden in terms of establishing the guilt of a defendant.</para><para>It is very straightforward to say that it is an offence to `intentionally create a human embryo clone'. To recast the offence as `intending to create a human embryo knowing or reckless as to whether the embryo is a human embryo clone' would be to complicate the offence. It is also somewhat unnecessary in this example because the technology and procedure required to clone a person mean that it is very unlikely that a person would commit the offence without having the requisite intention. Knowledge and recklessness have been included in clause 22 on the basis that it is easier to separate the different elements. It is one thing to engage in the conduct of importing an embryo and it is another as to whether the person knew the embryo was prohibited. The same cannot be said in relation to all of the other offences.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>6176</page.no><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HOGG</name><name.id>7L6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Minister, whilst that is implied, and I understand the explanation that you have given—it would seem to me that it really is superfluous in terms of the Commonwealth's considerations—am I correctly understanding you to be saying that that needs to be mirrored in the complementary legislation of the various states?</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>6176</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Health and Ageing</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>— We are attempting to achieve as much national consistency is possible.

There are inconsistencies coming out in the approach. You run one argument to knock something down and you then run exactly the same argument to try to support something which is being opposed.

If the word `intentionally' were not in there, would it breach any agreement that exists between the states and the Commonwealth with regard to the form the legislation must take? Would it cut across states prosecuting law in relation to their arrangements? As I understand it, they are different in many cases.

I am sure some very smart lawyers, barristers or QCs will look at this and think, `How do we determine “intentionally”?' I am not a legal practitioner, but I have found that in some of the cases that I have read the excuses that have been used to avoid or get people off a conviction have been very spurious, to my mind. I am loath to put anything in law that would offer an opportunity for that to occur. I am just curious if the word `intentionally' is being put in there to assist the states.

We discussed this issue in our party room this morning—as we do all issues— and my colleagues can vote as they please on this. However, on the issue of the strict liability provisions, which we have discussed as a group, you will find that the seven Democrat senators share this opinion—and this is the one that I offer on their behalf; it is not a personal opinion. As you would know from our legislative record in this chamber, the Democrats are often wary of strict liability in relation to legislation. In this place you have seen that record; you have seen us debate these issues.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We recognise the intent—bad pun!—of Senator Abetz's amendments. You would recognise that we share the abhorrence of the notion of human reproductive cloning, but we think that it quite a strong and perhaps inappropriate move to remove that terminology in the case of this legislation. We believe it has a legal impact; otherwise I do not think that Senator Abetz would put it forward. But it is a significant one that we are quite wary of. For the benefit of the chamber, I ask if Senator Abetz has perhaps a legal precedent to which he would like to refer—for example, there are laws where strict liability is in place—which might be of interest to other senators.</para><para>I make this contribution so that people know where we stand. It was not to provoke debate. I am sorry that Senator Harradine does not accept the fact that all the Democrats are entering into this debate in good faith. You will notice that my colleagues are going to join me in this chamber to hear the arguments, and people are free to vote as they choose. My work and my particular views on this issue are well documented and well known. I do not expect anyone to follow me blindly, in that sense. It may come as a surprise to some other individual members in this place that the Democrats actually debate the issues of biotechnology quite regularly in the party room, and we have done so for seven years. That is why you have seen amendments put forward not only in my name but in the names of Senators Ridgeway and Murray: look at the second reading amendment that was passed last night.</para><para>Let us not get distracted in this debate with personal or party political attacks, because this is one time when that kind of debate is needless. If people cannot rely on their own arguments, I feel sorry for them. In this case, however—as you know, Senator Abetz—last night I was quite happy to ask for time to contemplate your amendments. We did that. We discussed them as a group. We looked at other precedents, and, as I said, we have concluded that on this occasion we will not support the strict liability provisions that you have proposed. And, given Senator Evans's comments, that also relates to the possession amendment—obviously we want to be conscious of the amendments before us. I recognise what you are trying to achieve; and, if there is a case that we are aware of under this legislation where there are problems, then clearly this has to be part of the review. I look forward to seeing how this legislation operates with the current provisions in place. I am happy for you to add anything else that you think might sway us or anyone else in the chamber in relation to these amendments. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>6180</page.no><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator ABETZ</name><name.id>N26</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I do not think the powers of oratory of anybody would necessarily sway the Democrats in relation to this particular amendment, seeing that they have made up their minds and that has been broadcast, but I would not wish to have any senator think that the national criminal code does not provide for strict liability offences. In fact, in section 6 there is a whole regime dealing with strict liability offences—what that actually means—and in section 9 it continues to tell us about mistakes, ignorance et cetera also being part of a defence regime even if it is a strict liability offence. So the fact that it is strict liability does not mean that you do not have any defences available to you. What it does mean is that the burden that is placed on the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt the intention in relation to these offences is, I have to say to you, virtually impossible. As a result, whilst huge imprisonment terms make it sound tough and rigorous, the simple fact is that the prosecution will never, in my opinion, be able to prove intention unless the person who is being investigated voluntarily acknowledges and admits that it was his or her intention to do the particular act that is being prohibited.</para></talk.start><para>I happen to think that the people we are dealing with in this situation will be relatively intelligent people—in fact, highly intelligent people—and they will know their rights. They will exercise their right to remain silent—as a result of which this whole regime, quite frankly, is worthless: how the Crown could prove intention when all that they have is silence from the person being investigated is beyond me. I have a funny feeling that some of the drafters of all this know that and there is support at the end of the day by some for human cloning. We had a bit of a discussion last night about whether products of human cloning ought to be allowed in. Whilst that is still out with the umpire, there does seem to me to be a bit of a tendency, as it is now coming forward with the discussions on the bill, that this so-called rigorous regime will not be as rigorous as we were told.

For any regime to work, you have to try to cover as many loopholes as possible. It seemed to me, reading the <inline ref="R1624">Prohibition of Human Cloning Bill 2002</inline>, that there was a glaring loophole in not making possession an offence. Once again, we are told that we are against human cloning and other unacceptable practices. We even legislate what prohibited embryos are—it is in the act. We allegedly all agreed that they should be prohibited and that they are the result of unacceptable practices. But it seems that being in possession of them somehow should not be treated as an offence. </para><para>We have already had the preliminary argument put to us that, because creating the embryo or importing or exporting the prohibited embryos was already an offence, that of itself was enough not to require possession of them to be criminalised. Why do we have possession of narcotics as a separate crime? There is a crime against making them, there is a crime against importing and exporting them, and there is also a crime against possession. Why do we have that in the law? I can similarly ask, as I did before in relation to the excise laws: why is the mere possession without permission or having custody or control of tobacco seed, tobacco plant or tobacco leaf an offence?</para><para>Our legislation is absolutely littered with offences of possession. Under section 223B(1) of the Customs Act, we are told that any person who, without any reasonable excuse, has in his possession, on board any ship or aircraft, any prohibited imports to which this section applies shall be guilty of an offence—another example of possession. I trust I do not have to go through any more to make the point that possession in relation to prohibited items has been criminalised and outlawed in a whole range of areas.</para><para>If we are concerned about state legislation, can I indicate that mere possession is an offence in relation to drug laws, in the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 of New South Wales, the Misuse of Drugs Act of the Northern Territory and the Misuse of Drugs Act of Western Australia. Laws that allow courts to presume possession from proof of occupation or ownership of premises where drugs are found or from other evidence suggesting that the accused might have been in possession of drugs seized by police are not uncommon in Australian law. In relation to that, you can go to the Victorian Drugs, Poisons and Controlled Substances Act, the Poisons Act in my home state of Tasmania or the Misuse of Drugs Act in the Northern Territory. There are a host of examples in our laws indicating that possession ought to be a crime. I have just been provided a note, I am not sure from whom, that indicates that you are not allowed to make, import, export or be in possession of certain firearms. For heaven's sake, we have it for firearms, drugs and tobacco seed. If it is important enough for tobacco seed, what about human embryo clones that we allegedly are all agreed should not be allowed to be created, imported or exported? </para><para>The scenario could very easily arise where—I will once again malign that poor mad professor that I have been using as an example in this debate—a mad professor creates a human clone and then passes it on to a laboratory technician for safekeeping in the deep freeze. In that case, where is the offence? The laboratory technician has a right to remain silent. If he is discovered in possession of the clone, he does not have to say anything. That is his right by law, as it should be, but he himself has not committed an offence. So we have a human clone without anybody being charged. It seems to me that, if we are genuinely serious about abolishing human cloning, we should close this quite substantial loophole in the legislation.</para><para>The suggestion has been made to me that the penalty that would apply for possession is somewhat harsh. If that stands in the way of any honourable senator—and I am not trying to embarrass anybody by saying this, Senator Stott Despoja; I know we are having discussions, and they are acceptable—if the concern is that the penalty regime that applies to the possession is too harsh, I am willing to look at a lower penalty provision so that the term of imprisonment might be lowered. As I understand it, in the drafting the penalty provision was the lowest in the regime of the bill but, if honourable senators believe that mere possession should not be treated quite as harshly, then I am happy to countenance any discussion on lowering that. The penalty provision was chosen on the basis of a degree of consistency with the legislation, but I would be happy to look at any other suggestions in relation to the penalty that might appropriately apply to this new provision, which I recommend to the chamber most seriously. I look forward to support from senators on all sides for what I think is a very important requirement to make this regime as tough as we have been led to believe is wanted. Also, it will make a very firm statement by this place that we are genuinely tough when it comes to the issue of human cloning. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>6182</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Health and Ageing</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will not be advocating the support of the inclusion of an additional offence relating to a person possessing or having custody of a prohibited embryo. As I mentioned before, COAG decided to target the more serious high-level offences such as creating or implanting prohibited embryos. The significant penalties attaching to these offences indicate that the Australian community views these sorts of crimes extremely seriously. If it is an offence to create and develop certain types of embryo and it is also an offence to implant, import and export those embryos, then it is unlikely that people will ever be in possession of these embryos. That is where this differs from the situation regarding cigarettes and firearms and all the other things that were mentioned. </para></talk.start><para>The aim of the bill is to deter those people who have the greater capacity to commit the offence, namely scientists and others with the technological knowledge to create prohibited embryos. It was not considered appropriate or necessary, for example, to create a separate offence to punish a woman in whom a cloned embryo was implanted. But I note—and I have said this before—that the Criminal Code extends criminal responsibility to other forms of actions such as aiding, abetting, procuring the commission of an offence and conspiracy, and persons engaging in this sort of activity may be found guilty of the offence itself. These provisions should go some way towards satisfying members of this chamber that people who deliberately participate in the commission of such an offence will still be the subject of criminal sanctions. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>6182</page.no><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator ABETZ</name><name.id>N26</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I fully accept that COAG decided to target the more serious offences and on that I congratulate them.

The simple fact is that this bill is different. We are dealing with a conscience vote on this and I think it is quite appropriate for honourable senators to raise questions, because as time goes by more questions do arise. I regret that, because of other duties et cetera, I was not able to participate in the committee and I was not able to give this bill the sort of attention that I would have liked to up until the middle of last week.

I think it is an important point because it generally raises the issue of the role of COAG. In this debate, that provides us with some strengths and weaknesses. The strength of the legislation is that it represents a view arrived at by the states and territories for a uniform response. It brings in national uniform legislation dealing with these matters arrived at in a cooperative manner. That is a very rare thing these days in Commonwealth-state relations, whoever is in power. That is one of the great strengths of the legislation. One of the weaknesses that Senator Harradine has pointed to is the fact that the chamber is now responding to a process that it was not intricately involved with and does not have the full information about. That is a fair point. I think it has affected all senators in wanting to understand what the thinking was. As I say, I think we have to balance the strengths and weaknesses in the argument. While it creates some frustrations, it is also one of the really strong suits of the bill. </para></talk.start><para>In making a couple of comments on Senator Abetz's amendment, I indicate to those who are listening that we are in furious agreement on this bill. For those who might have got the wrong impression, there is no opposition to the second reading and I suspect there will not be any to the third reading of this bill to ban human cloning. While Senator Abetz in particular has a rhetorical flourish on some of his amendments, it is important to point out that, in effect, we are arguing about nuances in a bill that has wide support in the chamber.</para><para>Senator Abetz's amendment comes down to the issue of whether we ought to create the additional offence of custody or control over a prohibited embryo. I have listened to the arguments and I am not convinced that we need to create that separate offence. It seems to me that the legislation properly targets the more serious offences and that other aspects of the Criminal Code allow for us to prosecute, if required, a woman who might be in control or custody of a prohibited embryo through those provisions. I am not sure that we need to create the additional offence. I understand the point Senator Abetz is making. It is a concern all of us have.</para><para>As I say, this is a question about whether you think his amendment is necessary within the framework of the bill or whether the other provisions appropriately cater for it. It seems to me the bill does target the more serious provisions. It does make it unlikely that we would have to deal with that, but it is certainly not impossible. I am not for a minute suggesting that that may not be an issue that the legislation has to deal with, but the advice I have received is that the other provisions of the bill and the Criminal Code more generally relating to aiding and abetting, conspiracy et cetera provide for successful protection against that offence. Therefore, the amendment is not necessary. Formally, on behalf of the Australian Labor Party, I indicate that we will not be supporting the amendment.

Senator Patterson understands that it is very difficult for senators on many occasions—I think she would be the first to admit that—to do so. Because we have so many committees and there are so many things being dealt with, it is often impossible. Also, it is often impossible for senators to actually write questions. Indeed, I wrote many questions directly to Biotechnology Australia seeking answers in respect of many matters and I found it very difficult to get answers. When I got answers, sometimes the answers were wrong.</para></talk.start><para>With regard to what Senator Abetz is proposing in terms of creating a separate offence of possession, listening to what has been said and looking at the bill itself, I think it is probably unnecessary to create an additional offence of possession because of all the other offences that exist within the bill. It is not difficult to see that if it is an offence to create, if it is an offence to place or if it is an offence to import or export, somehow you would have to be in possession to be committing those offences anyway. I understand the logic of suggesting an amendment to create an offence of possession, but I feel that maybe it is covered. I would not be opposed to the additional provision, but I think that it is probably sufficiently covered. It will be a matter of time to see whether that is proven to be the case, but I think at this point in time the bill has a sufficient capacity to cover the issue of possession.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>6184</page.no><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator ABETZ</name><name.id>N26</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Firstly, I would be very interested to know when the letters were received from Premier Bracks, Premier Carr and Premier Beattie in which it was urged that the legislation be passed without amendment.

If those letters were received prior to the House of Representatives dividing the bill, that was an amendment to the then legislation, and I note the Prime Minister voted for the separation of the bills.

If three people in COAG wrote, I would assume, quite some months ago saying, `Pass this legislation without amendment,' and if that is now the rationale for denying good commonsense amendments to get through, then it would be a matter of great concern, because, quite frankly, we should not be debating any amendments at all in that case; it ought to be a case of take it or leave it as a whole, as the bill has been presented.

I would doubt that the letter could or should be interpreted as being so intransigent that, no matter what the overwhelming evidence might be, they do not want to know about it and they want to pass it as it is. That would be, for us, legislatively irresponsible.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In relation to the suggestions made that this legislation has sufficient clauses in it not to require possession and that other laws like aiding and abetting would also come into play, I would like to hear from those who actually believe that to be the case. Why on earth do we have offences of possession littered throughout a whole lot of legislation? It would be just as easy to argue that possession of a firearm does not need to be an offence, because, to get a firearm, you would have to have made it somewhere or bought it somewhere. By taking it off the maker or by receiving it from the maker or vendor, you are aiding and abetting the manufacture or sale of the firearm and therefore mere possession does not have to be a crime. That is the rationale. But nobody in this debate has knocked that down in relation to the suite of legislation that I have previously referred to.</para><para>It has been in the minds of legislators for decades now—if not centuries, indeed. It is like possession of stolen property. Mere possession of stolen property is also an offence. Why have the courts, the prosecutors and the legislators not said, `By receiving stolen property you are aiding and abetting stealing, therefore we do not need the crime of possession of stolen property'? It does not make sense. What is being asserted—that this regime covers it—is not logical, because if it were the case, as has been asserted, that you could overcome this or that possession is not needed, then why is it in all of the other pieces of legislation? Until that is answered, it seems to me that the response is a particularly soft one and that people are simply saying, `We do not want to make any changes, because our position was set in concrete months before the Senate even decided to look at this legislation.' Coming back to the very first point, I would be interested to know when those letters were received and the dates of those letters.</para><para>Question negatived.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Collins, Jacinta (The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN)</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Jacinta Collins)</inline>—Where does the committee wish to proceed to now?

Clause 22 of the bill has as its heading: `Offence—importing, exporting or placing a prohibited embryo'. I am proposing to omit that particular heading and just have: `Offence—importing or exporting a prohibited embryo'. The essence of what I am proposing is to delete also 22(3), which provides that:</para><quote><para>A person commits an offence if the person intentionally places an embryo in the body of a woman knowing that, or reckless as to whether, the embryo is a prohibited embryo.</para></quote><para>Again in the spirit of wanting to make sure that this bill covers all situations in accordance with what was desired, I believe that the clause as it now stands could have unintended consequences in penalising those who may become involved in placing embryos in women through possible embryo adoption programs in the future—for example, a doctor with certain ethical views who may feel obliged to try to save an embryo grown to 14 days by placing it, at the request of the woman, in the body of a woman who wishes to adopt that embryo. Bear in mind that, in clause 22(4) on the meaning of `prohibited embryo', only line (a) involves the cloning procedure. I draw the attention of honourable senators to page 11 of the bill, which defines what are prohibited embryos. I do not believe that either the woman or the practitioner should be punished if the woman wishes to adopt such an embryo. As the minister has been saying, the problem is the issue of creating the embryo in the first place. But you have also got this other situation that I am describing, which I think is important. Where the embryo has been created, even with the wrong intention, the placing of that embryo on the basis of adoption into the body of a woman who so requests that adoption should not mean 10 years imprisonment.</para><para>A doctor could inherit—and I use that word because I cannot think of another at the moment—a stockpile of embryos in a medical practice which includes IVF. He or she would then have to ascertain whether there were any prohibited embryos. Some may be discovered, including embryos grown to two weeks. The woman may wish to receive them and the doctor may wish to place them in the body of the woman. The person who does the placing may have had nothing to do with the creation of the embryo in the first place. The person who has taken over the practice may not want to treat the embryo created with the wrong intention differently to embryos created to achieve a pregnancy. Unless this amendment is carried, we may have inadvertently created an incentive to destroy the embryo. As the minister has mentioned, the real offence is the creation of the prohibited embryo. But, if the embryo has been created, it ought not to be a legal offence for a woman to want to rescue the embryo, even if many of us, for a variety of reasons, would have moral concerns about that event. It ought not to be a legal offence to try to save the life of an embryo. </para><para>I do apologise to the minister that this matter has been brought to my attention late in the piece. The minister has pointed out that the creation is the real offence but, once that has occurred, to then, in effect, penalise persons who want to save that embryo's life by adopting it would not have been in the minds of COAG to agree to. Again, Minister, I apologise to you for being in this position, but the whole debate folded last night and we have found ourselves in this situation.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>6187</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to ask Senator Harradine a question to be clear that I followed this correctly.

From my bush lawyer, bush medical ethics point of view, I can see the argument that if an embryo were to be created illegally through cloning, you would have a potential human life—that is what you are arguing—and that a person may wish to rescue that embryo by having it implanted. I believe that is the import of what you are saying. My concern is, and another argument could be, that by supporting your amendment there will be an unintended consequence—and this is most probably as extreme as the concept you are putting—of an incentive in the future for someone who is unable to have a child and is prepared to wear the penalty to knowingly be involved in, or encourage the production of, cloning an embryo because they are able to have it implanted. I hope you can get the drift of what I am trying to say.</para></talk.start><para>There we are in the horns of a moral dilemma by taking that clause out. That is only my bush lawyer interpretation; I have not talked to the advisers in the box. But that is my interpretation of what could happen, particularly if someone is driven to have their own genetic material implanted. Who of us would have thought that some of these things were possible? But an adult cell could be taken from a person and cloned. They could be keener to have their own genetic material implanted and give birth to that, and be prepared to wear the consequences, than they could be to be a host to someone else's genetic material. So there could be an unintended consequence of opening that up, with people prepared to wear the consequences of the penalty to have their own genetic material. If that embryo cannot be implanted, that takes away that remote but possible incentive.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>6187</page.no><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</name><name.id>GB6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Patterson is correct, and I think that is quite implicit in what Senator Harradine said about this amendment. The impact of removing this potential penalty does create a moral dilemma. It is obvious that this penalty is designed to deal with the cloning aspect of prohibited embryos but, as Senator Harradine points out, it is not actually a potential dilemma. In a sense, it is a real dilemma, because we know there are cases of embryo-rescue adoptions occurring internationally. We are talking about a real dilemma in the sense that we know that this is occurring internationally and that there are couples who become aware of what we would regard under this bill as prohibited embryos—for example, an embryo that has been developed in the laboratory beyond the 14 days. On the issue Senator Harradine is running, I think if we had more time we could probably deal with it more carefully and differentiate between the cloning example and the other prohibited embryos. But, the way the bill is drafted at the moment, we have quite a number of prohibited embryos, not just the cloned ones that Senator Patterson is raising a legitimate concern about. In one sense Senator Harradine is saying, `Yes, perhaps on this occasion we should weaken the penalty because it has unintended consequences for the other types of embryos that are covered by this bill.' </para></talk.start><para>I support the view that the real way to capture the behaviour is through the issue of the creation so that, even in the case that Senator Patterson mentions of someone attempting implantation, there is the earlier step of the creation of the embryo that can be captured for penalty. But in a case where an embryo has been created for whatever purpose—and we know this has occurred internationally—if there is a couple who wishes to maintain that embryo and bring it to the world, then surely those circumstances should not mean that they are penalised, and that is what does currently occur. I think Senator Harradine is saying that he is prepared to bear the weaker penalty that was designed to try to pick up the potential future cloning instances, because they could still be captured by the creation penalties. I think we all understand that that slightly stronger penalty is going to be removed in relation to what might potentially occur with cloning, but I am prepared to wear it on the basis that we know that this behaviour is occurring internationally and we would not want to ban it here.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>6188</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Health and Ageing</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>— The embryos about which we are talking, other than cloned embryos, are hybrids and chimaeras in the bill.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>GB6</name.id><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator Jacinta Collins</name></talker><para>—No.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>LI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name></talker><para>—I am having to do this on the run as Senator Harradine said that it has just been brought to his attention—and I think I know where Senator Harradine is coming from: if he had his druthers he most probably would not support IVF and the production of excessive embryos for IVF.

In this case my view is that if an embryo is created illegally from cloning— and I am weighing this up for myself; other senators will have to make their own decision because this is a conscience vote—the unintended consequence of enabling a person to wear the consequences of creating a clone in order to have it implanted is greater than having them create it and letting it die. That is a decision people will have to make.

Clause 13 talks about `creating a human embryo other than by fertilisation, or developing such an embryo', and in clause 16 we are talking about `developing a human embryo outside the body of a woman for more than 14 days'. So if the developmental process has been allowed to go to day 15, the implantation of that embryo is ruled out by this provision, because of the nature of this penalty. While science might say to us at the moment that day 14 or 15 is the stage at which an embryo will not survive if it is unattached, I think all of us here understand that this could quite easily change in the future so that, with developments in culture medium and other areas, later attachment will be possible in relation to IVF embryos.</para></talk.start><para>There is the hybrid example that Senator Patterson referred to and there is clause 14, which says `creating a human embryo for a purpose other than achieving pregnancy in a woman'. The point here is that, regardless of the purpose for which the embryo was created, and I am sure that strong penalties should be associated with inappropriate purposes, if beyond that purpose the embryo exists and implantation relates other than to I think the abhorrence any of us would attach to the cloning or even potentially the hybrid type example, and within this list of other prohibited practices there are quite a number—and as I said there are examples internationally of where these types of embryo adoption schemes are operating—it would be most unfortunate if the way in which this provision is currently phrased excluded those possibilities.</para><para>Senator Harradine has said that, essentially, he is prepared to wear a weakening of the penalty for the one example of all of these prohibited practices that Senator Patterson has talked about, which is the cloning. I think Senator Patterson is right: we in this chamber will ultimately have to make our own ethical judgments on that issue. But I think senators should have very clear in their minds that there are quite a number of prohibited practices we are dealing with here; it is not just cloning that this issue pertains to. It pertains to an embryo that, for quite legitimate purposes, may have been developed in IVF and because of a simple administrative error might have gone beyond 14 days. If a couple want to have that embryo implanted, they could fall foul of this penalty. </para><para>Question negatived.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">McLucas, Jan (The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN)</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator McLucas)</inline>—We now move to Senator Harradine's amendment (R6) on sheet 2697 revised.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>6189</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I propose to include an offence provision under a new clause 22A, after clause 22, which is on page 4—and I invite honourable senators to look at page 4.

It does intend to impose a penalty for the export or import of embryos. That is an important matter which has been referred to previously. Frankly, I do not believe that it was the intention of the COAG to allow for the export of embryos from Australia or the import of embryos to Australia, for example, from Singapore. I was proposing to put a blanket ban on that practice when it occurred to me that a woman who has frozen embryos here might want to live overseas, for example. Under those circumstances, clearly, she ought to be able to export those human embryos—and, vice versa, involving a woman coming from another country to Australia. In addition to that, there may be the situation of somebody who wants to adopt.

Our money was used by the NHMRC, and so they are not a disinterested party. The licence would be issued by an NHMRC principal committee. With an organisation which has a pro-experimentation objective, anything could happen. I am asking why we should not do the same with the importation of human embryos as is proposed by the Prime Minister with the exportation of human embryos.

That was put to the NHMRC in the committee hearings, and reluctantly the NHMRC agreed with me that there is absolutely no control over what happens to human embryonic stem cells and that they could be sold to the highest bidder overseas. That is to say, an Australian human embryo has been killed— the stem cells have been taken from that human embryo and that has destroyed the embryo—and those embryonic stem cells can then be sold to the highest bidder, whether the highest bidder be in Australia or overseas. We will come to the matter of the highest bidder at some later stage and, frankly, if we are going to have a strict regulatory regime, to the need to do something about that, if we are talking about the commercialism of this—which is what it is all about.

Let me say—and I said last night that I did not want to use the euphemism `succumb'—that human embryos are killed when they are excess embryos, and so those embryos would have been killed whatever. We do not want to use euphemisms like `succumb'—I said `die'— but defreezing them kills them. These embryos would have died—would have been killed—anyway. I am just making that point.</para></talk.start><para>I will be opposing any amendments which seek to ban the offering or receiving of valuable consideration for human embryonic stem cells or any other product derived from the human embryo. The effect of the proposed amendments is quite far-reaching. I believe it goes well beyond the COAG decision and also acts as a serious disincentive for research in Australia—something which is contrary to the <inline ref="R1625">Research Involving Embryos Bill 2002</inline>. I understand that some people in this chamber are totally opposed to embryonic stem cell research—and that is the difficulty in having this debate, because people are coming from a totally different premise. The proposed amendments would ban the receipt of any valuable consideration for the offering or receipt of embryonic stem cell lines and any products of embryonic stem cell lines. This means that not only can money not be exchanged but no inducement of any kind can be offered in relation to stem cell lines.</para><para>It is inconsistent with current international practice, whereby researchers who have embryonic stem cell lines are making those lines available to others for valuable consideration. For example, I am aware of an Australian company that have an agreement with the Public Health Service of the US government to make embryonic stem cell lines available to the Public Health Service or researchers funded by them. While the agreement does not provide for exchange of money for stem cell lines, it does provide that the Australian company can enter agreements for commercialisation of materials developed by the Public Health Service or its researchers, using ES Cell International stem cell lines on terms not less favourable than other similar commercial agreements granted by the company. As the proposed amendments ban any `valuable consideration' from being offered or received for stem cell lines, these existing arrangements with the US government would be illegal. </para><para>Another consequence of Senator Harradine's proposed amendments is that no valuable consideration could be offered for any therapies that may be derived from the use of human embryos and embryonic stem cells. One of the major issues that has been discussed during the debate on the <inline ref="R1625">Research Involving Embryos Bill 2002 </inline>is whether the use of embryonic stem cells may give rise in future to potential therapies to treat life-threatening illnesses. If we ban payment for any therapies that may be developed from stem cells, we are effectively saying that Australian patients may be denied access to any such future therapies. The legislation would prohibit payment for any therapies that were developed overseas and imported into Australia. Australians could not even buy any therapies that were developed by Australian companies.</para><para>As I mentioned, I consider that the proposed amendments have far-reaching, undesirable effects and go beyond the scope of the COAG decision, which expressly excluded the regulation of embryonic stem cells. I therefore oppose Senator Harradine's amendments (7) and (8) in relation to clause 23.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>6193</page.no><name role="metadata">Boswell, Sen Ron</name><name role="display">Senator BOSWELL</name><name.id>YE4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>NP</party><role>Leader of the National Party of Australia in the Senate and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—When this debate started, we were being offered cures for Alzheimer's disease and many other diseases.

I do not think that many people in this chamber would realise—I did not realise it until I became health minister—that we have a very limited number of people in Australia who have a very serious disease for which there is a treatment. As health minister, I am able to sign off for people to have access to this treatment. I will stand corrected as to the exact dollar amounts but, depending on how much treatment is needed, for one person it costs $457,000 and for another person it costs $214,000—that is the range. What a fantastic country we live in, that we are able to do that! I find it difficult when people come in here and emotionally say that only the rich can afford it and that the poor will not be able to. In this case, irrespective of your means, it is a treatment which is available to people. It is an example of a treatment—not from embryonic stem cell lines; let us not get it confused—which is very expensive but to which people have access because it has been shown to be clinically effective and cost-effective. So it has been through the test.</para></talk.start><para>Only the other day we approved a treatment for macular degeneration—and I cannot remember whether it was a commitment in the last election; I will not say it was— which had presented a difficulty because it did not fit with the PBS and it did not fit with the MBS. It is an inert substance which requires cold laser to activate it, and so it fell between the two. It costs about $2,000 per treatment, and for people who need the whole treatment it costs $10,000. People who need it and for whom it has been shown to be clinically efficacious have to be assessed after they have had one or two treatments. They are able to have that treatment up to $10,000. </para><para>We need to get a little perspective into this debate. I know the emotions are running high. We do have treatments that are very expensive. Gleevec, for example, has just been extended within the prescribing guidelines as put out by the PBAC. There are some initial treatments, but, as a second line of treatment for chronic myeloid leukaemia, Australians for whom it is clinically appropriate now have access to Gleevec. It costs approximately $50,000 a year. So I do not accept the argument that it will be available only to the rich, because we do have an incredible system in Australia. Hopefully, we can keep supporting it—and we will have that debate later when the other bill comes before us.

I seek clarification here from either the minister, the government, the advisers or Senator Boswell. From Senator Boswell's remarks relating to intellectual property and patents, he seemed to be suggesting that this is new ground, not in a biological or biotechnological sense but in terms of patents and pharmaceutical companies benefiting from their research and, to use the word he used, cures. I am sure that he and others of us realise that the patents law allows that, not only in this country but across the world. I am sure there are a number of people in the chamber who share the concerns to which he alluded. I did not agree with all his contributions, but I think we had better be very clear that it is not breaking new ground in enabling researchers, scientists and doctors to benefit in a commercial sense from the application of their research. I happen to have a very strong view that people should not, for example, be able to patent genes or gene sequences and that that should be outlawed, and I am glad to hear that we are having a debate about some of these issues. </para></talk.start><para>Even with my strong views, I recognise that our consideration of this legislation is not the time and place to make those changes. It might be the time to have some of these debates; I do not resile from that. Without wishing to reflect on an amendment of the Senate, that is what led us to introduce the amendment that was moved and passed in my name, on behalf of the Democrats, during the second reading debate yesterday, which allowed for broader investigation of intellectual property issues in relation specifically to stem cells and stem cell products et cetera. I think it is high time we had these debates. Through you, Chair, to Senator Boswell, the idea of the stem cell bank—and Senator McLucas and I will be moving an amendment on the applicability of that issue shortly; something that we canvassed during the committee's consideration of the bill— may be another opportunity for us to explore some of these issues.</para><para>I know this does not relate exactly to the amendment but, because it has been brought up, I want to acknowledge the importance of some of those issues. If we feel so strongly, as a group or as individuals, then let us amend the patent laws in this country. Let us stop allowing governments, including our own, to extend patent laws. It has been a very difficult and lonely road for some senators who have tried to do so. The Democrats have tried amendments to the Patents Act on many occasions—1995, 1996—and, indeed, we have a private member's bill, as I said, in relation to this specific issue. Do not allow people to own the genes and gene sequences. By all means allow them to own the processes by which they derive information about those genes, or own the applications of that information and that technology, but not the genes themselves. </para><para>I am not moving amendments to that effect in this bill, for the many reasons that have been put forward, including by Senator Patterson and others. Through you, Chair, to Senator Boswell, we are cognisant of the issues. We are looking at inquiries that will canvass these issues, because they are important, but let us not pretend that this is new ground in a patents law sense, in the sense that medicos—or, specifically, researchers and research scientists—are benefiting in some way that they have not benefited in the past. Certainly, the technology is different and is advancing at a rate of knots but, by the same token, if anyone wants to have a debate about patents law, bring it on! The Democrats have been waiting for that for many years. In the interim, look at how we can amend this legislation in a way that enables us to have a comprehensive debate and discussion about those issues, which we cannot do in this committee stage.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>6195</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I do not know where we were going to there.

These are extraordinarily important amendments, although that is not to say that all of my amendments are not necessary—of course they are. They are something that I think would be acceptable all around the chamber, because they provide for an offence which is the commercial trading in human tissue, human eggs, human sperm or human embryos. The amendments were distributed to the desk of every senator. I hope that those who are otherwise engaged in their rooms are listening to this, because it is a vital issue and I think quite a reasonable one as well. </para><para>The rationale for these amendments is as follows. The trade in human tissue is prohibited in all Australian states. The production of human cell cultures derived from human cells or cultures, especially stem cell cultures, would provide alternative ways of deriving human cells and tissues that may not be considered human tissue in state law because they were not obtained by removal from a human body. So an anomaly would arise. There is a need to ensure that the medical procedures made lawful by the act do not serve to avoid this important element of existing state law. As I understand it, all states have these particular laws regarding human tissue. </para><para>The prohibition of trade in human tissue is important. It has facilitated the existence of a relatively inexpensive, efficient and universally available blood bank and of organ transplantation services. The creation of the lawful possibility of trade in human cells and tissues, and thus a market for them, would prevent a similar development occurring in relation to human tissues and human cells derived by culturing human cells. That commercialisation would restrict access to human tissues and cells arising from cell cultures to those who could afford them.</para><para>The prohibition on trade in human tissues has been an admirable feature of Australian society. We have all experienced that and we have all benefited from it. The blood bank and organ transplantation services are part of Australia's social capital and indeed the envy of the world for their low cost, high standards, efficiency and universal availability. Trade in human tissue and body parts is felt by many to involve disrespect for the social and moral significance of human bodies. I hope that by building upon the existing legislation in the states we may be able to ensure that those items that are mentioned in the heading—`commercial trading in human tissue, human eggs, human sperm or human embryos'—are in effect dealt with in a similar fashion as they are in the states.</para><para>That is the essence of my amendments. They are not radical amendments at all. They are reasonable amendments and they deserve the support, I believe, of all honourable senators. On this important matter I hope it will not be necessary to divide. I hope that the minister will see their importance and significance and approve of the amendments. I cannot imagine that the premiers would go against the legislation and the legislative precedent and principle contained in their statutes in regard to tissues and the trade therein.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>6197</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Health and Ageing</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will be opposing the amendment proposed by Senator Harradine which establishes a new offence for offering or receiving valuable consideration for the supply of human tissue or the right to take human tissue from a person's body or from an embryo or foetus. As all senators are aware, the focus of this legislation is on prohibited embryos and prohibited practices involving embryo, sperm and egg, such as commercial trading. To extend the legislation to all human tissue is to go way beyond the scope of this legislation. That is not to say that I do not recognise, acknowledge and agree with Senator Harradine that the trade in human tissue is an important issue. It is one that is currently being dealt with through state legislation in a way that is not entirely consistent. I appreciate that this is an area that may require further consideration, but it is not really within the context of this bill. The scope of the bill is much narrower. It is focused on embryos, not on human tissue. This is a very complex issue which needs to be dealt with in a much more detailed way. I believe there is some work already being done. In some of the states there are bills on human tissue, but there is not a nationally consistent approach. It is an important issue to raise, but I do not think this is necessarily the appropriate place to do so in the form of an amendment to this bill.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>6197</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This issue being of such importance—and I hear what the minister has said—it may not be appropriate to deal with the amendment now.

I referred to this issue in my speech in the second reading debate, so I will not speak at length. I note that the same amendment will be moved to the <inline ref="R1625">Research Involving Embryos Bill 2002</inline> so that we have a level of consistency in the terms of reference that will be undertaken as one operation but are reflected in the two bills. Senator Stott Despoja and I move the amendment jointly. It is a recommendation of the report that we wrote in favour of the legislation following the committee inquiry. It follows from the small amount of evidence that was provided by only one witness who came to the hearings. We believed that the notion of the UK stem cell bank did have some merit and that is why that occurred.</para><para>This issue fits very well with the second reading amendment that Senator Stott Despoja moved which was carried by the Senate as an amendment to this bill. The issues of intellectual property and access to embryonic stem cell lines are very connected. The other part of that story is that we in Australia have not made significant decisions up to this point on what we think about intellectual property on embryonic stem cell lines and whether that will affect the access of researchers to those lines. The National Stem Cell Bank was established in the United Kingdom on 9 September 2002. We were advised by Mr Ilyine of Stem Cell Sciences at the inquiry that such an entity in Australia could in fact minimise the number of embryos that are required for use. I think all of us would agree that that is a desirable outcome. The second point he made was that a national stem cell bank, if introduced into Australia, could provide to qualified researchers free and unencumbered access to those embryonic stem cell lines. That goes to the issue of commercialisation that many people in this chamber have raised as a significant issue.</para><para>I recognise that various senators have said that the concept or the amendment as it stands does not go far enough and that the time frame is too long. I understand the desire of senators to limit the commercialisation opportunities, but I also understand the desire for and of researchers to access embryonic stem cell lines and at the same time maintain intellectual property over the work that they are doing. To those people who say that the time frame is too long, I put the following points. The UK model has been in operation for less than two months. I think it is too early at this point to carefully evaluate the effectiveness of its operation, even in the UK, and much less to say that we can transplant that model directly into Australia. The two countries have completely different IP laws and they also have different laws that manage the use of embryonic stem cells.</para><para>I believe that there might be applicability for a stem cell bank in Australia. That is why we have done this. But I think to say that we should just pick it up out of the UK and put it into Australia is a simplistic solution to what is a very complex issue. As I said before, we need to fully understand how intellectual property issues will be applied to the use of embryonic stem cell lines, because there is a relationship between that and the operation of a national stem cell bank. The bill has a mechanism for review built into it so that there will be a review of the operation of the legislation after two years. So I think it is useful to simply ask that review to extend its terms of reference to include an assessment of the applicability of the UK model in Australia.</para><para>Finally, I believe this amendment does not compromise the communique of COAG. It simply adds an extra term of reference to the review. I think it adds to rather than compromises it. I do not think COAG could be too upset with this amendment. It is a conservative measure, but I think it is a sensible solution. It starts a process of evaluation of the establishment of the UK model for a national stem cell bank in Australia. I believe it will lead us to a situation where we could have fewer embryos used, and access and IP holding by qualified researchers to embryonic stem cell lines. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>6199</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak in favour of the amendment moved in my name and that of Senator McLucas.

It was established on 9 September this year as a consequence of the UK Medical Research Council's announcement on the establishment of a national stem cell bank. As to the purpose of this bank, perhaps I should quote from the person who provided the evidence to us in the Senate committee, Mr Ilyine, the General Manager of Stem Cell Sciences, to whom Senator McLucas has already referred. When I asked him about this in the Senate committee, his comment was that it was:</para></talk.start></continue><para>... to hold all of the stem cell lines in a central point where there would be free and unencumbered access to those stem cell lines to qualified researchers.</para><para>It was suggested, among other things, that such a facility might minimise the number of embryos that would be required to create new stem cell lines. However, I think it is important for us to note that the committee was not provided with specific evidence or legal opinion on the status of the United Kingdom law in relation to this proposal. Nevertheless, on face value we believe that the idea has merits and certainly warrants further careful consideration and investigation by the persons responsible for the independent review of the act, as Senator McLucas has explained; hence the amendment to this bill as well as to the other legislation.</para><para>The purpose of this amendment is to provide an additional term of reference for the independent review of the act. Senator McLucas has explained why the time line is such as it is. It is because we recognise that, as I pointed out with the second reading amendment that was passed last night, it is more important to get it right. We have to recognise that the UK's model may not be applicable to Australia, that Australia's model may be very different from that in the UK. We may discover over the course of the early operations of the stem cell bank in the UK that there are different issues that we have to take into account.</para><para>Let us face it, the legislation that is before us—not so much the <inline ref="R1624">Prohibition of Human Cloning Bill 2002</inline> but the <inline ref="R1625">Research Involving Embryos Bill 2002</inline> that we will be debating next in the committee stage—is different law from that in many other countries in the world. We have looked at Israel and Taiwan. We have talked about the UK and the US. The UK legislation is different from this bill. It allows many other aspects and different types of research. So this may be one example where the different laws do not necessarily give rise to a stem cell bank that works in the same ways. Nonetheless, it is an important area which we should investigate.</para><para>I suppose that, strictly speaking, this amendment goes to matters relevant to the Research Involving Embryos Bill 2002. However, as the Prohibition of Human Cloning Bill 2002 and that other bill effectively share the same terms of reference, for the sake of consistency this amendment should apply to both bills. As you would know, Chair, Senator McLucas and I have circulated an amendment to the other legislation. In our supplementary report in favour of the legislation, we made a specific recommendation to the effect that this addition to the independent review should take place. I am aware that a number of senators in this chamber have indicated their support for such a proposal and that at least one senator has informed the media that he, too, wishes to move a comparable amendment. I thank those senators for their support and I hope that the government will consider this amendment favourably. </para><para>I make the point, however, that it is a little naive at this point to pluck an entity from one jurisdiction and simply appropriate it for Australia. That is not what we are intending to do; we are simply talking about investigating the applicability of this particular idea from the UK. Clearly, there are differences not only in the legislation that we are debating and potentially passing but also in Australia's IP and patent laws. In patent law, for example, the current Australian definition of `patent' is contained in schedule 1 of the Patents Act 1990 and remains essentially unchanged since the introduction of the first Australian federal patents legislation back in 1903. For the purposes of Australian law, within the meaning of the Statute of Monopolies 1623, an invention is:</para><quote><para>... any manner of new manufactures ... not contrary to the law, nor mischievous to the state by raising of the prices of commodities at home or hurt of trade, or generally inconvenient ...</para></quote><para>By contrast, the UK system introduced with the Patents Act 1977 is based on the Convention of the Grant of European Patents. It replaces the expressed definition of `invention' by reference to section 6 of the Statute of Monopolies with a list of specific exclusions from patentability. The exclusions include `a scientific theory or mathematical method', `an aesthetic creation such as a literary, dramatic or artistic work', `a scheme or method for performing a mental act, playing a game or doing business' and `the presentation of information, or a computer program'. Probably the most significant exclusion, set out in section 4(2) is:</para><quote><para>... a method of treatment of the human or animal body by surgery or therapy or of diagnosis practised on the human or animal body ...</para></quote><para>In respect of universities and patents, the UK has a statutory provision—sections 39 and 43 of the Patents Act 1977—for compensation of employees for certain inventions created in the course of employment. The Australian Patents Act 1990 has no statutory provision for compensation of employees. The UK, like several European countries, has a specialist Patents County Court. Australia has no specialist court, although there have been proposals suggesting the establishment of such a court. The point I make is that we should not assume that what is appropriate for the UK is automatically appropriate for our country. A stem cell bank is but one possible solution to the problems that we confront. However, this needs to be evaluated within the parameters of a broader consideration of these issues. There may be other solutions and, indeed, there may be other problems. That is why we believe our approach of adding an additional term of reference for the independent review to examine the applicability of the solution is the prudent and appropriate way to approach this issue.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>6200</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name><name.id>2L6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The amendment moved by Senator McLucas and Senator Stott Despoja foreshadowed some comments I was going to make later on in the discussion on the <inline ref="R1624">Prohibition of Human Cloning Bill 2002</inline> and the <inline ref="R1625">Research Involving Embryos Bill 2002</inline> in the context of seeking the deletion of this particular review provision and the insertion of a parliamentary review provision. I have listened to the discussion and read the notes that have been circulated and I am happy to indicate at the outset my support for this amendment, but I want to put a couple of points on the record.</para></talk.start><para>My memory is that the minority report signed by Senator McLucas, Senator Webber and Senator Stott Despoja made some comments about the desirability—perhaps the absolute desirability—of minimising the number of embryos that might be accessed or used for whatever purpose. Senator McLucas used that point as a justification for this amendment. It will be interesting in due course, if this review is undertaken, to see the economic analysis of supply and demand for human embryos. My preliminary view is that, if you have a public agency tasked with the job of making embryos available to those researchers who are given authority to have access to them and if the price of the embryo—the commodity, if you like—does not reflect market signals, a simple supply and demand analysis would suggest that demand would be greater than would otherwise be the case. So, if you create a public agency to regulate the disposal of or access to human embryos for particular research purposes and if market signals are not involved in the pricing, you could get the perverse result of increasing the demand—and hence the need—for access to, and availability of, embryos. That would defeat the purpose, as I understand it, of both the mover and the seconder of this amendment. I draw that to their attention and put it on the record for consideration. </para><para>The other matter I wish to draw to the attention of both the mover and the seconder is clause 25 of the bill, `Review of operation of Act.' When one reads that clause, one sees that it is extraordinarily narrow. Clause 25(1) refers to `an independent review', and Senator Stott Despoja repeatedly referred to it as such. On preliminary examination, that is a fine thing. But when you look at 25(2) to 25(6), you will note that the `independent review' is a written report only to COAG, not to other bodies or other parties. It has regard to a limited number of matters, set out in 25(4), paragraphs (a), (b) and (c)—and perhaps (d), if this amendment is carried—so there is a limited range of possible amendments. When you look at subclauses (5) and (6), you will see that the requirement is to consult with a very limited number of persons—the Commonwealth and the states, obviously, and `a broad range of persons with expertise in or experience of relevant disciplines'. That is a limited set of afficionados and experts—those who have particular knowledge in this area.</para><para>Then when you look at the final part of 25(6), the obligation on the report writers is to set out the views of those consulted in the report `to the extent that it is reasonably practicable to do so'. So there is no obligation in this independent review to seek submissions, to analyse submissions or to ask for public comment on submissions. There is no obligation in the independent review to go to a range of church, community, welfare or ethical organisations, who might have a view, a different view, an opposing view or a combination of views. In my preliminary thoughts, clause 25 in this bill and clause 47 in the latter bill provide a Clayton's type of review. The experts are going to be involved and they are going to have regard to a limited number of people and a limited number of issues—and it can be done in secret; there is no requirement to publish the transcript or seek evidence—and the report is going to be one for the afficionados. It strikes me as going to the heart of some of the problems under discussion in this whole exercise that you do not have the ability in an internal, possibly closed, review—however well minded, well intentioned or independent—to test the arguments and the submissions, to engage in debate and to challenge those who have a particular point of view.</para><para>My thoughts are that, if you are going to have an independent review, it should be fully open, fully public and anyone who has an interest in it, whether it be the most humble person up to major corporations, should be required to put their submissions in public, give public evidence, justify their position and be open to challenge and testing by those who have an interest. I foreshadow those comments, which will come later on in the debate on both the <inline ref="R1624">Prohibition of Human Cloning Bill 2002</inline> and the <inline ref="R1625">Research Involving Embryos Bill 2002</inline>, and draw them to the attention of both Senator Stott Despoja and Senator McLucas in the context of their seeking to, (1) minimise access to the number of embryos and, (2) make the act and its eventual review process more effective.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>6201</page.no><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</name><name.id>GB6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to take a brief moment to support the establishment of a stem cell bank. I would like to bring to the attention of the chamber some of the discussion that occurred at the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry into the <inline ref="R1608">Research Involving Embryos and Prohibition of Human Cloning Bill 2002</inline>. Hopefully I will track down the detail of this a bit further before we get into a more detailed discussion of this issue in the <inline ref="R1625">Research Involving Embryos Bill 2002</inline>, but we had evidence before the committee regarding the UK model. There was one component of that model that attracted me to going down this path. That was that the NHMRC guidelines from 1996 and the COAG communique both refer to the objective that we should limit the number of human embryos used in this endeavour. Whilst I oppose their use, obviously a sensible fall back position is that, if it is going to occur, we should limit it as much as possible. </para></talk.start><para>The limitation objective is missing from the <inline ref="R1624">Prohibition of Human Cloning Bill 2002</inline>, and that is one amendment I will be proposing. The British, it seems, have implemented that objective through their view about establishing a stem cell bank. The view is that if you eliminate competition as one of the factors involved in the number of human embryos that are destroyed to extract stem cells, that is one way of limiting the overall numbers that will be utilised. A public stem cell bank that makes the stem cells and the results of the research on stem cells publicly available is obviously quite a sensible means of ensuring that you are not simply duplicating work because of scientific competition. I will support what hopefully will be the strongest possible proposal for the establishment of a stem cell bank.</para><para>I will support this amendment to this bill but indicate that my position on the next bill may well be inconsistent, which may create further problems when these bills go back to the House—perhaps it can be rectified in the House of Representatives. It is obviously desirable that both bills have consistent provisions in relation to a stem cell bank. My view will be that it is something that should be done sooner rather than later. I have some concerns that this current proposal allows the elapse of too much time. Whilst I accept the concern that we do not want to simply mirror the British model, I bring to the committee's attention that what we learnt about the British model was that it was not introduced when they first introduced their legislation; it was a second phase, so to speak. The British have the public policy experience of reflecting on their legislation and designing their own stem cell bank to suit their circumstances, so I think the period of somewhere between six to 12 months is sufficient for us to be able to learn from their public policy experience and adapt that to suit our particular circumstances.</para><para>In that light, I do not think there is any problem with us requiring that there should be a stem cell bank established and chartering the NHMRC, for instance, to undertake the task of learning from the public policy experience in the UK and looking at how best to implement such a system. There can obviously be appropriate reporting mechanisms to the parliament, to give them that flexibility, but I do believe that at this stage we should be making such a requirement. I do not believe it is necessary for us now, after there have been various international experiences, to say, `No, it has to be done at a second stage.' The risk, if we go down that path, is that the horse will bolt. If we simply say, `Yes, this is something we may do in the future or in the never-never'—or it may become the never-never—the horse will bolt now. Certainly the technology has developed adequately that the horse can bolt in a number of areas in relation to commercialisation, and we may regret it if we do not seek to harness the horse at this stage rather than just say that we will analyse the situation and find a way to deal with it somewhere in the future. I am attracted to the notion that, in the debate on the next bill, where I know the Greens have proposed a version of how to deal with this issue as well, perhaps we can spend a bit more time analysing the detail of those matters and find a flexible way to require that we establish a stem cell bank at this stage of the process rather than at stage 2. I think that is probably all I need to say at this stage.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>6202</page.no><name role="metadata">Barnett, Sen Guy</name><name role="display">Senator BARNETT</name><name.id>00AUF</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I stand to indicate my support for the amendment put by Senators McLucas and Stott Despoja and also to indicate that my views are similar to those of Senators Bishop and Collins, who have just spoken, interestingly.

That will obviously be achieved at least to some degree under this review; albeit, as Senator Bishop indicated, the review is very narrowly defined. It will be an independent review, but I am not sure exactly how it will be conducted and by whom.

I noted their comments that, wherever possible, we should minimise the number of human embryos to be used. They set out their views on page 178 of the committee report. I have read those views and, as I say, I am willing to support the recommendation they made and the amendment before us. In paragraph 7.12 of their supplementary report in favour of the legislation they say:</para><quote><para>It was suggested that such a facility might minimise the number of embryos that would be required to create new stem cell lines.</para></quote><para>They both indicated in speaking today that that is a good objective, and it is certainly an objective I support. They also indicated that Mr Ilyine, who came before the committee, talked about free and unencumbered access to the stem cell bank. That poses a whole range of issues and concerns that I simply flag now, and maybe they will be dealt with during the review. They are obviously based in part on the submissions we had in relation to the UK experience. That stem cell bank was set up on 9 September this year and I certainly do not indicate my support for the regime in the UK with respect to the research and destruction of human embryos, but I think a national stem cell bank is worthy of consideration.</para><para>Another reason I support the stem cell bank is that it will provide an open and transparent process. That is what Senators McLucas and Stott Despoja are trying to achieve to some degree in having a national stem cell bank. If it does proceed, I would hope that we would have access to information such as the number of human embryos being used for research in the stem cell bank, the type of research and the types of outcomes from that research. In saying that, I foreshadow that those arguments are consistent with an amendment that I will put in relation to the <inline ref="R1625">Research Involving Embryos Bill 2002</inline> to make sure there is some accountability in the public arena for the number of human embryos, the type of research and the outcomes of that research. I hope that argument, which is consistent with support for the stem cell bank, will flow through to that amendment when it comes before the committee shortly.</para><para>I also want to indicate, as Senator Bishop did, that this is a narrowly defined review. It is not an open review in terms of a joint parliamentary committee review and I indicate my support for a joint parliamentary committee review, as indicated by Senator Bishop in an amendment that will be before the committee shortly on both this cloning bill and the human embryo bill. Why not have a public and open process where we can assess the review of the act, the operation of the act, the research conducted under the act and the number of human embryos, or so-called excess human embryos, that are being used for research purposes? I think they are laudable objectives. I put on the record my support for those objectives and for this amendment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>6203</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I briefly indicate on behalf of the Australian Labor Party that we will support the amendment.

If there were a real value and need for the establishment of a national stem cell bank, I would urge that, given that the English model is up and running, any investigation be made as quickly as possible, post the passing of this legislation, and that that matter be referred back to the Senate for further deliberation. I believe it is something which we need more evidence on; we need to know more about its operation. As far as I am concerned, if it takes two years and then another six or eight or 12 months before there is legislation and if there is a useful purpose to be served in having a national stem cell bank, the horse will have bolted. So, if this legislation is adopted—and from the debate there seem to be the numbers to carry it—I urge the government not to let any review pertaining to this matter drag on too far into the future.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>6204</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Health and Ageing</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank honourable senators for their contributions. I actually referred to this matter in my seconding reading speech. The NHMRC has been given the responsibility of reporting back to COAG by April 2003 on supply of embryos, and one of the issues surrounding supply of embryos is the embryonic stem cell bank. That process will address this issue faster than this amendment will. We are aware that the UK has established a publicly funded stem cell bank to provide to researchers unencumbered access to cell lines. Access to such a stem cell bank reduces the need to extract additional stem cell lines from embryos. As I said, the analysis of the issues on the adequacy of supply, and availability for research, of excess ART embryos will be included in the NHMRC report to COAG, and that issue will also be examined. The appropriate mechanism and how it would be progressed would best be determined once that report goes to COAG. Whether and how it will be considered by governments—for example, through the Australian Health Ministers Conference or the Council of Australian Governments—has not been determined. But once the report goes to COAG, COAG will make a decision as to whether the Australian Health Ministers Conference or the Council of Australian Governments will consider it. So it is going ahead, despite or in spite of this amendment. I believe this amendment is superfluous, because the issue is being addressed.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Collins, Jacinta (The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN)</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Jacinta Collins)</inline>—Senator Harradine, just before you commence, can I indicate that we are about four minutes away from Matters of Public Interest and that it might further the debate if we were able to conclude this amendment by that stage.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>6204</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to indicate that other matters will be included in the review and that there will be amendments to ensure that that takes place.

Many people may have noticed a difference in their local medical practice in recent times and found that their small, local surgery may have been replaced by a mulitidoctor, multiservice corporate practice.</para></talk.start><para>Over the past 20 years, there has been a trend towards corporatisation of general practice, and in the past few years it has rapidly increased. What, you may ask, is meant by corporatisation of general practice medicine? Corporatisation of general practice medicine basically involves doctors entering into agreements with companies whereby they have use of their consulting rooms and practice management services in exchange for a percentage of their incomes, usually 50 to 60 per cent. In some cases, corporatisation of general practice has gone hand in hand with vertical integration of medical services, so that the corporations also have interests in specialist and diagnostic services, including radiology, pathology and, sometimes, physiotherapy and pharmacy. All of these services are generally located in the same large medical centre.</para><para>Western Australia has been very much at the vanguard of the corporatisation of medicine, with many independent general practices being purchased by corporations. Nearly 50 per cent of general practitioners in Western Australia are involved in corporate medicine. Other states have not experienced such a rapid rate of corporatisation. GP medical practices have been aggressively targeted by these corporations, and doctors have been offered large sums of money to sell their practices to them. I have heard of offers of more than $1 million being made to some general practitioners, and in other cases combinations of cash and equity have been offered.</para><para>Major companies involved in corporate medicine include Foundation Healthcare, Endeavour Healthcare, Primary Healthcare, Gribbles, and Mayne Health. An April 2001 article in <inline font-style="italic">Australian Doctor</inline> cited estimates that around 2,500 GPs—about 10 per cent of the total number of general practitioners in Australia—have been contracted to one of the five large medical companies. Also, a newspaper article in March of that same year referred to a prediction that up to 50 per cent of GPs will work in a corporate medical practice within the next three to five years. However, this prediction now looks unlikely to be fulfilled, for several reasons. Medical company earnings have generally not met expectations, share prices have fallen and amendments to the Privacy Act now require a patient's consent for the transfer of medical records—all putting a break on further acquisition of general practices by corporations. Some writers, such as Paul Fitzgerald, writing in the <inline font-style="italic">Medical Journal of Australia</inline> in July 2002, believe:</para><quote><para>Although corporations have a large share of the Perth market ... it is unlikely they will achieve more than 20% of other metropolitan markets, such as Sydney or Melbourne.</para></quote><para>Corporate medical practices have been lauded as having benefits for consumers and doctors alike. For doctors, it is said that they can concentrate on what they do best—that is, practising medicine. For patients, corporate practices are being promoted as being customer friendly, offering good customer service. Because they employ a large number of doctors, corporate practices, unlike the traditional family doctor or sole general practitioner, are able to operate seven days a week and for extended hours. Corporations are building new large medical centres which offer the most up-to-date facilities. Patients are thus saved the inconvenience of having to travel elsewhere for specialist and diagnostic services, because they are all offered under the same roof.</para><para>For all of this, the advent of corporate medicine has been greeted with suspicion and even outright hostility in some quarters. The Australian Medical Association has expressed reservations about corporate medicine, in its scoping paper on general practice corporatisation. The most prominent concern is the vertically integrated nature of corporate medical practices. Corporations impose a third party on the doctor-patient relationship and there is a fear that GPs will be pressured by the management of these corporations to refer patients to the corporations' own in-house services, thereby eroding patient choice and the doctor's own clinical autonomy.</para><para>General practice in and of itself is not overly profitable. In 1999-2000, the average Medicare payment to general practitioners, including those working part-time, was approximately $110,000, out of which gross income the GP has to meet the expenses of running his practice. A bulk-billing general practitioner wanting to generate an after-expense but pre-tax income of $130,000 needs, it has been estimated, to conduct 37 standard consultations a day, five days a week, 48 weeks of the year. By way of contrast, the average Medicare payment to radiologists was $650,000 per annum, and the average to pathologists was more than $600,000.</para><para>This raises the question of why corporations have been willing to pay relatively large sums of money for general practices. The answer perhaps lies in the general practitioners' role as gatekeepers to the health care system, in that it is they who prescribe the medications, order diagnostic tests and refer patients to specialists. As Dr Paul Fitzgerald, who contributed to the AMA's position paper on the corporatisation of general practice, said on Radio National:</para><quote><para>You don't buy general practices because general practices are good business, you buy general practices because you want to buy their referrals.</para></quote><para>Beth Quinlivan, in an article on corporate medicine, cites the KPMG report entitled `Corporatisation of general practice' when she says:</para><quote><para>... for every dollar of Medicare income paid to a general practitioner, $1.60 is paid by Medicare for a specialist service. If a doctor's referrals can be controlled—or directed—a large slice of that specialist market can be tied in. If a medical centre has, for example, 10 full-time general practitioners, each generating $200,000 of Medicare income a year, they are also generating on average $3.2 million a year in downstream specialist billings. If a substantial part of that is picked up by businesses or specialists who work in the same corporate group, it is a good income stream.</para></quote><para>Obviously this may raise concerns about the independence of GPs in corporate medical centres. In its scoping paper, the AMA has said that GPs in some corporate medical centres have complained of pressure to turn patients over rapidly, loss of personal relationships with patients, and professional compromises to meet the requirements of the owners. Associated with this are concerns that doctors in corporate practices will come under pressure from management to overservice. However, on Radio National in August last year the then Minister for Health and Aged Care, Dr Michael Wooldridge, said that there was no evidence that corporatisation of general practice had resulted in overservicing and that, if the government did get information that this was leading to a blow-out of costs in medicine, it would act very quickly.</para><para>As is well known, all medical practitioners are under constant computer surveillance of their practice modus operandi, referral and prescribing patterns, so any variation is quickly noted. However, the other side of the coin is that many GPs working in corporate practices report that consultation times are often longer—15 minutes instead of 10 minutes or less—so that they practice better medicine and also enjoy being free of the responsibilities for the business management and administration of medical practices.  </para><para>Mr Ed Bateman of Primary Healthcare has said that most of the general practitioners there run their own practice and the people who come to see them come to see their family doctor. He said that doctors have accepted corporatisation because of economic forces, stating that for more than 20 years there has been a `cost squeeze on general practitioners'. Initially, he said, they worked harder, but they get to the point where they have to look at alternatives. The alternative many have chosen is to be involved in a corporate medical practice. Doctors also report enjoying access to the more technologically sophisticated equipment which the big medical practices usually provide, and they enjoy having ancillary staff available such as treatment room nurses, which a solo GP usually cannot afford. A further matter of longer term concern over the corporatisation of medicine is that it will provide an impetus towards managed care as per the American model, whereby referral and treatment decisions are made by protocol and the management choices of doctors are thereby circumscribed.</para><para>Corporate medicine appears now to be well established. But there is a series of questions I think which we as a community need to ask ourselves about corporate medicine and about whether it is in the best interests of the community as a whole. Firstly, is it in the public interest that general practices be vertically integrated with specialist and diagnostic services? If it is, should there be a requirement that GPs must disclose the company's interests as well as any personal interest that they may have in the service when seeking to refer a patient so that the patient can make an informed choice? Has vertical integration resulted in higher use of specialist and diagnostic services or will it in the future? Other questions are whether professional bodies and universities should pay a greater role in educating doctors about their ethical duties and whether uniform legislation should be introduced in all states and territories to seek to guarantee clinical autonomy of medical practitioners. These are just some of the issues which might eventually have to be addressed and resolved.</para><para>In conclusion, overall the format of general practice medicine appears to have changed and, just as 30 years ago corner stores and small owner-operated stores gave way to supermarkets and shopping malls, so now the same has happened in general practice medicine. There is a large well-appointed multi-doctor corporate medical centre to be found in many a suburb around this country where a small local independent solo practitioner's rooms have been replaced.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Drought</title><page.no>6207</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>6207</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Today I will address the matter of drought for the fourth time this week in the Senate. Properly responding to Australia's growing drought crisis has been a priority for Labor for many months. Regrettably, the same cannot be said about the Howard government's commitment to addressing this issue. After months of doing little more than attacking the states for their drought assistance measures—but doing nothing itself— we are now seeing a flurry of activity from the government.</para></talk.start><para>Yesterday, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry attacked the Queensland government for the level of assistance it was providing farmers in the Peak Downs area—farmers who are clearly suffering from the consequences of severe drought. This attack was galling, even by Mr Truss's standards, because it was the minister himself who was sitting on his hands in respect of the Peak Downs exceptional circumstances application. That application was lodged on 28 October, but incomplete interim assistance measures were not announced until today—a clear indication that the application has merit but an even clearer indication that the minister is not giving drought assistance the attention it deserves.</para><para>The fact is that the prima facie merit of the application should have been assessed within seven days of its lodgment. Clearly, the Prime Minister has now had enough of Mr Truss's bungling and has directed him to act. It is a shame that the Prime Minister did not take a direct interest in the drought earlier. I ask the Prime Minister to require Minister Truss to look again at the current Queensland exceptional circumstances application and to grant comprehensive interim relief. Until now, the Prime Minister has allowed Mr Truss to direct his energy to battling the states rather than dealing with what is emerging as the worst drought in 100 years. </para><para>I note the Prime Minister's comments to the National Farmers Federation last night that he wants to end Commonwealth-state bickering over drought assistance. But while he was acting like a statesman at the National Farmers Federation, his minister was issuing a statement attacking the New South Wales Premier, Mr Bob Carr, and his government for their drought program. Yesterday the minister also used a debate in the other place to debase the drought assistance packages currently offered by the New South Wales, Queensland, Victorian, South Australian and Western Australian governments. Despite the Prime Minister's rhetoric, his government has done nothing to focus on the delivery of better drought assistance. </para><para>The government has this morning announced the approval of the exceptional circumstances applications for Bourke and Brewarrina in New South Wales. This announcement also highlights the minister's failure to do his job. He has forced the farmers in these regions to wait 64 days to know their fate. Today we have an announcement that the application has been successful. We still have no idea when the money will actually flow to those farmers—and neither do they. The federal government has now received more exceptional circumstances applications from New South Wales. The farm families in these areas should not be forced to wait for months for urgently needed assistance. The Prime Minister must acknowledge his minister's incapacity to do the right thing by drought stricken farmers and instruct that interim assistance be made available within the next seven days.</para><para>So far government action has been motivated only by the pressure that Labor, farm organisations and media commentators have brought to bear, and it should not be this way. The government should be motivated by the needs of farm families. The Prime Minister must also ensure that these new applications are assessed within four weeks.</para><para>The government has focused on the impact of the drought on broadacre farming. It has given no consideration, might I say, to the devastating impact the drought is now having on the intensive industries such as poultry and pork and the beef feedlot sectors. An audit of all feedstocks must be undertaken immediately. That audit must look at current fodder stocks, not just grain. These industries, the tens of thousands of workers they employ and the thousands of small businesses that service them need to plan for the immediate future on the basis of available fodder supply. The minister must act to provide them with that certainty. As a matter of urgency, the government must review all aspects of the current grain import protocols with the aim of ensuring that the feedstock required by these sectors can be satisfied if there is no break in the current drought before next year. In many respects, I have been calling for that work to be done since October.</para><para>There are currently eight applications to import grain with the government, and one of those applications, for sorghum, has been approved. The opportunity for an early sorghum crop has been all but lost and the deadline for the planting of a late crop is only weeks away. If there is no rain in the next few weeks in important growing areas, the current small number of import applications will quickly turn into a tidal wave. It is worth noting comments made in the other place by the now Deputy Prime Minister in 1994. He said:</para><quote><para>We will not have enough domestic grain to cover needs. That is rapidly becoming quite obvious. Priorities in terms of what should be imported, what should be kept here, what export contracts should be met and what should be attempted to be met from other sources are issues that will need to be looked at as a matter of great urgency.</para></quote><para>...	...	...</para><quote><para>There is now an urgent need to get on top of the questions of inventories for feed, what is available, what is going to be needed, what the priorities should be, and how they can best be met. There should be no shirking of that responsibility at all under any circumstances. </para></quote><para>I am quoting the Deputy Prime Minister from 1994, and there was an audit of stocks undertaken in 1994. Due to the current drought that need has arisen again.</para><para>The government has also failed to respond to the crisis confronting our beef and sheep producers. Whilst most farmers have been progressively destocking their properties as the drought has worsened, their ability to retain or agist their key breeding herds and flocks has been severely limited or in many cases lost. This drought is now well beyond normal property management planning. The situation in New South Wales is particularly worrying. Over 96 per cent of that state is now drought declared and it was suggested yesterday that now 99 per cent of the state is in the grip of drought. Many have now lost their core breeding animals and with them the ability to rebuild their businesses after the drought. The government must act to assist these producers to protect the core breeding animals that remain. That would be a sound investment in a quick recovery when this drought has ended.</para><para>I note comments this morning by the Deputy Prime Minister that the government is working on a plan to help keep core breeding animals alive. I am concerned at the suggestion in his comments that the necessary work on these measures is only now beginning. The fact is that nothing has yet been delivered by the government on this issue. The fact is that it is the Minister for Transport and Regional Services who is now announcing that the government is starting to look at this option. Just what has the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry been doing? My view is that this assistance should be provided through the current exceptional circumstances structure, and the starting point should be a comprehensive audit of fodder stocks. The matter of feed grain availability is fundamental to any plan to hold core breeding stock together and there is, after all, little point in providing assistance to feedstock if there is no feed available.</para><para>Finally, to assist the government in this regard, I say that these steps are the steps it must now take. It must coordinate its existing rural programs to deliver more effective assistance to farmers and to rural industries. It must acknowledge the many dimensions of the drought's impact on regional communities and review existing government programs that can be adapted to assist these communities, the workers in them and their families. The government must sort out the exceptional mess that Mr Truss has made of the exceptional circumstances program and ensure that it delivers real and lasting reform of national drought assistance. That reform, might I say, must include improvements to the exceptional circumstances assessment and delivery program, including the resourcing of the National Rural Advisory Committee, NRAC, to deal with the multiple EC applications, because it is of little use to ask them to assess multiple applications if they do not have the resources to do it expeditiously. That would be a failing, and a major failing.</para><para>So far Mr Truss has proved incapable of addressing the drought crisis enveloping Australia. That crisis is now having a telling impact on the national economy, and the Reserve Bank is now saying it will be responsible for gross domestic product being reduced by one per cent—the equivalent of $7.1 billion. It has gone beyond the responsibility of the minister—he has proven that he is not up to the job. The Prime Minister must develop a national response to the drought. Australia cannot wait any longer for Mr Truss to act on his own initiative. I conclude with a plea made in the editorial of a newspaper in a probably rarely spoken about part of this country—the <inline font-style="italic">South Burnett Times</inline>, published in Kingaroy on Friday. That editorial says:</para><quote><para>Drought-crippled farmers expect governments to stop buckpassing and cut the red tape involved in them getting access to assistance.</para></quote><para>That is a message that Mr Truss should hear loud and clear.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>World Trade Organisation: General Agreement on Trade in Services</title><page.no>6209</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>6209</page.no><name role="metadata">Nettle, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator NETTLE</name><name.id>00AOR</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on a matter of fundamental importance to the Australian economy and society, both now and in the future, and that is the issue of international trade. In this parliament, we often hear about the impact of international trade on our economic indicators. Statistics about trading figures are quoted by both sides of the chamber to demonstrate various different points at various different times. In presenting this matter of public interest, I would like to focus not on the economic indicators or dry numbers relating to trade but on the real social impacts and environmental implications of these economically driven decisions. </para></talk.start><para>One of the unique things about the Greens is that in our policies we look beyond the assumptions that apply in many areas, including in the economy. There are two major parties in this chamber whose policy differences essentially split hairs in tinkering with the mechanics or the finetuning of the details of the trading system. In contrast, our major interest is in looking at questions that neither of these parties will address: the real effect of trade and economic policies on people's lives, the environment, the equity of our world for future generations, and the capacity to democratically shape our own society. The Greens' policy is based on a fundamental belief that economic systems should exist to support people, not the other way around. Too often the self-serving logic of corporations and economists takes too much for granted. We believe that, instead of adopting the vision of ordinary people to the pressures of powerful interests, we must imagine the economic world that we want and work to achieve it.</para><para>The World Trade Organisation provides a good example of this difference of approach. On Monday in the other place, the member for Farrer singled out Greens' policy for attack when she said that we must take on the international trading system on its own terms. The member's argument was that as a small economy we cannot expect to have control over our own economic destiny. She misses the point of Greens' policy, which is that there is nothing sacred about the international trading system. It is an artificial structure, set up by people for their own interests, and there is no reason why it cannot be and should not be turned around, taken over or turned down if it does not serve these interests. As a global movement, we advocate that this should happen on an international level. Indeed, Greens parties from around the world have signed on to a charter calling for the World Trade Organisation to be reformed to make sustainability its central goal. This reform must be supported by transparent and democratic processes and it must be accountable to representatives from affected communities. The WTO in its current form meets none of these requirements. Greens internationally state that if it cannot be reformed to meet these objectives it should be abolished.</para><para>The Greens believe that international agreements on the environment, labour conditions and health should take precedence over international rules on trade. The goals of these agreements promote quality of life, health and dignity of work and these are the very goals that the economic system is meant to be serving. But instead of serving these needs, we currently have a system where our environment, workers' conditions and human rights buckle under the power wielded by transnational corporations through the World Trade Organisation. In essence, we have the means overtaking the ends.</para><para>The next round of trade negotiations at the World Trade Organisation will focus on the General Agreement on Trade in Services, or GATS. This agreement seeks to force national governments to deregulate and privatise their essential public services. These services include health, education and environmental regulation. The negotiations affect every level of government, from national to local, and every aspect of people's lives. At the next round of the World Trade Organisation meetings in Mexico next year, we will see a continuation of the push to expand the scope of the General Agreement on Trade in Services. It was driven by the transnationals of the service industry, the fastest growing sector of the world economy. The aim of these negotiations is to force all countries, developing countries in particular, to open their doors and commit to essential services being listed in the GATS negotiations and therefore open them to deregulation, privatisation and international competition. I will be moving a motion in the Senate later today to address some of the worst aspects of this situation. I will call on the government to reveal Australia's negotiating position at these WTO talks. I look forward to the support of the majority of senators for that motion. </para><para>I will not dwell on the specifics today, because I want to turn to the question of the public response to these issues. Clearly, the immediate impetus for the debate today is the unofficial meeting of world trade ministers happening in Sydney over the next two days. This meeting is not officially a part of the next round of trade negotiations; indeed, it is more of a gentlemen's club where those who will be attending have received invitations from our esteemed Minister for Trade, Mark Vaile. The purpose is for the wealthier nations to come together to plan their strategy for negotiating with developing countries to have the essential services of those developing countries put out to tender for transnational corporations. It is an opportunity for the wealthiest countries to work out how they can get access to the markets that the majority of citizens are involved in: essential services such as health, education and water.</para><para>This meeting is neatly symbolic of the problems with the World Trade Organisation and the General Agreement on Trade in Services. It is exclusive and unrepresentative with only 25 out of the 144 countries in the World Trade Organisation having been invited. It is undemocratic in that the negotiations are to be completely secret and decisions reached at this meeting will never have to be ratified by this parliament. It is weighted against developing and smaller countries as the purpose of this meeting is to place pressure on those countries to support the interests of the wealthier countries. It is also a meeting that is organised to be against the interests of ordinary people. Why else would it be necessary to hold it in a special zone where legislation left over from the Olympics will make it almost impossible to undertake peaceful protest and democratic dissent?</para><para>This event has attracted a lot of media attention but not, unfortunately, for the profound implications of the future structure and control of our essential services. Instead the media attention, backed by the irresponsible and unfounded statements of some politicians, including the New South Wales Minister for Police, has focused on the potential for violence in demonstrations against the World Trade Organisation meeting. Tomorrow I will not be at the protests in Sydney, because I will be here in the Senate, but I will be sending a message to these protesters who will be gathering to make links between their opposition to the WTO and their opposition to the war on Iraq.</para><para>I would like to read part of this message that I will be sending to them tomorrow into the record of this chamber. I will be saying to them that, despite the pressures that will be put on them by the police and security forces, the Greens believe that protesters against the war and against the World Trade Organisation must show it is the strength of their conviction, support for each other and a belief that a better world is possible that will bring change—not violence. The Greens support the right to protest and to break unjust laws without the use of violence. It is a part of our freedom and it is one of the things that our political leaders claim to be fighting for. This is why people will be at the protest tomorrow, to protest peacefully against the war and the WTO, and this is why the Greens will be 100 per cent behind them in this endeavour. Peaceful protest against the World Trade Organisation is legitimate and democratic.</para><para>Contemptibly the decisions of the New South Wales government about how to handle such incidents are not. For example, the decision by the New South Wales police to ban all forms of peaceful protest in the city this week and, we hear today, potentially to ban the holding up of banners at Homebush this week is a recipe for disaster. It can be only for the most serious of reasons that the rights of citizens in a democracy to protest should be shut down. The limited incidences of violence by a small number of protesters out of tens of thousands of peaceful demonstrators are merely an excuse and not a reason.</para><para>Of the celebrated incidents of violence, particularly the September 11 protests of year 2000, the cold light of an ombudsman's inquiry has shown that the overwhelming perpetrators of violence were the police and security forces. The civil actions for compensation that have been lodged by innocent protesters injured by illegal police actions are on the public record. Yet the New South Wales government and the Minister for Trade are setting themselves up to make the same mistakes again. There may be a cheap political gain to be made out of headlines about violent protests, but the health of our democracy is the loser in the long run. There is no question that tomorrow and on Friday people will protest as they have every right to do. These protests are founded on real and serious concerns about the World Trade Organisation and the General Agreement on Trade in Services. These protests must be peaceful and I hope that the police and the security response will equally be peaceful. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Defence: War on Terrorism</title><page.no>6212</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>6212</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak about the war on terror. I particularly want to focus on the need for Australia to provide some leadership in the world to attack the economic causes of terrorism. We have reported constantly in the media the things that we are doing to deal with the effects of terrorism: military actions that need to be taken, how to stifle the supply of funding to terrorist organisations, how to cut off their weapons supply and how to detect the culprits involved here and bring them to justice. But that is dealing with the effects of the problem. I want to talk about the causes of the problem, specifically the economic causes, and how Australia can provide some focus on an economic war on terrorism and cut the problem off at the cause—nip it in the bud where terrorists are recruited out of poor economic circumstances and are gulled into being members of extremist or fundamentalist organisations that see terror as the only action that they can take. So I want to focus on the causes, which is not to say that I in any way disapprove of what needs to be done about the effects of terrorism. Certainly we need a strong international campaign, in which Australia is playing its part, working with the concerned nations of the world, to deal with the effects of terrorism. But, fundamentally, my argument is that unless there is a balanced package here, one that not only deals with the effects but also focuses on the causes, then terrorism will remain with us in the long term and the cost exacted economically, in human suffering and in loss of life and in damage to our institutions will be much greater than if we were to, with equal vigour, tackle the causes of the problem.</para></talk.start><para>Recently the US trade representative, Bob Zoellick, said in a considered speech that it is extremist and fundamental ideologies that lead people to terrorism, not poverty per se. I agree with that sentiment insofar as it goes. He is right about the ideologies that lift people from poverty into terrorist activity, but there is no doubt that poverty, which does disfranchise people not only in economic terms but also in everyday life opportunities in education and health, in the access to free and clean water, in the exercise of democratic rights and the right to employment— those problems which are endemic to poverty—creates a hotbed in which extremist ideologies can take hold and in which terrorists can be recruited. I am sure Bob Zoellick would agree with that.</para><para>The same applies when I consider the parallel comment made by the 1998 Nobel prize winner in economics, Amartya Sen, in his book entitled <inline font-style="italic">Development as Freedom</inline>. He put the issue in a slightly different and more erudite and sophisticated way than I will now. However, crudely put, his thesis is that people cannot be free, irrespective of the democratic institutional structures around them, unless they can afford to exercise the rights that freedom gives them. He illustrates his point by referring to a country in our region in which there is a democratic structure but where poor people sell their votes to local landlords, not because they believe those landlords will do what is in the interests of the poor, but simply because their vote is a tradeable good which enables them to sell it and buy a meal for themselves and their family to last through the day. They sell that vote in order to survive not because the landlord or person they sell it to is going to necessarily enact policies in their interests. So you do not get democracy. Despite the democratic structure, you get a perversion of democratic practice and a continuance of poverty as a consequence. </para><para>The point I want to make here is that the war on terror cannot be won if it is only a war on the effects of terror; it needs also to be a war on the causes of terrorism. For Australia, given our region, that imposes unique and special responsibilities. We live in a region of the world where there is an uncomfortably high level of poverty. We can be—and some would argue are—a symbolic or surrogate target as a country representative of, to put it in the lingo, `the great Satan' which is the target of terrorist organisations.</para><para>Living as we do in this part of the world we have an obligation not only to fight terrorism and but also to deal with its causes. In this context, I want to refer to the economic circumstances in Indonesia and the deterioration of the economic climate of that country, our nearest and most populous Muslim neighbour and a country friendly to Australia and a country with whom Australia is friendly. In referring to Indonesia, that does not mean that other nations in what has been called the arc of instability around our north ought to be neglected. For example, Papua New Guinea is in desperate economic straits. Australia provides 55 per cent of the budget of PNG. That budget is in deficit to the tune of about seven or eight per cent of the GDP of that country. We are asking PNG, in a declining economic situation, to reverse the democratic mandate that the government of Michael Somare was elected on—that is, to privatise when he was elected on a mandate not to privatise. We are also asking him to balance his budget because an unbalanced budget is obviously unsustainable in the long run. However, we need to stimulate economic growth for the country. Cutting programs to build roads that would allow agricultural producers to bring their goods to market, or cutting programs to deal with health and medicine when the AIDS epidemic is gaining a foothold in PNG, or cutting education services seems to me to be a wrongly focused approach for Australia to take in PNG.</para><para>The other nation that ought to be mentioned is the Solomon Islands. It is at grave risk of becoming the Biafra of the Pacific. Its economy is in almost total collapse. While there are strong cultural and religious reasons why those nations will not become part of any international terrorist organisation, their poverty makes them vulnerable. In attending to the arc of instability issue, Australia needs to address those concerns.</para><para>Indonesia was the worst hit economy in the 1997 Asian currency crisis and the slowest to recover. The significant thing about Indonesia in modern contemporary times is that it is now a democracy. It is a fragile democracy and it is struggling to remain a democracy. It is in our great interest that it becomes a stronger democracy than it is. That is vital for regional stability and for Indonesians, but it is also important because democracies as a general rule do not make war on other countries or on other democracies. To strengthen the institution of democracy in Indonesia is an important consideration for Australian foreign policy. </para><para>If the press reports about Indonesia are true, the Indonesians are showing great skill and great endeavour in tracking down those culpable for the Bali bombing incident and that is to their great credit. Indonesia needs a growth rate of at least six per cent per annum to reduce unemployment and poverty. In 2001, it grew at 3.3 per cent. In 2000, it grew at a higher rate of 4.8 per cent, but this year it is projected to grow at 3.2 per cent. Its growth level is trending down, not up. Its growth level is about half the level it should be in order to address the problems of unemployment and poverty. </para><para>Dark clouds are gathering over the Indonesian economy as well. It has a growing public debt problem and it has high external debt. The rupiah is weak against other currencies, pushing up prices for imported goods and making the cost of those imported goods beyond its reach. Some of those goods are essential to the development of the country. It has maturing debt obligations which place on it, and certainly on government outlays, a huge commitment. The government should be stimulating the regional economy of the country and bringing its budget back into growth, while providing economic stimulus, lifting aggregate demand in the Indonesian economy rather than paying foreign debt and denying itself the opportunity to stimulate growth. They are some of the questions facing the Indonesian economy. </para><para>In the two decades leading up to 1996, poverty levels in Indonesia fell from about 60 per cent of the entire population to below 12 per cent, but the currency crisis pushed poverty levels in Indonesia back up to 27 per cent. In real terms, there are now almost 56 million people in Indonesia, on our borders, living in poverty. When you analyse the nature of their poverty, it is typified by low education, no access to education, rural poverty, overcrowding in Java and the poorest poverty-stricken regions being in east Indonesia—that is, those parts of Indonesia closest to Australia. The World Bank poverty report recently said that, over a three-year period, between 30 to 60 per cent of all Indonesians face a greater than fifty-fifty chance of periodically experiencing not poverty but extreme poverty. So there is a burgeoning social issue right on our borders that needs attention.</para><para>The IMF rescue package that was initially put in place after the currency crisis did not work. I believe that the 2001 Nobel Prize winner for economics, Joseph Stiglitz, argues persuasively that the photograph of the Director-General of the IMF, Michael Camdessus, standing over President Suharto when he signed the IMF package not only was a bad look for the IMF in the region, with the West and Europe dictating to this culture, but was counterproductive, did not work and, in fact, made the problems worse. There is a further problem. The Paris Club of creditor nations is rescheduling a $US5.4 billion debt that Indonesia owes in the world under its debt relief programs, but a precondition of having access to debt relief is that they sign an IMF package which arguably has features to it that might worsen the economic situation in Indonesia. That is not a good look; it is a bleak outlook for that country. It is the biggest Muslim country in the world, it is a democracy, it is Australia's neighbour and it is a country over which we have a special obligation—an obligation that we should deal with irrespective of the terrorist overtones in the world at the moment. We have that obligation no matter what, but in this current climate that is a heightened obligation and one that we should give some priority to.</para><para>I am not saying in these remarks that no attention is being paid to the economic dimension that underpins the war on terrorism. Certainly Australia has given attention to that, and I acknowledge that it has done so, but it is not anything like the type of attention that is required. At the end of the day, this is a global issue. Australia cannot do it alone, but Australia should do a number of things. Australia should take and do what it possibly can within its region and among its neighbouring economies to put those economies on a growth path and help them economically to achieve self-sufficiency. We should use our standing in international fora, including the World Bank and the IMF, to help mobilise a global approach to poverty reduction in this area. We should tackle the Washington consensus, a key plank of which is balanced budgets, where you need to increase aggregate demand. After all, the Bretton Woods agreement that underpinned the IMF—an architect of which was John Maynard Keynes—was about increasing aggregate demand. The price that we pay for neglecting these things is a vastly greater price than we will pay to correct them. If we act now, we can remove some of the causes of terrorism and reduce the ultimate long-term cost. If we do not face up to these issues at the moment, and we let the problems incubate, then the war on terrorism will be an endless war, because the circumstances that gives rise to terror will remain. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Knowles, Sue (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Knowles)</inline>—I call Senator Tierney.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>8O6</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'Brien</name></talker><para>—Madam Acting Deputy President, on a point of order: I understand that Senator Tierney would have been fourth on the speakers list had he been here at the time he was due to be called, but he was not.

It does from time to time happen, and certainly over the last couple of days it has happened on far too many occasions, that senators have not been able to get to the chamber at exactly the minute the previous-speaking senator resumes his or her seat.

This came home to me very dramatically a few weeks ago when my wife and I, together with two of our adult children, left the performance of <inline font-style="italic">Cabaret </inline>at the State Theatre in Sydney and headed along George Street for coffee. Coming from the glamour and decadence of <inline font-style="italic">Cabaret</inline>'s pre-Nazi Berlin, we were suddenly confronted on the streets of Sydney by the dispossessed of our society—a group of about 10 people who were aimless, destitute, dirty, drunk and probably homeless. The statistics tell us that in that situation probably 75 per cent of them would have a mental illness—although my wife's experience as a senior officer in the Department of Community Services told her that in the group before us there was probably closer to a 100 per cent chance of them having some form of mental illness. Many showed signs of brain damage as they clutched their bottles of wine in brown paper bags, swaying and singing along to the music of the evangelist who was at that time trying to save their souls. They were harmless enough and we stopped to talk to some of them in the heart of Sydney, on a balmy spring night within a few hundred metres of five-star hotels and financial centre skyscrapers which denote opulence and success in our society.</para></talk.start><para>Yet the mark of how civilised our society is can be judged by how we treat these really forgotten people. How do we measure up in the state of New South Wales in the care of people with a mental illness? Recently, the Select Committee on Mental Health in New South Wales brought down its interim report. The committee was headed by Dr Brian Pezzutti. I want to draw out of this report one crucial point. The Pezzutti inquiry is the first parliamentary inquiry specifically into mental health in New South Wales since 1877. That is 125 years ago. In 1877, the inquiry identified 11 significant problems with the mental health program at that time. One hundred and twenty-five years later, seven of these 11 problems have not been dealt with properly. Why?</para><para>When the latest report was published two months ago, it drew some media comment. <inline font-style="italic">Four Corners </inline>screened<inline font-style="italic"></inline>a program which laid bare the run-down in psychiatric services in New South Wales, particularly over the last six years. Two days later, the media moved on to other issues. Contrast this with February 1999, when on the front page of the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph </inline>appeared a photograph, taken in a back lane in Redfern, of an older boy showing a younger boy how to shoot up heroin. Quite rightly, there was public outrage. The issue rolled on in the press for many weeks. Quite rightly, the government responded and hundreds of millions of dollars were allocated in a four-pronged attack on the drug problem. The mental health issue raised by the Select Committee on Mental Health died in two days as a media issue. And we are still waiting for Bob Carr to commit one extra cent, even when expenditure on mental health in New South Wales is right at the bottom of the class—sixth out of six, across Australia. Bob Carr probably thinks he can get away with this—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Knowles, Sue (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Knowles)</inline>—Senator Tierney, may I correct you.

Health is certainly an important issue with the community, but the concern is about access to hospital beds and waiting lists for operations. So I ask: if mental health does not register as a matter that affects voters, how will the lot of people with a mental illness ever improve?</para></talk.start></continue><para>The lack of engagement by the public on this issue is curious when you consider how widespread mental health conditions are, such as depression, anxiety disorders, substance abuse, personality disorders and, to a much lesser extent, psychoses. As for how many people are affected, I note that around 23 per cent of the population have a diagnosable mental illness each year. One-third of these suffer mild episodes and recover without treatment, one-third suffer moderately severe episodes and should have treatment and one-third suffer severe and/or chronic episodes and need treatment. </para><para>Who is affected? Sadly, the worst affected group is the 12- to 17-year-olds—at 20.6 per cent. Of the hope of our future, one in five will suffer a mental health episode. The most shocking result is for the under-one-year-olds. Of this group 5.8 per cent have a mental illness, mainly because of abuse, neglect or mothers suffering severe postnatal depression. So, if you have a 20 per cent chance of having a mental health episode and almost a 100 per cent chance of this happening to someone in you family, what are your chances of receiving professional help?</para><para>The answer is not good, particularly if you live in New South Wales. Only 35 per cent of people with a mental illness in New South Wales receive treatment. Most treatment— for 75 per cent of those treated—is provided by general practitioners. Of those treated for anxiety and depression, 55 per cent do not receive effective treatments. All of this raises a number of key questions. Why is such a widespread and disabling health problem occurring in such a wealthy society as ours and why is it so poorly diagnosed, under-resourced and largely untreated? Why don't the public register mental illness as a major concern and demand that more resources be allocated to this area?</para><para>In our culture people do not really want to know; they switch off. We have to ask why. Possibly, it is because there is a great deal of misunderstanding and misplaced fear of people who have a mental illness. Dr Patrick Corrigan, author of <inline font-style="italic">Don't Call Me Nuts</inline>, talks about the silent stigma of mental illness when he lists four myths that might explain the public disengagement from mental health issues. Myth 1 is that people with a mental illness are dangerous, unpredictable and out of control and that as a result they can become homicidal maniacs. The fact is that for the most part research suggests that people with mental illnesses are no more dangerous than the rest of the population, except when they use street drugs or are paranoid. Fewer than one in 1,000 people with a mental illness will commit a dangerous act in their life.</para><para>Myth 2 is that depression and mania in particular represent a weakness that most members of the population avoid because they have stronger characters. The fact is that serious mental illness is a biological disorder; it is a disease. People no more choose to have depression or schizophrenia than they choose to have diabetes or breast cancer. Myth 3 is that people with mental illness are not capable of living independent lives outside of institutions. The fact is that the vast majority of people with the severest of mental illnesses—schizophrenia, mania and major depression, to name a few—rarely see the inside of a hospital or need institutional care. Myth 4 is that if people with a mental illness are capable of work it is only in menial jobs. The fact is that, like the rest of the population, a small percentage of people with mental illness work as doctors, lawyers and entrepreneurs. Also, mental illness does not necessarily preclude someone from completing schooling or skills training.</para><para>Finally, how can we improve what we do for people with a mental illness? There are three key strategies. Firstly, we must increase the mental health literacy of the community. Rotary is to be congratulated on their Australia-wide community forums and support for research into mental illness. Secondly, we must ensure that health practitioners are better able to detect mental illness and provide treatment that works. To achieve this goal there needs to be a large boost in expenditure on mental health, particularly directed at GPs, with training programs and backup resources to make this happen. Thirdly, we need to reorganise mental health services to better provide treatments and forms of support that work in a timely manner—let me emphasise `in a timely manner'.</para><para>As a society which believes in the self-reliance of the individual, have we struck the right balance between that tenet—and all that it brings as a mainspring of wealth creation and economic growth—and our responsibility in a civilised society to look after those who cannot rely on themselves? Clearly, particularly in New South Wales, the answer is no. Brian Pezzutti's upper house committee is to be congratulated on exposing the disgraceful state of mental health in New South Wales. Jillian Skinner has made an excellent start with the mental health policy she released recently. We must now establish plans to ensure that the really forgotten people, the mentally ill, receive the level of care and treatment that should be expected in a civilised society. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESI-DENT</name></talker><para>—Order!

The issue of the size of salary packages being paid to corporate executives is, fairly said, one that does trouble some sectors of the community. The sheer sizes of the packages are sometimes difficult to comprehend. I think an abiding principle that Australians agree with is that people should be paid what they are worth and that they have their right to pocket a fair day's pay for a fair day's work.</para></talk.start><para>Senators on this side of the chamber would be aware that the growth of executive salaries last financial year appears to be well down on previous years, but that does not address some concerns about the magnitude of some of the payments. There are real issues of fairness if the heads of companies extol the virtues of wage restraint for their workers while accepting excessive salaries for themselves—I think that is a fair point. The owners of these companies—and this is the critical point and the answer to Senator Conroy's question—and the shareholders and their representatives on the boards can clearly play whatever role they need to in containing or winding back the level of remuneration for executives if they feel that it is excessive. That is the point: the answer to this is in the hands of the shareholders and the boards.</para><para>The Labor Party, in its usual attempt to stir up the politics of envy, seems to be suggesting that the government should somehow or other be stepping in and setting the salaries of individual CEOs. Is that what is really being proposed? I do not know whether Senator Conroy dreams of sitting at his desk and setting salaries for CEOs, but it is not going to happen. The shareholders would not be keen on the idea of the Labor Party—or, indeed, the ACTU or any of Labor's union mates—ticking off what are, or are not, fair and appropriate salaries for individuals.</para><para>The decision on the question of what is an appropriate amount for executive salaries ultimately resides with the owners of a corporation and the shareholders. Corporations in this country, I remind the Senate, are not like the ALP: there is no 60-40 or even 50-50 power split. If the shareholders want to alter the rewards received by the leaders of their companies, they are perfectly entitled to do so. I encourage shareholders to be active on this front—including institutional shareholders and superannuation funds, which I have noticed have been taking a great interest lately in this issue. Shareholders and directors need to be vigilant, and the extent of remuneration packages needs to be clearly disclosed so that they can make informed decisions. Nothing alters the point that the answer to this question is quite simple: it resides in the power of the shareholders to do what they wish to about setting executive salaries.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>6218</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question.

There ought to be a reminder of this on the scoreboard at the MCG. There ought to be placards around the ground. The billboards on the arena ought to remind people—or, indeed, Mr Bracks should take out some space and apologise for and explain his behaviour—why Victorian taxpayers like me are being asked to fund this sort of nonsense when the money could be much better spent.

That is like Kofi Annan getting a character reference from Saddam Hussein.

I am sure it goes on—the list must be as long as your arm. Do you ever hear one word from the Labor Party criticising these sorts of practices?

But the assumption that Senator Cook has made in his question, that millions of dollars have been lost in this matter that has been raging for some time—  the foreign exchange losses—is, firstly, not correct. It is not precisely my portfolio area, but I really do not know how many times Labor need to have the issue of foreign exchange arrangements explained to them. We on this side of the chamber have tried on many occasions to do this, but it should not surprise senators that the Labor Party appears to have no idea at all about a policy of their own making. That is the whole point about this issue. I am happy to go through it again. Why was the policy of foreign currency swaps entered into by Labor? Can anybody remember why? As we all know, the policy was initiated by the Labor Party as a device, a technique, for managing Labor's mounting debt, which peaked at $96 billion in 1996-97. </para></talk.start><para>The policy was also conducted, of course, on the expectation that the United States dollar debt would result in lower borrowing costs, to take advantage of the lower US interest rates compared to the high interest rates that Australia had under the Labor government—that is, it was a policy born of the chronic failings of the Labor government's economic management. The Labor Party are masters of rubbery figures and we have seen in this whole issue the most extraordinary and desperate attempts to try to blame this government for a problem of their own creation. </para><para>What did the coalition government do? It is worth recounting that we began repaying Labor's debt, in 1997-98 reducing exposure and helping to reduce the interest rate differentials. Labor's net debt has now been reduced to $36 billion, which is an extraordinary effort. No swaps to increase US exposure were entered into after February 1999 and the policy was suspended in December 2000. From September 2001, the stock has been run down in accordance with a pre-agreed timetable between AOFM, the Treasury and the RBA, with the aim of eliminating foreign currency swaps altogether. As has been said ad nauseam, the last cross-currency swap matures in 2008. This is starting to be a bit of a tired issue. I do not know how many times we can run through the fact that this was a debt of Labor's making, a problem of Labor's making, which this government fronted up to and has fixed.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>6221</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question.

I am happy to report that at the Australasian Police Ministers Council last week the Commonwealth initiatives that were put forward were accepted in relation to hand gun law reform. But at the outset I want to stress that the priority remains with the use of illegal firearms. Each year, we have the theft of 4,200 firearms in Australia and that is a diversion from the legal sector to the criminal sector. That still remains a high priority for the Commonwealth government.  </para></talk.start><para>In relation to the agreement reached last week, what we took to the Australasian Police Ministers Council were proposals which the Prime Minister put to the premiers and chief ministers when they met before that. We outlined a detailed proposal which would achieve a fair balance between public interest and safety on the one hand and the interests of legitimate sporting shooters on the other. We identified in excess of 250 types of hand guns that were not applicable to legitimate sporting events and we also identified some 10 disciplines of semi-automatic hand gun events which were legitimate sporting shooting events. We said to the Police Ministers Council that we have a proposal here which is a chance to bring sweeping hand gun law reform. As well as that, what we sought from the states and territories was further regulation in relation to the licensing of hand guns, the storage of hand guns—because of the theft problem that I mentioned—and empowering sporting shooting clubs to deal with undesirable members, because they had come to us and said: `We have an issue here. We have a situation where we have tried to expel members. They have taken us to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and overturned our decisions.' Of course, our proposals dealt with that. </para><para>Needless to say, the tragic events of Monash University brought this all into sharp focus. The proposals that the Commonwealth have put forward would have resulted in the alleged shooter not having access to any of those guns. The list of hand guns that we have drawn up is a draft list and that is being worked on between officials and the sporting shooter sector. We will reconvene as a Police Ministers Council and re-examine the 19 proposals that we have agreed on, and it will then go forward to the Council of Australian Governments in mid December. We have here a golden opportunity for all the state and territory governments to work with the Commonwealth in relation to the Commonwealth's initiative to regulate the use of hand guns in the community and also to outlaw those hand guns which are not applicable to legitimate sporting events. </para><para>What we have done in this whole process is look at the interests of legitimate sporting shooters, and they have been working with us in identifying those events and ways that we can tighten controls, but of course you have to remember that the constitutional responsibility of the day-to-day regulation of hand guns lies with the states and territories and we have a distinct problem in the number of thefts of firearms each year, where firearms are stolen and diverted into the criminal market. That is where the problem lies and that is what we must address. That is part of the proposal that we have put forward and we will be taking that back to the Police Ministers Council when we meet in late November. </para></answer></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DISTINGUISHED VISITORS</title><type>Distinguished Visitors</type><page.no>6222</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—I draw the attention of honourable senators to the presence in the gallery of three staff members from the newly formed East Timorese government who are here observing our parliament.

How is the agreement different from a section 29 action declared by agreement not to need approval?

The fact is that whoever might be in a position theoretically to have access to sensitive information has an obligation to ensure that they do not misuse that access. Those who are the owners of that information, whether it be intellectual property or otherwise, such as the Commonwealth government, would similarly be very concerned to ensure that arrangements are in place to require that that demarcation line is carefully drawn and observed. That applies whoever the carrier might be, whatever the circumstances of that carrier—whether it be partly government owned, wholly government owned or fully privately owned.

I know he has a very big interest in this, coming from South Australia where, I might say, the South Australian Labor government recently made a very magnanimous gesture for drought relief. They provided some money to replace money they withdrew from a Commonwealth program on droughts when they first got into power. The other bits of the money went to frost relief, would you believe, in the time of drought, and also to roads. That is indicative of what the state governments are all about.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Chapman's question does enable me to go back through just what this is all about. I know farmers out there and the public generally hate more than anything governments squabbling with each other and saying, `It's your fault' and so on. But it is important that we all understand that droughts were originally a state responsibility. They came in under the natural disaster relief arrangements. But in 1992 a new national drought policy was developed between all of the states and the Commonwealth. What that provided was that in droughts the states would take the initial action. They would pay the money that was necessary to address the impacts of drought. It was also agreed that, when a drought was a once-in-a-lifetime event or a one-in-25-years drought, the Commonwealth would come in with additional funding, because it was seen to be beyond the ability of the states to cope. That is the background of it. It is very important that it is understood.</para><para>Since then the Commonwealth has made very significant contributions under the drought EC or exceptional circumstances provision. I am able to say that, in the Bourke and Brewarrina areas of New South Wales, drought EC or exceptional circumstances have today been officially declared. That means that, in addition to getting the welfare payments that farmers in those areas have been getting now for some weeks, they will be entitled to business assistance and other relief from the federal government. That is very important.</para><para>I heard Senator O'Brien speaking in the debate just before lunch, saying that nearly all of New South Wales was drought affected and somehow blaming the Commonwealth for that fact. It is important to understand that the Commonwealth can only act on drought relief when the states make an application to it. Until today the New South Wales government had made one application, for Bourke and Brewarrina. On 19 September, one week after receiving that, money actually started going to those people—$44,000 has already gone to those people from Commonwealth money.</para><para>For the rest of New South Wales that Senator O'Brien talks about, there has still not been an application made by the New South Wales government. I correct myself—I am sorry. Three applications came in today. The Commonwealth has to assess them, refer them to an independent committee and then act on them. But the New South Wales government have been recalcitrant in not putting those in before today. I ask Senator O'Brien to tell me: what has the New South Wales state Labor government paid for drought relief? Give me a cash sum. Give me a cash amount. They will not say, because they are embarrassed that they have spent nothing whilst the Commonwealth has spent a considerable amount and is going to spend a lot more.

Can I also say that Queensland asked for drought relief for the adjoining shires of Belyando and Emerald. That is a bit of a laugh, because the Queensland government have not even declared those two shires to be drought affected for their own purposes, yet they are asking for the Commonwealth to give exceptional circumstances drought relief. That is the way the state Labor governments are playing politics with this. It is an easy attack on the Commonwealth to say that the Commonwealth should do this, but under the arrangements the states have the prime responsibility.

The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is one of the best systems in world. It enables all Australians to have medications at a subsidised rate. That is something that people do not understand. People who pay the general rate do not often realise that the most commonly prescribed medication on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme costs $80 per person per month. The cost of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme went from $1 billion in 1990 to $4.8 billion last financial year. What we have to do is ensure that we manage the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme in a number of ways. One of them is to get the best price we can for a medication. The Productivity Commission found in a survey of prices for medications around the world that we get the best prices because we drive our prices. Of course we always have to realise that there is a fine balance between the profits that the companies have to make and our protecting taxpayers' funds. What happens is that the pharmaceutical companies make an application to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee to put a medication onto the PBS.

Yes, I will get to the answer, but I am going to tell people about the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme in the process. There are some other medicines— Avandia, Singulair and Spiriva—on which there have been delays in finalising pricing agreements between the department and the manufacturers. Important as they are, I believe it is legitimate that the government does what it must to make potentially life-saving medicines, such as Gleevec, available on the PBS as soon as possible.</para></talk.start><para>As I said, negotiating pricing arrangements is often a very difficult task, as manufacturers will naturally always seek pricing arrangements in their best interests but not necessarily always in the best interests of the taxpayer. I categorically reject any suggestion that the government is delaying the listing of the new medicines. The new PBS schedule effective from 1 November 2002 includes three new listings: Xigris, Movicol and Valcyte. One of them is for treating sepsis, one is a laxative for cancer patients and the other is for treating HIV-AIDS patients. Xigris is a new drug which may be used in the treatment of potentially fatal complications of meningococcal disease. It is an important addition to the treatment options for this devastating disease.</para><para>Clearly, any suggestion that the government is delaying the listing of new PBS medicines is false. However, I caution the Senate against thinking that, without support for the government's budget measures, the PBS can carry on growing at an unsustainable rate. It cannot. It cannot grow as it has from $1 billion in 1990 to $4.8 billion last year. Let me remind honourable senators that when Labor were in government there was a medication recommended by the PBAC—I cannot remember the name of the drug, but I have mentioned it once before in the chamber and I am sure it begins with `r'—for which the Labor Party could not get agreement on what they thought was a reasonable price, and it was never listed. They can sit over there and talk about delays. We are not delaying, but we are determined to ensure that we get an appropriate price that means that the taxpayers' money is well spent and that we are able to have a sustainable Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>6228</page.no><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name><name.id>AW5</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question.

We also recently introduced protection for child complainants and child witnesses in proceedings for child sex tourism and other child sex offences. Certainly, in relation to educating people, we make it very public that we are cracking down on people who engage in child sex tourism.

It is estimated that there are around 20,000 children in Cambodia alone being abused.

Over 12,000 general practitioners participate in this scheme and continue to provide services to veterans and war widows. Under the memorandum, participating local medical officers receive a higher rebate, equal to 100 per cent of the Medicare benefit schedule fee, for treating veterans. The rebate paid to general practitioners who are not party to this arrangement is equal to 85 per cent of the Medicare schedule fee plus 60c. I have been advised, and I think I have advised the chamber before on this issue, that any veteran who is unable to gain treatment because of a refusal to accept the gold card should contact the nearest state office of the Department of Veterans' Affairs to gain assistance in finding an alternative general practitioner.

The September figure for Australian private health insurance has remained stable, unlike under Labor when it declined rapidly and was unsustainable, as former Senator Richardson said. Although the proportion of the population covered went from 44 to 44.1 per cent, the number of Australians covered actually grew by 4,268, to 8,000,709. This demonstrates the success of the determination of our government to restore the balance between the public and private health systems. This is just the latest in a sequence of data that shows clearly the incredible success of the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate, Lifetime Health Cover and no gaps. Last year, 2000-01, we saw for the first time in history a fall in the number of public hospital admissions, by almost 5,000—almost a 0.1 per cent decline. At the same time, the number of private hospital admissions went up by over 12 per cent. Nobody can say that that is not taking a load off the public hospitals. Importantly, these figures do not include the real impact of the Lifetime Health Cover initiative. </para></talk.start><para>Clearly we have restored balance to our health system and taken pressure off Medicare and the public hospital system. I was in Queensland last week—in fact I was in Queensland twice last week—visiting a small private hospital where there is now an after hours centre operating for general practitioners in the area. The director of that hospital, a very impressive young woman, said that had these reforms and changes not come in the hospital would not have been there; the Uniting Church was thinking of dropping out, the hospital would not have been there, would not have been providing this service to those people on the coast and would not have been able to offer a service for after hours care that relieves the doctors in that area and enables them to roster and to have time off. So there was a double impact. There are some hidden benefits of the fact that the private hospital system is viable.</para><para>Clearly we have restored balance to our health care system and taken pressure off Medicare and the public hospital system. Over half of procedures are now performed in private hospitals: half of the procedures for chemotherapy, 53 per cent of major procedures for breast cancer, 56 per cent of cardiac valve procedures and 60 per cent of joint replacement and limb re-attachments. So there is clear evidence that there has been a freeing up of public hospitals, and in addition there was a $3 billion windfall to the states when we did not claw back money we said we would claw back as private health insurance went up.</para><para>The Labor Party needs to decide whether it supports the 30 per cent rebate. The families who get a rebate of about $750 a year will be very interested to know whether the Labor Party supports it. The people who are waiting for elective surgery, who were putting off having surgery that was not lifesaving or was not seen to be urgent and who were living with the pain, for example, of severe bunions reducing their mobility will be interested to know what the Labor Party is going to do about supporting private health insurance. Let me say that on this side of the chamber we support a strong public system and a strong private system. We believe that is the best way to ensure that we get the best health outcomes for all Australians.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>BH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name></talker><para>—Mr President, I ask that further questions be placed on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline>.</para></talk.start></interjection></answer></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title><type>Questions Without Notice</type><page.no>6231</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>National Stem Cell Centre</title><page.no>6231</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>6231</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Finance and Administration</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Murphy asked me a question yesterday about the National Stem Cell Centre, which I took on notice.

Last year in March and again in September, the government's handpicked, drug company friendly pharmaceutical benefits committee approved two diabetes treatment drugs: Avandia and Actos. It is now 1½ years later and the government has failed to make the necessary decisions about the listing of these drugs under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Astoundingly, this minister has not even taken a submission to cabinet on the issue. In that time, over a thousand people who could have benefited from these treatments have been transferred to insulin therapy. </para><para>This is a government that claims the reason for the delay is one of price. The minister told us today that no agreement had been reached on the issue of price. She failed to tell us that in January this year her department reached an agreement with the manufacturer of Avandia and that that agreement went to the issue of price, volume, conditions of listing and use. So we have a situation where the government in fact reached an agreement that went to the issue of trying to minimise the fiscal risk of the PBS through inappropriate use of the glitazones class of diabetes drugs. This is the position that the government chose not to reveal to us today. That is why I say that this minister misled the Senate.</para><para>The Commonwealth has the capacity to force down the price of drugs by direct negotiation with the drug companies. The Health Insurance Commission has the capacity to impose stringent controls on the prescription of drugs; however, it is only if this minister chooses to exercise that control—it is only if she has the political will to do that. The minister has spoken on the issue of price, but at no point did she talk about the issue of cost. She did not point out to us the cost of forcing people onto insulin who could otherwise have avoided it. Nor did she explain the additional cost to the public health system or the community cost resulting from thousands of people who failed to get appropriate treatment. We all understand what sorts of serious complications there are for people who have diabetes and who are not treated effectively.</para><para>The other great and consequent cost that the minister chooses to ignore is Australia's reputation in research and development. She fails to understand that the patent lack of transparency in the processes of government is undermining confidence in this country's ability to be a proper place in which R&amp;D investment can take place. A situation is emerging where the process of listing and costing drugs is being corrupted by the political interference of the Treasurer of this country. That is the truth of the matter. The minister does not have the political will because that political will is sapped by the Treasurer. The government is essentially seeking to deny sick and elderly people affordable and appropriate treatments and is encouraging a situation where painful conditions are prolonged and suffering is intensified. </para><para>The government has failed in its treatment of diabetes. We should remember tomorrow on World Diabetes Day the failure of the government to fulfil its obligations. Last year, the government launched—with all the great fanfare that only the propagandist machine controlled by this government can—a whole series of measures aimed at helping people with asthma and arthritis. The government said that these measures were about trying to improve the quality of life of people with these conditions. The government is now saying that it no longer cares about those people. It is suggesting that where there are affordable drugs—drugs that are provided at costs which can be controlled—it is not interested in proceeding. It is not even interested in taking a submission to the cabinet on the question. If the government were interested in ensuring that doctors prescribed wisely and that people used their medicines effectively, we would see a course in which we were able to assist the minister in the development and reform of the PBS. We do not see that from this government. It is difficult for the government to face up to the fact that it is concealing its own financial errors and shortcomings by trying to slug pensioners in regard to the PBS. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>6235</page.no><name role="metadata">Payne, Sen Marise</name><name role="display">Senator PAYNE</name><name.id>M56</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to take note of the answers given by the Minister for Health and Ageing, Senator Patterson, in question time today. To make it quite clear, as I understand the minister did in her response during question time today, and which I am now able to reinforce, and contrary to the assertions made by Senator Carr—which were not made in any measured or sensible manner but were made in the typical way we have come to expect, which apparently means that if you shout louder you get more of your message across, which, of course, is entirely untrue and ineffective as you would expect— no price agreement was made in January in relation to Avandia. It is not true. The matter has been double-checked. The minister has advised that that is not the case and, therefore, any further suggestions, assertions or allegations from Senator Carr that this is a corrupted process should be of great concern to the Senate. It is an entirely inappropriate allegation to make in this chamber.  </para></talk.start><para>It is also inappropriate to allege that the government is in some wilful fashion seeking to intensify the suffering of individuals in this country. To try to reduce the complexity of the operations of the PBS to a diatribe shouted across the chamber to an audience of nobody who is interested, certainly on this side—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AW5</name.id><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator Carr</name></talker><para>—That is the truth.

It certainly does not enhance the capacity of Senator Carr's reasonably inadequate argument as it has commenced. The minister made quite obvious in her remarks and in her response this afternoon that finalising pricing arrangements between the department and manufacturers involves very complex processes. They are not simple processes that can be dealt with in a matter of minutes. Negotiating those arrangements is a very difficult task because manufacturers naturally seek pricing arrangements in their best interests but not always in the best interests of Australian taxpayers. As well as the good health of Australian taxpayers, the government is also required to have the best interests of those taxpayers as a principle in its operations. I can just imagine the diatribe that would come from Senator Carr if we decided that that was not a principle we should follow: it would be even less entertaining than the last one. </para></talk.start></continue><para>As the minister made quite clear in her remarks, the government is able to categorically reject any suggestion that it is delaying the listing of new medicines. I think the minister referred to some of the aspects of the new PBS schedule, effective from the first of this month, which includes three new important listings: Xigris, which is for treating severe sepsis; Movicol, which is a laxative for cancer patients; and Valcyte, which is an important treatment for HIV-AIDS patients. Xigris—and those opposite may be interested in the importance of this—is a new drug which is used in the treatment of potentially fatal complications of meningococcal disease. It is a very important addition to the treatment suite available for combating the devastation of meningoccocal. So any suggestion that the government is delaying the listing of new PBS medicines is absolutely false. </para><para>Of course, it is important to remember that the Senate has refused to support the government's budget measures on the PBS. It is simply not the case that the PBS can continue to grow at an unsustainable rate; it cannot. It is time that those on the other side took a very close look at the government's very reasonable propositions in relation to the budget measures on the PBS and considered those far more carefully, without histrionics and without hysterics. It is time they looked at what can actually be sustained in the growth of the PBS in the near- and medium-term future and at the very sensible suggestions the government have made in relation to the budget. </para><para>What the government have done and will continue to do is to ensure that Australians have access to medicines they do need via the PBS. It is a principle to which we are committed. We are also committed to ensuring that there is access to pricing arrangements that represent fair value for taxpayers. There is absolutely nothing about that from which we resile. As the minister has indicated, if the opposition really were serious about sustainability rather than about stunts, they would support the sorts of budget measures that the government have brought forward. Again, I want to reinforce that the minister made it perfectly clear during her response—and I am able to, on her advice, confirm it—that there was no price agreement reached on this particular drug in January. It is not the case. To accuse the government or the minister of running a corrupted process is an entirely inaccurate, inappropriate and unhelpful contribution from Senator Carr. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>6236</page.no><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display">Senator CROSSIN</name><name.id>7Y6</name.id><electorate>Northern Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to take note of the answers from Senator Patterson, the Minister for Health and Ageing, today. I specifically want to talk about her two answers in relation to the figures regarding the bulk-billing rates and the veterans gold card. We heard the minister's response today that she believes that the figures for this quarter may be out this Friday. But if we just turn back the clock to August of this year, we will find that the minister was not certain about when the figures for the last quarter were going to be released. After a number of questions in this chamber, she finally admitted that she had seen the minute relating to the figures for that quarter, although when she first answered that question she had led us to believe that she had not seen them. So are we still to accept that the minister may not have seen the figures for this quarter? If she has not, why hasn't she been pressing the Health Insurance Commission to release these figures, given that it is beyond the six-week time frame when they normally release the figures?</para></talk.start><para>If these figures are consistent with previous quarters, we know that the figures on the range and amount of bulk-billing that occurs in this country will continue to decline. I would not be surprised if the latest figures continue to show that. We have seen—and I remember taking note of this back in August—this government stand by and watch the rate of bulk-billing seriously decline since they came to office. This is a government that has no commitment to maintaining Medicare. When we were in government we put that system in place. We are the party that are committed to maintaining the integrity and the values of Medicare. This is a government that is happy to stand by and see Medicare eroded and diminished by stealth.</para><para>Let me turn to another very serious matter that has come to my attention in the last couple of weeks—that is, the diminishing value of the veterans gold card, particularly relating to the services they get from specialists, and now, it would seem, from general practitioners. If a veteran has a gold card and they present themselves to a doctor or a specialist, then that gold card has been, in effect, their Medicare card. They have been able to use that gold card to get access to that service. We know that specialists have withdrawn that access and have continued to fail to recognise the value of that gold card in recent months.</para><para>At the same time, this government has had in place with the Australian Medical Association an agreement—which expires on 13 December—to recognise a gold card for up to 50 per cent of the value of the Medicare rebate. But that agreement is about to expire. The minister said today that there were discussions with the AMA to try to extend that agreement for a short period. What happens after that? What is going to happen after that for the many thousands of veterans around this country who rely on their gold cards to get access to GP services? They will, more than likely, have to go and apply for a Medicare card, or they will have to take out private health insurance.</para><para>Let us have a look at that today. We asked the minister if the government could guarantee that they would give assistance to those veterans if private health insurance had to be taken out. She could not provide that guarantee today. This minister could not guarantee on the public record today that where veterans are disadvantaged and need to take out private health insurance the government would assist them. This minister's response was to say that people should go back to the Department of Veterans' Affairs and they will help them to find a doctor. In the case of the Northern Territory, for example, there are very few doctors who bulk-bill—in fact, one doctor in Palmerston bulk-bills after six o'clock at night. The Department of Veterans' Affairs will be able to find a doctor for veterans, but these doctors will not be bulk-billing. Veterans will have to get a Medicare card and take out private health insurance, and today we have seen the minister not able to guarantee whether those veterans could have any assistance if they find themselves in this situation in coming months. Again, we have seen that the government is not committed to assisting all Australians with their medical benefits. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>6237</page.no><name role="metadata">Eggleston, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator EGGLESTON</name><name.id>4L6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am appalled at the way the Labor Party is trying to stir up fear in the hearts of the veterans around Australia, making them worried about whether or not they will receive appropriate medical care and attention from their doctors. Of course they will. There are something like 12,000 doctors around Australia participating in the gold card and Veterans' Affairs medical scheme, and those doctors will continue to provide medical services to these people. What is happening is that the agreement between the government and the AMA over the provision of Veterans' Affairs medical services—DVA gold card services—is due to be renewed in December. As with all agreements which come up for renewal between all sorts of bodies, when the matter is under discussion a little bit of posturing goes on. That is what is going on here: the doctors are posturing. We will find, I am quite sure, when December comes that there will be an agreement in place to provide medical services to veterans around this country.</para></talk.start><para>As I said at the beginning of my speech, it is absolutely outrageous and irresponsible for somebody like Senator Crossin to get up on a broadcast day and make a speech which implies that veterans, who have given so much to this country in times of war, are going to find that they cannot get adequate medical services through the Veterans' Affairs scheme. It is absolute scaremongering, total nonsense and, as I said, completely irresponsible of Senator Crossin to do that. She really ought to think through what she has had to say today, because it would have had a very frightening impact on many of the people who do depend on the Department of Veterans' Affairs for medical services.</para><para>The Howard government is absolutely committed to looking after veterans, and it remains absolutely, solidly committed to the gold card system. The government is aware that some doctors have been concerned about the level of fees paid for services to the veterans community and, as I said, there is a process of negotiation going on with the AMA. I am quite sure that will be resolved in a very satisfactory manner for the doctors concerned. I want to assure everybody around this country who is listening to this broadcast that there is no question whatsoever that medical services to veterans will not be maintained.</para><para>The other point that Senator Crossin raised and which I think needs to be dealt with concerns the release of the bulk-billing statistics. Senator Crossin seems to think that Senator Patterson should have those statistics to hand and release them to the Senate today. As it happens, as Senator Patterson said, about every six weeks the department of health produces statistics on the level of bulk-billing for various kinds of medical services around the country. In this time frame of six weeks, the next statistics are due to be released on Friday, 15 November. When I read the paper this morning I noticed that the date was 13 November and that it was a Wednesday, not a Friday!</para><para>I suspect the Senate will find that, at the time they are due on 15 November, those statistics will be duly released by the minister to the waiting public, including Senator Crossin. She will then be able to tell from those bulk-billing statistics what the actual percentages are for various categories of medical services around this country. I think the minister has acted quite responsibly. If the statistics are not due to be released until Friday, the 15th then that is when they ought to be released, not on Wednesday, the 13th. It is a little bit rich of Senator Crossin to expect the minister to release those statistics before the department does.</para><para>There has been some suggestion that bulk-billing is declining around the country, but I wonder what category we are talking about. I would be very surprised if pathologists or radiologists were bulk-billing less than usual. Certainly, there is some variation with general practitioners, but that goes up and down. Basically, something like 70 per cent of medical services for GPs are bulk-billed in this country, and I am quite sure the statistics will show that that is continuing. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>6238</page.no><name role="metadata">Moore, Sen Claire</name><name role="display">Senator MOORE</name><name.id>00AOQ</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I also rise to take note of the answers given by Senator Patterson in question time today and respond to issues she raised, particularly concerning the much discussed figures on bulk-billing. It is no surprise that people are waiting for the figures on bulk-billing. It is no surprise that we are awaiting them quite eagerly, because this was discussed in this place when the last round of figures were due and because the media report on what is happening to bulk-billing across our country on quite a regular basis now. I note with interest that Senator Patterson actually said that she expected the figures sometime this week and that, when she got them, which usually happens on the evening before their release, she would note them—but not for action; she would just note them.</para></talk.start><para>We are now aware—having been told about 10 minutes ago—that the figures will be released this Friday, 15 November. We await these figures with great expectation, because we know that there is interest in them. We know that people are waiting to have a look at them to find out what is happening with bulk-billing across the country, not just in particular areas. It was proven by the last figures, whenever we got them, that bulk-billing is falling. In fact, in my state of Queensland it is clear that there has been quite a serious decline in bulk-billing and that, in some of the poorest parts of the country, people no longer have access to their doctor in that way. In some areas of Central Queensland and western Queensland the figures on this have dropped to lower than 50 per cent.</para><para>The only reason we know this is happening is that people are telling us it is happening. They are concerned, they are hurt and they are making quite serious decisions about whether or not they can afford to go to the doctor. The much awaited figures that we are going to see, hopefully—definitely—on 15 November, will indicate exactly where bulk-billing is available and how it is being accessed. The figures that we got last quarter, after waiting to see whether or not they would be noted, indicated that people no longer had access to that service. Anecdotally, the people talking to us say that the choices they have to make indicate whether or not they can go to their doctor. The doctors—who, as we heard recently, have been posturing—have in fact gone public with their own concerns about this service. They have gone to the media and they have lobbied their politicians. They are talking to the AMA about the fact that, in Queensland, 30 per cent of members have already stopped offering bulk-billing and that those members still using the service or providing the service to their clients are now forced to restrict it. It is a really serious issue: no longer can people expect a service that they used to have.</para><para>In some areas of Queensland, doctors are saying that they are being forced to restrict the service to particular types of patients. Also—and this is something that I have great difficulty with—they are only able to provide bulk-billing during particular hours. So you can go to the doctor during particular hours and maybe you can have bulk-billing but, if you go during other hours, you cannot. That is not the access to medical services that we need to have.</para><para>However, if we are going to look realistically at what is happening to the health system, there should be an open expectation that we will have the figures. There should be an open expectation that everybody who has an interest in this quite critical issue—our health—will be able to have a look at agreed data, that they will be able to study it and ask specific questions. Rather than posture, people will be able to ask particular questions about what is important to them. Then and only then will we be able to work out some realistic way to address the problem. Instead of quarrelling over whether or not we have the accurate figures, we will be able to look at the real issue, which is whether there is a crisis in the medical situation in our country and how many people have access to a fair health system. </para><para>It is interesting that it is very easy for people to quote the private health care figures and that they are able to be released automatically every month. So this afternoon we were able to hear how effective private health care allegedly is and to have accurate figures that could be related to and used to promote the system in this place. It would be novel—in fact, it would be refreshing—if the same degree of pride could be had about what is happening with bulk-billing in the country. We will wait and see, with interest, whether we get the figures on Friday—then maybe we will see whether they are accurate.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Environment: Endangered Species</title><page.no>6239</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>6239</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move: </para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Defence (Senator Hill) to a question without notice asked by Senator Bartlett today relating to the protection of spectacled flying foxes.</para></motion><para>I found it astonishing that the minister was not able to answer at least the general thrust of the question that I asked him. I did not expect him to give a chapter-and-verse legal recitation of the vagaries of section 33 of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, but I did at least expect that the minister—who knows this act very well—would be able to easily assure the Senate that the agreement reached last week between the federal Liberal government and the Beattie Labor government in Queensland did not breach the EPBC Act. I am genuinely surprised that he was not able to do so.</para><para>That act was established and put in place a few years back. One of the big areas where it was particularly a major improvement was in protection for threatened species. Unfortunately, we have the classic conundrum for the public in relation to politics: parliaments pass acts providing alleged protection— whether it is for the environment or for people in the community—but governments ignore the acts passed by parliaments and, in some cases, blatantly breach them. That is a real difficulty. It is a difficulty with acts, such as the existing heritage act, because departmental officials in estimates have said quite openly that there is no way of enforcing an act if its provisions are not followed.</para><para>There are ways, however, to enforce the EPBC Act because it is a better act. The provisions are not ideal but they are there. Indeed, the spectacled flying fox situation in Northern Queensland, where fruit growers were electrocuting large numbers of spectacled flying foxes and other flying foxes, provides the best example of acts not being enforced. Because of the provisions in the EPBC Act that were put in by the Democrats in the Senate, against opposition from the Labor Party and the Greens, the public now have the standing to take a matter to court to get the act enforced, and this has happened. It is not ideal. It would be far better if the government just enforced its own act, without the public having to go to court to make the government do what it should do. Nonetheless, a court decision was made that the electrocution of spectacled flying foxes— which at that stage were not even listed formally as a threatened species; they have subsequently been listed by the federal minister, something which we congratulate him for— threatened not just the survival of the flying fox population but also the World Heritage values of the Wet Tropics, because the flying fox plays a key part in the web of the diverse ecosystem matrix that makes up the World Heritage values of the Wet Tropics. So the act of slaughtering these flying foxes directly worked against the World Heritage values of the Wet Tropics.</para><para>It was a clear decision of the court, and it is precisely what the environmental protection act was put in place to enable to happen: to strengthen the protection of World Heritage areas and threatened species. This government and the Labor Party government in Queensland have gone off to a back room, reached an agreement between themselves and come out saying, `Any action that we say is okay is now exempted from the EPBC. As long as you kill these flying foxes by shooting them, instead of electrocuting them, and as long as you shoot up to allegedly only 1.5 per cent of the total population, the act does not apply.' Leaving aside the absurdity of how you can set the figure of 1.5 per cent when nobody knows what their total population is, there is absolutely no way of enforcing the ability of a farmer to shoot only a certain number. In one way, if you do it with electrical grids, at least you can see the numbers on the ground and you can see it in operation. But, with shooting, since you do not know how often, how regularly and at what time of the day or night it will occur, it is impossible to monitor. </para><para>Leaving aside those absurdities, the basic fact that the two governments can do up an agreement and say, `The act does not apply, as long as you kill them this way rather than that way,' surely flies in the face of every tiny shred of the spirit of the EPBC Act. In the Democrats' view, it raises serious doubts as to whether it actually breaches the letter of the law of the EPBC Act. We look forward to the minister coming back to the Senate as soon as possible to answer the question and to provide that information. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>NOTICES</title><type>Notices</type><page.no>6240</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Presentation</title><page.no>6240</page.no></subdebateinfo><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murray</inline> to move on the next day of sitting:</para><motion><para>That the Senate—</para><para>	(a)	notes the rejection by a majority of the states and territories of Graeme Samuel as nominee Deputy Chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission;</para><para>	(b)	asks the Federal Government:</para><para>	(i)	to ensure that it consults fully with the state and territory governments regarding Professor Fels' replacement, and</para><para>	(ii)	to establish criteria for the selection and appointment process that include not just selection on merit, but that any candidate should be demonstrably independent, and have a strong interest in consumer and small business needs.</para></motion><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senators Cherry</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Ridgeway</inline> to move on the next day of sitting:</para><motion><para>That there be laid on the table by the Minister representing the Minister for Trade, no later than immediately after motions to take note of answers on Monday, 18 November 2002:</para><para>	(a)	all requests received by the Australian Government for increased access to Australian services markets by other nations, lodged under negotiations, under the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS);</para><para>	(b)	any documents analysing the likely impact of any requests made of Australia in negotiations under GATS;

The so-called cut-off motion, which was initiated by Democrat senator and my predecessor from Queensland, Michael Macklin, back in the 1980s and subsequently modified down the track, was introduced for two reasons: firstly, to make it harder for governments to push through legislation without adequate time for consideration and, secondly, to enable the Senate to have more control when determining what are urgent or important matters and which ones can be put off for later. This bill fits very squarely in the second category. In fact, it would be hard to find a better definition of a bill that we do not need to debate before the end of the year.</para></talk.start><para>I know Senator Ian Campbell does a fabulous job, with as much difficulty getting cooperation from his own colleagues as from the rest of us, in trying to manage all the business of this chamber to get through the important issues that the government believes it needs to get through in the time frame available. As I have said many times on behalf of the Democrats, I believe the Senate should be sitting more days than it does. I acknowledge that that is not Senator Campbell's decision, but the Democrats believe that, with the legislative workload these days, the historic levels of Senate sittings that we might have had in the past are now inadequate and we really need to be sitting an extra few weeks. Apart from that, most of us like each other's company so much that I think we should hang out with each other a bit more often!</para><para>The reality is that we have only a certain number of days—only 12 sitting days before the end of the year, roughly—to consider a large number of bills; I am sure Senator Campbell knows the number off by heart. We are going to struggle to deal with all of those. We will be having late sitting hours and curtailed debates, people will be making shorter speeches than usual and incorporating remarks, we will be sitting on Fridays and we will be getting tired and grumpy and angry and less able to make considered decisions. The last thing we need is another bill that we do not need to debate.</para><para>The Democrats' view is that we all know what the outcome of this bill will be. We could all give our speeches now or we could incorporate them. They are the same speeches that we made last time the bill came up—or the time before, the time before that or the time before that. But we will not do that. We will all make our speeches, we will all vote the same way and the outcome will be the same. In one sense, it is the government's prerogative to put forward what it wants to debate, but I believe that the Senate should not simply sit back and say, `We will debate whatever bill the government wants us to in whatever order it wants us to.' I believe that the Senate, as the primary house of legislative consideration in the parliament and in the country, should be more assertive in determining what order of business it wants and what bills it gives priority to. This bill is not a high priority.</para><para>The Democrats are not opposing this motion because we are trying to put off its ever being voted on. We are opposing it because we have only a small number of days left in the year, we have a large legislative program and we should not be chewing up that time on a bill that will not even get through. We can easily deal with it next year and vote it down then. I think that in many ways Senator Ian Campbell would agree that the Democrats would be doing him a favour if the Senate were to oppose this motion in that his program would be just that little bit less cluttered as we move through this busy period towards the end of the year.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>6248</page.no><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator LUDWIG</name><name.id>84N</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—It is worth while putting the opposition's position before the Senate. The opposition support the Democrats on this motion. We stand, however, ready to debate the <inline ref="R1636">Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2002 [No. 2]</inline> today. We have said that if the government did want to consider this as a trigger for a double dissolution then our position would be as has been stated by our leader, Mr Crean: you can bring it on. We will put our arguments whenever the bill comes on for debate. We note that the Democrats, however, are not in a position to debate the bill, and on that basis we agree to support their position on the matter.</para></talk.start><para>What might also be worth while saying, if the government has some doubt about it, is that already the opposition have agreed to the cut-off in respect of 34 bills. Given that to date we have had only 45 sitting days this year—this is provided by the general statistics for 2002—when you look at the 2002 program, I do not think the government should consider putting any blame on either the Democrats or Labor for adopting a position on this bill. When you look at the time that was provided during the last sitting day, you find it was inadequate. When you look at the number of bills that we have already agreed to have exempted from the cut-off—a total of 34—you see that we have been generous to a fault in terms of our position.</para><para>When you examine the legislative program to date as shown in the statistics on the ParlInfo site—and this is a telling statistic in itself—you find that, from 1 January to 24 October, 10 government bills were introduced into the Senate, plus another 134 bills have come through to be dealt with. That is a total of 144 bills. Up to 24 October, there were still 32 bills to be dealt with; more have been put through and we have not opposed their exemption from the cut-off. On my understanding, there are a few more to be dealt with before the end of the year. We all know—Senator Ian Campbell knows it quite well—that the cut-off is a measure that is designed to avoid the end of year rush. I have gone to the trouble in this instance to go to <inline font-style="italic">Odgers' Australian Senate Practice</inline>. I do know there is a 10th edition, but the ninth will do. It outlines an amendment moved by Senator Hill, his leader in the Senate, that:</para><quote><para>... had the effect of making a permanent order of the Senate to the effect that a bill introduced in any period of sittings will be automatically adjourned to the following period of sittings unless the Senate makes a deliberate decision to exempt the bill.</para></quote><para>That was done on 29 November 1994. Senator Campbell's leader agreed at that time, and I am sure he is still of the same view, that each bill stands on its merits as to whether it should be exempt from the cut-off—whether the government has been able to convince the Senate as to whether a particular bill is urgent, whether it deserves exemption from the cut-off and should be dealt with or whether it should fall by that particular rule and not be dealt with. The <inline ref="R1636">Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2002 [No. 2]</inline> is a bill we are ready to deal with. The Democrats tell us they are not. On that basis, given the Democrats' position, it is not a bill that the government has been able to demonstrate clearly is urgent enough to be dealt with. </para><para>It is also worth reiterating what an exemption from the cut-off is. We often seem to have this debate about this time of year. It is about the third time, from my recollection, that we have had it. The government knows why it does it. The government does not have to seek exemption from the cut-off in relation to this bill if it already understands the position of the parties. It could simply choose not to introduce it and let it lie. But of course it brings it on. Why does it bring it on? Because it wants to make a point.</para><para>I am not too sure whether Senator Alston or Senator Ian Campbell will get up to make the point, but I remind them—and this is perhaps to help people who are listening to this debate—that when a bill is introduced by a minister or received from the House of Representatives, it is deferred for the next period of sitting, unless it was introduced after the expiration of two-thirds of the total number of sitting days, in which case it fails and requires approval of this house to be introduced and dealt with. This was designed to avoid the great haste which this government might want legislation to be dealt with. Each piece of legislation should be dealt with properly and appropriately and without due haste. One wonders in this instance whether the government's purpose is to bring it on and rush it through.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>6249</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I congratulate Senator Ludwig on that act of pure sophistry. It is really an act of transparent cowardice, because he seemed to suggest towards the middle of his remarks that the purpose of the exercise was to avoid the Christmas rush. But he started off by saying that the opposition stood ready to confront this matter—it was not afraid of a double dissolution—but unfortunately the Democrats were not ready and therefore they would defer to the Dems. That is not exactly what Senator Bartlett said. What Senator Bartlett said was that he had great and enduring respect for Senator Macklin who, many years ago, was arguing the case for a cut-off motion or an exemption from the cut-off that would follow from it. As he understood the purpose of a cut-off motion, it was to ensure that there was adequate time for consideration of a bill.</para></talk.start><para>If ever there was a bill that has been overexposed it has to be this one. This bill has been before the parliament no less than 15 times; it has been before this chamber eight times. If ever in the history of the Senate there was legislation by which you could say you were not taken by surprise, it is that on unfair dismissals. This has been a circus for years. To pretend that somehow you are not ready, or to hide behind what you claim are the Democrats saying they are not ready, is complete and utter sophistry. The reality is that the Dems want to hide because they want to put off the date of reckoning. But they know full well that the purpose of the cut-off motion is to ensure that people are not taken by surprise. This has to be one of the worst kept secrets of all time if you think we have suddenly sprung this on you. We have been bringing it back time and again. Just so that the Labor Party is utterly exposed on this issue, let me remind you what its general attitude has been to exemptions from the cut-off. Senator Ray said on 24 September last year:</para><quote><para>... around 125 to 127 bills have been subject to a cut-off resolution since we resumed after the 1998 election. The Labor Party has only ever opposed the cut-off for one ...</para></quote><para>So you would think that there would have to be extraordinary circumstances to justify that. It would have to be a huge piece of complex legislation which had been dropped on you at the last minute and you simply had not had time to prepare. This, of course, is quite the opposite. The Labor Party has known for months and years about a determination to proceed on this matter and, with its usual consistent intransigence, it absolutely refuses to come to the party. That is irrespective of the fact that we have gone to elections on the issue. It is irrespective of the fact that there have been surveys in which small business has made it painfully clear that this is costing it hundreds of millions of dollars a year.</para><para>A recent survey by the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research gives compelling reasons why small business needs to be exempted but, as always, the Labor Party just says no. As we saw in an article by Cameron O'Reilly this morning, it is because virtually everyone on that side is here representing the interests of the union movement. They are not representing the wider community; they are not in touch with small business. They are not really in touch with policy issues. They are simply here as spear carriers for their various unions. If there is one issue that unites them, it is the fact that the unions do not like the exemptions for unfair dismissals. As a result, they are going to die in a ditch. I would have thought that to start off by saying, `We are not afraid of a double dissolution, but we have to defer to the Democrats,' was the height of cowardice. For all those reasons, we will be supporting the motion. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>6250</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I would have kept quiet, but I think that, in view of some of the remarks made, I need to say a few things. As usual, there has been truth all around the chamber. Firstly, we have such a crowded program that any bill which intrudes and which would take hours to debate obviously has to be considered carefully. Whilst it is true that this bill has been endlessly debated, it is a bill which comes forward with endless arguments that need to be rebutted.</para></talk.start><para>I can assure the chamber that, speaking on behalf of the Democrats, we would take the time and effort needed to debate this bill in full. I am quite certain that so will the Labor people. For instance, the latest Melbourne study cited by the minister is just one of those pieces of paper and items of misinformation which firstly needs to be forensically examined—hopefully beginning at next week's estimates—and secondly would need to be thoroughly rebutted, because the government knows that, if you keep repeating untruths, there are enough people out there in its heartland who believe them. The difficulty for us all is that we have to constantly rebut extravagant claims made by the government with detailed and factual analysis and response.</para><para>Frankly, the only possible grounds for this bill to be considered urgently would be if it were the trigger for a double dissolution. If the government were to come to us and say, `We want this to be urgent because we want a double dissolution,' both Labor and we would say, `Bring it on.' But the Prime Minister himself has said that he does not want a double dissolution. If he does not want a double dissolution, there is no question of courage or cowardice. There is no question at hand. There is simply a question of the policy issue. The policy issue will require hours of debate and some further production of analysis. The Democrats would have considered the cut-off exemption favourably if the Prime Minister had said he wanted a double dissolution. He does not want one, therefore there is no urgency and therefore we will leave it until next year.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>6250</page.no><name role="metadata">Murphy, Sen Shayne</name><name role="display">Senator MURPHY</name><name.id>FX5</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—From my point of view, as many times as we have seen the government introduce bills into this place with regard to industrial relations, whether it is the rebadged unfair dismissal laws that are now the fair dismissal laws, the fact that you try and argue that this is an urgent bill is just a nonsense.

Earlier reports of the committee advised that there were possible concerns with the bill in relation to delegation of power and search and entry provisions. The committee reported that the provisions were such that a briefing by departmental officers would be appropriate. After the briefing the committee further reported that it did not accept a central proposition put by the departmental officers, that it had refined its concerns and that it would again write to the minister. </para><para>The committee has now received a response from the minister, the Hon. John Anderson, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services, in which Mr Anderson advises that he will seek amendments to the bill and the draft regulations which will address the matters raised by our committee. The committee is most grateful for this cooperation, which demonstrates a commitment to the committee's principles of personal rights and parliamentary propriety. The amendments which the minister proposes will all improve core personal rights. It is worth while examining each of the matters in relation to which amendments will be made, because they illustrate different and significant aspects of the work of the committee.</para><para>The first area of amendment will provide a major enhancement of safeguards in relation to the power in the bill to enter certain premises without a warrant—by force if necessary. As the bill presently stands, this power is exercisable by a delegate who may be any person at all, subject only to the executive director being satisfied that the delegate is a suitable person to exercise them. The amendments will include a reference to regulations specifying requirements such as briefing and training in entry, search and seizure powers for persons to whom it is proposed to delegate these powers. This will be a considerable improvement from the present drafting, which is based on a subjective power unconstrained by objective criteria. As such, the present provision may come within the committee's terms of reference both because it breaches personal rights and because it insufficiently defines administrative powers. The proposed amended provision will, however, be similar to another clause of the bill which limits and controls exercise of power.</para><para>The next amendment relates to the equally important subject of the notification of rights. The committee considers that bills should provide not only for suitable safeguards and protections but also for appropriate notification of these to persons who may be adversely affected. This, however, is an area where the present provisions of the bill are deficient. The bill does provide for photographic identity cards in the prescribed form for those people who exercise specified powers, which is an essential first step. This beneficial provision is, however, diluted by the following clause which requires the identity card to be produced only if the occupier of the relevant premises asks for this to be done. The minister has now advised that an amendment will require an identity card to be produced when exercising premises powers and for reasonable steps to be taken to notify any occupier of the premises of the purpose of the entry.</para><para>The present bill is also defective in that it does not provide for an owner or occupier of premises to be advised of their rights in relation to entry and search which, as noted above, may be without a warrant or consent and by force. This is a significant omission. The effect of even the best legislative safeguards is reduced or even negated if they are not communicated to those whom they are intended to protect. Here again, the minister has undertaken to propose an amendment which will provide for the regulations to specify the rights and obligations of occupiers and for the bill to require occupiers to be informed of these when their premises are affected. This will be another major enhancement of personal rights.</para><para>The committee was particularly concerned at the breadth and number of situations which, under the present bill, are subject to entry without warrant. In this context, powers which are given to public officials should be limited to as narrow an ambit as possible consistent with policy objectives. Here also, the proposed amendments will significantly improve the present provisions of the bill, limiting entry without warrant to matters including only accidents and serious incidents. This is a preferable position to the existing wider application of the power.</para><para>The final undertaking by the minister is to impose another limit on the exercise of the power to enter without a warrant. The existing power in the bill is not limited and controlled by the usual condition that it must be exercised only on reasonable grounds. The minister has agreed to sponsor such an amendment which, together with the other amendments outlined above, will provide an integrated group of safeguards in relation to search and entry provisions in the bill. The committee emphasises again its appreciation for the minister's undertakings. </para><para>At its meeting this morning, the committee also discussed its participation at the fifth Australasian and Pacific Conference on the Scrutiny of Bills and the eighth Australasian and Pacific Conference on Delegated Legislation to be held in Hobart on 4 to 6 February 2003. These conferences are a useful means of sharing experiences with our state and territory legislative scrutiny colleagues. In the case of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, they are also significant because of our pioneering role in the field. The committee has decided to prepare a report for the conference on its work during the three years since the last conference and to present two papers.</para><para>The first paper will be on entry, search and seizure provisions, which is an area where the committee has done considerable work and that represents one of the most important aspects of personal rights and liberties. Part of the paper will include the minister's undertakings mentioned earlier in this statement as an example of the improvements in legislation which result from effective legislative scrutiny. The second paper will address regulation-making powers in Commonwealth bills. The days are long gone when bills simply provided for regulations to be made where `necessary or convenient'. Bills now often require detailed and esoteric regulations to be made, which raise issues of parliamentary propriety. The committee is confident that the report and the two papers will give a comprehensive account to the conference of its work. The committee in due course will report to the Senate on the conference proceedings.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Community Affairs Legislation Committee</title><page.no>6253</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Membership</title><page.no>6253</page.no></subdebateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Brandis, George (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Brandis)</inline>—Order!

Labor opposes these price controls because they fatten up the already hugely profitable Telstra at the expense of struggling low-income families. Labor opposes these price controls because they make owning a home phone, which is a lifeline for many, a luxury. Labor opposes these price controls because the Howard government has cynically and shamefully misrepresented their effect on low-income Australians. Put simply, Labor is seeking to overturn Telstra's 2002 price controls because they are unfair.</para><para>Telstra's price rises under the Howard government have hit hard the hip pockets of many Australians. Since the federal election, Telstra has increased its prices for telephone line rentals, directory assistance, wake-up and reminder calls, mobile phone flag falls, text messaging, Internet access and <inline font-style="italic">White Pages</inline> dual listings. The Howard government have let Telstra off the leash with its new price controls, introduced before the parliament rose for its winter recess in June. Cynically, the government did not introduce this new unfair regime until after last year's federal election. They knew Australians would not cop line rentals going up prior to the election. The new price controls allow Telstra to slug most Australian families with higher line rental fees and higher mobile phone costs, and some are even paying higher local call rates. Telstra is making huge profits and there is no justification for the large line rental increases allowed under the new price controls. They are unfair to low- and middle-income families.</para><para>This is part of a deliberate policy by the Howard government to allow Telstra's line rental fees to eventually increase to around $32 a month—that will be an increase of $244 a year per line since March 2000. That is just money for jam, and that mob is just fattening up the cow to try and draw in some extra buyers when they try and sell Telstra. That is what this is really about. Since March 2000, Telstra has increased its line rental charges for most customers from $11.65 to $21.90 per month—an increase of $123 a year per line. For customers using Telstra's most common home line, Complete Plan, that is an increase of almost 90 per cent in just 2½ years. Labor says: enough is enough! Those outrageous rises must stop.</para><para>The government talks about rebalancing, whereby line rental costs go up and local call costs come down, but under the August Telstra price rises line rentals went up on common plans and—surprise, surprise, Senator Cherry—there was absolutely no accompanying reduction in local call costs. Most Australian consumers will remember the shock they received in the mail this August when Telstra advised them that their line rentals would be going up by $2 or $3 per month without any accompanying reduction in local call costs.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>00A9C</name.id><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Cherry</name></talker><para>—That's not true.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name></talker><para>—Everyone got the letter, Senator Cherry. The shock deepened when Australians started to receive their bills. They had to fork out the extra $2 to $3 a month to pay for their home phone. Many of those receiving quarterly bills copped a $9 increase in line rentals. If you look closely at the bill, you can almost see John Howard's face smiling as he takes another $9 away from the average Aussie so that he can fatten up Telstra for sale. This all goes to the heart of the unfairness of the new regime. Line rentals have a discrete subcap allowing for increases of the CPI plus four per cent—an effective increase of about 7.5 per cent a year—but there is no accompanying discrete local call subcap requiring an equivalent reduction in local call costs. The new price controls do not require Telstra to reduce local call costs by an amount related to the increase in line rentals. This was required under the old price controls. The reductions in call costs promised by the government when they announced these new prices in April have not been delivered. Those promises by the government have not been delivered. There has been some very minor fiddling with STD and fixed to mobile rates. Local call costs have not come down on any Telstra residential plans—not one. Other services, such as mobile phone calls and text messages, no longer have price controls at all under this new regime. Telstra has already started putting up prices for these services. The reality is that phone line rentals of above $30 per month will make owning a home phone a luxury for many Australians. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>00A9C</name.id><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name></talker><para>—You may well laugh, Senator Cherry, but it is not a laughing matter to millions of Australians. The government's low line rental plan, HomeLine Budget—supposedly for low-income earners—has seen local call costs rise in August from 15c to 22c per call to 30c per call—that is a massive 36 per cent to 100 per cent increase. Some help for low-income earners, thanks to Prime Minister John Howard! The largely low-income customers on this plan have also been slugged with increased costs for STD and international calls. Struggling Australians are effectively being told, `We will let you save on phone rental, but please don't make too many calls.'</para></talk.start></continue><para>The removal of the local call subcap on budget packages is an insidious feature of the new price controls. This not only disadvantages low-income earners but also opens the way for Telstra to introduce a timed local call product, with the long-term aim of squeezing out untimed local calls. That is the hidden agenda here. For those of you who say that would never happen, try finding a phone number from the <inline font-style="italic">White Pages</inline> with directory service. They are trying to force you onto the other scheme—`call up and we will connect you'—the call connect. That is what this is about. They tell you that you can still have this other service, then they try to make sure you can never find it, and so you have to use the more expensive one. That is what Telstra have been doing and that is what the Democrats are letting them do.</para><para>The government has tried to argue that the new price arrangements are revenue neutral for Telstra. This is the biggest furphy of the lot. Even Meg Lees would not swallow this one! Supposedly, consumers lose on the swings but win on the roundabouts. But in October Labor revealed government departmental modelling which showed that Telstra stood to gain $170 million a year under the new price arrangements. How can that be so? It is `revenue neutral', apparently. Telstra would gain $120 million from the fixed line price changes and around $50 million from the removal of price controls from mobile phones—that is the government's modelling, Senator Cherry.</para><para>This more than confirmed Labor's own estimate that Telstra would gain up to $100 million from the new arrangements—so we were pretty conservative. We actually tried to give them the benefit of the doubt but their own modelling shows $170 million. It confirmed the views of many from investment banks around the country that Telstra stood to gain from these new arrangements. There are a lot of smart people out there; they do their analysis, they have been given a look at the books—and what did they say? They all said, `Telstra's going to be better off.' But what does this mob on the other side of the chamber say to us? `Oh no, there's no revenue to be gained by Telstra through this.' But the cat is out of the bag. In the money markets, they know Telstra are on a winner. The government's own research says that they are on a winner.</para><para>This Howard government modelling also allows Labor to confidently claim that this motion will force Telstra to hand back around $80 million that it would have taken off consumers over the next eight months. If you support this motion, $80 million would be saved for ordinary Australians. Vote with the government and they would be $80 million worse off.</para><para>Senator Alston has also had a difficult time defending his new price control arrangements. In Senate question time on September 19, it quickly became apparent that Senator Alston did not even understand the new price control arrangements, but that is no surprise from `the master of detail', as he is known over there in the chamber.

It was a fitting prelude to last week's Estens inquiry whitewash.</para><para>Australian families should not be unfairly slugged under these new price arrangements. While the old price controls were far from perfect, they were clearly fairer to low- and middle-income families. Those who are the hardest hit under these new Telstra price arrangements are low- and middle-income families who do not qualify for any kind of special concession. Once again, John Howard has deserted his so-called battlers. Labor are seeking to protect Australian families by disallowing the Howard government's new, unfair Telstra price controls. We call on the minor parties and the Independents to support this motion.

Shame on you!</para></talk.start></continue><para>Just for the benefit of Senator Bartlett, who missed the earlier part of the debate, I will make the point again: this is a company that is making $170 million—not $17 million—out of the new price arrangements, based on the government's own calculations. What did the big tough Democrats over there in the chamber get out of them? Ten million dollars. Telstra are making $170 million. The Democrats' decision to side with the government in pushing through unfair Telstra prices shows once again that the Democrats just cannot be trusted.</para><para>Thanks to the Australian Democrats and the Howard government, Australians will now be paying more for phone line rentals with no guaranteed reduction in local call costs. You had a big bargaining position here, guys, and you went for 30 pieces of silver. When standard phone line rentals hit $32 per month in the next few years, Australians can thank the Democrats and the Howard government. But, Senator Bartlett, this one is down to you. There is no Meg Lees to blame and nobody else to blame; this one is down to you. The party that gave low-income Australians the GST has now rubbed salt into their wounds by allowing John Howard to drastically increase the cost of their telephones. But given that most of you supported flat taxes before, you will not mind an equivalent flat tax for low-income earners on phone lines. If this motion were to be successful, Telstra would be forced to revert to the fairer 2001 price control arrangements as per clause 25 of the 2001 price control regime, which forces the continuation of the main provisions of the 2001 price control regime until July 2003 in the absence of a new determination. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT6</name.id><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name></talker><para>—ACOSS supported the GST as well, so do not trot them out as representatives of low-income earners.

If this motion were successful, Telstra would be forced to comply with the fairer 2001 price control regime for the remainder of the financial year, forcing money back into consumers' pockets—money they would otherwise have taken away. The government would also be forced back to the drawing board to come up with new price controls that do not disadvantage low- and middle-income Australians, which Labor would support. So you had the big chance to make them do it right, and you sold out for 30 pieces of silver.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The government has threatened to abandon price controls from July 2003 if Labor's disallowance motion is successful. What a threat that is: they will just let the gorilla off the leash—they will let Telstra charge whatever they want. Does anyone seriously believe that that is what they would do, that they would sit back and let Telstra just rip people off because it is a huge monopoly? You had the chance here to get a better deal. You could have worked with us to get low-income earners a genuinely better deal, not fatten the cow for this mob to try to sell off Telstra. This is an outrageous threat but it is a hollow threat, and if you had a bit of backbone you would have stood up to them, voted for this motion and forced a decent regime on them next year. If the government got their way, it would mean that we would end up with a privatised monopoly delivering an essential service without price controls. You know you did not have to let them do that. Here we have a government that want to sell Telstra and remove price controls—the true agenda. They want Telstra to be just like the banks. Australians will not cop this and they will know exactly who to blame if Telstra's price controls are removed—John Howard.</para><para>Labor has a strong commitment to Telstra and remains the only party which has not wavered in its commitment to oppose the further sale of this vital national institution. Now you can see why this sort of debate today is critical and why you have to keep Telstra in public hands with majority ownership so that that mob over there and their pack of spivs, who want to advise them and make millions and millions in fees, cannot just flog it off so that shareholders can buy it and lose more money, just like they have done on T2. That is what this debate is about. It is about what you can do when you have majority ownership. It is not just saying no; it is what you can do—the social security protections and the community service obligations you can work in are what is important about this debate. The Democrats are now showing that they cannot be trusted on Telstra. They have sold out Australian consumers yet again. Labor opposes the Howard government's new price controls: they are unfair, they hurt low- and middle-income Australians and they should be disallowed.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>6258</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I was surprised to see Senator Conroy's name attached to this disallowance motion and then I realised that he has actually got formal responsibility in this chamber.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>9L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator Mackay</name></talker><para>—You don't turn up to estimates, so you wouldn't notice.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Brandis, George (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Brandis)</inline>—Order!

I have to say we should all welcome him and, I suppose, be a bit more tolerant than usual. It is interesting to reminisce about the genesis of this disallowance motion, because this was announced by Mr Crean at the start of the Cunningham by-election. Mr Crean said: `I'm in such a desperate hurry I am going to make Telstra the big issue of the campaign. Here is a classic example for you: how they're ripping off consumers and punishing low-income earners,' and all the things you normally say when you try to scare the pants off people. Then he made it plain that he had not even been to caucus he was so desperate to get this initiative out there, presumably on advice from Lindsay Tanner. I think that is a story in itself because Mr Crean called a door-stop interview last week to respond to Estens and, as you may recall, Mr Tanner had scheduled a press conference for, I think, 2 o'clock and suddenly it was cancelled without warning. Mr Crean came in over the top at 2.30 p.m. Mr Tanner had to be there with him, and Mr Tanner was not allowed to speak. So Mr Tanner is not exactly the flavour of the month. If you look at Kevin Rudd's top 10 shadow ministers, Mr Tanner is not there and, I am afraid, Senator Conroy, nor are you. </para></talk.start></continue><para>When we said that we would not play ball with this silly, shabby little Cunningham by-election stunt, Mr Tanner's response was to say, `Oh, no, it's not drop dead. This is to encourage you to negotiate.' That is what the Democrats have ultimately done, but policy lazy Labor never came near us and never for a moment suggested anything; they just said no. Again, it is symptomatic of a party that has all these very serious internal problems, because Mr Tanner, as we know, has been out there making speeches on a whole range of subjects outside his portfolio but when it comes to this one he is not interested in cutting any deals or talking to anyone; all he is interested in doing is putting out a release that basically misrepresents the position fundamentally while hoping no-one will notice.</para><para>The reality is that we allowed the increases on the recommendation of the ACCC. I think you will find, when you look at the very extensive discussion paper that the Democrats have released today, that the ACCC very carefully analysed some of the problems in the marketplace. One of them relates to competition because, whilst you have an access deficit of around $1.2 billion, you find that the line deficit rental is about 45 per cent of the interconnect charges, which means that Telstra's competitors are actually paying a lot more than they need to pay. So if you have line rebalancing, which the OECD has been promoting for some years and which the ACCC well and truly understands, you actually get a much healthier competitive environment. Of course Labor knows that. That is why this whole exercise is so profoundly dishonest and why it backfired hugely in Cunningham. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator Conroy</name></talker><para>—How many votes did you get in Cunningham?</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESI-DENT</name></talker><para>—Order!

But the end result is you have done nothing; you have been cut out of the deal and the Democrats, of course, have been able to get a little extra. Good luck to them. But the fact is that there was no need for any extra, because these measures are very carefully considered and do contribute very substantially to competition. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The opposition claimed on 19 September that Telstra's customers under the new price controls would have to pay about $100 million a year more on line rentals than they would save on local, STD, IDD and fixed to mobile call costs. That was based on totally fallacious reasoning—and we had an example of it just a few moments ago with Senator Conroy adding a CPI of 3½ to a plus four to say that that was 7.5 real. Of course, that is nothing of the sort. The fact is that people have been getting substantial reductions on a basket of call prices in exchange for a modest increase over a five-year period in line rentals. As we know, that is something about which people have always been able to make a choice. While Senator Conroy likes to pretend that somehow I was not aware of this at the time, I have always been acutely aware that low-volume users were given the option of paying a little bit more on call charges in order to have a $4 a month less line rental charge. That is their choice—and we respect that. The way the Labor Party put it was that these people were suddenly being forced to pay higher call rates—and of course they were not. No-one was obliged to take up that package; it was simply there as an optional extra for those who did not use the service or make all that many calls.  </para><para>Correctly calculated, using constant prices, consumers are in fact better off as a result of the price caps on line rentals and call charges by more than $100 million annually—so precisely the opposite of what the Labor Party like to pretend. The opposition then claimed on 10 October that a research paper presented by the Communications Research Unit on 2 October showed that Telstra would be $170 million better off under the new controls. The paper, as they well know, presented the results of running a computer model based on publicly available data and the researchers' own assumptions. The model was theoretical and very general, covering the industry as a whole. The researchers simply used the Telstra price caps as an illustrative example of how the model might eventually assist policy making. They openly acknowledged the model's limitations. They stated that it was `naive and relatively simple'. In fact, the industry had not previously been given an opportunity to make any informed comments on the model's structure and assumptions.</para><para>The model took no account of some important factors that could significantly affect Telstra's revenues: firstly, the depressed state of the telecommunications market over the past 12 to 18 months, which has reduced the scope for Telstra to achieve revenues theoretically permitted under the price caps; secondly, the fact that, as rebalancing occurs, competitive pressure on Telstra's prices should increase and Telstra's interconnect revenues from competing carriers should fall; and, thirdly, the fact that in most price cap periods, Telstra's prices have been reduced by more than what is required under the caps due to competitive pressures or commercial judgments by Telstra. </para><para>Perhaps most significantly, the paper did not consider the benefits deriving from Telstra's $150 million a year package of products for low-income consumers. That is the very package over which Labor now slams basically the entire welfare sector because there were five leading welfare organisations who signed off on that and who came out and criticised the Labor Party for its shabby and expedient threat to disallow. And, of course, that package is of very significant benefit to low-income consumers.</para><para>The opposition misled the electorate when they suggested that the disallowance would mean the reversal of the recent line rental increases. They well knew—or, if they did not know, they could have obtained advice— that any disallowance was not retrospective and that Telstra would not be required to reverse its price changes if the determination were disallowed. But, of course, they were not going to tell that to the people in Cunningham or to the electorate at large. Contrary to their claims, disallowance would have had serious, adverse consequences. It would mean the revival of price caps put in place over three years ago that are no longer relevant or appropriate and that are potentially damaging to competition. This includes price caps that would give very little scope for reduction of the access deficit—so a fundamental chilling of competition. It would give assistance to low-spend consumers—in other words, people who might have holiday homes and only make occasional calls— rather than targeting low-income earners who ought to be the ultimate beneficiaries of low income—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>9L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>LD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name></talker><para>—You do not understand the difference, Senator Mackay?

That, of course, would have gone out of the window. Controls on directory assistance charges would no longer have applied. There would have been no controls at all on Telstra's prices after 30 June next year beyond those applying under trade practices law. Disallowance would have meant the loss of some very important low-income initiatives such as the new low-rental HomeLine Budget product and the expansion of pensioner concessions. These initiatives would no longer have been tenable and therefore would need to have been withdrawn.</para><para>I think the Democrats understood all that. Telstra has specifically designed product offerings for a group of over 340,000 holders of the low-income health care card. Telstra will offer a product with a rental that is $2 less per month than the standard residential line rental, which will not increase in real terms. Telstra will also offer substantially discounted connection charges to this low-income group.</para><para>These are the additional benefits that the Democrats can quite rightly say result from their taking this seriously. They are not the result of political posturing where you get out and pretend that somehow you are going to act to the benefit of low-income earners but you do absolutely nothing about it. That, I think, is really where Labor continues to be absolutely exposed. Senator Conroy said it all when he said: `Telstra's huge profits constitute no justification for these measures.' In other words, because he thinks that Telstra is making a lot of money, he could not care less about competition. He could not care less about line rebalancing or excess deficits. These issues are not too difficult to get your head around if you are prepared to do some homework on them. But ignore the ACCC, play the populist card, think you can appeal to low-income earners and the end result is that you come a huge cropper. That is what has happened here. Of course we are not in the business of giving handouts to Telstra; we are in the business of having a much fairer and competitive regime. I think the Democrats have comprehensively demolished all of Labor's arguments in the paper that they put out today. </para><para>Let us be quite clear: HomeLine Budget and other packages are part of the options available to people that give them more flexibility. Labor, presumably, would use the ministerial power of direction to stop those sorts of options being available because Labor somehow think that these people are being forced to pay higher call charges. Once again they would put Telstra in a straitjacket. We know that they would break it up. We know that they are in favour of structural separation, so we know that they would keep some poor pathetic part of the utility service in government ownership and sell off all the rest. Of course they would not let Telstra sell off NDC. Of course they would not let Telstra get into more foreign adventures, as they see them. They would not let them get into any media enterprise activities. They would have them stick to carriage and not content. Once again you would have the Labor Party hell-bent on crippling a great Australian company. For what purpose? To suit the ideological prejudices of those who really call the shots in the Labor Party. The CEPU and the other unions presumably write most of this material and they do not want to understand the benefits of rebalancing, which is so fundamental to health and competition in telecommunications. So I am pleased that, with the assistance of the Democrats, sanity has prevailed. Once again it shows the total irrelevance of the Labor Party, who are too lazy to do any serious work on the subject, and they of course will continue to get what they deserve. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>6262</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am not surprised that Senator Conroy fled the chamber as soon as his speech finished because I am sure he did not want to endure the reality of having his fanciful claims smashed aside for their tissue paper thin reasoning. It is a bit of a shame. I do not know whether the story the minister tells about this issue appearing in the first place is correct, but perhaps Senator Conroy has just been stuck in the position of having to be the mouthpiece for Mr Tanner's original miscalculation. </para></talk.start><para>This is an important issue—political point scoring aside—because it does involve Australian consumers in their millions. It is a complex issue. It can be frustrating, I am sure, for the public or the media when you have got some shadow minister coming along waving around a piece of paper and saying that these new controls relay an extra $100 million profit for Telstra. It is not until you actually explore the reasoning and the rationale and calculations behind that that you discover that not only does it not give extra money for Telstra but it actually gives an extra $115-odd million to the consumer. The public just says, `One mob say this; the other mob say that—who can tell?' The Democrats have done the work. We have worked extensively to get the data, some of which is not publicly available. The data about household incomes is not available to Telstra, for a very good reason, because there would be significant privacy implications. That is also why rushing in with a quick position is irresponsible.</para><para>Senator Conroy had another swipe at ACOSS, saying that they just supported the GST and they are supporting this—say no more. Of course ACOSS did not support the final GST package, and this is just a cheap slur by the ALP.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>9L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator Mackay</name></talker><para>—Neither did you!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT6</name.id><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name></talker><para>—Neither did I— that is quite right. That is why I know that ACOSS also did not support it. So just simply to say that ACOSS supported something when they did not, and then to try to extrapolate and say that you can ignore them now because they supported something when they did not, shows the weakness of Senator Conroy's argument. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Of course it is not just ACOSS; it is a range of other groups. It is Anglicare, it is the Smith Family, it is the Salvation Army, it is Jobs Australia, it is the Council on the Ageing, it is the Federation of Homeless Organisations—and they have worked on this for 18 months in what is a complex area. It is such a mix of different baskets of prices going up and down and different household incomes and different groups and different social frameworks and different household structures that of course it is complex. That is why you listen to the people that did the work. </para><para>I am sure that Senator Conroy normally would not dispute the intentions and motivations of organisations like ACOSS and others. The whole group—the Low-Income Measures Assessment Committee—worked for months and months with the sole aim of protecting low-income people. They had therefore already produced an updated, very effective package of $150 million extra assistance for low-income people. It is quite clear that the package as it now stands, which Labor is trying to disallow, and the changes that are coming in, which Labor is trying to stop, will already make most low-income people better off. It will provide them with a choice, if their individual circumstances make it desirable to choose a different package, that will ensure they are not worse off. </para><para>But the Democrats did recognise that there could still be a small group of low-income people who might be slightly worse off. In total there is no doubt the majority would have been better off, but we like to ensure that everybody will be better off. With the extra package that the Democrats have now consulted about we are very confident that we have managed to achieve as close as you can get to nobody being worse off with that extra $10 million on top of the existing $150 million package that Telstra is already putting forward. That package would also be drastically impacted upon if this disallowance were to go ahead. So the assistance that is already being provided for low-income people would be lost as well. </para><para>What we have here is a motion that would overturn months of work by experts in the welfare sector focused solely at protecting low-income earners. All of that would be thrown out—not only that but there is no alternative model. They are just going to wipe all that clean and say, `Get rid of all that; you go and figure out something else, and we will tell you if we like it.' That is basically what this motion would do.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>7G6</name.id><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator Lundy</name></talker><para>—That's the government's responsibility.

That is our job. That is why we do not simply react and form a policy on the basis of whatever Mr Tanner puts in a press release. We will do the work and assess what is important to the Democrats, which is protecting low-income people. We will ignore cheap political stunts and look at the policy outcome that is best for low-income people. Not only is this best for low-income people; it is best for middle-income people and for the consumer. It improves competition in the industry. It is not just Telstra supporting this change because it gives them extra money. Of course, it does not give them extra money; it gives them less money. But groups like Optus support it because it is better for them and the entire telecommunications industry. It improves the choices for consumers. It ensures that the options for consumers increase. The increased opportunity for a drop in call costs over time for high-usage people, who are not all high-income people, clearly means that they will be better off. Because of the other packages that have been put in place, low-usage people also have options. Let us not forget that a large number of low-usage people are very high-income earners. So we have the ALP wanting to assist high-income earners, who use extra phones because of the low-line rentals—the extra fax line or the phone in the holiday shack—and willing to throw aside a whole package of measures that assist low-income people.</para></talk.start></continue><para>What is so absurd about what is being done is that a quick knee-jerk response by the ALP—based on inadequate research, no checking with people who know and no seeking out the data or double-checking whether they know their facts—has stuck them in a spot where they feel the need to continue down a path when I presume they know that what they are doing goes against their supposed rationale. You cannot argue against the rationale of what Senator Conroy said he was doing. The trouble is that what he says he is doing in this motion is not achieved. The opposite is achieved.</para><para>What the Democrats are about and what we have always been about is looking at each issue on its merits, getting the information from the people who have the facts, doing the work ourselves before we rush to a decision and then ensuring that the outcome is in the interests of the public.

We did an enormous amount of research, and I pay particular tribute to the staff member who did a large majority of it. We consulted with people widely—people who have the same motivation. It was not just a few spivs—to use Senator Conroy's phraseology—off on the side who are interested in making money from consultancies. We do not employ any of those people. We are talking about people who care about low-income people. We are talking about people who care about consumers. We are talking about people who are trying to develop technology in the Australian communications sector, and enhance the opportunity for rolling out broadband quicker and getting better access to better telecommunications services. All of those people understand the industry but come at it from a perspective of what is in the interest of the consumer, what is in the interest of low-income people and what is in the interests of the development of the technology. Then we make a decision. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The Democrats are not, and have never been, interested in simply supporting one side because that is the politically convenient thing of the day. That is why the role the Democrats play is so crucial. We will do our very best. We sometimes make mistakes, like everybody does, or make misjudgments or use incorrect information, but the role, the purpose and the motivation of the Democrats is to ensure that the people we believe are important are considered, and the policies and objectives that we believe are necessary for Australia are reflected where possible, in the legislation and the decisions that this chamber makes. That is why we have prevented a negative outcome for the consumer, for the majority of low-income people and for the telecommunications industry, which is what this disallowance motion would achieve. On top of that, we have achieved an extra positive outcome for low-income people and for low-income health care card holders—in effect, the working poor, who have now also got extra assistance of $10 million. They are the people, broadly speaking, who are most likely to be worse off from this change. Even that small negative of this change we have addressed.</para><para>It is unfortunate if this is the level of understanding of the issues by the Labor Party. If that is going to continue across their responses to all telecommunications issues, then it will be a difficult time in this chamber. There are a lot more broader important issues in relation to telecommunications, information technology and a wide range of other areas that need considered debate. Again, they are complex and significant and they affect a wide range of people and a large number of people and industries. </para><para>The bottom line is that the social impact comes first, particularly for those who are less well off but also through access to information and contact with others in the community. That principle is an important one that is being more widely recognised across all policy areas. On top of that is the economics—what it will mean for the industry and future development opportunities for business and competition across the sector, not just for Telstra but for the others.</para><para>I find it hard to figure it out sometimes when one minute Telstra is being whacked around the head, as it often deserves to be, for being this huge massive profit-making entity that is supposedly trying to rip the consumer off everywhere and the next minute it is being lauded as a great Australian company that we could not possibly privatise any further.

Not only have we stopped a bad thing happening for consumers and low-income earners but we have even got an extra 10 million bucks in the process for the working poor.' Thank you, I will take our ability to actually deliver outcomes for low-income people, for the less well-off and for the general community any day—particularly when it is balanced against a party that comes in here and dares to say, `Trust us on privatisation; trust us on trying to look after low-income people.'

We have Senator Bartlett basically sounding like Senator Alston, defending the government and bagging the Labor Party, saying that we have no policies et cetera. I expected Senator Bartlett to start talking towards the end of his speech about how we were all union officials. At least he did not quite go that far. He obviously has not read the options paper by Mr Tanner just as the minister has not read the Estens report nor the press release. What Senator Bartlett did not do—and I am sure that Senator Cherry will be able to enlighten us when he makes his contribution—is find out exactly where the figures came from. The figures that Senator Bartlett disparages actually came from the department. The Labor Party did not pull them out of thin air; they are departmental figures and that is the reality. The $100 million figure came from the department.</para><para>I interjected on Senator Cherry about the ACA and he just wrinkled his nose, not particularly interested in the ACA, so clearly they are not the flavour of the month. I am sure he loves ACOSS, because they supported the GST. I am quite serious. I think this is a softener for the Democrats to change their position on Telstra. There has been a change in the person who deals with the portfolio. I have got an enormous amount of respect for Senator Allison, and I wish that she had stayed in that portfolio after this performance. This is a softener in relation to the Democrats' position on Telstra. Senator Bartlett made it very clear that Telstra will not be sold in this parliament. We will wait and see because there was the never-ever GST, which he had the courage not to support—unlike this. He had the courage and, as I have said, I thought better of him. </para><para>Let us go to some of the points that Senator Alston made, because there is no point in picking on the Democrats—if they are going to act like puppets, who cares. No wonder Senator Alston did not recognise Senator Conroy in relation to whom he represented in the chamber, because he did not even bother turning up to the last Senate estimates. He was in Stockholm. What was he doing in Stockholm? I reckon he might have been scoping for another job the way he has been performing recently. Maybe that is the kind of posting that he wants. As for the absolutely nauseating sycophancy that we heard from the minister—as they say in the classics, it was deja vu in terms of the nauseating sycophancy we heard in relation to the GST and in relation to Senator Lees and other people who have been involved in deals. It is either absolutely nauseatingly sycophantic or it is total sledging. Senator Alston never manages to get the balance totally right. I would say to Senator Alston, who is not here because he is not very interested—and we all know that he is bored out of his brain and wants another job—is that at least we had the courage to stand a candidate in Cunningham; there was no Liberal candidate. So do not come in here and accuse us of lack of intestinal fortitude. Also, the minister was wrong. Mr Tanner has met with the Democrats in relation to this matter on several occasions, obviously to no avail. So here we go again.</para><para>The deal was done by the Democrats because Labor raised this issue to start with. That is why. If we had not, nothing would have happened. The Democrats would have sat there and nothing would have happened. The Democrats wanted to opportunistically rush through a pretty shabby and pathetic deal to get some kind of glory for themselves. The Democrats' paper that was issued to support this decision is a joke. The Democrats are shamelessly trying to rid themselves of any social equity concerns whatsoever. The Australian Democrats claim that local calls have come down since 1997-98 and ignore the fact that they remained the same under Telstra's new price rises and, in fact, went up in one package. It is extremely disappointing, but not unexpected, that the Democrats have used their votes to sell out to this government for a mere $10 million, and I make the point that the figures actually came from the department itself. I do not say this lightly, but I now genuinely doubt whether the Democrats will stick to their commitment to no further sale of Telstra. Nobody has been more committed than the Labor Party—and Senator Lundy and I in particular—in relation to ensuring that the majority of Telstra remains in public hands.</para><para>Australian consumers will remember this every time they pay their phone bills, and thanks to the Australia Democrats for delivering the coalition's price line rental hikes to them—thank you very much. Every time Australians pay their bills, they will be able to say, `Thank you very much,' to the Democrats. In contrast to the coalition and the Democrats, Labor is saying that renting a telephone line should not be allowed to become a privilege only for those who can afford Telstra's high prices. It is crystal clear to Labor senators that the Howard government is basically doing this to fatten Telstra up for privatisation. It is a hugely profitable company and Senator Conroy has already made that point extensively. He covered a lot of figures. I do not know whether you were listening, Senator Bartlett, to what Senator Conroy said.</para><para>We do not agree with the coalition that a telephone is an optional luxury for those who can afford it. The coalition does not seem to understand that a telephone is an essential service. If this motion were successful, which it clearly is not going to be now, Telstra would be forced to revert back to the fairer 2001 price control regime until July 2003, allowing a better price regime to be negotiated. Senator Bartlett comes in here and says, `Let's be reasonable. Let's come up with some alternatives.' If you had not intended to vote this disallowance down, Senator Bartlett, it would have given us the time between now and July 2003 and you could have done a better deal than the deal you have done today. You might have got $12 million instead of $10 million but you sold out for $10 million. We believe that this new price control regime is totally unfair and this disallowance, which is now obviously not going to get through, would have been a much fairer way to ensure that that outcome could have been achieved. </para><para>I hope Senator Cherry in his contribution will enlighten the Senate as to precisely where he got his figures from. If they came from Telstra and the department, I have to say that you have fallen for the old three card trick yet again, Senator Cherry.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT6</name.id><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator Bartlett</name></talker><para>—You used the old figures.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>9L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator MACKAY</name></talker><para>—That is right.

I will just say this to Senator Bartlett: if the Democrats or the radical centre—or whatever you attempt to call yourselves these days—want to deal themselves back into the game, they should try to make the price of the deal a bit higher than this. Senator Lees, for whom I actually have a lot of personal respect, at least managed to extract a bit more than $10 million, and we are not even talking about new money. What is this really about?</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT6</name.id><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator Bartlett</name></talker><para>—It is new money.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>9L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator MACKAY</name></talker><para>—It is not new money. Telstra's press release makes it very clear that it is not new money; it is rebadged money, rephased money or whatever Orwellian euphemism you wish to use. I am very curious and I would like Senator Cherry in his contribution to advise us on this: what is the political underlay here? What is going on here? Why are you doing this? Is this a pathetic attempt to become the radical centre, to deal yourselves back into the game? I would have thought that you would have learnt your lesson on that under the leadership of Senator Bartlett, because he had the courage to oppose some of the government's measures. But I guess that is the price of leadership.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In conclusion, I just think that you cannot expect anything better from Senator Alston. He does not even bother to read his own Estens inquiry report. You cannot expect anything from him. He is on the way out. He is bored. He is looking for another posting. He would be lucky to get to New Zealand. However, we hope he stays, because he is great for the cause of keeping Telstra in public hands. He is great. Every time he says something, the Prime Minister comes in and contradicts him and we have another four or five questions in both chambers. We are quite happy for Senator Alston to remain here. However, I have to say that this deal by the Democrats is very disappointing. It is absolutely pathetic, and if this is a portent of things to come then good luck to Meg Lees in terms of forming a new party.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>6268</page.no><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator CHERRY</name><name.id>00A9C</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am pleased that Senator Mackay and Senator Lundy are in the chamber today, because I am quite happy and quite proud to defend my party's social justice principles.

We will see what comes out of the little deal being negotiated between Mr Swan and Minister Vanstone at the moment over whether or not we defend the rights of sole parents. As Senator Bartlett pointed out, it was disappointing to watch the Labor Party vote for a billion dollar tax cut in capital gains tax for high-income earners, so I am not going to be lectured on social justice by people from the Labor opposition.</para></talk.start><para>The important thing about the package that we have put together today is that we have taken the sound economic analysis of the ACCC, in terms of the rebalancing proposals they produced last year, which recognised that such proposals produce good, solid outcomes for consumers, and we have dealt with the problem area that that created. That problem was the issue of low-income, low-usage telecommunications consumers. We said to Telstra and to the government, `You've made some progress in dealing with the issue of low-income, low-usage consumers, but too many people fall outside the boundary of your concessions.' We told them that they had to fix that. They came back and they found $10 million of new money and, lo and behold, we now have extra concessions for 341,000 households. That is something which the Democrats can be very proud of. With the package we are talking about today, we have delivered the economic benefits identified by the ACCC in their report last year and incorporated them into the new price control proposals—plus, in terms of the package we are presenting today, we are delivering the social equity of dealing with the group that fell through the cracks, namely the low-income, low-usage households. I want to deal very briefly with some of the figures that Senator Conroy referred to earlier on. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT6</name.id><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator Bartlett</name></talker><para>—Senator Conroy has already gone.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>00A9C</name.id><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator CHERRY</name></talker><para>—I am not surprised that he has gone. Senator Conroy is someone I usually have a great deal of respect for in the figures department. He is very good on figures. On the Senate Economics References Committee, he always knows his figures. However, on this particular occasion, his figures seem to have gone a bit haywire. Let us start from one particular point of view with the $170 million figure that he produced from the departmental paper. That was a first working paper based on a new model being developed by the department.</para></talk.start></continue><para>There are three fundamental problems with that $170 million, which I am disappointed that Senator Conroy did not identify in his usual analytical and thorough way. The first problem is that the first $40 million of that money was from the reduction of the X factor, the minus CPI factor, from 5.5 to 4.5. That is obviously going to have some impact, but the key thing is that mobile phones have been taken out of that package. Why have they been taken out? Because the ACCC identified that mobile phones are in a competitive market and the vast bulk of the price reductions that occurred under the previous price control regime were in the mobile phone situation. That is why the actual market has been developing those outcomes—because people shift between carriers all the time. That is what the ACCC has said, that is what the market is saying and that is what the telecommunications carriers are saying.</para><para>The second problem that comes through is the $80 million which allegedly was going to come from the increase in line rentals. Again, this fails to compare with the current situation. Under the current balancing, the subcaps, Telstra is allowed to balance line rental increases against call increases to come up with a CPI minus zero effect. That particular aspect of the current package is something which the Labor Party really has not considered adequately. Listening to Senator Conroy, I noted there was a great long list of increases in line rentals that Telstra has been able to achieve under the current price control regime—the one that he wants to reinstate if this one falls over. I find it extraordinary that the Labor Party can come in here and put up a whole list of reasons as to why we should be voting for a disallowance so we can return to the system creating the problems Senator Conroy was pointing to in the first place. So that particular part of the analysis also falls over.</para><para>The third problem with the analysis is that $50 million of that $170 million came from an assumption that mobile phone prices would rise in the absence of price caps. The reason why the price caps are being removed from mobile phones is that they are reducing by significantly less than inflation in terms of price costs, and have been over the longer term. It is worth noting that, over the last 11 years of price caps, Telstra has failed to increase the cap in eight of those 11 years. The price cap regime of CPI plus or minus X was introduced by a Labor government in 1989 and has worked quite well in terms of delivering reasonable price outcomes for all of that period. </para><para>I am pleased that Senator Conroy has now returned to the chamber. The fundamental problem with Senator Conroy's and Labor's figures is the treatment of this terrible thing which they seem to have forgotten about, called `inflation'. All of the price cap regimes, in terms of the price caps that have been in place since 1989, deal with a CPI plus or minus X factor, which I am sure that Senator Conroy would appreciate. But the Labor Party seem to have forgotten this in their analysis, because they only deal with the X. They have forgotten about the CPI component. They have forgotten about the fact that, when you are looking at the new price cap regime, you should compare it with the old price cap regime.</para><para>The old price cap regime allowed for a balancing of sorts between line rentals and call costs to come up with a subquota of CPI plus or minus zero. When you take that figure into account, the Labor Party's figures rapidly turn around. The Labor Party's figure of $100 million, which Telstra is supposedly gaining, comes from taking Telstra's call revenue of $4.9 billion a year—CPI minus 4.5 allegedly results in a loss of $84 million. Then you take their line cost revenue of $2.7 billion. CPI plus four per cent is $186 million; $186 million minus $85 million is $101 million. That is what the Labor Party is claiming is going to happen, but that is in nominal terms. The proper analysis—the analysis done by the ACCC, by the Productivity Commission, by every person, including the Labor Party itself when it was in government—deals with these issues in real terms, because it is a CPI plus or minus factor. You do that, and that $101 million profit for Telstra turns into a $113 million profit for the consumers. In fact, if you correct that further by taking out the figures that the Labor Party failed to take out in terms of the wholesale interconnect figures which are stuck into these ones, you come up with a $115 million gain for consumers.</para><para>You have to compare it with what is happening now: every increase in these line rentals—these ones Senator Conroy was complaining about—is able to be put into place under the current cap because call prices are being reduced in real terms. They are not being, and have not been, reduced in nominal terms, but they have been reduced in real terms. That is how the averaging of the price caps comes into play. It is disappointing on this particular occasion. The Labor Party have based their position on a misunderstanding of the application of inflation to the price capping regime and also a whole range of assumptions in terms of some modelling coming out of a very early, preliminary stage of some seminars within the department.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>7G6</name.id><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator Lundy</name></talker><para>—Before they got the politics right!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>00A9C</name.id><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator CHERRY</name></talker><para>—Before they got the politics right!

This equity measure supplements Telstra's $150 million package, Access for Everyone, announced in April this year. That included the rebalancing of money, as Senator Mackay correctly pointed out, from those low-usage, high-income people, who were getting about 90 per cent of the previous B10 program, I think it was, towards genuine low-income, low-usage individuals, particularly pensioners, who of course will pick up an extra $3 a month in terms of their rebates. </para><para>The key elements of the package announced today in terms of eligibility are that the package will extend new concessions to low-income health care card holders who are eligible for up to 12 months—even though, of course, health care cards are only issued every six months. So they actually only have to validate their eligibility on an annual basis. The connection fee will be reduced for this group from $59 to $33, to be amortised over 12 months, which will help the cash-flow pressures on low-income earners forming new households. The line rental will be reduced by $2 from the standard package, with a local call cost of 24c. Line rental increases for this particular package for low-income earners will be fixed at CPI, so over time they will be doing a lot better than they are doing from day one. Other calls—STD, fixed to mobile and international calls—are tagged at no more than 15 per cent higher than home line complete rates. Of course, they must decrease by 4.5 per cent per annum in real terms. Telstra has also agreed to better publicise its bill assistance program to financially vulnerable consumers and to trial a service option to advise consumers on the packages best suited to their call demands.</para><para>The Democrats are satisfied that these pricing arrangements for Telstra will deliver a fairer deal for more low-income groups than current arrangements do. We are also satisfied that the repackaging proposal in terms of the price control mechanism will deliver a better deal for consumers overall than the current price control mechanism so criticised by Senator Conroy in his earlier speech. If the ALP were serious in their concern for low-income households then this is precisely the sort of thing that they should have been doing, but I have now listened to two speeches in this debate and am yet to hear what the Labor Party's alternative was going to be.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator Conroy</name></talker><para>—The existing price cap!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>00A9C</name.id><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator CHERRY</name></talker><para>—That is the one you do not like, the one that you are criticising, which allows Telstra to offset all the reductions in mobile phone charges and actually use that to increase line rentals. It has comprehensively failed. Price controls are a complex area of public policy, which would be very clear to anybody listening to the ALP's contribution so far, and they are not amenable to simple analysis. But the key difficulty is that it is impossible to predict the effects of new price controls on each household. To do that requires knowledge of household income and call usage patterns, and that data is often not available. Moreover, phone call usage is not well correlated to income levels. The primary factors in call usage are of course social networks and the numbers in a household. In real terms, the new price control determination represents a net benefit to consumers of approximately $115 million a year. However, the benefits are not evenly distributed, and of course we acknowledge there will be winners and there will be losers.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator Conroy</name></talker><para>—Oh, there'll be losers!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>00A9C</name.id><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator CHERRY</name></talker><para>—The `winners' are those who make a high number of calls, particularly STD, international and fixed to mobile people, those ATUG consumers.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT6</name.id><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator Bartlett</name></talker><para>—High-income earners, Senator Conroy, like those you helped out with the business tax!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>00A9C</name.id><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator CHERRY</name></talker><para>—Can I have some order from Senator Bartlett! As local calls are currently delivered at about cost price, there is likely to be no significant reduction until the removal of the access deficit starts to kick in. There is a correlation between household income and total telecommunications expenditure. However, phone line usage is not at all well correlated with income. There is no evidence to suggest that high-income households are more or less likely to have higher fixed-line expenditure. The higher telecommunications spend in high-income households reflects a greater diversity of telecommunications products. Low-spend consumers tend to have smaller social networks—for example, they have no children—and consequently high-wealth suburbs have a higher proportion of low-spend lines than battling suburbs.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator Conroy</name></talker><para>—How embarrassing!</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT6</name.id><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator Bartlett</name></talker><para>—It is embarrassing to help the high-income earners.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>00A9C</name.id><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator CHERRY</name></talker><para>—Yes, it is terribly embarrassing to help the high-income earners.

The figures actually make sense when you start to work through them. The usage figures—the work that was done by the ACCC last year—appear to have escaped the notice of the ALP in this argument. In real terms, net gains for consumers will be around $115 million. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The ALP has relied on a nominal model that ignores the effects of inflation. Quite simply, the ALP model is naive in economic terms. It is very disappointing, Senator Conroy. The model essentially says that Telstra can put its prices up by the CPI, plus or minus whatever the basket requirements are, but no-one else is compensated for inflation. All Centrelink customers, for example, are compensated for CPI annually or biannually, depending on the program. Moreover, while award wage pay rates are not typically adjusted by reference to CPI, increases are designed to capture likely CPI movements— say over two to three years—through national wage cases et cetera. It is common to have clauses in certified agreements saying that, if the CPI has moved ahead of a predicted rate, the parties will revisit the rate specified in that agreement. That is, for most Australians the effects of price control are already expressed in real terms.</para><para>In terms of the local calls and the line rental nexus, in previous determinations local calls and line rentals were in a CPI minus zero basket. According to the ALP, this meant local calls were required to be reduced by the amount related to line rental increases. This is of course not correct. Just assume that line rentals and calls were 50 per cent each— and that is not too far off the mark. Then it is obvious that if CPI were, say, three per cent Telstra could increase line rental by six per cent and calls by zero per cent, and it would have met the target without a change in local calls. That is pretty much what has happened in recent years. That is another reason that the opposition's arguments in this debate have been somewhat off the mark.</para><para>In terms of fairness to low- and middle-income earners, the key equity elements in the previous price controls were the caps on two baskets—the bottom 10 per cent and the bottom 50 per cent of bills. These were notorious for providing benefits to holiday shacks and fax lines because of low usage. Analysis provided to Telstra suggested that 90 per cent of the B10 category were in the top 90th percentile of household income and 50 per cent of the B50 category were not in the bottom 50 per cent of income.

As discussed above, the effects of price caps are dependent on actual call usage and not on income. Households with relatively high use of STD, fixed to mobile and international calls will definitely be better off. Those with relatively high levels of local calls may not benefit to the same extent. This means that the onus will increasingly fall on customers to self-select the right package for their call usage patterns. We have sought in all of this to ensure that there are more options for customers to choose from, to ensure that they get the right package for their respective usage patterns.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The Democrats acknowledged that we needed to ensure that the Access for Everyone package was broadened out to include more low-income groups. That is why we have negotiated this additional package to pick up more groups who were not picked up by the previous package.

In summary, looking at what we have been trying to work through with this debate, it is a very complicated debate involving a whole range of economic offsets and economic discussions. It has been a debate that has been very important in discussing the future competitive nature of telecommunications. I hate to admit that from time to time the minister is right, but the reduction of interconnect charges, which the rebalancing will allow, is a very important component of delivering more competitive telecommunications into the future. That is why the non-Telstra carriers are so keen on this package—because it will actually result in a reduction in interconnect charges which will allow them, over time, to be more competitive and keep more pressure on Telstra to keep their prices down. That is called the market; the market actually occasionally works.</para></talk.start></continue><para>It is deeply disturbing to me to see the once great Labor Party in opposition becoming less and less attached to economic reality, economic analysis and figures, social justice, the importance of competition and the importance of all the things which previous governments held to be important.

It is a good debate, and I commend Senator Conroy for initiating this debate because it is a good opportunity to analyse the price control mechanisms and to work out whether they are, in fact, in Australia's interests. We have concluded that they are. We acknowledge that there was a difficulty in terms of low-usage low-income households.

I think it was all summed up in Senator Cherry's contribution when he said, `The minister is right.' What we have just heard is the most pathetic vindication I have ever heard of the government's position in relation to upping these costs and pricing of Telstra and how they charge consumers. </para></talk.start><para>I would go so far as to reflect on the comments of Senator Cherry and his obvious devotion to the effective workings of the telecommunications market in this country. Let us look at the evidence of this out there. We can see how well it is working because even the Estens inquiry—whitewash as it was—highlighted some problems that are occurring out there. We know that by virtue of the thousands upon thousands of consumers who continually complain about poor treatment by Telstra and the fact that we do not have telecommunications competition in rural and regional Australia. That is the testimony of the market that you support, that you say will provide the answers. What we have seen from the coalition government is that they are incapable of regulating telecommunications in this country effectively to create competition where it is needed most. They have had over six years to do it and they keep making mistake after mistake.</para><para>Here we have the Democrats, the neophytes of telecommunications policy, in here today telling us that they think that the minister is right, that they subscribe to the dodgy maths that the minister has laid out before them. We have heard pathetic quote after pathetic quote of rubbery figures which they present as some sort of substantiation for what is the most significant sell-out in telecommunications policy that I have heard from the Democrats in my time in this place. That is not to say that there have not been other major sell-outs. The sell-out of the GST in the middle of the election campaign—at that crucial time—changed the way that poor people and the underprivileged in this country would be disadvantaged under the tax system. </para><para>That is your legacy. That is the legacy of the Democrats and today we have seen a blueprint on how this political party is going to sell out on telecommunications policy from this point onwards. So get used to it, out there. This is the blueprint. Thank you very much, Senator Cherry. Thank you very much, Senator Bartlett, for making it very clear to the Labor opposition—the only party that will stay true to not privatising Telstra and that will stay true to protecting consumers in the telecommunications market.  </para><para>I would like to reflect a little on the use of figures by Senator Cherry. He talked about the $170 million departmental calculation as somehow being a flawed figure and an early estimate. If that is not spitting out the minister's spin, I don't know what is! That is what I mean by politics. Once they realised that the facts were out there, their little feet started scurrying around in the department and there were phone calls between Telstra and the minister's office to get their line right. But guess what? There's someone else on the conference call now between Telstra and the minister's office—it is the Democrats. `Quick, tell us how we can get out of this one. How do we substantiate? How do we talk our way out of the fact that Telstra stands to gain $170 million from this exercise in increased line rentals and other changes, such as the relaxing and removal of the price cap regime?'</para><para>I think it needs to be explained that disallowing this regulation will force the government to go back to the drawing board and prepare a fairer price cap arrangement. That is what Labor is trying to do today. We are asking for support of the crossbench and the Democrats—we know it is not forthcoming from the Democrats—to force the government to do something better. We do not want this weak, mild, sycophantic, pathetic $10 million extra when we now know there is no extra money involved. It is a little bit of dodgy rebadging. We are used to that from the coalition government. I did not think the Democrats would so easily succumb to such smoke and mirror tactics. I think they have made it very clear that they are happy just to be seen to be doing a deal with the government on this. I think this is to try and deal themselves back into telecommunications policy—after all, they have so little to go on anywhere else.</para><para>I would also like to comment on the issue of line rentals and the focus on the increase that Telstra proposed on line rentals. Line rentals is perhaps the most tangible representation of Telstra's monopoly in telecommunications. It is there. It is what no-one else can touch and if Telstra are allowed to put up prices on that it can only improve their bottom line. You can subscribe to all of the access deficit theories and rebalancing theories. The bottom line is that, notwithstanding all of that, it is the line rental that is the most tangible representation of Telstra's monopolistic hold on the local loop. That is the one pricing mechanism that they have that no other carrier has. No-one else can charge line rental, and to allow them to increase that continues to reinforce their monopolistic place and their grip on the market. I think that very point has been lost in any discussion—from the ACCC to the department, to the government and now to the Democrats—when you are considering what constitutes a competitive environment in telecommunications in this country. </para><para>The other point I would like to make relates to another campaign and the use of pair gains in the telecommunications network. I was browsing through some of the many thousands of emails I have received from consumers, not only in rural and regional Australia but also in metropolitan Australia, who cite the fact that they are sick and tired of being ripped off in such a way that they ask for a second line—a line that they pay full rental on, and which now costs an additional $3 dollars per month, so they are paying extra money for it—and they do not even get that extra line. This is the precise frustration for those who use the telecommunications system for Internet connectivity. A pair gain does not provide an additional line for the purpose of getting a connection speed that makes using the World Wide Web meaningful; a pair gain means that one line is split. Telstra charges people not on the basis of a piece of copper running from the exchange into their homes but on the basis of dial tone. That dial tone can come from one copper pair, and that copper pair could be split up in a number of ways. Telstra charge line rental—and the words here are very important—for dial tone.</para><para>The added, I guess, salt in the wound, twist of the knife in the back of consumers, is that while Telstra and the government, and now the Democrats, are collaborating to push up line rental at the expense of consumers' interests, there are millions of consumers out there who are astounded and outraged to find that their so-called `new line' on which they are paying line rental is not even that; it is just more dial tone backed on the end of their existing line through a pair gain system. This is, I have to say, relevant if you use the Internet and dial-up connections. The core of the point is that the Democrats argue that these are the kinds of issues that we should be focusing on—the Internet, connectivity and new technologies in telecommunications—and yet this, to me, is about that. The very issue that we are debating—the capacity to charge line rentals on what is not a full line anyway—really needs to be addressed at this point in time. I think the Democrats have ignored some of these key issues. </para><para>I refer briefly to some of the minister's comments. Predictably, the minister's contribution to this debate focused primarily on the politics. He came in here and had a bit of a rave about the Cunningham by-election and about the government saying that it is going to improve telecommunications competition, and what is everyone else going to do, and how great it is to be so chummy with the Democrats; but he did not bother spending time talking about the issues of competition policy. He left that up to Senator Cherry. Clearly, the brief was slipped across the chamber so that Senator Alston could do what he normally does, which is to sort of dip a foot into the debate from the point of view of just talking about the politics and having a bit of a go at Labor—his normal tactic. He did not really go to the substance or the core of the issue. He did not address any of the questions that the Labor Party has raised specifically, and certainly did not take on any of the very valid points that Mr Tanner has raised in the context of this debate. He showed absolutely nothing but contempt for the Labor Party's request that the government start again and do better, and not to work as Telstra's second-hand person in conveying their interests in this place. I have to say, the same message goes across to Senator Cherry. It is so disappointing.</para><para>The only way we are going to have effective telecommunications competition in this country is for politicians to rise above the spin that Telstra spits out. That is the only way we are going to make a difference. You can have the Besley inquiry and the Estens inquiry, and you can look at the substance of those and try and work with very weak and whitewashy recommendations, but the only way we are going to improve telecommunications in this country is for the politicians to take an interest and rise above the vested interests, and not be prepared to come in here and act as patsys on behalf of the corporate representation of Telstra. Clearly, that has not been the case. I say to the Democrats that they have one opportunity to right what they are presenting here, and that is to change their mind and support Labor's motion. I cannot see that it is going to happen. </para><para>I would like to close by saying that in relation to this disallowance motion Minister Alston has taken no time to present a cogent case or a reasonable understanding of what the government is trying to achieve. They have presented a package of price caps that does nothing except, I think, advantage Telstra in the marketplace. It absolutely slates consumers. Whatever justification there is on the consumer package, we know that is just some sort of sop to try and get some PR points out of the whole exercise, but it is not going to wash. Labor's position is the only way that we can draw the government to account on these matters. The only way we can draw them to account is to force the coalition to go back to the drawing board, address the genuine consumer concerns—not allow consumers to be slugged another $9 a quarter and leave them vulnerable on other pricing issues—and come back with a package that addresses not only our concerns but also starts to look at the bigger picture about how it helps Telstra perpetuate their monopolistic hold on most aspects of the fixed line telecommunications network in this country.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>6275</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In closing the debate, I thank all the contributors who have spoken today—even the minister and his acolyte—</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>9L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator Mackay</name></talker><para>—The mini-minister.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name></talker><para>—The mini-minister—thank you, Senator Mackay—because he did actually do much better.

That is what happens in non-competitive markets, where you get to put up the same fees and charges—just like the banks—with no scrutiny, no capping and no serious ACCC attention.

Did they just tell you, `It was an early working draft, don't you worry about that; it's really too hard to work it out for ourselves'?</para><para>If I were a Democrat member right now, I would be seriously considering my position. They had hopes that Senator Bartlett would lead them back to something resembling a progressive position, but, no, that radical centre is still running the show in Canberra.

By way of introduction, I observe that there are no requirements for the review to be public, to seek submissions, to engage in debate or to take account of evidence submitted to it. The bill requires that the review process consult only the Commonwealth and the states and persons with expertise in or experience of relevant disciplines. This, of course, does not cover the broad spectrum of interested parties who have participated in this debate to date.</para><para>The object of the legislation is `to address concerns including ethical concerns'. I would suggest that cannot be realised by a review which has no-one representing those perspectives and which has no requirement to consult regarding ethical concerns. Furthermore, clause 25(3) requires that the independent review is to report to COAG. Given that the report will consider and report on the operation of an act of the Commonwealth parliament, it is appropriate a review report to the Commonwealth parliament and not to COAG. </para><para>The effect of the amendment circulated in my name is that it will replace the independent review with a review of a joint committee of the parliament. I submit that it is appropriate that a parliamentary committee review the operation of its own act because there are serious ethical issues that this review needs to take into account. Not only are members of parliament appropriate representatives of community concerns but it is appropriate that legislators have a role in the review of contentious legislation such as this. Just developing that argument in somewhat more detail, as I said, the bill provides for an independent review and a written report to COAG. The review has to have regard only to a limited number of matters, a limited range of possible amendments and has to consult with a limited range of persons. So generally, I would suggest that that review, when acted upon, is not going to be open, accountable or responsible and it will be neither wide nor broad. </para><para>Specifically, I would make the point to the chamber that there are within this industry— for want of a better description—a limited number of experts with expertise in the field. Those experts are scientists, university professors, medical researchers but in total—as it became clear in the evidence to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee inquiring into the bill, which is the subject of discussion today—there are a limited number of persons involved in this industry and a limited number of people with expertise. The indications are that there is a limited pool from which to draw upon. </para><para>We suggest that the review, occasioned by the provision of the bill, will have no regard to ethical considerations and no regard to the activities of licensed entities that might be granted a licence to engage in activity pursuant to this bill. It was quite apparent at the Senate committee that there are a range of participants from the community and a range of speakers who have quite significant interests in this bill and quite significant interests in further scientific research in this field of endeavour. That necessarily leads one to ask: are there vested interests and is there potential for conflict of interest? The sums of money that have been indicated will be granted by the Commonwealth to particular private corporations who might be engaged in research in this field—something in the order of a minimum of $45 million—are huge sums indeed. </para><para>Therefore, I would suggest that the activities of those corporations that are engaging in research are properly the subject of investigation and ongoing review by the Commonwealth and by a committee of the Commonwealth parliament, simply because the Commonwealth parliament is allocating tens of millions of dollars to those corporations. If the Commonwealth were not allocating funds and were simply giving a licence to entities to engage in research, there may well be an argument that they are private corporations, or public corporations, and it is their money, their capital—and how they expend their funds is their business. But when the Commonwealth allocates tens of millions of dollars, I would submit that it is appropriate for the Commonwealth to have an ongoing interest, and an appropriate vehicle for that interest to be demonstrated is via a committee of this parliament.</para><para>My next specific point is that the independent review to be established by this legislation does not have to have any regard to the views of the public. It is clear from what has been going on in this chamber over the past two or three days, from the range of interest groups and individuals who took the trouble to write to the Senate committee or to give evidence, that there is a range of perspectives in this debate and a range of opinions being expressed. A simple reading of the speeches in the second reading debate from all sides of the parliament will show that speakers go right from the beginning of the continuum to the end in their views. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Sitting suspended from 6.30 p.m. to 7.30 p.m.</inline></para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>2L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name></talker><para>—Prior to the break I was providing some reasons for seeking to change the review provision as contained in the Prohibition of Human Cloning Bill and I addressed some general considerations and then was attempting to make some more specific comments. Continuing in that vein, I now want to make the point that in the terms of reference of the independent committee of review there is no instruction or admonishment to have regard to views of the public. Those individuals who are to be consulted are a relatively narrow group of persons, state governments and the like. But there is no requirement to have any contact or consultation with the public. </para></talk.start></continue><para>It is clear from the contributions to the Senate legislation committee and it is clear from the contributions by various persons in this chamber that there is a wide range of divergent viewpoints on a lot of the issues associated with both cloning and the use of embryos. It is fair to comment that the views expressed by various senators across the board have reflected those divergent views or have picked up the arguments and accepted them and then repeated them here.</para><para>My concern is that when the review process is undergone there is no mandatory requirement to seek the views of others outside that narrow group of persons mentioned in clause 25. There is no regard for the interests of church or community groups. There are clearly divided ethical and scientific attitudes. There is no regard for the views of individual members of the public or for them to have the opportunity to make comment. There is no requirement to have regard for public submissions. There is no requirement to seek public submissions. There is no requirement to inquire what the public thinks, and there is no requirement to seek to disclose or publish the views of members of the public or community groups.  </para><para>Any submissions made are not open to query or testing or challenge, and it strikes me that it is almost an obscene process to enter into because it is only through questioning, challenging, testing, engaging in discussion and debate that what truth there is in this discussion can be arrived at. It is one thing for a group of reputable scientists on either side of the debate to put a particular view to a closed inquiry—albeit it an inquiry characterised as independent—but if their views cannot be examined, if they cannot be called into the dock and asked questions, if they cannot be tested by another group of experts, where is the worth in that? What satisfaction can be demonstrated that the process has been open and proper? So that is the criticism: there is no respect and no requirement to consult with members of the community, members of the public.</para><para>My next criticism goes to the role of the NHMRC. It has been created under statute. It is an agency of the Commonwealth. It has great powers. More importantly, it has in this debate the ability to allow the creation of great wealth. Those companies that might be granted licences to engage in research and then engage in trade and commercial development of findings they might make have the potential to create great wealth. We are told that, if the commercial development of findings in the areas of rare and debilitating diseases or body parts transfer or growth of new organs should come to pass, those corporations who hold that interest are going to have great earning capacity and great wealth will go to them. So the NHMRC, in granting a licence, has the power to allocate work and the power to allocate the potential creation of great wealth. It strikes me as odd that, if the NHMRC is the licensing body that grants that authority to particular corporations or companies, it should be in any way involved in, or responsible for, or in charge of, the activities of that review committee. </para><para>I know that in this cloning bill the NHMRC is not particularly identified or singled out as having charge of that. In the embryo bill, for discussion later this evening, the NHMRC is singled out as being in charge of that. I do not say that the NHMRC is in any way wrong in its activities, motivated badly, or malevolent in its deliberations. But, like any other organisation, it is capable of industry capture. It articulates and reflects the views of those persons who participate within its deliberations. </para><para>I would submit that the way to overcome a range of the problems I have identified is to have a parliamentary committee engaging in the review of the act. Clearly, it would be open and accountable. Those who chose to give evidence after being requested to do so would be open to challenge. They would be able to put forward their arguments. More importantly, it is an avenue for the resolution of conflict. It is a vehicle whereby ideas can be tested, challenged and resolved. It would in that way bring together the various interest groups—whether they are scientific, university, private corporations, church groups or individuals—and allow them to come and put their case, present their argument and be tested through the court of public opinion of a parliamentary committee, which is much more aware of and relates to what community values or views might be.</para><para>In the final analysis, such a process or such a committee aids the development of science and research because it offers a protection that the arguments or the ethics that guide scientists are being used properly. I will not go through the arguments again. I suggest that the review provision contained in the bill is deficient for the reasons outlined and the purposes to be achieved by that review committee can better be achieved by the establishment of a standing committee of this parliament to engage in that activity.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>6281</page.no><name role="metadata">Boswell, Sen Ron</name><name role="display">Senator BOSWELL</name><name.id>YE4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>NP</party><role>Leader of the National Party of Australia in the Senate and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am very attracted to Senator Bishop's amendment.

In the bill under discussion, the <inline ref="R1624">Prohibition of Human Cloning Bill 2002</inline>, the review provisions are contained in clause 25(1). It requires that the minister `cause an independent review of the operation of this act' et cetera. The reference to the NHMRC that I made in my argument related to the protection of that organisation not being engaged in conflict. That protection was to be achieved by a parliamentary committee engaged in the review. In this bill there is no suggestion that the NHMRC is tasked to do the review, although of course that is an option open to the minister. In the other bill to be discussed later this evening, the embryo bill, it is the NHMRC which is tasked by clause 47, from memory, to do the job. I put that point on the record. </para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>6282</page.no><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HOGG</name><name.id>7L6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Following on from what Senator Bishop has said, in my speech in the second reading debate I lay down a few issues that were of concern to me and one was the proposal under existing clause 25(2), which states that the review is to be `undertaken by persons chosen by the minister with the agreement of each state'. The way I read that was that if there was not an agreement by each state then it would be difficult to form the committee. People might say that that is not the intent. If that is not the intent, it is certainly the way it read to me. I may well be reading it the wrong way. The second thing that I raised was in respect of clause 25(4), which states: </para></talk.start><quote><para>The persons undertaking the review must consider and report on the scope and operation of this Act taking into account the following:</para><para>(a) developments in technology in relation to assisted reproductive technology;</para><para>(b) developments in medical research and scientific research and the potential therapeutic applications of such research;</para><para>(c) community standards.</para></quote><para>I express the view that that subclause could assume or even presume that changed circumstances in some way will make cloning permissible or respectable. That concern has not been allayed by anything that I have heard in this debate to date. I think that the path being advocated by Senator Bishop is a very good path indeed. It may well be that, ultimately, you could have both forms of review operating in tandem, although that has not been canvassed here tonight. It is not an impossible outcome if this Senate so desired. Looking at the review advocated by Senator Bishop—and I have seen his amendment for the next bill that this chamber will consider—it is clear to me that, on the review process, Senator Bishop has at least tried to establish consistency across the two bills.</para><para>Of course, the thing about Senator Bishop's proposal in respect of the review under clause 25 is that his proposal advocates a joint parliamentary committee. Given the intensity of interest that there has been surrounding this debate, and given the various views that have been expressed either for or against the proposals covered by this debate, one can understand that the ultimate responsibility, the ultimate test, rests undoubtedly, in my view, with this parliament. It is the responsibility of the parliament to be accountable for the transparency of the processes it puts in place. I believe that that accountability and that transparency rest with the proposal that Senator Bishop has raised, because it will take into account all the varying interests that are out there in the community. While the existing proposal in clause 25(4)(c) of the bill looks at community standards, it does not necessarily look at the whole raft of interest groups and individuals who would want to take part in an open and transparent process—there is no guarantee of that under the existing proposal in the bill before us.</para><para>Whilst the proposal is independent of the NHMRC—and that is itself a good thing— there are a number of problems, as I said. The review must be undertaken by persons chosen by the minister with the agreement of each state. That is a real problem, in my view from what I have read to date. The way in which the review seems to be constructed under the existing proposal lends itself to desiring a certain outcome that will favour a watering down of the cloning provisions or favour access to human embryo cloning, which certainly are not available under the bill in its current form. I believe that in the interests of openness, transparency and also good governance the proposal by Senator Bishop warrants merit indeed.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>6282</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Health and Ageing</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank honourable senators for their contributions. As evidenced in the ongoing debate surrounding stem cell research, nobody needs reminding that science is moving incredibly quickly and it is simply not possible to anticipate the developments that may occur in the next three years in the areas of human cloning, reproductive technologies and stem cell research. Recognising that the landscape may change considerably over the next few years, the legislation provides for a comprehensive review of the act within three years. The proposal in the bill is that an independent review be undertaken by persons chosen by the relevant minister with the agreement of each state and territory. The review will involve wide consultation with the Commonwealth and the states and territories and with a broad range of persons with expertise in or experience of relevant disciplines. The results of the review will be put to COAG. </para></talk.start><para>This is entirely appropriate because, as noted by a number of senators in the second reading debate, the Commonwealth bill is only one part of a comprehensive, nationally consistent regulatory scheme, with corresponding legislation in each jurisdiction. It is essential that the states and territories have input into the review and also that the results of the review be considered by all jurisdictions through the COAG process. This does not mean in any way that it precludes the federal parliament from also considering the issues. If the review gives rise to possible amendments to the legislation, any such amendments must come before parliament, and at that time whoever is here will have the opportunity to consider in detail any proposed changes to the legislation.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>7L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Hogg</name></talker><para>—Are you leaving?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>LI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name></talker><para>—No, I am not anticipating leaving, but I never judge things.

At that time, those of us who are here will have the opportunity to consider in detail any proposed changes to the legislation. If it is considered necessary, the issues can also be referred to a committee, as occurred with this bill when it was first introduced. In view of that, I oppose the amendment.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>6283</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I indicate on behalf of the Australian Labor Party that we will also be opposing the amendment. As I have indicated previously, all ALP senators will have a conscience vote and so they will vote according to their own views, but the formal ALP position is to oppose the amendment. Basically, Senator Bishop has put forward an alternative review provision, which is one run by the parliament versus one that is independent of the parliament. It is a perfectly reasonable argument to put, but on balance we prefer the provisions in the bill because of the fact that it arises out of a COAG process. It is a bill that reflects a process arrived at between the Commonwealth and all the states. Part of that COAG agreement was to have a review that is broader than just the work of this parliament and which involves some contributions from the states in the composition of the committee and other matters affecting it. Because of that COAG approach, on balance we say that the review is better being done as envisaged under the provisions of the act.</para></talk.start><para>The other point that I would stress is that it is of course competent for parliament at any time to review any of these issues. One thing that the Senate chamber could not be accused of is not taking its review process seriously by having numerous inquiries into issues that concern senators and the Senate. So it is competent for us to have a review of any of the provisions arising out of this bill or any activities that are conducted under this bill at any stage. On behalf of the Labor Party, I am indicating that we are open to any approaches on those issues as they arise. Because this has arisen out of a COAG process and because that is in fact its strength—it is broader than just the Commonwealth government and it brings uniformity to the laws across the states—we think this wider independent review involving the states is an appropriate response and therefore preferred to the alternative regime that has been argued. </para><para>I also mention that I think Senator Boswell got a little confused. I think Senator Bishop advised him correctly, but I think Senator Boswell misheard and then argued the case, which he wants to mount against the embryo bill, in the context of this bill. I think for those listening that, in fact, the NHMRC is not forming or overseeing the review arising out of this bill but out of the latter bill. Senator Boswell might like to repeat his arguments when we get to that bill, but it does not apply here. Speaking on behalf of the opposition, it is preferable in our view to have the independent review because of the nature of the COAG agreement and the need to involve the states. We accept that the alternative is perfectly reasonable to put, but in this circumstance we prefer the independent review. We also make the point quite strongly that it is competent for this parliament at any stage to review any of the issues that arise out of this bill or out of the operation of the act—if it is passed. I indicate that we have an open mind to those issues if they are brought before the parliament for debate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>6284</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On behalf of the Australian Democrats and before you interject, while it is a conscience vote, I have discussed this issue with my six colleagues and they are understandably supportive of the notion of a public inquiry, or specifically a parliamentary inquiry, into this or any other piece of legislation. Understandably, though, we are wary of enshrining in this legislation the notion of a parliamentary committee. I have just spoken informally to Senator Bishop. I put on the record that the Democrats are happy to support a joint committee or a Senate committee to investigate the operations of this bill at a specific time if Senator Bishop, or any other member of this chamber, wishes to put that proposal forward in the usual form as Senator Evans was suggesting—through a notice of motion, as we would give notice for any other Senate committee or other committee process. I am happy to put on the record our support for that because I do think that, while we have a preference for the current proposed review of the act, a public inquiry is totally complementary. I certainly have no problem with the idea of a broader involvement in a debate or an analysis of this legislation, be it after two years, three years or what have you. I am quite happy to support Senator Bishop in that respect but not by enshrining it in the legislation. I am sure that he and other people who support that position would prefer it to be in the legislation, and I hope that it is fair enough to accept our word on the record and acknowledge that—</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>YE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Boswell, Sen Ron</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3I6</name.id><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name></talker><para>—I will ignore that interjection, Senator Boswell.

In relation to the next legislation I will not pre-empt the proposed review provisions, but I suggest that any piece of legislation in its infancy or after it has been operational for a couple of years does deserve scrutiny. Certainly the wider that scrutiny, and the more public and community members that are involved, the better. That is certainly a strong Democrat position and I hope that my commitment on behalf of the Democrats is seen as that and that I do not have to put up with silly interjections from now on.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>6284</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Given what Senator Stott Despoja said about the importance of a public inquiry or investigation, how would the minister propose to alter the bill that is before us to achieve that end or does the minister not believe that it ought to be public?

I do not necessarily agree with the narrowness of the interpretations made by some senators, but it is fair to say—and I expressed this, as did Senator Stott Despoja in response to the arguments of Senator Bishop and others— that we accept and support the need for a broad inquiry, obviously with as much participation and involvement as possible.</para></talk.start><para>It is important that the minister takes that message.

I could not follow the minister's comment. Frankly, it was not a response to my question. My question was: why is this to be a private inquiry? Why is it not to be public? At the end of the day, in respect of the private—not public—inquiry or review, it is being suggested around the traps that this paves the way for cloning. I will deal with that point later. Not only is the inquiry not to be public but a narrow number of persons are to be consulted, including the Commonwealth and the states and `a broad range of persons with expertise in or experience of relevant disciplines'. If there is to be cloning, there is nothing at all in this legislation about consulting women's groups, a number of which came to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee and made submissions to the committee about the number of eggs that would be required to undertake cloning. There is nothing about that—leave them aside.</para></talk.start><para>I am very surprised that the Labor Party, through Senator Evans, will not give the public a fair go. They just go along with the government and with a private inquiry. What about a public inquiry? What is meant by an independent review—independent of what? It would certainly be independent advice from the ordinary public. What does `independent' mean for the qualifications of the persons who will conduct this review? Should it not be the case that those persons should not have a continuing personal, professional or pecuniary conflict of interest with the matters being reviewed? Is that not reasonable to have in the legislation? Is not that the matter of transparency and accountability that we often talk about in this place?</para><para>Senator Stott Despoja is in her place. I hope I did not mishear her. I thought she said that it should be a public inquiry. I am asking the minister how that can be achieved. As I see it, there is a general desire around that chamber that there should be a public inquiry. There are those like Senator Bishop and me who believe that the best way to have a public inquiry is to have a parliamentary inquiry. </para><para>However, I come back to the question I asked: why a private review? What has been the advice given to the minister? In the end, the advice states:</para><quote><para>... the views of the Commonwealth, the States and the persons mentioned in paragraph (b)—</para></quote><para>that is, persons with relevant expertise—</para><quote><para>must be set out in the report to the extent that it is reasonably practicable to do so.</para></quote><para>What does that mean?

They were the ones who initiated this. The Senate, or the House of Representatives, can initiate an inquiry at any time, as Senator Harradine knows, and it can be a very significant and in-depth inquiry.

I asked: why is this to be a private review? Why is it not to be a public review so that this can all be out in the open? Never mind what has happened, for example, to the NHMRC over a number of years, where things are done secretly. I say that through experience, because it was the NHMRC that incorrectly defined cloning when the officer concerned wrote to the states. He told the states that the NHMRC sees a distinction between reproductive cloning and therapeutic cloning. So outrageous was that that the Australian Health Ethics Committee, which is part of the NHMRC, said in an open statement that that was wrong. That information was provided to the committee and was clearly stated by the Australian Health Ethics Committee chairman. Page 17 of the committee's report states:</para></talk.start><quote><para>The distinction between `therapeutic' and `non-therapeutic' scientific or medical research was made in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki, and revised in Tokyo in 1975. This declaration was confirmed by the World Health Organisation and the Council for International Organisations of Medical Sciences as the basis for international guidelines for biomedical research involving human subjects.</para><para>According to that distinction, `therapeutic' research is research or practice carried out where the procedure is or is expected to be of benefit to the subject of the research. `Non-therapeutic' research does not directly benefit the subject of the research, although it may be of benefit to others or to scientific understanding in general.</para></quote><para>It is very important to be clear on this because, as was indicated by that definition, if the subject of the medical experiments is a human embryo, that is not therapeutic cloning. Rather, that is non-therapeutic so far as the embryo is concerned. </para><para>The distinction was affirmed by the Australian Health Ethics Committee when the doctor concerned, who was the COAG officer in charge of developing this bill, made his statement saying that therapeutic cloning is distinct from reproductive cloning. The chair of the Australian Health Ethics Committee, the principal committee of the NHMRC, said:</para><quote><para>Therapeutic interventions are interventions directed towards the wellbeing of the individual embryo involved and non-therapeutic interventions are interventions that are not directed towards the benefit of the individual embryo but rather towards improving scientific knowledge or technical application. Non-therapeutic experimentation includes both non-destructive procedures (which include observation) and destructive procedures ...</para><para>The more-recently-coined term `therapeutic cloning' collapses both (a) the distinction between therapeutic and non-therapeutic research on embryos and (b) the distinction between destructive and non-destructive experimentation on embryos. The creation of embryos specifically for research purposes, experimentation on those embryos and their subsequent destruction, etc. all fall under this term. It was because of the lack of transparency of the term `therapeutic cloning', because the term concealed rather than revealed these ethically-significant differences, that AHEC rejected its use.</para></quote><para>The Australian Health Ethics Committee has rejected the use of the term `therapeutic cloning'. It is a behaviour-governing term and is quite contrary to the principle of medical research.</para><para>What is happening here? Mark my words, in the next two or three years there will be a significant attempt to say, `Oh, we don't want reproductive cloning,' but they will say that they need therapeutic cloning. Well, they cannot really say `therapeutic cloning', because they have been proven wrong there, so they will call it something else, whereas it is exactly the same thing, exactly the same process: the process of somatic cell nuclear transfer, where the cell is taken from an adult and placed into an enucleated egg. There is an electrical current, and fusion occurs sometimes, if at all. Say there are two resultant embryos. One might be placed into the body of a woman and the other could be carved up to get the stem cells, thus destroying the embryo. That is why we need to be perfectly clear in legislation what we are doing about it. We need to hear what certain scientists are saying about this publicly. Do they have a vested interest? Of course there is a vested interest with a number of them. You have heard that there are a wide range of claims being made or requests being indicated: `When the time comes, yes, we will be pushing for cloning.' That is what this review is all about. If it is not about that, why have the review? The bill bans cloning. Why shouldn't it be left at that?</para><para>The bill bans cloning. You are proposing to have review of that ban in two years time. Then, according to this bill, the report must be made not later than three years after the royal assent. Under those circumstances, because it is of major public interest, why is it to be a private review? Why shouldn't the public and others with expertise, for example, hear evidence given to the review by those people? My question again is: why should it not be public?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>6287</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Health and Ageing</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I believe I answered Senator Harradine's questions, and I will not be supporting the amendment.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>6287</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—If that is the way the minister wants to treat the committee stage of the bill on a very, very important matter, so be it.

The more I sit here and think about this the more concerned I become about that specific provision because it lends itself to the minister being held hostage by the various states until they selectively put on the review panel those that will conform with their own view. There is nothing there that prevents people who might be of different views— regardless of what side of the debate they are on here—being selected, because of the right of veto that comes under subclause 25(2), which says:</para></talk.start><quote><para>The review is to be undertaken by persons chosen by the Minister, with the agreement of each State.</para></quote><para>It seems that we are heading down the path where there is going to be a select group that may be chosen and then there is a right of veto by each state over each of the people to be chosen. I do not know if that is the intent of this, but that is the way it reads. So the concerns that Senator Harradine has raised about the independence of this body really start to bite even further. </para><para>One should consider that there will be a lot of behind the scenes argy-bargy. Let us face it, when these committees are set up they are not set up by some broad democratic elective process; they are set up by people lobbying the appropriate people, or by people approaching the appropriate people. And we may find that the committee of review is a loaded committee of review. Or if it is not a loaded committee of review, you may have the ministers of the various states being offended by the views of someone. Let us assume that someone with Senator Harradine's views is to be put up for this committee. All that I would see as necessary would be for one state minister to object and that person would be rejected from serving on the review panel. I do not think that is the intention of what is in the current provision. That is the way it is reading and that is a real concern because one then does not have an independent review. One does not even have a review that is semi-independent. So, Minister, I ask again: can you clarify that for me and give assurances that that is not to be the case?

A couple of other states made submissions to the committee and indicated that they were in favour of the bill. The comment has been made, `What happens if they make amendments into which we have not have had an input?' If amendments are to be made to the bill, they will come to the House of Representatives and the Senate, and we can have this sort of debate about the amendments all over again, amongst whoever happens to be here at that stage—and that is appropriate.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Harradine indicated he was a parliamentarian. Well, yes, I am a parliamentarian too. We are politicians sometimes, but we are parliamentarians at others. As I said, I took objection to any implication that I did not hold the process of parliament in high regard. Let me just say that, if anybody thinks that somebody can put up a person, recommend them for a committee, and somehow influence the whole of COAG, let them think again. As one person has found just recently, it is quite a challenge to get all of the states to agree on appointment to a position. Having all states agree is one of the things required in this bill.</para><para>As I said before, if the parliament believes that there is a need for the impact of any aspect of this bill to be looked into in further detail, I am absolutely sure that somebody in this parliament will move to set up a committee to have a full inquiry. There is no reason why that could not go on at the same time. When all of the premiers have supported a Prohibition of Human Cloning Bill, I find it very difficult to read into this some conspiracy about it being a private meeting. COAG has to operate in a way which is workable and which can achieve outcomes.</para><para>As Senator Chris Evans said earlier today—and I have said here again tonight—it is very difficult to get agreement on an issue like this. If you actually put in place mechanisms that make it too hard to work, we will never get this sort of agreement. I think it is important that we can demonstrate a process that will look at something of significant concern to the whole community. We have now got agreement on a national uniform approach to this issue and I do think it is a little conspiratorial to think that there is some hidden agenda in here and that it is private. As I said, if any amendments to this bill arise out of the review, they will be subjected to the full scrutiny of parliament and the full public scrutiny which only the Senate can undertake—and does more and more.

It is clear that it is going to be a private review, not a public review, on an extremely important matter of public interest.</para></talk.start><para>I am also asking what is meant by `independent'. You will recall that I asked this before: What is independent? Independent of whom? Does it refer to the people who make up the panel? Again, independent of whom or of what?

The bill states:</para><quote><para>(2) The review is to be undertaken by persons chosen by the Minister, with the agreement of each State.</para></quote><para>That point was raised by Senator Hogg, and he wanted to get the answer. Please, I am asking through you, Mr Temporary Chairman: what is meant by `independent'? Because we are voting on a very important issue here, the review of the legislation, I ask what is meant by having such a narrow focus on the terms of reference? The bill, which at the moment is supposed to ban cloning of all types, states:</para><quote><para>(4) The persons undertaking the review must consider and report on the scope and operation of this Act taking into account the following:</para><para>(a) developments in technology in relation to assisted reproductive technology;</para></quote><para>I am not too sure how that comes into it, as far as the banning of cloning is concerned. Perhaps the minister might be able to tell us. How does that come into play? This bill is about the banning of human cloning. According to the bill, the review is then supposed to look at `developments in technology in relation to assisted reproductive technology'. Then the bill says:</para><quote><para> (b) developments in medical research and scientific research and the potential therapeutic applications of such research ...</para></quote><para>It says `potential'. What does that mean? We heard this before in the Senate inquiry— people say certain research on stem cells has the potential to do certain things—but there has never been any proof of concept. This is very important because, you mark my words, there are—and this aspect has been there all the time, as I explained to the Senate before—certain scientists who want to clone humans. Even the Minister for Education, Science and Training's scientific adviser, Dr Barlow, has stated that he believes in human cloning, including what he terms `reproductive cloning'. This is the minister's chief science adviser! I have raised that before and I now call publicly for him to repudiate that. It is very important to ask the minister this question about independence and why there are not broader terms of reference. Clause 25(4)(c) refers to `community standards'. What does that mean? Is there to be an ethical evaluation of certain proposals or not, or is it to be determined on the basis of a newspaper poll? These are matters that will ultimately determine whether there will be cloning or not in Australia, and it is important for the minister to respond to them.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>6290</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Health and Ageing</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I find it quite distressing that Senator Harradine is persisting in this way in the sense that it gives no credibility at all to our parliamentary process. We elect, despite some of us disagreeing over who is elected as premier, our premiers, our chief ministers and our Prime Minister of the day to actually have the good sense to interpret what is meant by `independent'. For example, when people are appointed to committees—and I have the responsibility of appointing people to committees from time to time as minister—they are required to fill out a form to indicate whether they have a conflict of interest. I would presume that we would expect that people would not have a conflict of interest, but one of the things here is that we could go on defining and defining what is meant by `independent' and still not have got to what people want in the end. </para></talk.start><para>Through our democratic system we will have elected premiers and chief ministers and indirectly elected a Prime Minister—as we indirectly elected those chief ministers— but at least they are elected representatives and indirectly elected by their parties.

If you tried to define what you meant by `independent' and went through all those things—that they cannot actually have shares in a company that is involved in cloning, that they cannot be involved in research into cloning but they have to have skills in biotechology to be able to understand the implications of this—we could go through those ad infinitum to explain what we meant by `independent'.</para><para>I put trust in the fact that we will have seven people, although they might not always share my political views, who have been elected, having been chosen by their parties to represent their state or territory, and also the Prime Minister of the day—and I am not presuming what parties they will be from—who will have the wit and the ability to interpret what we mean. If they make any recommendations that change legislation, the parliament of the day will have the ability to actually reject or accept those recommendations to amend the legislation. I believe that is sufficient protection, and Senator Harradine knows that I am a cynic of the first order, although in this case he may be more cynical than I am.

Why is it not fair to argue that those people responsible in the parliament of this country, whether they be senators or members, do not have the capacity to conduct a review of the nature proposed in this piece of legislation? If there is any reason why I would not support what is proposed it is for that reason alone because you are saying to us that we ain't good enough to do the review.

I assumed from what she said that the minister must not choose a person to undertake the review if the person has a continuing personal, professional or pecuniary conflict of interest with respect to the matter being reviewed. The whole point about this issue and what has been lost sight of is that unless that sort of provision goes into the legislation there is no guarantee—fancy trusting a politician but apparently the minister is trusting the premiers and the Prime Minister with this. I do not distrust them but I do have regard to the fact that they are busy people and so much is done for them in this particular area by the NHMRC. They are in the game; they have a research orientation. The NHMRC are the ones that are running the game. I will talk about that later on tonight when we come to the question of the appointment of a licensing committee. </para><para>I felt that the persons undertaking the review must give to the parliaments of the Commonwealth and of each state and territory a written report of the review.

The minister will not accept any amendment, although she was required to accept one earlier today. Rather than proceeding in that fashion, I wish to withdraw the alternative review of the act provision in amendment (10) and move an amendment—and I am doing this on the run—having regard to what the minister has said. I seek to include in line 6 of clause 25 of the bill after the word `independent' the word `public'. That is a very simple amendment.

The problem that we have, however, is with the notion of enshrining it in this legislation. We seek not to do that and, hence, I indicated to the chamber and to Senator Bishop, both informally and on the record, that we would not be supporting his amendment. However, I have given a public commitment tonight that the Democrats would support such an inquiry but through the normal processes—a notice of motion to the parliament, whether that emanates from the Labor Party or from individuals in the coalition.

I think his views in relation to accountability, transparency and public involvement are all valid, but I think a Senate committee or a joint committee plus this review that will happen after two years could potentially be quite complementary. This independent review reports to COAG. Will the federal parliament receive a copy of this review? Will this review be tabled in the federal parliament? That is something that the minister, on behalf of the government, could undertake to have happen. It solves some questions that may be outstanding in relation to public scrutiny of that review and public involvement. I am quite happy for us to have two reviews of the legislation. An independent review as per the terms of reference or the provisions set out in clause 25 is appropriate. Similarly, I am a great fan of parliamentary inquiries; hence the Democrat commitment to support one if terms of reference should come from the parliament. Given that this presumably reports to COAG, will the report be tabled in the federal parliament? Could the minister provide that information to the parliament? That also opens up, Senator Harradine and Senator Bishop, another opportunity for our involvement as a democratically elected body.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>6294</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Health and Ageing</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>— Clause 25(5), line 24 of the <inline ref="R1624">Prohibition of Human Cloning Bill 2002</inline> says:</para></talk.start><quote><para>The report must contain recommendations about amendments that should be made to this Act, having regard to the matters mentioned in subsection (4).</para></quote><para>The committee may say that they have no recommendations about amendments or they may believe that there should be recommendations about amendments.

That is not the way to operate on a major question of public policy. I am very disappointed that Senator Stott Despoja does not support this motion to ensure that this inquiry or review is undertaken in a public manner. The more accountability and the more transparent the actions of executive government, the better. It is absolutely essential that this be undertaken in the eye of the public—that is why I have moved the amendment.

As I understand it, the intention is to insert—in clause 25(1) titled `Review of operation of Act'—the word `public' between the words `independent' and `review'. I do not think that that satisfies anyone because I do not know what is meant by that. Does it mean that it is open to the public to view it, to be involved, to be consulted? Does it involve submissions from those organisations? Personally and on behalf of the Democrats, I believe that the provisions are sufficient and can be combined with a committee at another point in time.</para></talk.start><para>I apologise for not bringing this up in the context of the Community Affairs Legislation Committee. I certainly cannot be accused of not being involved in their deliberations. They were held at the same time that the parliament was sitting. While that sometimes facilitates the opportunity for senators to get there, it often makes it hard, too, when you have conflicting appointments and commitments. I would be satisfied with these provisions if there were a guarantee, an undertaking—and I know that this is not popular with some members of the government—that not only the recommendations but the review would be provided to parliament. It is a standard Democrat request where you have a review of an act, be it independent or otherwise, that the results of that review be tabled in the parliament and thus are available for senators and members. They are also thus publicly available.</para><para>I understand that the idea is to make the recommendations available. I certainly do not mean to be problematic at this late stage in the debate, but I do not see a problem with their being tabled in the parliament. I am not seeking to enshrine that in the legislation. I would be satisfied with an undertaking from the minister, on behalf of the government, to do that, because I think that that is appropriate. As I have said—and as I say through you, Mr Temporary Chairman, to Senator Harradine—a more public or a parliamentary inquiry at another stage is something that we would support, but we will not seek to put it into the legislation. Can I get a clear sense from the minister, because I will not pursue it further if I am at a dead end—not through discussions anyway; we might pursue it through other means—whether the minister is ruling out giving that undertaking.

Last night we had the debate about amendments (3) and (4). I had obviously some sympathy with the argument. Having made quite a significant speech about consistency, as I said, I had some sympathy with the amendments that Senator Harradine was moving—although not indicating support for the amendments. I had the opportunity this morning briefly, because we were back in here at 9.30, to have a discussion with the Prime Minister about the possibility of giving us time to contemplate this in more detail—maybe through regulation. Because Senator Ellison also has an amendment, we have not had time to take all of those into account. At the risk of prolonging this debate, when people get revved up again I am wondering whether it would be appropriate to defer any further debate on the bill until we can indicate to people whether there is an alternative way of addressing the importation issue, at least to give breathing space to consider it in much more detail.</para></talk.start><para>I believe that there is reasonable goodwill.

I would hope that those honourable senators who believe strongly in these amendments and who think that it might be overturned would allow that time in order for an alternative or a compromise to be examined.</para><para>In my sense of goodwill in addressing that, I would expect reciprocal goodwill in that the debate would not go on ad infinitum as a result of that.

That is my inclination on this occasion as well. However, I also make the point that we are scheduled to consider these two bills only until lunchtime tomorrow and then adjourn the debate and that it is not to be rescheduled until the sitting week after next. I think it would be the view generally around the chamber that it would be very useful to have dealt with and concluded this bill by lunchtime tomorrow. It would certainly be my strong desire to finalise this bill so that when we come back for the sitting week after next we only have one bill to consider and we do not have to restart both. That is obviously a question for the chamber and depends on how the debate goes, but I think that would not be an unreasonable proposition. If the minister is seeking to adjourn the debate on those amendments, we should at least only adjourn it until tomorrow morning and deal with them then.</para></talk.start><para>I had a question to put to the chair.

We should have a broad understanding that if the adjournment of the debate is supported it is supported on the basis that we come back in the morning to deal with those issues and to conclude the bill. That would be my preferred option and one for which I would ask for support. Obviously, preliminary to that is the minister's view in terms of the proposal in respect of amendments (3) and (4) and whether Senator Harradine still intends to oppose schedule 1. Perhaps we could deal with that tonight. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>6298</page.no><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HOGG</name><name.id>7L6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am not trying to cut across my shadow spokesman's—</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator Chris Evans</name></talker><para>—You have a conscience vote on this.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>7L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HOGG</name></talker><para>—It is not a prerogative on this issue, but I would like clarification from the minister in respect of what she is proposing if the debate is deferred.

I am going to take a very brief time to talk to the amendment because we have had a long discussion about much of the issue of the review of the act. If we are able to incorporate this into the provisions of this bill and it becomes part of the act, I think it will help a lot of people by taking out a lot of the heat about exactly to whom the report, parts of the report or findings of the report might be made available. It does not take away anything from the Council of Australian Governments, but it does add to the public aspect of a review of this act. I think that people would feel much more comfortable if they knew that such a report, once written, would be tabled in both houses of this parliament as well as being given to the Council of Australian Governments.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>6300</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I support the amendment; I think it is highly desirable. It is the least that can be done for this report, which will be a private review, and it is absolutely essential to have the review at least tabled in both houses of the parliament. I think it would be essential at that time for this review to contain detail of who was heard and the gravamen of the material that was given. I remind the chamber that one of the problems that we had on the committee was that COAG would not give us the basis upon which it made its decisions. Senator Murphy's amendment is a good one in that it will require those conducting the review to table their report, and presumably the information upon which they have made their recommendations, and to have that tabled in both houses of parliament. So I support the amendment moved by Senator Murphy.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>6300</page.no><name role="metadata">Barnett, Sen Guy</name><name role="display">Senator BARNETT</name><name.id>00AUF</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I support this amendment and make it clear that it is an important public policy issue that we are discussing.

It is a watershed event in Australian political history. There will be a review, as set out in clause 25. As I indicated earlier, it will certainly avoid the release of any selective parts of the report for various agendas or objectives of the different members of COAG. This will eliminate that and ensure it does not happen.

One of my staff has already put a note in his pocket to write a letter to the Prime Minister—a letter which we hope not just the Prime Minister will see but which will go to the Prime Minister and then to COAG, saying that that is the intent of the Senate.

We are drafting provisions in relation to an independent review that will involve the states, the territories, the Commonwealth and, yes, COAG.

I do not happen to be a lawyer; I do not happen to have every aspect of the Gene Technology Bill at my fingertips. But in the spirit of the fact that this was going to be a difficult debate, Senator Ian Campbell arranged a meeting of all the people who are deeply involved in this. He asked that if people had detailed questions, especially technical questions, they give them to me so that I could give people reasonable answers. I am not trying to obfuscate, and I think most people would know that I am not that sort of a person. In trying to ensure that I could answer people's questions—and I think we had five days of committee hearings on this bill, when these quite detailed questions could have been asked—I did ask that people do that so that I could attempt to answer them as well as I possibly could. That has not happened. With regard to the issue of heritable alterations of genes and clause 18, I can confirm that clause 18 is not intended to prohibit non-heritable alterations such as somatic cell therapy.</para></talk.start><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Progress reported.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BUSINESS</title><type>Business</type><page.no>6302</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration of Legislation</title><page.no>6302</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>6302</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Manager of Government Business in the Senate</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave— Senator Ludwig, a number of people and I have been working very hard to ensure that the debate on the <inline ref="R1624">Prohibition of Human Cloning Bill 2002</inline> and the <inline ref="R1625">Research Involving Embryos Bill 2002</inline> was an informed debate, that all senators could make a contribution and that it was handled in an efficient, effective but ultimately fair manner. Senator Ludwig and I were told by all participants in the debate on the Prohibition of Human Cloning Bill that it would be very short and that the committee stage would only last for a couple of hours.

The government cannot impose its will, the opposition cannot impose its will; you need to manage it in a way that basically reflects commonsense and goodwill amongst all senators and have respect for the fact that all senators hold views on these bills.

I think the job is very tough and is not an easy one to do, because it is not a simple debate where the government has a clear policy position—the position is not as clear as it is on normal legislation. We have sought information from all senators with a view on these issues. We convened a meeting and have had regular discussions on that. For example, I heard Senator Patterson earlier asking that people bring questions forward so that she could be briefed on them and actually respond to those questions. To some extent that was successful but to a great extent it was not.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We were also given clear information to the effect that the debate on the Prohibition of Human Cloning Bill 2002 would be a very short one and that the longest debate would be on the Research Involving Embryos Bill 2002. As it turned out, the debate on the human cloning bill has taken an enormous amount of time. All parties were hoping that the debate on both bills would be concluded by lunchtime tomorrow. </para><para>Because a number of senators were travelling overseas, some on ministerial business and others on parliamentary business, with the agreement and cooperation of the Leader of the Opposition, the Manager of Opposition Business and all parties, we added extraordinary sitting hours to the program—I think these hours are possibly unprecedented: a very long night on Monday, a long night on Tuesday and a long night tonight— to enable those people who held strong views on these bills to travel overseas tomorrow afternoon for very important business. I thank the Leader of the Opposition, the opposition and all other senators for facilitating that. We facilitated the possible spillover of the debate onto 2 December, because those people would have travelled back from overseas by then. Enormous goodwill has been extended from all sides, from the major parties and from the minor parties as well, to facilitate the wishes of those people who were travelling overseas—to in fact delay the debate for another fortnight until those people came back from overseas.</para><para>The reason we suggested at that stage that third reading debates would be held over until 2 December was to allow those people to have a final vote on those bills.

I was told that there is no running sheet, but I now understand there is. If there is consensus around the chamber to keep going and move on to the next bill and at least make some progress, I will do that. Senator Ludwig is saying no and I think everyone probably wants to go home.</para></talk.start></continue><para>It is very important for all senators to ensure that all legislation gets proper consideration in this place. These are special bills and I have gone to extraordinary lengths to ensure this is a well-informed debate with enormous amounts of time allocated to it. If all senators do not ensure that goodwill prevails, not only in the debate on the policy issues themselves but in the allocation of time for dealing with those issues, it will make it very difficult for all of us to consider the many other important bills the Senate needs to deal with over the remaining eight-odd sitting days we have. I will discuss with Senator Ludwig and others how we try to solve the situation that we are now in. It is really a very undesirable situation, where we have dealt with a bill we were told would not take very long at all, and it seems that the biggest challenge lies in the next bill. We will obviously need many, many hours. We have very few sitting days left to deal with those 40-odd other bills and yet another big bill in front of us. I think we are going to need a lot more goodwill than we have had already, and a lot of people are putting their heart and soul into managing this effectively. I would ask all honourable senators who are part of the management of this debate and part of the policy debate to help me, Senator Ludwig and the leadership and whips team to deal with the challenge the Senate faces as we move into the final couple of sitting weeks of this session. We cannot do it without that goodwill, and I ask all senators to help us achieve that.

I thank the Senate in advance for that. Subject to how that goes tomorrow, I am certainly looking forward to 14 November. I wish to outline tonight on the adjournment what the motion is along the lines of.</para></talk.start><para>There are seven points for the Senate to note. The first is `the alarming rise in the number of people with type 2 diabetes', estimated to be one million people here in Australia, with half of that number actually being undiagnosed. That means these people are guaranteed to have health complications over a period of time. They have a serious and adverse health future. They can suffer a whole range of health complications, from heart disease, kidney disease, eye disease and eyesight problems to problems with limbs, such as hands and feet. For example, last year 69 Tasmanians had amputations from the knee down, and that is a scary thought. It is not something that you wish to dwell upon but it is a fact, and it is a fact that we need to take into account in this country, because we do have an epidemic. It is not just me saying this; this is being said by all the experts, and I acknowledge the International Diabetes Institute and also Professor Don Chisholm, who is leading the diabetes research and the Diabetes Strategy Group in this country. They have said that we have an epidemic in this country and in fact world wide. </para><para>I want to refer to a recent landmark study called DiabCost Australia, which said that type 2 diabetes is costing Australians a staggering $3 billion a year, with the bill for each person with diabetes averaging nearly $11,000 in expenditure and benefits. That is a lot of money per year for those people. According to the study, as the complications of diabetes increase, the costs per person are estimated to escalate from $4,020 to $9,645 when there are both microvascular and macrovascular problems.</para><para>Early detection is the key. Early detection through screening programs and action to slow or prevent the onset of complications will see reductions in health costs and will improve and maintain quality of life for individuals with type 2 diabetes. With diabetes you can have a good healthy lifestyle, as long as the diabetes is managed properly. That is the key and that is why we need to identify those 500,000 Australians out there who do not know they have it. Once they know, they can do something about it: they can manage their health outcomes. I certainly want to make that a top priority of my time in this parliament. It has been a priority in my time as a member of Diabetes Australia in Tasmania and as a member of its national board.</para><para>I want to commend Diabetes Australia for the work that they do as a peak body for people with diabetes in this country, representing those one million Australians. I compliment them, particularly Graham Harris, who is the president, and Brian Conway, the executive director. They will both be in Parliament House tomorrow, when we will have an education and awareness day, and I want to thank Diabetes Australia for assisting in the hosting of that event. It is being hosted by the Parliamentary Diabetes Support Group, which is chaired by Judi Moylan with the support of Dick Adams, Cameron Thompson, Dr Mal Washer and Jann McFarlane—all in the House of Representatives—and me. The membership has grown: just recently there were 23-odd members and I understand that another person has joined up even today. I encourage members of parliament to consider joining and supporting the Parliamentary Diabetes Support Group.</para><para>Tomorrow, we are hosting this special day. It is the first time we have ever done it in Parliament House and there will be opportunities for educational awareness and opportunities to find out more about diabetes. I thank Diabetes Australia for the support they are providing tomorrow. I also thank the Juvenile Diabetes Research Fund for the work that they are doing to support us and for the work that they are doing in raising money for research, particularly for type 1 diabetes. The contribution of the landmark study of DiabCost Australia will go towards better informing government and the public of a significant public health problem. </para><para>On my recent visit to the United States, I found out that nearly 50 per cent of the deaths in the United States could have been postponed or prevented altogether as a result of better public health outcome—and that is a key point. The position is very similar here in Australia. If we get better public health outcomes and if we live a better and healthier lifestyle, we can avoid these health complications. There are 100,000 Australians at present with type 1 diabetes—that is, insulin dependent diabetes—and I am one of those. I wish to acknowledge that the government has recognised the public and personal burden of diabetes as a national health priority and that is good news. </para><para>The motion that I will move tomorrow has six points. Firstly, it urges the government to continue the programs to raise public awareness of the high risk of undiagnosed and untreated cases of type 2 diabetes and urges the government to take whatever steps are necessary to identify those who are undiagnosed with type 2 diabetes. If that does not occur, we will have a serious health problem not only for our health system but also with respect to those Australians because they will be guaranteed to become unhealthy and seriously so in the longer term, including death as an outcome. I urge all members of the government and all members of the public to take this on board as a serious issue.</para><para>Secondly, it urges the government to support access to new medications for the treatment of type 1 and type 2 diabetes while ensuring that the Australian taxpayers get value for money through appropriate pricing arrangements. Thirdly, it urges the government to continue to encourage people diagnosed with diabetes to undergo regular medical tests, including eye testing so as to prevent complications.  </para><para>Fourthly, it urges the government to ensure adequate funding for further research into prevention and treatment of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes and a cure for type 1 diabetes. That is obviously a top priority and that is why I compliment the JDRF for the work they do in raising money—in fact, raising millions of dollars a year not only in this country but in the United States and around the world for a cure for type 1 diabetes. </para><para>Fifthly, it urges the government to develop a strong education program encouraging appropriate diet and exercise regimes to minimise the risk of type 2 diabetes. That is one of the reasons I am hosting a forum in Tasmania on 29 November on childhood obesity, the problems and the possible solutions. We are receiving good support for that and I encourage as many Tasmanians as possible to attend and become more aware of the problems of childhood obesity and where it can lead.</para><para>Sixthly, it urges the government to develop strategies to heighten awareness of the rising levels of obesity particularly in young Australians and the associated adverse health effects of obesity. I want to acknowledge the wonderful support we received from CanTeen Tasmania and Eat Well Tasmania in organising that forum in Tasmania. They are groups that are particularly concerned about children and their health outcomes. We are looking forward to a great educational day and a great awareness day.</para><para>Finally, I want to acknowledge again the work of Diabetes Australia, the JDRF, and the Australian Diabetes Society endocrinologists who formed together to show that they are not only interested in themselves but interested in their patients and the people that they look after. I also acknowledge the work of the Australian Diabetes Educators Association, the work of the nurse educators who are out there and the work of our own nurse educators here in Parliament House and thank them for their support in arranging tomorrow's World Diabetes Day education and awareness day.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Western Australia: Veterans Health Care</title><page.no>6306</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>6306</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name><name.id>2L6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the adjournment debate tonight to address an issue that has been raised with me in recent times by Western Australian veterans relating to their access to health care. The nub of the issue is that Hollywood hospital is one of only three tier 1 private hospitals in Western Australia and the only one within the metropolitan area. Some veterans believe that this severely limits their access to quality health care. For the information of the Senate, a tier 1 hospital is one that a veteran can be admitted to without the prior approval of the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Prior approval is required for all non-tier 1 hospitals. This hospital treatment is provided under the auspices of the Repatriation Private Patient Scheme, which provides for the hospital care of eligible veterans, war widows and widowers. The scheme seeks to use tier 1 hospitals, which includes public hospitals, former repatriation hospitals and private hospitals selected through a competitive tendering process.</para></talk.start><para>The tier 1 hospitals are called `veteran partnering' hospitals, of which there is only one in metropolitan Perth; namely, Hollywood. Since June this year, two private hospitals outside the metropolitan area in Geraldton and Bunbury have acquired tier 1 status. The situation in Western Australia contrasts with other states where there is much greater accessibility to tier 1 private hospital services. By contrast, veterans in New South Wales and the ACT have access to 49 tier 1 private hospitals. These figures struck me as unusual the first time I saw them given the geographic size of Western Australia and comparable, if not greater, veteran populations than other state capitals.</para><para>Hollywood Private Hospital is an acute-care private teaching hospital. Its history dates back to World War II. The Commonwealth government built Hollywood hospital during the Second World War in response to and in anticipation of casualties returning to Australia, so it was built to care for service men and women. The hospital was opened in 1942 as the Australian General Hospital. It was also known as 110 Military Hospital. The Repatriation Commission was given control of the hospital in 1947 and the hospital changed its name to the Repatriation General Hospital Hollywood. </para><para>In the early 1990s, the Commonwealth Labor government either transferred the repatriation hospitals to the states or, in the case of Hollywood and Greenslopes in Brisbane, sold them to the private sector. Ramsay Health Care purchased Hollywood hospital and became the owner-operator on 24 February 1994. Since then Ramsay Health Care has spent $50 million upgrading the facilities at Hollywood. The privatisation of Hollywood hospital has been a resounding success. The professionalism and quality of care by Ramsay Health Care is well recognised within the veteran community and there is considerable support for the hospital from within the veteran community and from doctors.</para><para>The issue has arisen whether Hollywood hospital should be the only provider of private hospital services to Western Australian gold card holders. While there is no dispute that Ramsay provide the veteran community with quality private health care, there are some members of the veteran community who seek access to other private hospitals within the metropolitan area. Those seeking access to alternative tier 1 hospitals point to their right to choose where they are treated, given that veterans in other states have a choice of private hospital and the changing demographics and urban sprawl of Perth resulting in increasing inconvenience of travelling the distance to Hollywood for veterans and their families. Certainly those complaints are legitimate. It is true that veterans in other states have access to their choice of private hospital and that the veteran population in Perth extends north of Joondalup and south to Rockingham where travelling times to Hollywood can be significant and inconvenient.</para><para>There are many within the veteran community who are happy to attend Hollywood and are concerned that the ability of the hospital to service them—and certainly this is one of Ramsay's concerns—might result in reduced accessibility and range of existing services to gold card holders. Ramsay has a contract with the Repatriation Commission until 2006. Ramsay holds the opinion that the contract gives them exclusive tier 1 status within the metropolitan area in recognition of their commitment to the expense as the result of caring for veterans. Yet the Repatriation Commission stated during Senate estimates in February this year that it has a different view of the contract. It does not believe that the contract gives Ramsay metropolitan exclusivity. </para><para>So at the heart of all this are the best interests of veterans. Some veterans believe that staying with Hollywood and maintaining the high level of existing services is in their best interests. Others, understandably, would like to be able to choose which private hospital they attend. The two options may very well, if Ramsay is correct, be mutually exclusive. Permitting tier 1 access to other metropolitan hospitals may well result in a decline in the range and quality of services that Hollywood can continue to provide to veterans. This supposition, however, needs to be tested. According to the Department of Veterans' Affairs, this has been the experience elsewhere, hence their decision not to intervene in Perth especially in light of what they believe is a high level of satisfaction with Hollywood. The Repatriation Commission's view on veteran partnering generally is that it should not be implemented at the expense of existing good relationships and services such as in Perth. If opening Hollywood to competition in the metropolitan area means that the hospital is not going to continue to be as accessible to veterans as it is presently, then there may be more veterans who will be disadvantaged by any change than the number who are concerned with the present arrangements. The RSL is undertaking a survey of its 10,000 financial members regarding the suitability of existing hospital arrangements for its members. I will be interested to see the outcome of that survey. </para><para>Most of the dissatisfaction with the existing arrangements seems to be coming from younger veterans who want to choose where they are treated. The TPI Federation and the SAS Association have both been very vocal in the calls for change. I have attended meetings convened by both the RSL and the TPI Federation and I am aware of the various opinions on this issue. At the former meeting there was considerable satisfaction with the present arrangements and at the latter meeting there were calls for the department to review those existing arrangements. I do consider this a matter which warrants the investigation of the Department of Veterans' Affairs. I support the call of a number of ex-service organisations for a review of the Western Australian arrangements. I would be very interested to see the outcome of such a review.  </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Cybercrime</title><page.no>6308</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>6308</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise tonight to speak about cybercrime in Australia. According to the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) Coordination Centre, the number of reported incidents of computer related security breaches in the first three-quarters of 2000 rose by 54 per cent over the total number of reported incidents in the previous year. CERT logged some 9,000 security breaches in Australia in 1999, and that number leapt to an extraordinary 22,000 incidents in the year 2000. In addition to this, it would appear that countless instances of illegal access, damage, fraud and illegal pornography around the world remain unreported, because victims fear the exposure of vulnerabilities, the potential for copycat crimes and the loss of public confidence.</para></talk.start><para>Last year in this chamber, we passed the <inline ref="R1360">Cybercrime Bill 2001</inline>—now the Cybercrime Act—which amended the Criminal Code Act 1995 and beefed up the penalties for this type of crime. It enacted seven new computer offences to target people who access or modify computer data or communication to and from a computer which they do not have authority to access, modify or impair, and do so with the intention of committing a serious offence. But, despite the enactment of these new laws, electronic attacks, in the form of hacking of major web sites and servers and far-reaching virus and worm attacks, continue. Some companies are monitoring minute by minute to combat the new generation of viruses such as Bugbear-A, Klez, Braid-A and Sircam, which have superseded last year's viruses and worms such as the ILOVEYOU virus and the Anna Kournikova virus, amongst others.</para><para>The perception within the industry is that perpetrators of cybercrime are undeterred by the prospect of arrest or prosecution. They prowl the Net and are an ever-present threat to businesses, their clients, and ultimately the security of the nation. Cracking and virus introduction were targeted by the bill, as were `denial of service' attacks via message or ping floods. More serious offences included `denial of service' attacks and virus introduction actually causing unauthorised modification of data leading to impairment of information. Other offences cover the simple hacking of sites, where unauthorised entry into a protected system is an offence as is the writing, supply, control or possession of codes or programs which can be used to commit a computer offence.</para><para>The problem with this, however, is that the vast number of very common software programs that include utilities and applications which can be used for hacking would fall foul of the new cybercrime laws. For example, the Telnet program is attached to every copy of Microsoft Windows and is used on 80 per cent of the world's computers, and there are programs like John the Ripper which is attached to Unix. Indeed, the federal parliamentary network, which runs on Windows NT, would fall under the shadow of this extremely broad legislation, making the Commonwealth's IT network legally dodgy.</para><para>This problem is compounded for system or network administrators who frequently use programs like Netbus and Linux and who may possess not only programs that can be used for hacking but also, in some cases, benign virus codes. The offence of possession is tempered by the requirement of `intent to commit or facilitate an offence', but in so doing there is the inference that anyone in possession of any of these common applications may have to defend themselves against such allegations. </para><para>Although the government claims that the technology neutral terminology and broad scope of the bill made the proposed laws effective, industry insiders are less enthused. Philip Argy, the National Vice-President of the Australian Computer Society, is reported as saying he supports the legislation in principle but has `serious reservations about the broad powers being conferred upon statutory agencies such as ASIO'. In cracking down on cybercrime, the bill may have gone too far. Mr Argy uses an interesting analogy to explain how he sees the new laws. He says:</para><quote><para>Assume the police say they have reason to believe there is a sardine just off the Sydney Opera House which could help with their inquiries. Based on this, they can get a warrant to trawl Sydney Harbour and any body of water which is connected to Sydney Harbour.</para><para>It can be argued every waterway on the planet is ultimately connected to Sydney Harbour in one way or another, and would therefore be included in such a trolling exercise.</para></quote><para>In terms of computers, we are talking about a lot of networks, a lot of individuals and a lot of power. The bill amended the Criminal Code to include new offences aimed specifically at Internet activity, but it has been put to me on more than one occasion that the laws are too broad and are seen by many in the industry as using a sledgehammer to crack a walnut. The overall affect is that Mr Argy and others within the industry are concerned that civil liberties be protected and that strong legislation not be used by law enforcement agencies for harassment.</para><para>The bill addressed the practicalities of cybercrime by hugely expanding the associated law enforcement powers of investigation. The offences were given a wide and extraterritorial ambit under the bill in order to catch offenders who may otherwise escape liability by the simple method of bouncing commands off a remote computer or operating from a secure shell overseas. Additionally, police powers are now extended to allow seizure of data in the form of taking a mirror of a drive or disk on site for later analysis. Hypothetically, if a computer somewhere, for example at BHP, is suspected of sending a damaging virus, the police now have the power to insist that BHP provides them with a copy of all information it has stored on all its computers and every computer that its system is networked with—everything. There is no privacy or commercial protection. The absurdity and cost of this scenario is heightened if it turns out that the BHP virus was actually started by a 14-year-old hacker in Hobart.</para><para>Due to the nature of electronically stored information, pursuit of data by police through a network means everyone connected to the network is vulnerable to a search warrant—an approach that leaves no room for data privacy. In a more extreme example, if a search warrant was allowed to extend to data and computers accessible from, but not held on, electronic equipment at the premises being searched, then technically there is creation of an unlimited warrant in the case where such a machine is connected to the Internet—hence Mr Argy's Sydney Harbour comparison.</para><para>Industry fears that certain groups may be unfairly targeted by the legislation. So-called `white hat' security consultants who crack networks to find flaws and misconfigurations in network security are concerned that their jobs are threatened by these developments. Site operators who attract and generate large volumes of traffic may be guilty of the offence of crashing web or email servers simply by their ordinary high-load operations. For example, Madonna's Internet concert was so popular that it caused a large number of crashes all over the world, including Australia. The legislation would place Madonna in danger of falling foul of the law.</para><para>IT groups like 2600 Australia maintain that hacking plays an important role in the continuing development of security technology. Through their activities, hackers reveal problems with existing software and are a major motivation in the development of antihacking technology both through their own work and as a response by the general community to their activities. The advantage of the Internet is that it is a medium designed to facilitate a free flow of information and data, and legislating to restrict that operation should not destroy or control that freedom. It would at any rate be practically and effectively useless. </para><para>The importance of the legislation is that it points the finger at the real problems behind cybercrime news stories—that is, the insufficient awareness or education of people using the Internet in terms of both operators ensuring their own security and companies promising security hardware and software but in fact leaving their customers wide open to attack. The Cybercrime Bill was a well meaning but clumsy step in the right direction, although it must be careful not to persecute the IT industry in its search for legitimate Internet criminals.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Victoria: Bracks Government</title><page.no>6310</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>6310</page.no><name role="metadata">Tchen, Sen Tsebin</name><name role="display">Senator TCHEN</name><name.id>86Y</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—A few weeks ago, I rose in this chamber to bring to the attention of senators the sad conditions that my home state of Victoria has sunk to, less than three years after coming under the deplorable mismanagement of the Bracks Labor government. I cited the particular example of the Federation Square development, which had the distinction of being the only Centenary of Federation project that remained incomplete nearly two years after that important event. Senators will be pleased to know that this unsatisfactory situation has been corrected. The Federation Square project was finally opened on Saturday, 2 November—two days before Premier Bracks announced an early election—and was nearly $360 million over budget.</para></talk.start><para>When I raised this matter in this chamber, I was conscious that speculation about the likelihood of an early Victorian state election had been rife in the media for some time and I had some concern about whether it was appropriate to raise state issues in this chamber at this time. However, since it was well known that Mr Bracks did give his solemn undertaking—in writing, too—when he first came to office that his government would serve the full four-year term before going to an election, I took him at his word. And since, according to some of my Labor colleagues, his government was doing so well— to this point I shall return shortly—why would he call an early election anyway? Surely it was quite proper for me to comment on the state of affairs, as I see them, in my own state.</para><para>Therefore, I felt rather badly when Mr Bracks, against all promises and against all logic, did call an early election shortly after I had called attention to the true state of affairs in Victoria. Did I breach convention? I was delighted to learn that my esteemed colleague the honourable member for Bendigo, in the other chamber, on Monday this week—a full week into the Victorian election campaign—spoke in the House not once, not twice but three times in praise of the various alleged achievements that Mr Bracks and his government have wrought, particularly regarding Bendigo. It seems to me only proper that I should speak freely about the true state of what Mr Bracks and his government have actually done—or, more accurately, not done—in Victoria; and I shall make particular reference to Bendigo, also.</para><para>Three years ago, the Bracks Labor government were elected to office on the back of a string of policy promises. In this list of promises the Labor Party gave significant attention to regional Victoria in an effort to court their vote. Three years since their election, this list of promises has become a list of broken promises. In his paean to the Labor Victorian government of broken promises, the honourable member for Bendigo provided some quite fanciful and inventive claims of success on the part of the Bracks government in the areas of health, education, job creation, provision of `fast rail' train services, economic management and urban planning. I would like to deal with each of these claims in the same order. Let me first quote from the Bracks 1999 list of promises about health services:</para><quote><para>A Bracks Labor Government will reverse the decline in the provision of health services throughout regional and rural Victoria.</para></quote><para>It was quite unequivocal. But what is the real situation now? According to the Bendigo Health Care Group's annual report for 2001-02, waiting lists have in fact exploded under the Bracks government. The number of patients on waiting lists for semi-urgent elective surgery grew from 207 in June 1999 to 395 in June 2002—an increase of 188 people or 90 per cent. The number of patients on waiting lists for semi-urgent elective surgery for longer than what would be clinically ideal grew from 18 in June 1999 to 207 in June 2002—up by 189 people or 1,050 per cent. Previously in Bendigo Hospital, no patient had had to wait more than 12 hours in the emergency department for a hospital bed. Now there are 124 patients who were forced to wait for more than 12 hours. </para><para>The honourable member for Bendigo in his speech claimed that Bendigo Hospital has been able to employ 104 extra nurses under Mr Bracks's government. In fact, the hospital's annual report shows it has employed 117 new nurses during the last two years. Of those 117 nurses, 100 were to meet the requirements imposed on the hospital by the enterprise bargaining agreement that the Bracks government has made with the nurses union, but of these 100 nurses the government would only fund 75, leaving a gap of 25 which the hospital must fund within its own budget. The 17 additional nurses were for new programs, and they are not funded by the Bracks government at all. So that is a total shortfall of 42 nurses, or about $3 million, for the hospital to cover from its own resources.</para><para>The hospital's annual report also shows that waiting times for category 2 patients have nearly doubled, from an average of 69.72 days in 1999-2000 to 127.25 days in 2001-02. In 1999-2000 73.3 per cent of category 2 patients were admitted within the recommended 90 days; now this percentage has fallen to 61.75 per cent. If these were achievements, one shudders to think what greater disasters Mr Bracks could have wrought in Victoria and in Bendigo in particular.</para><para>I now turn to education. Again, let me quote from Labor's 1999 list of promises:</para><quote><para>Labor will ensure that class sizes are cut for 5, 6, and 7 year olds to 21 or less.</para></quote><para>That is for prep grade, grade 1 and grade 2. Three years later, what is the reality in Bendigo schools? Senators would be interested to know—and the honourable member for Bendigo ought to know but apparently does not know—that the reality is that 75 per cent of prep to grade 2 classes in Bendigo's 18 state primary schools remain with well above 21 students. Indeed, as at April this year, most of these 18 schools have class sizes that are higher than the regional average for the Victorian education department's Loddon-Campaspe-Mallee region, which has an average of 22.3 students per class—itself well above the figure in the Labor Party's promise.</para><para>What really is surprising is that the honourable member for Bendigo does not seem to know the story of the Kangaroo Flat Primary School, right in the heart of his electorate. The Kangaroo Flat Primary School was included in the Bracks government's May 2000 budget for funding and scheduled for completion in two years. It would make the 19th state primary school in Bendigo. Today, more than two years later, the Kangaroo Flat Primary School is an empty site with not one classroom, not one teacher, not one student. After the episode with Federation Square, no-one should be surprised by the Bracks government's remarkable ability to not get things done. I have a long list of such examples, so I shall continue on another day this story of the Bracks government's ineptitude.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Peek, Vice Admiral Sir Richard</title><page.no>6311</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>6311</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Tonight I rise to speak about a fine Australian—a man who has put his life on the line in defence of this country in two wars, a man who rose to the most senior naval position in the country, a man knighted by the Queen and decorated for his service to Australia by Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States of America, and a man who speaks in plain language, straight from the shoulder and tells it as it is. I wish to speak about Sir Richard Peek, and shortly I will quote his own words in a letter to me.</para></talk.start><para>On 23 October, the report of the Senate Select Committee into A Certain Maritime Incident was tabled and debated in this chamber. I think that you will recall the debate, Mr President. In his contribution to the debate, among other things, Senator Ferguson said:</para><quote><para>Indeed, as it says in our report, the only person with senior military experience that the Labor Party could wheel out to criticise the handling of the issue was Sir Richard Peek—a gentleman who may have had a distinguished military career; I do not know. It was so long ago, nobody would remember—because Sir Richard Peek began his career in the Royal Australian Navy in 1928 during the prime ministership of Stanley Melbourne Bruce. It was just a few years after the sinking of the <inline font-style="italic">Titanic</inline>. He retired some 30 years ago and could hardly be regarded as an authoritative commentator on contemporary military decisions or systems. This is the only person from the military—an armchair academic—that the Labor Party could wheel out to give evidence before this inquiry. </para></quote><para>In the government members' report to the inquiry Sir Richard Peek was described as a vaguely `Gilbertian figure' and his evidence to the inquiry was belittled accordingly.</para><para>The only conclusion that I can come to is that government members were unhappy about Sir Richard's views and the evidence that he gave and decided to shoot the messenger.

He is intellectually incisive and acute and is, I must say, remarkably knowledgeable about contemporary naval matters. That is the background against which I received this letter on 7 November in which he thanks me for defending his reputation in the debate that occurred at the time of the tabling of the report. He asks, if it is acceptable, for these words to be read into the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> to record his attitude to what was said about him. With those remarks, I now quote from his letter:</para><quote><para>Ferguson's remarks about me seem to have nothing to do with the Debate on the Selective Committee's Report (the only reference to me is on para. 4.31 of the Report and is surely a matter which is only common sense). His remarks appear to be directed at what I said in evidence before the Inquiry and if he had been on the ball (and game!) he could have raised his views then.</para><para>I will only comment about one remark which Ferguson made i.e. “the only person ... that the Labor Party could wheel out ...” was me. The Senator is obviously proud of the phrase because he uses it twice in sixteen lines. The only reason that I comment on it is because it is inaccurate. I was not wheeled out by the Labor Party and the Senator could easily have checked how I became a witness.</para><para>Before the Election, it was obvious to me and many others that there was something putrid being cooked up politically.

Please do not mistake me. All my life, starting in the Navy I have been, necessarily, apolitical.
