A special Telstra direction is one that relates to Telstra's wholesale and retail operations and it requires the ACCC to exercise its powers to make rules requiring Telstra to keep and retain particular records, prepare reports based on these records and deliver the reports to the ACCC. The amendments also set out the procedure that must be followed before the minister can make a special Telstra direction: the minister must publish the draft of the direction, invite people to make submissions on the draft direction within the specified time limit and consider any submissions that are received, before making the direction. The amendments also clarify that the minister may only give a direction that requires the ACCC to exercise its powers under sections 151BU, 151BUDA, 151BUDB and 151BUDC or that requires the ACCC exercise its powers under those sections in a particular way. This means that the minister would not be able to give a direction to the ACCC not to exercise its powers under those sections. The amendments also enable the minister to give a written direction to the ACCC requiring it to prepare a specified kind of analysis of the report and to publish the analysis within a specified period after receiving the report. </para><para>To enable matters in an instrument to be incorporated by reference, one of the amendments amends section 589 of the Telecommunications Act to allow instruments made under parts XIB and XIC of the Trade Practices Act to apply, adopt or incorporate provisions of any act, instrument or other writing as enforced or existing at a particular time or from time to time. This will allow ministerial direction in relation to accounting separation to refer to the regulatory accounting framework enforced from time to time. The government's amendments will also refine the proposed preselection provisions so that the ACCC makes the threshold decision on which services should be preselectable, but the ACA is responsible for implementation, including technical matters. This refines the proposed preselection amendments in the bill to provide that the ACCC specifies which services should be subject to preselection, but the ACA determines the preselection requirements for those services, including exemptions from the requirements. The amendments also provide a right to seek merits review by the Australian Competition Tribunal in relation to access disputes that were notified to the ACCC before the introduction of the bill in the House of Representatives on 26 September last.</para><para>The proposed amendments include some minor technical amendments. One is an amendment to ensure that provisions relating to the expiry time of ex-ante class exemptions and individual ex-ante exemptions are similarâthat is, so that an expiry time of an exemption order:</para><quote><para>... may be described by reference to the end of a period beginning when the service or proposed service becomes an active declared service.</para></quote><para>Another amendment provides two provisions relating to ex-ante undertakings, proposed sections 152CBA and 152CBF, to make it clear that the reference to `act of declared service' is to declaration in the ordinary sense under proposed section 152AL(3), not the deemed declaration that results from the proposals in the bill, proposed section 152AL(7). Another amendment to proposed section 152AL(7) clarifies that if a special access undertaking is subject to limitations then the service specified in the undertaking is deemed to be a declared serviceâand therefore subject to the standard access obligationsâonly to the extent to which the service falls within the scope of the limitations.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>7362</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>Australian Capital Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThese amendments are predominantly technical in nature and strengthen the provisions of the <inline ref="R1648">Telecommunications Competition Bill 2002</inline>. I would like to make a few comments about the range of amendments contained in this group. Items (1) to (5) modify the new preselection arrangements so that, whilst responsibility for declaring which services are subjected to preselection will be given to the ACCC, the ACA will be responsible for determining the technical requirements for preselection. Item (6) is a technical drafting amendment. Item (7) allows for the merits review of access arbitrations that were notified before 26 September, the date of the bill's introduction to parliament. This amendment satisfies a key concern identified by Labor senators in the minority Senate report on the bill. Under the current bill, arbitrations currently on foot with the ACCC would lose their ACT merits review appeal rights and this amendment ensures that parties involved in these arbitrations would retain these rights. This was a particular concern to Seven, who had ongoing arbitrations in relation to pay TV, of which I understand there were two outstanding. Labor support this amendment fully, having already advocated it, and if the government had not moved the amendment then we certainly would have. </para></talk.start><para>Items (8), (9), (10), (11) and (12) are technical amendments, and items (13), (14) and (15) amend the accounting separation provisions of the bill. Labor reflected on these in our minority report, and this is an appropriate opportunity to restate the concerns we have that this bill is generally a weak response to the recommendations contained in the Productivity Commission report. We expressed our concern and surprise at that at the time of hearing about this bill in committee. We will be supporting the bill nonetheless, on the basis that Labor will continue to develop our responses and policies as far as accounting separation for Telstra goes.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>7363</page.no><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator CHERRY</name><name.id>00A9C</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI want to briefly note that the Democrats will be supporting these amendments and also, like Senator Lundy, note that we particularly support amendment (7), which is to grandfather two arbitrations under way currently which involve the Seven Network, a matter on which we had made representations to the government prior to this debate.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>7363</page.no><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name><name.id>8HC</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ON</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to indicate that One Nation will support the government's amendments, and I would like to make some general comments in relation to the <inline ref="R1648">Telecommunications Competition Bill 2002</inline> and its proposal to change sections of the act. These proposed changes originally were designed to encourage foreign and domestic companies to compete with Telstra in the domestic market. However, following the release of the Productivity Commission's report, the government to a large degree initially ignored the report and tended to focus on the complaints of Singapore Telecom, Optus, New Zealand AAPT, MCT and Primus. As a result, One Nation believes that the original proposals put forward by the government would have left Telstra exposed in the market in a way that would not be in the best interests of Australia. Subsequently, Telstra has held considerable consultation with the government, and the government, as we see here today, is bringing in a considerable group of amendments to the bill in its original form.</para></talk.start><para>One Nation does have concerns with some of the proposals by both the Labor Party and the Democrats to alter the bill in such a way that would require Telstra to give an unfair competitive advantage to those other competitors. Let me explain it this way: if the Labor and Democrat amendments are successful, they will require Telstra to provide to the public arena some areas that are more profitable than others. Their proposal would allow the competitors to be able to select, based on Telstra's data, the areas that they should concentrate on and then, to a degree, leave Telstra to carry the more unproductive areas. I believe that that is not in the best interests of Australia. It is in the best interests of keeping Telstra as a government majority owned entity. I believe that ultimately, if the Labor amendments and the Democrat amendments were to succeed, we would end up with a situation where Telstra could in all probability lose its market dominance and, to some degree, be exposed to being taken over by overseas interests. I do not believe that is in the best interests of Australia as a nation, both from a security point of view and purely from the point of Telstra returning to the government a considerable amount of revenue.</para><para>So One Nation places on the record very clearly that we will be supporting the government's amendments and the bill but will be opposing both Labor's and the Democrats' amendments. We believe that they would undo, to a large degree, Telstra's input and the work that Telstra has been able to achieve by convincing the government of the dangers of allowing the other market players to have unfettered access to Telstra's profit margins, its statistics and the like. Finally, I place clearly on the record that One Nation is supporting the government's bill and the government amendments in the form that the government puts them forward. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>7363</page.no><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator CHERRY</name><name.id>00A9C</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Democrats are moving no amendments that do any of the things which Senator Harris has mentioned, but we will debate that when we get to the amendments. </para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>7364</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>Australian Capital Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI would like to put the same thing on the record.

Carriers are currently required to present industry development plans to the minister, summaries of which are then made public. This enables the minister, the parliament and the public to scrutinise the industry development performance of carriers. While Labor acknowledges that these reports can be burdensome for some smaller carriers, simply removing these provisions altogether is unacceptable. It is appropriate that carriers, particularly Telstra, be encouraged to remain accountable in regard to their industry development plans. The core of these provisions should remain, so as to ensure the industry development plans of the major carriers can be monitored. I foreshadow Labor's support of the next amendment, which does remove an additional burden for future carriers in relation to the preparation of an industry development plan. I will speak to that in more detail later, but is our intention to support the follow-on amendment for this, which further clarifies the role that future smaller carriers can play. That amendment will be moved by the government, and the opposition will be supporting it.</para></talk.start><para>In general, industry development is an issue very important to the federal Labor opposition. It is something in which I have been involved in relation to information technology for a long time and it relates directly to the telecommunications industry. It should come as no surprise in the current public debate about the relative status of the information communication technology trade deficit in this country that Australia would be well suited and far better off if we were able to improve our exports in relation to our imports in the area of ICT. It would be the most inappropriate time to reduce or remove any accountability requirements for telecommunications carriers to state what they are doing in relation to industry development in ICT. A brief history lesson shows how crucial Telstra, in particular, has been to the growth and formation of many Australian companies and the growth of their capabilityâparticularly in telecommunications technologies. Taking into account the sheer size of Telstra, I have no doubt that, as it and other carriers grow, their purchasing power in the Australian marketplace will have a directly determinant effect on the health of our local indigenous ICT sector.</para><para>This amendment is to prevent a watering down of those commitments. We believe that industry development plans should stay and that we should continue to be able to scrutinise the larger carriersâin particular, Telstra's purchasing plans and what they contribute to industry development in this country. I should add thatâas stories emerge from time to time about the plans and intentions, alleged and otherwise, of Telstra to source a growing number of services and technology from overseas, including outsourcing various aspects of their own IT to other placesâit is a really important issue. I would like to know the government's thoughts about the need to retain that level of accountability as far as industry development goes.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>7364</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI think there was probably a time when IDPs had some relevance, although some might have argued even then that they were largely cosmetic because, whilst indicating areas in which the company's performance should be specified in the plan, they essentially left it on a `best endeavours' basis. In other words, the companies indicated their proposed levels of R&amp;D and what they hoped to achieve in other areas, but there was never any suggestion that they would be compelled to do things which did not make sense or which were quite uneconomic. The IDP provided a measure of visibility as to their plans, rather than our simply not having a clue what they might be up to or what their intentions were. Having that in front of you does not detract from the criticism that ultimately it does not make a great deal of difference. </para></talk.start><para>The Productivity Commission found no compelling arguments for continuing with IDPs, on the basis that larger carriers are well aware of local capabilities and will continue to use local industry for cost and efficiency reasons. Smaller carriers are either resellers or carriers serving a limited or regional market and would have a limited impact on the local equipment industry. IDPs may act as a barrier to entry. Firms will be asked to comply with the principles set out in the Australian industry participation framework run by the Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources. This framework provides full, fair and reasonable access in the preparation of Australian industry development plans to maximise opportunities for suppliers and the development of industry. The government continues to support Australian ICT industry development through its endorsed supplier arrangement. In this regard, on 21 June 2002, the government released its voluntary procurement and strategic industry development guidelines to encourage its suppliers to undertake strategic activities in Australia in areas including R&amp;D, exports, investments, SME alliances, skill development and technology transfer.</para><para>It comes down to this: if the Labor Party really only has Telstra in mind, it may as well come out and say what it will require Telstra to do. However, if it says that it should apply to the industry generally, it has to accept that these decisions are often made globally. If there is an unnecessary degree of paperwork involved in complying with what is essentially a feelgood exercise, they take that very much into account in deciding where to locate for all sorts of levels of activity. We have to get the balance right. We should not for a moment be out there saying that none of these things matters. We should be reminding them that quite often there is a mutual benefit to be derived. But to go beyond that and to force them to do things which they just do not think are commercial is not a good idea. I presume that Labor agrees with that. The halfway position is to get them to spell out plans in great detail and usually to engage consultants and others to prepare them so that everyone can feel a bit better about them. That is a much more significant burden on SMEs than it is on an organisation like Telstra. At the end of the day we would be better off having the resources of all concerned applied to competing in the marketplace rather than simply complying with red-tape requirements which ultimately will make no difference to commercial outcomes.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>7365</page.no><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator CHERRY</name><name.id>00A9C</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Democrats also will be moving to delete from the bill the provisions relating to industry development plans. The bill seeks to enact the Productivity Commission's recommendation to scrap the requirement that a carrier develop and report against industry development plans. The Democrats oppose the removal of this requirement. We note the commission's conclusion that it could find no compelling argument for continuing industry development plans, because commitments, apart from R&amp;D, were formerly voluntary, and benefits including information on industry-wide investment and product development are not really part of the instrument. But, while we accept these arguments to a degree, in our view the appropriate course is not to scrap the plans but to re-evaluate and streamline the criteria. In particular, we believe that the plans should focus on R&amp;D and technology transfer issues. Accordingly, we will look carefully at future legislation that sets out to improve the strategic focus of plans. I note that on 21 June the minister outlined streamlined ICT industry development arrangements. Whilst some of those measures are welcome and clearly overlap with the elements and scope of IDPs, we do not see them as a replacement.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>7365</page.no><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name><name.id>8HC</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ON</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise again to indicate that One Nation will oppose the Labor and Democrat amendments.

I would be very interested to hear from both the shadow minister and Senator Cherry how they relate their position to a letter that I assume they also have received from Optus.

IDPs actually create a greater burden on the smaller players. It is quite logical if you work out the arithmetic: if Telstra has to produce an IDP from 75 per cent of the funds in the market, there is a relative cost per unit to it. Then we have all the other players who have to produce their IDPsâexactly the same as Telstraâfrom 25 per cent of the remaining value of the market. So the cost per unit on all of the other players is, disproportionately, three times greater. When you have Optus writing to senators, asking us to support the government's positionâthat is, to remove IDPsâI find it quite perplexing that the Labor Party and the Democrats are moving to remove them.

The industry wants the bill to stand as it is printed. If the Labor and Democrat amendments are passed, that will defeat the section of the bill that will remove the requirement of the industry to produce IDPs. Clearly, the industryâand this is the position of Optusâhave said that they do not see any value in the IDPs. It does not impact on how they provide their service and it does not impact on the goods that they purchase. Generally speaking, it covers a five-year period. As everybody knows today, the telecommunication industry is a moving feast, so what is relative this year, when these companies will spend millions of dollars to produce the IDPs for the next five years, may be totally irrelevant in 12 months time because of the changes in the industry. This is what the industry is saying: it wants the burdensome requirement to produce the IDPs removed.

Currently, applicants for a carrier licence must prepare an initial IDP in order to obtain a carrier licence, but thereafter they may fall within a category of exemptions as declared by the minister. This is a disallowable instrument subject to scrutiny by the parliament.

Labor has been convinced in this circumstance that it is a sensible change to the act. Currently, the ACA can exempt smaller carriers from preparing industry development plans. As the minister said, carriers in this category include those with revenue below $5 million and capital expenditure below $20 million. This amendment further strengthens the provisions to ensure that these smaller carriers do not have to prepare such reports prior to being issued with a carrier licence, so it increases the consistency within the act. I think this will help reduce the regulatory costs and burdens on the smaller start-up carriers, because after all we are all about encouraging competition.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>7368</page.no><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator CHERRY</name><name.id>00A9C</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Democrats will also be supporting this amendment, and we note that it has been developed after discussions between the government and the other parties. It allows the ACA to provide exemptions for small prospective carriers to provide IDPs when they are seeking a licence. This makes the exemption provisions consistent with those that apply to existing carriers. The exemptions will be set out in a ministerial instrument and the current thresholds are expected to total annual revenue below $5 million and annual capital expenditure below $20 million. A further category of exempted carriers covers those whose services primarily relate to research or educational institutions. The Democrats understand that as a consequence there will be around 15 to 25 IDPs, including renewals, requiring approval by the minister each year. We further note that the proposed new section 15A, subsections (4) to (7) inclusive, provides for the ACA to verify that prospective and current carriers meet and continue to meet the conditions of the exemptions as determined.

It is also interesting that, based on the figures that we have been given, Optus is not one of those mentioned. So there again, we have a situation where the two main players in the industry, Telstra and Optus, are stuck with this burdensome requirement to provide industry development plans. Telstra has indicated that they have no impact on the service it provides and they have no impact on any purchases that they make within Australia. In their letter dated 3 December, Optus have clearly set out exactly the same, and yet there is the situation where Optus and Telstra nowâeffectively as of this minuteâhave to produce their industry development plans. If the amendment before us is successful, the minister will have the ability to exempt a licensed carrier, and it has been indicated to the chamber that there is going to be a numerical cap on that.

Amendment (2) allows the ACCC to extend or further extend the expiry date of a declaration for a period of up to five years. That means that a declaration could be for 10 years, as desired by the opposition, if the ACCC has conducted a public inquiry halfway through. Amendment (3) requires the ACCC to conduct a public inquiry within 12 months of the expiry date of a declaration.

It does that by allowing that, if the ACCC has conducted a public inquiry and decides to allow a declaration to expire but then makes a new declaration, or decides to revoke or vary the declaration, and the ACCC report of the public inquiry was published within 180 days, then the ACCC is deemed to have made a public inquiry for the purposes of 152AL(3)(a), (b) or (c).

Whilst we acknowledge the rationale that 10 years provides greater certainty for investors for the duration of declarations, we question whether this is appropriate for all declarations. Clearly there will be circumstances where 10 years is appropriate. However, some services might not warrant such a length of time due to technological change or declarations in similar services.

The amendments ensure that the ACCC must, by way of a public inquiry, make a positive decision about whether to extend, revoke or vary a declaration during the 12-month period prior to the five-year declaration expiry date. Under the original bill, the ACCC needed to hold a public inquiry only if they wished to extend the declaration. If the declaration automatically expires or is varied, there is no provision for any hearing at all. We will be opposing the Democrats' amendments. </para></talk.start><para>We are opposed to the automatic expiry of a declaration after five years, as we feel that this period is too short to provide for industry and regulatory certainty. For instance, the Senate inquiry received evidence pointing to the fact that many commercial contracts in the communications industries extend beyond five years. It would also mean that the ACCC is bogged down in constant regulatory reviews of access declarations. In any case, the ACCC has the power to revoke declarations that have become outdated, as happened with the AMPS service under the current access regime. Whilst I think that the Democrats' amendments are well intentioned, in effect they further increase the burden on the ACCC to hold regular inquiries regarding access declarations.</para><para>I foreshadow Labor's amendment to extend the sunset period for access declarations to 10 years. Labor feels that this provides a far more sensible solution to this dilemma. It is a simple amendment that accepts the government's premise that access declarations need a defined expiry period, but it provides for a period more acceptable to the general terms of contracts that occur in the industry, and I think it is more appropriate for the efficient regulatory oversight of the industry.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>7371</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âSenator Lundy has spoken to these amendments and the following amendment. We take the view that the Democrats' approach is not just well intentioned but is sensible policy. We understand that stakeholders want to have their views explicitly considered before the ACCC makes its decision. We therefore agree with Senator Lundy that automatic expiry after five years is no longer sufficient. We certainly oppose the extension to 10 years. Given the dynamic nature of the telecommunications industry and rapid changes in technology, five years is a more appropriate period than 10 years, particularly given that contracts in the telecommunications sector generally run for around three to five years. I think that means that the Democrats and the government are in agreement on these amendments.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>7371</page.no><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name><name.id>8HC</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ON</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI indicate to the chamber that it is obvious that the Democrats have the support of the government on these particular amendments. The concern that I have with these amendments, first of all, is that we are extending or giving the possibility to extend a declaration. Senator Lundy raised the issue that some of the contracts for people accessing these services have been written for up to seven years. I understand the reason for that: if they are going to go to a major movie house and make a commitment to purchasing programming over a long period, they are going to need an applicable amount of time to have the surety to be able to deliver those movies through that carrier service, whoever that may be. But the point is that they have entered into these seven-year contracts knowing full well that the declaration is for only five years. They have entered into a commercial contract for seven years, knowing that there is only security there for five years. So, having done that, they have made an economic and strategic decision. Therefore, I believe that has no bearing on the length of period of the declaration.</para></talk.start><para>I have two concerns. I ask the minister: if the ACCC does extend the period of a declarationâin other words, if it carries forward the legal requirements for access for a personâdoes the actual carrier have a right of appeal or is the ACCC decision to extend final? That is one issue. The other issue that causes me great concern is that we have amendments proposed by the Labor Party where the intent is to remove the minister's ability to give a direction to the ACCC. So these two are linked. If the chamber passes these amendmentsâand it appears that it willâthe concern I have is whether the carrier who has a legal contract that was previously five years has a right of appeal against the ACCC. Also, provided the Labor amendments are successful, will the minister still have a right to give a direction to the ACCC?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>7372</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI think the position is that we fully understand the importance of the players and all of the stakeholders having their views properly considered but, at the end of the day, we think it is more appropriate that the ACCC makes that decision rather than government. So, if the public inquiry provides that opportunity, we do not think it is appropriate for the government to come in over the top of the ACCC and contradict it, in effect. The government would always have the ability to legislate a different position, but that is not what we think is the best approach here. We prefer the Democrats' amendments, which require the public hearing and then provide the basis on which the ACCC can make a decision about an extension of the declaration, rather than the government itself doing that. At the end of the day, you can always appeal everything, but these are considered judgments that have to be made, and we think that the ACCC is in a better position to do that and have its objectivity unquestioned. If it is done by the government, then often it is seen to be for someone's benefit or not for someone else's benefit. We would rather take that tension out of the system wherever possible. </para></talk.start><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>7372</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>Australian Capital Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âby leaveâI move amendments (2) and (4) on sheet 2753:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(2)	Schedule 2, item 10, page 16 (line 9), omit â5-year periodâ, substitute â10-year periodâ.</para><para>(4)	Schedule 2, item 15, page 18 (line 9), omit â5-year periodâ, substitute â10-year periodâ.</para></quote><para>I made my comments with respect to the 10 years that Labor is seeking in the context of the discussion we just had in committee.

There is a major difference between the new special anticipatory arrangements and the existing ordinary access arrangements. The new special anticipatory category requires the ACCC to take into account the views of the minister by disallowable instrument in determining whether or not to grant anticipatory access undertakings or exemptions. To ensure legislative parity between special, or anticipatory, and ordinary undertakings and exemption provisions, Labor's amendments remove the ministerial power of directions under the new special anticipatory access provisions.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Given the current controversy over the Foxtel-Optus content sharing deal, it is important that the government ensures that access arrangements legislated for anticipatory services are the same as those for existing ordinary services. The ACCC should continue to use the long-term interests of end users test to guide its access decisions. The ACCC should not be subject to undue political interference. It must be left to do its job. I would like to quote the minister from a few minutes ago in this debate. He stated himself that he would rather see the ACCC's objectivity `unquestioned' in relation to ministerial direction. I look forward to the government's support in relation to this amendment. </para><para>I believe Labor's amendments will ease concerns that the regulator could be influenced by the short-term political considerations of the minister rather than using the existing long-term interests of end users test, as is currently the case for ordinary access decisions. I think this very important amendment is worthy of support as it will strengthen the anticipatory access provisions, which Labor supports in principle. I would be interested to hear what other parties have to say, and I would like to make a few more comments before we conclude this aspect of the debate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>7373</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âJust to be clear, we are not in any shape or form suggesting that the minister ought to be able to override the clear objects of the act, which of course include the long-term interests of end users. To the extent that the minister is able to give the ACCC any guidance, it will simply be in the context of making it aware of the government's views and asking the ACCC to take them into account. That is pretty harmless stuff. It is really just saying: `This is what we think; have a good look at it.' Otherwise, it might be unaware of some matters. None of us have perfect information from all sources, and this is simply designed to provide the ACCC with that level of awareness.</para></talk.start><para>I want to make it clear that the minister will not be able to direct the ACCC to take into account matters that it could not in any case have regard to in deciding whether to approve an ex ante undertaking or grant an ex ante exemption. Nor will the minister be able to direct the ACCC to give particular weight to a matter notified in the minister's instrument. The proposed formal notification procedure will provide a transparent and accountable statutory mechanism for the minister to bring particular matters to the ACCC's attention. The minister's notification is also subject to parliamentary scrutiny and disallowance.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>7373</page.no><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator CHERRY</name><name.id>00A9C</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Democrats will be supporting these opposition amendments. The legislation extends the ACCC's powers by enabling it to deal with access issues before an investment is made. This is consistent with how it currently deals with access arrangements after the infrastructure is established. However, there is one notable difference between the new anticipatory access arrangements and existing access arrangements. The new anticipatory arrangements require the ACCC to take into account the views of the minister in determining whether or not to grant anticipatory access undertakings or exemptions. These views are intended to be put as a disallowable instrument. I take on board the minister's statement that his policy statements are `pretty harmless'. I am sure that does not apply to the rest of the minister's portfolioâI am thinking about the possible appointment of a former minister to the ABC board, which would not be described as `pretty harmless' at all.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>LD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator Alston</name></talker><para>âWho?

There is an argument that such a provision as the ministerial policy statement in this area may lead to the politicisation of the ACCC's consideration of anticipatory access arrangements. The opposition's amendments ensure legislative parity between anticipatory and ordinary undertakings and exemption provisions. The Democrats are staunch defenders of the role of the ACCC and believe that a ministerial direction may impinge on its independence. Whilst we acknowledge that a disallowable instrument does allow for parliamentary scrutiny of a ministerial decision, on balance we feel there is no substantive reason why the current approach for ordinary undertakings should not be followed. As I noted previously, the Democrats welcomed the government's decision not to accept the Productivity Commission's recommendation about the long-term interests of end users or the LTIE test. We believe this remains the most appropriate general framework for the ACCC to consider anticipatory undertakings in. </para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>7374</page.no><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name><name.id>8HC</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ON</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to indicate that One Nation will be opposing Labor amendments (R5), (6), (R7), (8), (R9) and (R10). We are doing this because the removal of the ministerial powers with respect to special access undertakings and exemptions would affect the integrity of a very important part of the entire bill. The government has quite rightly instituted a process whereby investors can approach the ACCC before they invest and seek assurances as to how they will be regulated. As part of this process, it is proposed that the minister can write to the ACCC and say that the ACCC needs to take into account a particular issue or policy objective when making a decision.</para></talk.start><para>As a classic example of this we have seen pay TV companies run multiple cables down the same streets in the same cities and none of them is returning a profit on the investment. The government has correctly set out to allow a telecommunications carrier, prior to physically making the commitment of substantive funds to a particular project, to go to the ACCC and say, `This is what we are proposing to do; how would you allow our competitors access to this?' The proposal is that, before they invest the money, they have a reasonable understanding of how they are going to get a return on it. There is not a business anywhere in this world that does not require that certainty, whether it is for their shareholders' capital or their own capital from that particular company.</para><para>As part of the process in the amendments that Labor is proposing, the minister would not be able to go to the ACCC and say, `Telstra are going to run a fibre-optic cable out to Mount Isa but they need to know what return they are going to get on that investment.' So they would go to the ACCC and the ACCC would come back with a regime of access to that infrastructure that was not viable for Telstra. You are saying that the minister cannot go to the ACCC and say, `Based on the benefit of that cable being run out to Mount Isa, there are social and economic issues that you should take into account when you are allowing other access to it.' If the Labor amendments are passed, they will stop any telco from entering into a major project in a rural area because it will not have certainty as to how it would get a recovery on that investment. Most certainly the minister will not have the ability to go to the ACCC and say, `You have not taken this into consideration.' You are condemning rural Australia, from this point on, to staying with the present infrastructure, because nobody will go out and invest in those areas if they do not have the ability to go to the minister and say, `This is for social or economic reasons in the rural areas.' For those reasons One National believes it is absolutely critical that the ministerial powers be retained in this bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>7374</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>Australian Capital Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI would like to clarify again what the amendments are about. The amendments are about removing the ministerial direction and what prevails is the long-term interest of end users test. It is very strange for the amendments to be presented in the way that Senator Harris has chosen to present them because, as I explained in my earlier comments, the intent of the bill overall is to make sure that carriers have the opportunity, through the anticipatory undertakings, to plan for the future. That is exactly the opposite of what Senator Harris is saying the amendments will do.</para></talk.start><para>The amendments strengthen the provisions and remove the opportunity for what we are concerned aboutâpolitical interference. The bill will have the effect of providing the anticipatory undertakings regime, which is what Senator Harris is passionately arguing is the core outcome of this bill. I think we need to acknowledge that rural and regional Australia is currently in dire need of support. The fact is that the infrastructure in rural and regional Australia, which effectively has been in the hands of a monopolyâ Telstra'sâfor some time, is not getting better; it is actually getting worse. I think it would be a very positive outcome if the provisions of this bill were implemented so as to allow other competitors a far greater ability to determine the value of their investment in advance by determining anticipatory access undertakings.</para><para>I do not accept for a second the argument that to do such would undermine Telstra's position in the market and would make it less likely that Telstra will in fact make those investments. That does not follow, and it is not supported by the evidence that we have before us. For many years Telstra have been in a position to make the choice to invest in rural and regional Australia, and they have chosen not to. They have chosen not to in a way that has left rural and regional services not only depleted but deficientâknowingly so, as has been recently documented, albeit in a perhaps less strident way than it could have been, in the Estens report. I believe that there is probably even some genuine intent by the coalition government here to try to strengthen the competition regime with a view to encouraging alternative investors to Telstra and, through that, hopefully encouraging Telstra to make the sorts of investments necessary. </para><para>I do not accept the argument, Senator Harris, that to remove ministerial direction lessens that; I actually think it strengthens that. You are arguing that ministerial direction would come by way of encouraging rural and regional investment and that not to have ministerial direction there would somehow undermine that. I think the opposite will occur. I think there is a potential risk that ministerial involvement will actually strengthen Telstra's position at the expense of competitionâand that is my concern. So I think we are coming at this from a fundamentally different premise. I have alleged on many occasions that I think the government and Telstra are far too close and that indeed they work together to prop up Telstra's position in the market to the detriment of competition and services, particularly in rural and regional Australia. That is why we are moving these amendments, because we think that at this point in time political interference is moving in that direction. I accept where you are coming from if you are arguing the case that you believe ministerial direction actually strengthens competition and will in fact improve services in the bush. But, quite frankly, I think the evidence has shown us otherwise. I think we want to achieve the same thingâ improving rural and regional servicesâbut we are at odds over the role that ministerial direction will play. I think that is why you feel the way you do about our amendments, but I hope that clarifies our intent with this amendment. As an opposition we have more faith in the independence of the ACCC in using the long-term interests of end users test than we have in ministers involving themselves in the decision making of the ACCC. So I hope that clarifies your concerns about Labor's position.</para><para>I would like to go to another matter that relates to the impact that the anticipatory undertakings have on pay TV. It is worth while laying out for the Senate in committee a number of the major concerns expressed during the consideration of this bill and the inquiry into this bill. One of the major concerns expressed not just by the Seven Network but also by Fairfax included the implications of this bill for pay TV. What we found out, of course, was that the anticipatory undertakings and exemption provisions of this bill did have a direct impact at the time on the negotiations that were occurring in relation to the Foxtel-Optus content-sharing deal. In fact, the successful passage of this bill enabled a crucial part of the Foxtel-Optus content-sharing deal to occur. The crucial part was that these anticipatory undertakings are a prerequisite for Foxtel's willingness to digitise their pay TV network. I, as well as many parties, have certainly expressed serious concern about this, because it is only with the successful passage of this bill that Foxtel will have the opportunity to seek anticipatory exemptions under these provisions so as to create an environmentâ effectively a six-months access holiday or up to 100,000 subscribers upon the digitisation of the pay TV network.</para><para>The government and other parties have been asked to excise the aspects of this bill that would relate to pay TV. Labor have not seen it as being appropriate for us to do that at this time, primarily because the ACCC will have to go through that formal process of listening to the arguments presented by Foxtel as to whether or not those anticipatory exemptions should be granted to digitise their service. So there will effectively be an opportunity for the ACCC to decide whether or not they believe anticipatory exemptions are an appropriate condition for the digitisation of the pay TV network. Foxtel have made it clear that they do see them as a prerequisite, hence our concern that there appears to be a too-cute-by-half aspect to the negotiations on the part of Foxtel and certainly by Telstra, given that they own that hybrid fibre coaxialâHFCâpay TV network and given their involvement in Foxtel. The minister has said on the record: </para><quote><para>... I have requested the ACCC to report to me in January 2003 on the wider competition implications of emerging industry structures in the Pay TV sector, including implications for the telecommunications sector.</para></quote><para>He has done this in the hope that this report will cast `further light on this issue'. Given the context of this bill providing the preconditions of the ACCC's formal contemplation of an exemption for a period of time or of set conditions for a future digitised Foxtel network, I would like to ask the minister about his key concerns over the emerging relationship between Telstra and the Foxtel network, particularly in the context of digitisation. I put it to you, Minister, that concerns have been expressed about Telstra's place in the pay TV market and that you yourself have commented about the concerns over that structure.</para><para>I ask the minister to give some assurance to the Senate that the structure of pay TV and its relationship with this bill will not in any way serve either to reduce competition in pay TV or to set in place unfair conditions in pay TV. Indeed, could the minister elucidate further his concerns about what he has called the implications of emerging industry structures in pay TV? I have to say that I interpret these as being concerns about new verticals and old verticals being re-established in the new digital pay TV regime, particularly when the regulatory authorities in most other jurisdictions around the world have sought to prevent a residual monopoly extending from telecommunications into other areas of carriage and infrastructure, such as pay TV. I would be very interested if you expressed your concerns, Minister, and provided the Senate with some assurance that this will not lead to any uncompetitive environment or suppression of true competition in our pay TV network, particularly the future digitised pay TV network.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>7376</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIt looks as though we are going to miss out on lunch, so maybe I will spend a couple of minutesâ</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">CHAIRMAN, The</name><name role="display">The CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>âIf you are quick, you might not, Minister.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>LD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name></talker><para>âI hope that is so, but I did see Senator Murray lurking and I suspect he will want more than his one minute of sunshine. The short answer to the question is this: I am indebted to Senator Lundy for effectively foreshadowing Labor's policyâa policy that has been a very badly kept secret in recent timesâwhich is to force Telstra out of Foxtel. I think that is a very serious step to take, particularly in the absence of any evidence that it is uncompetitive. We will see what the ACCC has to say about these issues and it may well express a view on a desirable industry structure in terms of vertical integration. However, that is not to say one should assume that because of an apprehension you need to fundamentally destruct the current industry. Yet, that is what Labor is proposing to do. We know that, Senator Lundy, because we have been told by a number of people and, quite clearly, when the time comes there will be an almighty explosion, I can assure you.</para></talk.start></continue><para>This current provision, it must be understood, still requires a public inquiry. The ACCC still has to satisfy itself that any proposal is in the long-term interests of end users. There can be no suggestion of access holidays, special deals or backdoor assistance; it has to meet a test which is very transparent and visible. The advice which will be forthcomingâI hope we will have it by early next year; I have not asked to have it by next year; I would have asked to have had it quite some time agoâwill address a number of issues which impact on the long-term future of the telecommunications and broadband industries. Things like video services will obviously be part and parcel of that. It may well address bundling; it may address the availability of new services; it may raise the need to ensure that there is full competition between HFC networks and the DSL networks. We know that Telstra is in both of those networks. I have made it plain that, if there is any indication that Telstra is running dead on DSL, we would take a very dim view. That is one thing; it is another thing to say that simply because they are in Foxtel and there is a possibility that they might act in a way that you disapprove of that would then justify a policy decision to excise them, presumably against their wishes and against the wishes of the shareholders in Telstra, not to mention the shareholders in the Foxtel consortium. That would be a very big step. So, we are ready for you when you finally make that announcement. In the meantime, we will see what the ACCC has to say. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>7377</page.no><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name><name.id>8HC</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ON</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âSenator Lundy is correct when she says that One Nation is very passionate about rural areas but that passion extends also to urban areas. Senator Lundy is wrong in her statement that Telstra has not been investing in the rural areas. Two years ago I did an extensive tour through Queensland and at well over 100 meetings the issue of Telstra's services was a major concern, yes. It was raised at each and every meeting during that tour around Queensland. This year I have been doing something similar and have had close to 50 meetings, at only two of which the issue of Telstra services in rural areas was raised. I would like to put very clearly on the record that I do not see any connection between people being satisfied with the service and making a commitment to privatise Telstra. I would not like to be misquoted in the media on that issue.</para></talk.start><para>For example, the government has put in place a program in relation to Internet access in rural areas, which has been administered by Telstra. Through that program a person in a remote area can get satellite access or hardwired cable access. Telstra is working extremely hard in rural areas implementing that today. So the commitment has been made by Telstra to improve the service in rural areas.</para><para>I also believe that by removing the minister's direction we are removing part of the possibility of the Senate overseeing an ACCC decision. Senator Lundy quite clearly said that they believe that the decision should stay with the ACCC. I do not believe it should. I believe that the decisions made by the ACCC should be able to be challenged in this place or supported if they are correct. I ask the minister: is it correct that if you were to give a direction to the ACCC under this legislation then the ACCC decision would be a disallowable instrument? That is my understanding of the bill. If that is the case then what you are doing is removing the ability of the Senate to be able to oversee and scrutinise an ACCC decision. I will be corrected if I am wrong, but it is my understanding that if the minister were to give a direction to the ACCC it would become a disallowable instrument and therefore come to this place.</para><para>Senator Lundy said that she is focusing on competition. I understand exactly where Senator Lundy is coming from, but we need a very careful balance in this legislation. There are times when being driven purely by competition can be detrimental to providing a service. Senator Lundy gave pay TV as an example, where under a competition regime multiple providers have rolled out the same cables down the same streets or strung cables on the same telegraph poles, power poles or whatever they are to create an unsightly mess in some of our areas. I believe that if the industry had had the ability to sit down together, go before the ACCC and set out an access regime for one single set of infrastructure then they would be a lot better off today. That is the example that I give in relation to finding this balance between competition and providing infrastructure that has a social and economic benefit for the community. I look forward to the minister giving us some clarification in relation to that direction. I place very clearly on the record that I believe that, for the purpose of the government being able to say that the ACCC has got it wrong in relation to a question of national interest, the ministerial direction should remain.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>7377</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI think I understand Senator Harris's concerns; however, we do take the view that ultimately the ACCC should not be subject to direction. The provisions that we are canvassing are really a notice in advance requiring the ACCC to have regard to government concerns. That notice is a disallowable instrument but any decision of the ACCC is not. Most decisions of the ACCC can be taken to higher courts or tribunals under ADJR legislation and probably other legislation as well. In that way, I think the system does allow those who are not happy with the ultimate outcome to challenge it in the courts. From the government's point of view, we quite rightly say that we think it is important for the ACCC to be aware in advance of our concerns so that they are not acting in ignorance and so that they can properly have regard to them. That document, as you say, is disallowable. </para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>7378</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThis is a complicated argument with good points on both sides.

The government provides substantial tax concessions for superannuation in order to promote self-provision in retirement. Appropriate restrictions on the release of superannuation moneys are of course required. The government recently increased the preservation age from 55 to 60 on a phased basis between the years 2015 and 2025. This means that for someone born before 1 July 1960 the preservation age will remain at 55 years, while for someone born after 30 June 1964 the preservation age will rise to 60 years. This change aims to reduce the opportunities for people to double-dipâ that is, to use their concessionally taxed superannuation benefits for non-retirement income purposes and then to access the age pension. What Senator Sherry appears to be referring to is a report that was apparently prepared by a temporary employee of the Department of Finance and Administration which raised the prospect of increasing the age pension age. This paper has absolutely no official status and the premise of the question is a complete furphy.</para></talk.start></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>7378</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMr President, I ask a supplementary question.

If that quote is correctly attributed to the Treasurer, it does not in any way mean that other options cannot be canvassed. The report that appears to have excited so much interest is an internal working document only and was prepared for the basis of an internal discussion. The Prime Minister has recently announced the establishment of an interdepartmental task force reporting to the Treasurer on labour force participation, particularly for older Australians who wish to continue to work; superannuation retirement incomes policy, which is extremely important; and managing expected increased government spending in areas affected by demographic change, particularly health and aged care. The work of the task force is under way and it is not surprising that the Treasurer would make some comment in relation to it. </para></talk.start></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Drought</title><page.no>7379</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>7379</page.no><name role="metadata">Lightfoot, Sen Ross</name><name role="display">Senator LIGHTFOOT</name><name.id>WP6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator the Hon.

This crippling drought needs attention in two ways: (1) to try and help those most severely affected with immediate help and (2) of course, we have to prepare for the time when the drought breaks, as it ultimately must, so that when it does break farmers can look forward to a future. The government has responded with additional measures for farmers, particularly those in New South Wales, and also with new measures for small business. Importantly, as well, there are new measures for workers whose jobs are at stake because of the impacts of the drought.</para></talk.start><para>The Prime Minister announced this morning an additional package of some $368 million, and that is on top of the $360 million already committed for drought relief. Previously, the government had announced income support in areas where a prima facie EC, exceptional circumstances, case had been made. We have also previously announced the reduction of the 12-month waiting period for farm management deposit withdrawals. We had mentioned, in new initiatives over the last couple of weeks, an additional $2 million for counselling services; $10 million for a drought recovery Australian Government Envirofund program; $1 million for pest management to help farmers in those areas affected; $5 million for the Farmhand appeal; and $1 million to the Country Women's Association. </para><para>Today the Prime Minister announced that, for farmers having a one in 20-year rainfall deficiency over the nine months between March and November of this year, there would be interim income support. That is at around $600 per fortnight for a family. If more than 80 per cent of farmers in a state fall into this category of the one in 20 over the nine months then every farmer in the state will automatically be involvedâthat is, of course, what has happened in New South Wales. That will happen, should that statistic occur, in other states as well. All farmers in New South Wales are now eligible for interim income support. </para><para>As well, there is an interest rate relief subsidy of five per cent, or 50 per cent of the rate being paid by the individual farmer, on new or additional loans of up to $100,000. That applies not only to farmers caught up by this new program but also to people receiving existing and prima facie relief payments. Importantly, in this relief the government has recognised that small business also suffers. A range of measures has been introduced for small business in drought affected areas, and the details of that are on the government's web site. As well, workers have not been forgotten. Where they have lost their job because of the impacts of drought, they will be involved in a new Work for the Dole program. They will be given access to a lot of facilities that are not usually available quickly. It is a good package. I ask the Labor Party to support it. I know that they need some support from the state Labor governments and we need our colleagues over the road here to get the states to help. We want them to make an effort to help. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Superannuation Complaints Tribunal: Appointments</title><page.no>7379</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>7379</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is to Senator Coonan, the Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Revenue.

Last week, COAG endorsed a comprehensive range of measures dealing with hand gun law reform. It accepted the 28 recommendations made by the Australian Police Ministers Council and looked at the question of how hand guns can be determined to be lawful or otherwise by virtue of the barrel length, the calibre and the capacity of shot. This was a very important decision, and it balanced public safety and security on one side with the interests of legitimate sporting shooters on the other. What COAG agreed to in relation to hand guns was that there be measures to ban semiautomatic hand guns with a minimum barrel length below 120 millimetres and revolvers and single-shot hand guns with a minimum barrel length below 100 millimetres, and that all hand guns are to have a maximum capacity of 10 shots. In relation to calibre, the option agreed to by COAG will apply a maximum calibre of up to .38, with a provision of a calibre of up to .45 for specially accredited sporting events, agreed to by COAG following some further consultation with the Sporting Shooters Advisory Council, which I have set up.</para></talk.start><para>We believe that these measures will see more than 500 hand gun models banned. We will also, of course, see a buyback situation, which will be introduced to assist in the removal of banned hand guns from the community. Firearm owners will be offered fair compensation for those prohibited hand guns. A list of hand gun makes and models to be prohibited, together with values, will be prepared in consultation with experts in each jurisdiction. As far as funding is concerned, the Commonwealth will provide $15 million of funds remaining from the 1996 buyback, with the costs to be shared on the basis of two-thirds from the Commonwealth and one-third from each jurisdiction of the states and territories respectively. This buyback scheme will operate from 1 July 2003 to 1 January 2004. An amnesty will be run in conjunction with the buyback for people to surrender illegally held hand guns from 1 July 2003 to 1 January 2004.</para><para>What we have here is cooperation across the country between chief ministers, premiers and the Prime Minister in relation to the Commonwealth's initiative following the Monash tragedy. The Prime Minister originally proposed the hand gun law reform, and, after consultation with the states and territories, we had that agreement the other day. They also adopted other measures which relate to graduated access, a probationary period for people who want to join the sport, a period of 12 months relating to the acquisition of a hand gunâfor the first six months there will be no ownership of a hand gun and for the next six months legal possession would be restricted to two hand guns of a restricted typeâand minimum participation rates to qualify as a genuine sporting shooter. Tighter requirements will need to be met in terms of minimum participation rates by the person concerned. There are other provisions relating to medical reporting, the authority of clubs to expel members and measures to prevent club-shopping by individuals. This is a great initiative and a great decision by the governments of Australia and is, once again, the result of the leadership of the Prime Minister on what is a very important issue for all Australians. </para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Fuel: Ethanol</title><page.no>7381</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>7381</page.no><name role="metadata">Hutchins, Sen Steve</name><name role="display">Senator HUTCHINS</name><name.id>84P</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is directed to Senator Coonan, the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer.

He found on checking that there were a number of letters received in his office on the ethanol issue from various sources. The Prime Minister's office did get a letter from Mr Honan; it was not passed to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister's office has also spoken to a number of parties about options for promoting the ethanol industry, which included the Australian Biofuels Association and people with a different view.

What is appropriate for me to repudiateâand I do so wholeheartedlyâis the suggestion that there is anything improper in what has been done in respect of putting together this policy, which of course has been put forward for very good reasons. The improved legislative and administrative arrangements that the government has announced should not lead to an increase in petrol prices. Why would they, you might ask. The petrol market is very price competitive and parties in the market are hardly likely to use inputs to make fuel unless those inputs lead to a price competitive product. The current law allows ethanol to be imported free of customs duty for blending with petrol in Australia, and very little has been imported for this purpose. I fail to see how this measure will affect the price of supply of any petrol outlets that rely on imported ethanol. It is appropriate that ethanol, which is an alternative fuel to petrol, is taxed on a similar basis to petrol.

It is quite obvious that there is nothing at all irreconcilable with the Attorney-General implementing the one matter that relates to mediation and the other recommendations being implemented with the blessing of COAG.

It should be emphasised that the report involves events that occurred in the 1980s in Canada's health system, not in Australia. I would also like to reassure Australians that we have one of the safest blood systems in the world. In 1990 we were one of the first countries in the world to introduce a first-generation mass screening test for hepatitis C, shortly after the new antibody test became available. During the mid to late 1980s the test available for hepatitis C was the surrogate test and it was only able to detect liver dysfunction.

Two expert hepatologists, Professor Peter Angus and Geoff Farrell are supporting Professor Barraclough in his work. As part of the process, Professor Barraclough is consulting with all appropriate parties, including the Australian Red Cross blood service and CSL Ltd, as well as state and territory health departments. I think it is important for the community to understand that the claims that Professor Barraclough is looking at relate to a period in 1990, not today.

I am really getting very tired of the Labor Party talking about Medicare, as though in 1996 we inherited a healthy, functioning health care system. The fact is we did not. We did not inherit a healthy, functioning system, we inherited a system where public hospitals had huge strain, and we have reduced the strain on the public hospitals. Labor view Medicare as a funding model, not as a health care model. They are only interested in what happens at the counter, not what happens in the surgery. As health minister, I am concerned about Medicare as the deliverer of good health outcomes for all Australians, not just for those in the inner suburbs of Melbourne and Sydney.</para></talk.start><para>Our list of achievements is very long. We have increased spending on Medicare by $2 billion from $6 billion to $8 billion. The number of services covered by Medicare will increase this year to 220 million, 25 million more than in 1996. We are investing $560 million in the Rural Health Strategy, which is already delivering results. I have said before that the number of GPs practising in rural and remote areas has increased from 5,700 in 1997-98 to 6,363 in 2000-01.</para><para>Labor left us with an absolute maldistribution of doctors, and had we undertaken whatâand I should not mention her nameâ Carmen Lawrence was advocating, which was that we reduce the number of medical school places, we would now have even fewer doctors. But that was what Labor were advocating and the deans of medicine opposed it. We have increased the number of doctors in rural areas, with an 11 per cent increase over three years. We have committed $80 million to an outer metropolitan program to encourage more GPs in this area. We were left with too few doctors in rural areas and too few doctors in outer metropolitan areas. We have also increased the number of doctors in training by 160. In medical schools, we have increased the number of GPs in specialist training. With respect to visits to GPs, about seven out of 10 continue to be provided at no cost to patients, and about eight out of 10 visits to GPs by patients aged 65 and over continue to be provided at no cost to the patient.  </para><para>Government spending on general practice, including Medicare rebates, a practice incentive program and general practice immunisation incentives, will increase this year, representing an increase of around 24 per cent in the four years up to and including 2003. The Labor Party were paying doctors but they were not vaccinating children. Fifty-three per cent of our kids were vaccinated then; now we have over 90 per cent of our kids being vaccinated. Three out of four GPs receive practice incentive payments. This year, the government has allocated a further $242 million to the program, $49 million more than last year. The average payment under the practice incentive program in 2001 and 2002 per full-time equivalent doctor was $15,149. This is expected to rise to $17,928 this year, an increase of $2,779. This is so that doctors will do things like deal with patients who have diabetes and assist them with their management, deal with people who have asthma and assist them with an asthma management plan, vaccinate our children and produce health outcomes. We are focused on health outcomes. Labor was focused on the financial side, financing health rather than producing health outcomes. </para><para>In terms of GP remuneration, I am committed to working with the profession on affordable and sustainable outcomes. I point out, though, that in the last six years under Labor, the Medicare rebate for a standard GP consultation increased by only $1.70. Under the Howard government, it has increased by $4.20. More importantly, under the last six years of the previous Labor government, the Medicare rebate for the longer level D consultation increased from $62 to $65.20âa rise of $3.20. Under the Howard government, it has increased from $65 to $80âa rise of $15.20.

I wish her well in her last few weeks in this chamber. The recent midyear update on the budget does show the strength and resilience of our economy. But the midyear update also shows that Australians are now paying a lower level of tax to GDP than when we came to office in 1996. Since we came to office, total income tax as a share of GDP has fallen from 17.1 per cent to 16.4 per cent in 2001-02. Looking at personal income tax, it has fallen from 12.7 per cent of GDP when we came to office to 11.8 per cent in 2001-02. </para></talk.start><para>Of course, that is a reflection of the fact that we gave the biggest income tax cuts in the history of this countryâ$12 billion worth of tax cuts, which are reflected in those figures which show the ratio of income tax to GDP. Our total Commonwealth tax revenue this year is actually less as a proportion of GDP than it was a decade ago, and it is going to stay that way well into the forward years. Of course, as part of our efforts to ease the tax burden on Australians we have provided things like the private health insurance rebate, a tax cut and family tax assistance. We cut Labor's fuel excise by 1Â½c a litre, and we abolished Labor's petrol indexation. Our policy is to keep tax as low as possible, commensurate with providing Australians with the services which they expect and, of course, with budget responsibility. </para><para>It is the opposition's desire to get up the sort of line that Labor are actually not the party that believes in high taxes and high spending but that it is the coalition party. Of course, not even the Labor Party believe that. If you look at some of their high-spending promises, they will inevitably lead to higher taxation if they ever do get back into office. The highest tax burden on individuals ever recorded in this country was in 1986-87 under the then Labor government when tax was 14.2 per cent of GDP compared with 11.8 per cent now under us. Labor's record on tax is abominable. You should never believe anything they say on this subject. The nation will never forget the l-a-w law tax cuts before the 1993 election which, of course, Labor never delivered. They have no credibility. </para><para>They are also trying to perpetrate the nonsensical idea that the GST is a Commonwealth tax. The GST is not a Commonwealth tax; it is a tax that is paid entirely to the state premiers. It is not available for spending by the Commonwealth; it is a tax that we collect for the states and territories. Every single Labor premier is very grateful that we collect that tax for them and they spend it, not the Commonwealth. Even if, for the purpose of debate, you hypothetically assumed that the GST was a Commonwealth tax, which I hasten to add it is not, then to make a comparison you have to deduct all the state taxes that the GST replacedâand of course they were numerous. If you do that, then the tax to GDP ratio still falls as a result of the new tax system, with total tax revenue at 22.6 per cent in 2002-03, down from 23.5 per cent of GDP in 1996-97. So we are responsible for the biggest tax cuts ever in Australian history. We are about easing the tax burden on Australians. We want to keep managing this economy well, managing the budget well, and delivering further tax cuts to Australians.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Nuclear Energy: Lucas Heights Reactor</title><page.no>7387</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>7387</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is directed to Senator Alston, the Minister representing the Minister for Science.

ANSTO undertakes hazard reduction measures each year before the summer to ensure that adequate firebreaks exist. There are over 100 fire hydrants located around the centre's boundary fence as part of its firefighting infrastructure, together with an independent water supply and trained bushfire volunteers. The separation distances between buildings with nuclear built materials and the bush prevent any direct bushfire threat to these buildings. Bushfires do not present a credible threat to the safety of the HIFAR research reactor or other significant ANSTO facilities. At no point during current or past bushfires has there been any direct threat to the HIFAR reactor. Indeed, HIFAR's strong containment building is designed to withstand greater heat loadings than could be achieved by a bushfire. Fire protection measures are part of the design of all ANSTO buildings and emergency arrangements for fire are regularly and exhaustively reviewed. Comprehensive emergency plans exist for the facility.</para><para>ANSTO, in consultation with the New South Wales fire brigades and bushfire brigades, has prepared a comprehensive assessment of past bushfires, and lessons learned are incorporated into emergency plans. The potential hazard from bushfires has been taken into account in the design of the replacement reactor. The ANSTO emergency plan, which is integrated with the local district and state emergency plans, specifies the roles and responsibilities of emergency services, such as police, fire brigade and ambulance, in the event of any emergency such as a bushfire threat to the site. The plan has been developed by the ANSTO local liaison working party, comprised of representatives of the New South Wales Police Force, New South Wales fire brigades, the Ambulance Service of New South Wales, the New South Wales Department of Health, the New South Wales Environment Protection Authority, Sutherland Shire Council and the New South Wales State Emergency Service. An independent review in 2000 by an expert appointed by the New South Wales government concluded that the plan is adequate. I hope that demonstrates that these matters are of serious concern and that all that could feasibly be done is being done. The end result is the judgment that bushfires do not present a credible threat to the safety of those facilities, and Labor will therefore have to find another, presumably more specious, reason for trying to justify a relocation of the site.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>7388</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI thank the minister for his answer.

How would an outcome of this sort further the government's vision for the arts of encouraging excellence in artistic endeavour and access to Australia's rich cultural heritage?</para></talk.start></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>7389</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI can confirm for Senator Ridgeway that the government is reviewing cultural agencies in order to examine the potential for achieving efficiencies whilst, of course, maintaining the ability of those agencies to achieve the government's cultural objectives.

I can recall some years ago we got Mr David Gonski to do a review of the various film bodies to see whether it was appropriate to have three, four or five bodies all in that general area, whether they all served a useful purpose on a stand-alone basis or whether there was some scope for rationalisation.

On the Myer inquiry, I think Senator Ridgeway would well know that we have a very impressive track recordâ$92 million for the film industry and $45 million for the major performing arts. The Myer inquiry report, which we received I think on 6 September, is one that many people in the industry have wholeheartedly supported. A number of them have been to see me already, urging its implementation.

Can the minister confirm reports that the initial Navy Board of Inquiry into the Westralia fire was held before the ship's engines had been stripped down and examined?</para><para>There was no âinitialâ Navy Board. The Navy Board of Inquiry (BOI) was directed by the terms of reference to determine the cause of the fire, which it did as the result of the evidence of the Western Australian Police Arson Squad Report as to the cause being the failure of a fuel supply hose. While other theories were initially submitted to the Board their proponent did not press them. None of those theories or the evidence of the Arson Squad required any investigation of the internal elements of the engines. The internal examination of the engines was done in 2 stages as part of the restoration of the ship, not to determine the cause of the fire; first by way of determining what if any damage had been sustained by the engines as the result of the fire, second by way of work commissioned as preventative maintenance, intended to ensure the engines served the planned period between major overhauls and was based on recommendations flowing from the first fire damage report</para><para>2.	How could that BOI have thoroughly examined the causes of the fire if it did not have the report from the detailed engine inspection?</para><para>As the issue for the Board was the cause of the fire and this was determined on the basis of reliable evidence, subjected to full testing by cross examination from all represented parties, it was not consistent with the role of the Board to order a stripping of the engines when there was no probative value as to the cause of the fire in following that course.</para><para>3.	Does it show that a number of faults other than the flexible fuel line could have caused the fire?</para><para>No. The first report addressed the fire related damage to the engine and included the results of an examination of the two cylinders on the Starboard Main Engine around which the fire had erupted. The report stated âCombustion spaces were in the condition that might be expected for an engine that had been operated on lower loads in recent times.â The nature of the examination could nevertheless have been expected to identify such other causes had they been present. No such matters were raised in the report. The second report was based on the findings of a substantial overhaul operation concerning the technical state of the engine which included taking measurements of wear and distortion of components. While some wear and distortion was identified this was consistent with the use of the engine and not of any failure of the engine or component. Both of the examinations and reports were provided by Rolls Royce.</para><para>4.

No doubt in some cases the lack of response is simply to avoid accountability, and senators will have noticed that it is often the same ministers or departments who have this aggressive ethos towards parliamentary government and the rights of senators to seek information.</para><para>The first unanswered question of note, No. 676, concerns the savings proposals of the Department of Veterans' Affairs over the last five years, which I suspect are a total sham. As the Senate knows from the estimates function, which we all explore several times a year, portfolio and new spending proposals are often required to be offset by an equivalent saving. This is a useful discipline as it forces scrutiny of ineffective programs and expenditure and focuses minds on real priorities. </para><para>However, I suspect that this process is little more than an elaborate game, particularly if the savings option is nebulous and difficult to cost. I suspect the answer I am awaiting from the Minister for Veterans' Affairs will tell me that many of the savings options nominated over the last five years cannot be calculated because there are simply no measures to do so or, what is more likely, no-one has ever checked. I will be happy to be proven wrong but I suspect that the game is that, having got the new policy money and kept the minister happy at budget time with lots of new giveaways, you forget about the veracity of the savings and, where your programs are standing appropriationsâthat is, open-ended, as many are in Veterans' Affairsâyou simply come back in additional estimates and get topped up. By that stage, of course, time has moved on, no-one goes back to reconcile the record, and the numbers all get lost in the wash of the next budget estimates. So much for the Charter of Budget Honesty!</para><para>I have also asked a detailed question on the Veterans' Home Care Program, which is the equivalent of HACC but which is now the subject of substantial cutbacks to the extent that some veterans are wishing they had remained in HACC. Once again, this is a major embarrassment. While the departmental spin doctors will no doubt try and put a good light on it for the minister, the fact remains that the program is being cut back because the estimates of demand and budget were quite inadequate. As we have now discovered in estimates, management of this program is worse than we thought and the minister has blatantly misled veterans and war widows by a spurious claim that this year the budget for home care has increased by $8 million. The facts are that last year's budget was the same as this year'sâ$59 millionâbut it was underspent and that $8 million went back to the Treasury. There is no increase at all, although we hope the full budget will be spent this year.</para><para>I also draw to the chamber's attention unanswered question No. 631. That question was about grant programs, which are of course the mother of all pork barrels. We also learned at Senate estimates that the Repatriation Commission and the Department of Veterans' Affairs have become the political promotion vehicle for the minister and the Howard government. Those who believe this is an area of bipartisanship are mistaken. It is no wonder that the minister would like to avoid scrutiny as to where the grant money has gone. It is a similar case with question No. 674, which seeks information on departmental regional visits where advice of such visits is provided only to government members and senators. The Department of Veterans' Affairs is now completely complicit in this politicisation, and the lack of an answer can be seen as a confession to that accusation.</para><para>Finally, question No. 744 seeks an update on earlier information about the number and type of compensation claims lodged by ADF personnel serving in East Timor, under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. This is a major cause for concern. As stated at estimates, because of the provisions of the Privacy Act, details of these claims cannot be passed to the ADF health service. This means that, within the many hundreds of compensation claims accepted, there will be a considerable portion of disabilities which will be sufficient to render the claimant unfit for duty. Yet they are able to conceal that fact, which makes one wonder about the credibility of the assessment process in the first place. I would have thought that at least the Minister for Defence would have liked to know about this as it is potentially a very serious fraud, to say the least. I could go on question by question but the issue is the same: if we in this place cannot get straightforward questions answered, where is the accountability? The only thing that is worse is the refusal to answer at all, but at least we have this procedure of asking the minister and taking note. </para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title><type>Questions Without Notice</type><page.no>7395</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Superannuation: Preservation Age</title><page.no>7395</page.no></subdebateinfo></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Superannuation Complaints Tribunal: Appointments</title><page.no>7395</page.no></subdebateinfo></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Insurance: Public Liability</title><page.no>7395</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>7395</page.no><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator LUDWIG</name><name.id>84N</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer (Senator Coonan) to questions without notice asked today.</para></motion><para>It was surprising, if not downright incredible, to hear what the Assistant Treasurer said today when she was given an opportunity to explain the inconsistency between, on the one hand, the answer that she gave in this house to the question on the report by Justice Ipp and, on the other hand, the matter she raised in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline>. </para><para>I suspect that Senator Coonan, with respect, is too concerned about her personal affairs to worry about the questions that are asked in here. It would pay her more to listen to the questions and answer them. The question that was asked by Senator Collins last week and Senator Crossin today was: what steps has the minister taken to promote the implementation of recommendation 57 of the Ipp report on the law of negligence? That was where it started. Recommendation 57 of the Ipp report deals with structured settlements and mediation. The answer we got back was really all over the place.

If she has done nothing about it, then one wonders whether she has just forgotten her role as Assistant Treasurer. It appears that she must have.

So what we have discovered is that Senator Coonan is more interested in talking to the papers than in talking to the Senate. She comes in here and says, `I've got a blank'âshe is like a rabbit startled by a spotlight. But when she then takes the trouble to talk to a paper she becomes very effusive. She manages to give the media the whole box and dice.

Indeed, on 15 November the minister met for the fourth time with relevant state and territory ministers as well as with a representative of the Australian Local Government Association to discuss public liability insurance. As a result of those meetings, there is agreement between all levels of government on the need for the introduction of measures aimed at reducing and containing claims costs and improving the affordability and availability of public liability insurance. This follows the historic in-principle agreement reached at their previous meeting to move to a nationally consistent law of negligence. At that meeting on 15 November, the ministers agreed to a package of reforms implementing key recommendations of the review of the law of negligence: the so-called Ipp report, to which Senator Ludwig referred in his remarks.</para></talk.start><para>The government has taken leadership, brought the states together and achieved an agreement on a package of reforms. The governments have agreed that the key Ipp recommendations that go to establishing liability should be implemented on a nationally consistent basis. The suggestion that the states and territories will not introduce uniform legislation is false. Each jurisdiction has agreed to introduce legislation on a nationally consistent basis as a matter of high priority. Each of the states and territories recognises the importance of consistent legislation to ensure that the common law does not diverge over time. At that meeting it was further agreed that a system of thresholds or scales for general damages coupled with restrictions on legal costs is an imperative; it is noted that most states are moving in this direction. The minister also confirmed that the federal government would amend the Trade Practices Act to support reforms that were nationally consistent, and they agreed in principle to amend areas of inconsistency. Ministers agreed that the national package should have a significant impact on alleviating the public liability crisis and reinform insurers of the importance of quickly and fully passing on the benefits of reform to consumers.</para><para>An actuarial assessment of the economic impact of national reforms to negligence law on the affordability and availability of public liability insurance was also presented to ministers at that meeting on 15 November. The assessment noted that, if key quantifiable elements of the review of the law of negligence were implemented, an initial reduction in public liability premiums of 13Â½ per cent could be expectedâa significant achievement. The assessment also suggested that the behavioural effects of adopting the suite of recommendations on the definitions of `negligence' and `duty of care' and other Ipp recommendations on liability reform should result in significantly larger savings over time. The actuarial report was supported by industry representatives present at the meeting. The representatives assured ministers from the states and the Commonwealth that adoption of the Ipp recommendations will increase the availability of public liability insurance, particularly in the community sector, and bring certainty and stability to pricing. They agreed with the findings of the PricewaterhouseCoopers report that the reduction in claims costs due to the Ipp reforms will flow through to reduce premiums by an estimated 13Â½ per cent.</para><para>At that meeting, ministers also agreed to consider in detail the merits of proportionate liability and professional standards legislation as a means of addressing problems surrounding professional indemnity insurance. There was strong agreement on proportionate liability for economic loss, with some jurisdictions committed to implementing legislation and others close to finalising their position. All of that has been achieved as a result of the four meetings that Senator Coonan initiated with representatives of the states and territories. The achievements to date and the forward work plan were therefore put to the meeting of the Council of Australian Governments for endorsement. That was achieved last Friday. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>7397</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âWe have just had from Senator Chapman an extraordinarily comprehensive outline of what Senator Coonan has been doing in respect of the implementation of the Ipp report, which deals with a whole range of issues with regard to insurance matters. The Ipp report makes recommendations on some important aspects of insurance in this country. Senator Chapman has spent five minutes outlining to us what Senator Coonan has been doing in apparently taking a lead role in activating action in response to the recommendations of the Ipp report. According to Senator Chapman, apparently Senator Coonan has been involved in these meetings no less than four times. Why is it, then, that last Wednesday in the Senate, in response to a direct and clear question from my colleague Senator Collins about what she was doing about the recommendations in the Ipp report, the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, Senator Coonan, said, `Absolutely nothing'?</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>BH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name></talker><para>âShe explained all that in question time.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name></talker><para>âShe did not explain it, Senator Hill. We have got a case of a minister who either forgot all about the activities that have been outlined by Senator Chapmanâthe minister is absolutely incompetent if she cannot remember all the activities she carried out in respect of the recommendations of the Ipp report that Senator Chapman has very kindly accredited to herâ or was misleading the Senate. I find it amazing that on Wednesday of last week the minister came in here and said she had done `absolutely nothing' about the recommendations of the Ipp report and then on the Friday in the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> she claimed credit for all the activity she had been carrying out. There is a fundamental contradiction in Senator Coonan's response.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Two other questions were raised in the Senate today. The issue of former Senator Michael Baume's appointment to the position of either chair or deputy chair of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal was raised by my colleague Senator Cook. Senator Baume, a longstanding Liberal senator in this place, a mate of the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, was appointed by the former minister, Mr Hockey, as a member of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal last year, just prior to the election being called. Former Senator Baume had been the consul generalâthat is effectively a type of ambassadorâin, I think, New York for a number of years, representing Australia. As I understand it, it was an appointment made by the Prime Minister for his former mateâa current mate, apparently. Then Mr Baume bobs up on the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal.</para><para>We have looked at the contribution of former Senator Baume to superannuation matters while he was a member of the Senate. It is absolutely nothing. Here is a person appointed as a member of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal who has no record of activity in, knowledge of or involvement in superannuation matters in this chamber. It is not as though the Labor Party are opposed to political appointmentsâthey do have their place. However, here we have a bloke appointed to the consul general's position in New York for a couple of years. It is a very lucrative position and he is a mate of the Prime Minister. It is not as though we are saying that all political appointments are inappropriate but he has come back to Australia after being in New York for a couple of years and he ends up on the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal.</para><para>With credit to Senator Watson, if it were Senator Watson who was being proposed as chair or deputy chair of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal, the Labor Party would not be complaining. But this bloke, who has already had one job, and who has absolutely no record of service in the area of superannuation, is being touted by this government as a future chair or deputy chair of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunalâa tribunal that is responsible for guarding the superannuation of nine million Australians. A bloke who has absolutely no involvement or record in the area of superannuation is being touted by this government for an appointment to safeguard the superannuation of nine million Australians. It is absolutely outrageous.

It is true that before 15 November this year there was some possibility that we may not have reached unanimous agreement amongst the states. There was a suggestion that they may go their own way in a number of areas. It is a tribute to the leadership and the chairmanship provided by Senator Coonan that, at that historic meeting, she drew all the people involved, the state premiers and others, to the need to get some commonality of approach and uniformity. This has been achieved. Undoubtedly, that date is an important milestone for Australia. Public liability insurance in terms of awards and costs had become quite out of hand and was unfortunately affecting much of Australia's way of life. Senator Coonan, as Senator Chapman has indicated, has had four important meetings which have brought together the contentious and outstanding issues to get a very important resolution.</para></talk.start><para>In raising this today the question I have to ask the opposition is: where have you been? Haven't you been reading newspapers? Haven't you been keeping abreast of these important issues? Are you out of contact with the community you are supposed to serve? Are you not fully acquainted with the problems and the solutions that Senator Coonan and her colleagues have been able to bring to bear? In a sense, I think this take note debate and the matters that have come from the government are a reflection on the Labor Party's lack of closeness with the electorate they serve. Maybe they gave that responsibility to their colleagues in the lower house. It is an important responsibility, whether you are in this house or in the House of Representatives, to keep very much abreast of the issues that affect your electorate. Certainly, public liability is one of these issues.</para><para>What came out of that important and historic agreement is that ministers have agreed to a package of reforms which implement key recommendations of the review of the law of negligence, which we refer to as the Ipp report. It is a very important report. To suggest that the Commonwealth has not taken a leadership role and that it has not taken adequate action in relation to the limited areas is to forget that it has a limited responsibilityâbut it has had a coordinating role. It has fulfilled that coordinating role remarkably well, and it would appear that we are going to get some very satisfactory outcomes.</para><para>The Commonwealth, of course, has introduced the <inline ref="R1573">Taxation Laws Amendment (Structured Settlements) Bill 2002</inline>. The bill is designed to provide tax concessions for periodic payments to seriously injured people who receive large damages so they are not disadvantaged by taking periodic payments rather than a lump sum. Again, this is another initiative of Senator Coonan and it is a bill that has gone through this place. For people to raise questions of the nature that have been raised today is quite extraordinary.</para><para>I find it disappointing that members of the Senate raise questions about the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal and attack the integrity of Michael Baume. Michael Baume was certainly a very fine senator. Assertions have been made that he has been a mate of the Prime Minister. If prime ministers and all of us had friends with the loyalty and respect of Michael Baume, this world would be a much better place. It is true; I acknowledge that he has been a great friend of the Prime Minister. That is nothing to be snide about. That is a tribute both to the character of the Prime Minister and to Michael Baume. They have a lot to offer. Naturally, Mr McDonald, I understand, is not seeking reappointment to the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>7398</page.no><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display">Senator CROSSIN</name><name.id>7Y6</name.id><electorate>Northern Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI also rise to take note of the answers given by Senator Coonan today.

The very first question on this day was asked because, again, we wanted to get this minister to clarify for us exactly where the government are going in relation to their proposals to increase the preservation age to 65 or 70 years, as well as phasing out the age pension.

She was not prepared to deny it at all. This is a government that has made it quite clear that it wants Australians working much longer, regardless of their circumstances. Given the kind of signalling that we have had from government ministers over the last few months, it is no doubt that we, along with the Australian public, should expectâany time now, I supposeâthat this government will announce an increase in the preservation age to 65 or 70 years as well as the phasing out of the age pension. This will probably happen, we suspect, in the 2003 budget. The government is doing this because it refuses to do anything to deal with the adequacy of retirement incomes. So what it wants to do is make sure that more people work for longer. It wants to ensure that Australians work until they are at least 70 years of age.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Have a look at the measures that are already in place. The preservation age was increased by the Liberal government from 55 to 60 years as part of the 1997 budget. They increased the age at which a person can contribute to super from 65 to 70 as part of the 1996-97 budget. Then, as part of their 2001 election commitments, it was increased to 75 years. Let us have a look at some of the minister's comments, which will show quite clearly why we believe the government have an agenda of getting Australians to work till they are 70. It is an agenda of increasing the preservation age of superannuation from 60 to 70 years, which means you will not be able to touch that superannuation component until you reach that age. On 21 December last year on the <inline font-style="italic">AM</inline> radio program, the minister said:</para><quote><para>We want to move superannuation along the track of phasing out any need to rely on social security ...</para></quote><para>So there was the first warning bell that went off.

I will name a few: the National Museum, the National Gallery of Australia, the National Portrait Gallery and the National Maritime Museum. The answer from Senator Alston suggested that there was a need for a review in order to achieve some efficiency in relation to resources. It seemed to me to be an argument suggesting that there were a number of things that were going to come out through the review process. One thing that is very clearly mooted at the moment is talk of entry fees being imposed upon many of these institutions which currently enjoy free access, particularly to the general public and more particularly to school groups. I think it is of concern that this is the path that the government are going down. They are suggesting that, because of the bean counters over at the Department of Treasury and the Department of Finance and Administration looking at the budget bottom line, art institutions are not paying for themselves and somehow need to be held accountable for what is regarded as inefficient use of moneys.</para><para>The other thing that needs to be said is that it is disingenuous on the part of the government to suggest also that it is supporting the pursuit of artistic excellence when it comes to addressing the funding needs of our cultural institutions in this country, particularly when you consider what has come out of the recent Myer inquiry and the Guldberg reportâthat it is clear on the face of it that for every $1 that is invested in the visual arts sector there is usually a $3 return. And we are talking about a sector of the arts industry where some 20,000 people are employed. We are talking about $160 million being returned annually in terms of their contribution to the Australian economy, and now we have a government talking about introducing fees. Not only that, we have a government that is talking about the possibility of amalgamations. There is a suggestion that, of these 15 national institutions, amalgamations may occur between the National Portrait Gallery just down the road and the National Gallery, and between Screensound and the National Archives.</para><para>This is of concern because it goes to the question of the public accessibility to these organisations and it fails to recognise that, even where an economic argument is developed, clearly from the range of reports that have been put forward, not all of these institutions can survive for themselves. More particularly, the minister, Senator Alston, failed to give any answers to questions that I asked in relation to the non-budgetary support that might be given to implement the recommendations from the Myer inquiry into the visual arts sector, particularly in relation to a tax ruling from the tax office on the definition of a professional arts practitioner and, in addition to that, whether there would be any decision to introduce resale royalty rights in this country. These are important. When you consider the range of recommendations that have been put forward through the Myer report, they are indeed very small commitments in terms of what the government can do to shore up the visual arts sector in this country. At the moment, all the government seems to be doing is looking at the budgetary bottom line without thinking about what other incentives might be put in place to support this industryâto support 20,000 workers and an industry that is contributing $160 million annually.</para><para>This is pertinent at a time when we consider that, even for the resale royalty rights, the only thing that has been asked for there is for $250,000 to be set aside to allow a feasibility study to examine how such a scheme could be put in place in Australia to bring us into line with our counterparts in other parts of the world. This is particularly important to me when you consider that in many Indigenous communities, particularly those that have thriving artists in rural and remote locations, virtually the only job available is producing artworks for the art markets in Australia and abroad.

The offences in this Bill are designed to combat the increasing interstate trade in illicit firearms, which includes the trafficking of illicit handguns. Research indicates that those who engage in firearms crime are invariably sourcing their weapons illegitimately and do not comply with licensing and registration requirements. The offences in the Bill impose tough penalties on those who in the course of trafficking firearms across interstate borders breach State and Territory firearms laws.</para><para>The Bill's new people smuggling offences would cover smuggling activity not already covered by the Migration Act 1958. In particular, the offences would target the involvement of Australian citizens and residents in overseas people smuggling operations, and smuggling activities coordinated from Australia. Aggravated people smuggling offences would provide larger penalties for people smugglers who smuggle five or more people, and smugglers who endanger the life, plan to exploit or otherwise ill-treat those people being smuggled. </para><para>These offences would broaden the focus of Australia's people smuggling legislation, and would demonstrate Australia's commitment to combating people smuggling in both Australia and the region. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Reasons for Urgency</inline></para><para>It is desirable that the measures in the Bill be in place as soon as possible, to strengthen firearms laws in line with agreement on 6 December 2002 by the Council of Australian Governments to improve community safety and control access to firearms, particularly handguns.</para><para>Timely passage of this Bill would implement an important measure in the combined Commonwealth, State and Territory effort to fight the spread of illegal firearms, and emphasises the priority the Commonwealth places on strengthening national firearms controls.</para><para>The Commonwealth's timely adoption of firearms trafficking offences is consistent with the aim of introducing increased penalties for trafficking. State and Territory maximum penalties for the illegal possession and sale of a firearm are generally significantly lower than those being proposed under the Commonwealth's legislative amendment.</para><para>Passage of the people smuggling offences by the end of this year would fulfil the commitment made by Australia at the Ministerial Conference on People Smuggling, Trafficking in Persons and Related Transnational Crime, held in Bali in February this year, to combat people smuggling in the region.</para><para>(Circulated by authority of the Minister for Justice and Customs)</para><para>âââââ</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">FINANCIAL SECTOR LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2)</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Purpose of the Bill </inline></para><para>The Bill amends seven Acts relating to the financial sector.

In accordance with the terms of the standing order, the publication of the documents was authorised. In accordance with the usual practice and with the concurrence of the Senate I ask that the documents be incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The documents read as follows</inline>â</para><para>GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE JUNE 2002 REPORT BY THE SENATE RURAL AND REGIONAL AFFAIRS AND TRANSPORT LEGISLATION COMMITTEE ON âTHE ADMINISTRATION BY THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORT AND REGIONAL SERVICES OF AUSTRALIAN MOTOR VEHICLE STANDARDS UNDER THE MOTOR VEHICLE STANDARDS ACT 1989 AND REGULATIONSâ</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Introduction</inline></para><para>Prior to its announcement in May 2000 the Government considered very carefully the views of the various stakeholders, including those involved in the low volume import trade. I believe the decisions taken strike an appropriate balance between the interests of suppliers and retailers of new and used mainstream vehicles, used vehicle importers, and consumers of genuine specialist and enthusiast vehicles.</para><para>I should point out that, while the driving force behind the decisions was to ensure that the national safety and environmental objectives of the Motor Vehicle Standards Act 1989 were not undermined, the decisions were also driven by the need to ensure equity in meeting regulatory requirements between the supply of vehicles under normal and concessional arrangements.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">The Committee's Recommendations (Responses in Italics)</inline></para><para>4.20	The Committee considers that significant but not fundamental amendment to the Scheme is necessary in order to meet the Government's objectives of ensuring that only safe vehicles are supplied to consumers within an appropriate regulatory environment.</para><para>4.21	The Committee therefore recommends amendments to the revised arrangements along the following lines:</para><para>a)	Simplified criteria for the RAW Scheme, and</para><para>Â·	<inline font-style="italic">The RAWS criteria are detailed rather than complex. The previous regime of little control in regulation and a set of administrative procedures was ineffective, and made possible the substantial level of malpractice within the former scheme. The criteria set out in the Regulations for the RAW Scheme aim to achieve the original scheme outcomes and close the loopholes in the previous system. </inline></para><para>b)	Continuation of transitional arrangements until the Regulations are amended, ie an extension of the 7 May 2002 cut-off date until revised criteria are operational.</para><para>Â·	<inline font-style="italic">The 7 May 2002 cut-off date, after which non-SEVS vehicles could no longer be imported, was one of the Government's core policy decisions. The Amendment Act, which commenced on 1 April 2002, made all existing approvals transitional approvals. The Regulations specified that transitional approvals for non-SEVS eligible vehicles be terminated at midnight on 7 May 2002. It is not possible to reinstate those approvals, which have already been terminated.</inline></para><para>4.22	Simplified administrative criteria for the RAW Scheme must address, but may not be limited to, the following:</para><para>a)	The `fit and proper person' requirements;</para><para>b)	Vehicle inspection signature requirements [Regulation 13Y]; </para><para>c)	The two year approval period for a RAW, which should be extended to not less than four years; </para><para>d)	Access and inspection requirements [Regulation 13ZF], especially Regulation 13ZF(c).</para><para>Â·	<inline font-style="italic">Refer to response to 4.21 a) above. The Government may consider some fine tuning of these criteria with the benefit of experience of their operation.</inline></para><para>4.23	The Committee also recommends Government review of the criteria for inclusion of low volume imports on the SEVS Register.</para><para>Â·	<inline font-style="italic">The eligibility criteria were developed in line with the core policy decisions of the Government. If the criteria were to be relaxed the policy intent would not be achieved, and large numbers of used vehicles that could not reasonably be considered specialist or enthusiast would be imported. </inline></para><para>4.24	The Committee further recommends that the Review Panel membership be amended to comprise:</para><para>a)	an independent chairman;</para><para>b)	a representative from the Department of Transport and Regional Services; and</para><para>c)	a representative nominated by an industry association (whose members are Registered Automotive Workshops.)</para><para>Â·	<inline font-style="italic">The review panel has an independent chairman being the Administrator of Vehicle Standards. The person who reviews the original decision, taking into account the Review Panel's report, will not be the same person who made the original decision. In any case an application could still be made to the AAT for review of a decision.</inline></para><para>Â·	<inline font-style="italic">To achieve completeness the review panel also includes a representative from the mainstream vehicle manufacturers, the motor vehicle users association and the Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources.</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Conclusion</inline></para><para>SEVS has, in practice, been in operation for nearly two and a half years (since May 2000) and that already 194 vehicle models have been included on the Register of Specialist and Enthusiast Vehicles. Of these, 150 vehicle models are used imported vehicles. A measure of the success of SEVS is that there has not as yet been any requests for a review panel to meet, nor has there been an application to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to review a decision in relation to SEVS.</para><para>The RAWS is a well considered scheme and the legislation provides the rigour needed by the Department of Transport and Regional Services to administer the new arrangements properly. It provides a comprehensive framework for the imported used vehicle industry and gives the certainty needed for the industry to make business decisions for the future. As at 5 September 2002, 80 corporations have registered with the Department as a RAW Scheme participant, 17 participants have paid their application fee, and two RAWs have been approved.</para><para>I have requested that the Department consider carefully the Report in the context of future opportunities to improve the operational efficiency of the schemes. However, the Government does not intend that the policy decisions that it took in May 2000, and reaffirmed in September 2000, would be revisited in the near future. The Government will await the outcomes of full implementation of the schemes as legislated prior to considering changes.</para><para>âââââ</para><para>RESPONSE TO RECOMMENDATIONS OF A REPORT ON VISITS TO IMMIGRATION DETENTION CENTRES BY THE HUMAN RIGHTS SUB-COMMITTEE OF THE JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS, DEFENCE AND TRADE</para><quote><para>The Report contains 20 recommendations across a range of issues. </para></quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 1</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">That DIMIA and ACM introduce into each of the centres an updated and expanded range of educational, sporting and exercise facilities and provide access to a range of newspapers</inline></para><quote><para>DIMIA manages a process of continuously improving programs, services and facilities for detainees. A significant expansion of the range of recreational, sporting and educational opportunities occurred during 2001 and 2002.</para><para>The Immigration Detention Standards (IDS) underpin the delivery of services in immigration detention facilities, including the provision of educational and recreational activities. DIMIA has undertaken a review of the IDS to ensure that the standards are appropriate, effective and measurable and that the outcomes stipulated in the IDS are measured, monitored and delivered to a consistent standard.</para><para>A full list of educational, sporting, recreational and exercise facilities, and a list of the newspapers provided to each centre as at 30 June 2002 is contained in the attached document entitled `Summary of Facilities, Services and Activities Available to Detainees'. </para></quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 2</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">That DIMIA negotiate agreements with State and Territory Governments and non-government schools to enable children in detention centres to gain access to nearby schools:</inline></para><para>1.	<inline font-weight="bold">To ensure that all school age persons in detention centres are given the access to the level of education that they require, and</inline></para><para>2.	<inline font-weight="bold">Reports to the Committee on progress of these negotiations with relevant State and Territories by not later than six months after the tabling of this report.</inline></para><para>The provision of education services at all immigration detention facilities is covered by the contractual relationship with the Detention Services Provider. The Department and Services Provider's duty of care includes ensuring that all children in detention have access to, and are encouraged to participate in, education opportunities. </para><para>All detainee children are encouraged to regularly attend educational classes provided either within the detention facility or, if appropriate and where possible, at local schools. At the very least, attendance enables detainee children to acquire some basic socialisation skills. Where children are released from detention through grant of a visa, regular attendance will provide a foundation for them to enter schools in the Australian community. </para><para>The programs developed for children in classes in detention facilities are based on state/territory school curricula but also take into account the children's variable lengths of stay in detention and address their abilities, any learning difficulties they may have, such as literacy and numeracy problems, and the level of their English language skills. Trained and qualified teachers, focusing on ESL, are employed in all facilities. </para><para>Within detention facilities, pre-school programs usually comprise language, craft and play activities that assist the children to develop physical, social and language skills. The focus of these programs is on early childhood development, promoting strong parent-child relationships and socialisation. </para><para>Primary level classes include English, mathematics, arts and craft, physical education, and computer skills. The children often incorporate their own culture and upbringing into the work they complete, such as drawings, music and written work. Classes focussing on Australian culture allow the children to gain an understanding of life in Australia and are an effective preparatory program for those who are released from detention.</para><para>Secondary classes also focus on English, mathematics, physical education, and computing. At the secondary level, science classes may be included. Formal classroom activities are supplemented by additional activities and developmental programs, including access to computers, discussion groups, and organised sports and crafts activities. For those older children accessing the adult classes, some life skills and other useful courses are available.</para><para>DIMIA recognises that for many children, access to external schooling is likely to be appropriate and beneficial. There may, however, be limits to the number of detainee children who can be placed in nearby local schools. This is because of their level of literacy and English language skills and, particularly for those who have just arrived, unfamiliarity with the Australian school system. </para><para>Attendance by detainee children at nearby schools also needs to factor in the children's emotional well-being in such an environment. Some detainee children may in fact be more comfortable participating in classes run within detention facilities. Schooling in the facilities may better be able to prepare those who are in detention for a short period prior to release on visas for their eventual attendance at schools in the community.</para><para>Consideration of enrolment in local schools needs to take account of the views, concerns and needs of local schools and state and territory authorities in relation to the provision of education for detainee children. </para><para>While DIMIA is seeking to negotiate formal arrangements such as MOUs with relevant state governments, its priority is in trying to get practical arrangements in place so that detainee children can attend either local government or non-government schools.</para><para>Access to external schools for some detainee children has occurred or occurs at Curtin, Port Hedland and Christmas Island IRPCs and at Maribyrnong and Villawood IDCsâin some instances in local state schools and in other instances through the Catholic education system. Negotiations are continuing with the South Australian and Victorian Education Departments on access by detainee children to local state schools.</para><para>DIMIA officers have reported to the Committee on progress in the area of access to educational facilities for detainees in recent appearances before the Committee.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 3</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">That, together with English language lessons, detainees be strongly encouraged to participate in classes about life in Australia.</inline></para><para>Educational opportunities and information sessions which inform detainees about life in Australia are provided at all immigration detention facilities. Detainees are advised on arrival about the facilities and classes available. Participation in the classes is voluntary. Balance is required between encouraging participation and raising detainee expectations about the likely outcome of their visa application.</para><para>The range of information sessions and classes was expanded in 2001 to reflect detainee interest. For example, information sessions at Woomera deal with such matters as ATM banking, driving and registering a car, cultural diversity and the election process.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 4</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">That, DIMIA and ACM review the Occupational Health and Safety issues involved in the work done by detainees at detention centres.</inline></para><para>Meaningful activities are provided to detainees so that they may contribute to their own care, as well as that of the wider detainee community. Essentially, these activities are similar to those which people undertake on a daily basis in maintaining a home. The activities give detainees some control over aspects of their daily lives and are viewed as contributing positively to morale and self-esteem.</para><para>ACM and DIMIA are committed to providing a safe and healthy environment for staff, detainees and visitors to detention facilities. A number of initiatives have been taken to ensure compliance with relevant building codes and health/safety legislation. For example, health and facilities managers brief detainees on their rights and obligations in relation to relevant health and safety issues and legislation before detainees commence voluntary activities in the kitchens or elsewhere in centres. These issues are fully covered in the operations manual of the services provider.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 5</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">That the points system for work carried out by the detainees at the centres be reviewed to ensure that, as far as practicable, there is consistency in the allocation of points where similar work is undertaken at the various centres.</inline></para><para>The points system operating in the immigration detention facilities is aimed at providing detainees with opportunities to be rewarded for involvement in meaningful activities at centres. This encourages participation in such activities which contributes positively to detainee morale and self-esteem. These activities are entirely voluntary and any points earned are transferable between centres.</para><para>The allocation of points per hour is consistent across the centres at one point per hour. If there are differences between centres with respect to how many points a detainee might receive per week for undertaking similar activity, this is likely to be because the number of hours per week for this activity differs. An effort is made to rotate such activities amongst detainees and the numbers available to undertake a particular activityâand therefore the number of hours per detaineeâmay differ from centre to centre.</para><para>In some centres, points are sometimes calculated on an estimated number of hours per week for which the activity is undertaken. An example of this is points allocated weekly for participation in detainee representative committees. This is appropriate because, in addition to attending committee meetings and various representational and ad hoc activities on behalf of detainees, committee members are on call 24 hours a day and are the first point of contact for ACM officers in the event of a problem. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 6</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">That the Australian Government consider the establishment of a reserve list of Members to assist the Refugee Review Tribunal (RRT) at times of peak workload.</inline></para><para>In 2001 the Government finalised a selection process for additional RRT members, with a term of appointment from 1 October 2001 to 30 June 2004. With these new appointments, the RRT membership increased to 66 members. However, one member resigned in April 2002. The RRT now comprises 65 members, including one principal member, one acting deputy principal member, three senior members, 36 full-time members and 24 part-time members. In addition, eight new RRT appointments have recently been approved. The new members are expected to take up their positions from I July 2002.</para><para>The RRT's part-time members are required to work a minimum of two days per week. However, in periods of peak workload, part-time RRT members work extra days to meet demand. Hence, part-time members already function as `reserves' when required.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 7</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">That the current informal arrangement, whereby the Refugee Review Tribunal can draw attention to humanitarian issues in the case of an asylum seeker, should be formalised by an amendment to s417 of the Migration Act 1958 so that these issues are formally included in the Minister's consideration of such cases.</inline></para><para>The Minister's power under s417 is a non-compellable, non-delegable discretionary power. It is a safety net mechanism to address any humanitarian concerns, including ensuring that Australia meets its obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the UN Convention Against Torture.</para><para>Ministerial Guidelines for the identification of unique or exceptional cases where it may be in the public interest for the Minister to substitute a more favourable decision under s345/351/391/ 417/454 of the Migration Act 1958 are publicly available. When a Tribunal member is of the view that a particular case may fall within the ambit of these Guidelines, they may refer the case to the Department. In this situation, their views will be brought to the Minister's attention using the process outlined in the Guidelines.</para><para>In any event, cases in which the RRT has affirmed the original decision are routinely assessed by DIMIA officers against the Guidelines, irrespective of whether the case was flagged by the RRT.</para><para>The Government considers the current arrangements to be sufficient to address cases where there are humanitarian concerns and, therefore, formalisation of this arrangement through legislative change is considered to be unnecessary. </para><para>The Government, therefore, cannot accept this recommendation.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 8</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">That the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation develop an appropriate risk profile to assist the early release into the Australian community of asylum seekers.</inline></para><para>The Government is confident that the existing process of security checking of protection visa applicants is completed in a timely manner.</para><para>Under the Migration Act, asylum seekers who are unlawfully in Australia must be detained and cannot be released into the community until and unless they are granted a visa.</para><para>In undertaking security checking of protection visa applicants, including applicants who have arrived in Australia without authority and are held in immigration detention, ASIO already utilises profiles based on risk factors in order to facilitate security checking processes. </para><para>Protection visa decision making occurs relatively swiftly, except where there are security concerns, which need to be addressed by ASIO, or character or identity matters which need to be addressed by DIMIA. </para><para>Delays can also occur where applicants later change the information they initially provided about their identity. Where detainees cooperate, security and character checking can usually be addressed quickly, enabling the protection visa decision-making process to be expedited. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 9</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">The Committee supports the proposed trial of facilities for women and children in towns, with access to nearby detention centres.</inline></para><para>The trial of alternative detention arrangements for women and children commenced in Woomera in August 2001. The trial comprised a maximum of 25 Woomera women and children, housed outside the IRPC in a cluster of four three-bedroom houses, under ACM supervision. Originally, each had a family member remaining at Woomera, an application for asylum under consideration and posed neither character nor management risks. </para><para>An evaluation of the Woomera project has been conducted and the Minister has agreed to expand the eligibility criteria to include those women and children whose cases have proceeded beyond the primary or merits review stage. The Minister has also given approval for compelling cases or those with special needs to be considered for participation on a case by case basis. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 10</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">That for asylum seekers who have received security clearance:</inline></para><para>3.	<inline font-weight="bold">There should be a time limit on the period that they are required to spend in administrative detention;</inline></para><para>4.	<inline font-weight="bold">It is desirable that this time limit should be no longer than the period that the Department is funded by the Australian Government from time to time to process individual applications for asylum in Australia, currently 14 weeks; and</inline></para><para>5.	<inline font-weight="bold">Similarly appropriate time limits should be established for consideration of applications by the Refugee Review Tribunal.</inline></para><para>The concept of time limits on processing and length of detention such as proposed by the Committee has been tried in the past and was unsuccessful, not least because, rather than encouraging cooperation in for example the provision of documentation, it may be an invitation to detainees to simply `wait out' the time limit. This proposal could well act as an incentive to those who seek to enter Australia illegally and be used as a selling point for the people smugglers. </para><para>In 1992 the then Labor Government introduced the Migration Reform Act which overtook the previous provisions limiting immigration detention to 273 days (although these provisions remain in the Act). The limits only ever applied to âdesignated personsâ defined as unauthorised arrivals who arrived in Australia between  </para><para>19 November 1989 and 1 September 1994. The provisions have become redundant through the passage of time.</para><para>Protection visa applicants who have identity documentation and whose claims are clear can receive decisions on a visa within four to five weeks. </para><para>Delays in making a primary decision are due in most part to a need to obtain information from other Governments and agencies and to attempts to substantiate claims of identity and nationality in cases where the asylum seeker has disposed of travel documentation before arrival. </para><para>Where it has been determined that no protection obligations apply to a person and his or her family, applicants' time in detention can be extended while they pursue their legal rights of review. Pursuit of the various review mechanisms is the choice of the individual. </para><para>Those who had received a negative primary decision would have little incentive to comply with any conditions of release, and in fact it is likely that many would abscond. This has been the UK experience, with 50 to 70 per cent of those released into the community absconding.</para><para>The Government, therefore, cannot accept this recommendation.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 11</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">That all detainees are given appointments on a regular basis with their case officers to update the detainees on the precise current status of their applications for protection.</inline></para><para>All applicants in immigration detention who apply for a protection visa are provided with assistance under the Immigration Advice and Application Assistance Scheme (IAAAS) to prepare and lodge their application.</para><para>It is expected that detainees will be kept informed of progress of their application by their IAAAS provider. However, DIMIA does recognise the importance of detainees being able to communicate regularly with DIMIA staff about any concerns they might have in this regard. With the expansion of DIMIA staff at IRPCs over the last year, processes have been put in place for more frequent, regular contact with detainees, and through Detainee Representative Committees. These processes are now being enhanced through a proactive program of scheduled meetings with individual detainees on a regular basis to discuss issues of concern, including on the status of their applications. </para><para>Onshore Protection case officers are not located on site at immigration detention facilities. This recommendation would have significant workload implications for case officers and may divert such resources from processing protection visa applications. </para><para>The appointment of Deputy Managers at each detention facility allows DIMIA to be more proactive in addressing the immigration status of detainees. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 12</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">That the Department negotiate with appropriate community groups to examine the feasibility of developing a sponsorship scheme for detainees who have not been processed within the time limit against which the Department is funded, currently 14 weeks, and who have received a security clearance.</inline></para><para>The Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Migration assessed alternatives to detention in 1994 (Asylum, Border Control and Detention) and expressed doubts that any alternative could ensure that unauthorised arrivals would not abscond during the processing of their applications. It also raised concerns about whether there was sufficient capacity in the community to provide adequate care for these people while their applications were decided.</para><para>While some community organisations are prepared to offer support to those released from detention, they do not see it as their role or responsibility to ensure that asylum seekers present themselves for removal from Australia if they are found not to have a right to remain.</para><para>In the absence of such undertakings, community sponsorship schemes would not deliver the essential function of making sure failed asylum seekers are available for removal. </para><para>The majority of people who have been in immigration detention for a lengthy period are there because they have been found not to be refugees and are awaiting removal. Such people would have nothing to gain by cooperating in a community release scheme and would have no incentive to comply. The recommendation does not address the requirement that people who do not have established reasons to remain in Australia must be available for removal. While the Government remains prepared to consider the feasibility of community sponsorship schemes, it cannot support schemes which do not address this fundamental requirement.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 13</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">That, wherever possible, blocks within detention centres be designated for the exclusive use of families.</inline></para><para>The IDCs at Perth, Villawood and Maribyrnong all contain designated areas for women, children and family groups. Every effort is made to accommodate families and other special needs groups, such as women, children and unaccompanied minors, together in all facilities. Courtesy fences have been erected in the Woomera IRPC to enable discrete areas to be assigned for use by women, children and families and separate areas for single men. </para><para>Capacity to deliver the optimum accommodation plan depends on the nature of the detention population at any given time, including, for example, the proportion of families with children. This can vary significantly. Facilities are utilised flexibly to deliver the best result, within the limitations of existing infrastructure and the size and composition of the population.</para><para>In the design of new facilities, particular attention is being given to a flexible design which will allow for the segregation of certain groups, and for the provision of family friendly accommodation. In respect of the new Baxter IRPC facility for example, the Department has drawn lessons from its experience in managing detention in its existing facilities over the last few years. Baxter will provide higher levels of amenity and security than existing IRPCs. The smaller capacity compounds will provide more flexibility for the management of detainees, in a more community-oriented environment. It will better accommodate families, first because there will be a family-designated compound and secondly because all the accommodation has ensuite facilities. Moreover, some of the rooms have interconnecting doors with one other room. Two of the nine compounds have rooms for people with disabilities.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 14</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">That appropriate community organisations, including religious and welfare groups, be given greater access to the detention centres after detainees have met initial processing requirements.</inline></para><para>Subject to the good order and security of the detention facility; the protection of the privacy, dignity and safety of detainees; the restriction of a detainee's movements for management reasons; and the agreement of detainees, detainees are able to receive visits from relatives, friends, and community contacts. Visits are focused on the needs of the detainees. Community group members and religious leaders are regular visitors to the centres to provide services including personal, cultural, spiritual and religious support to the detainees. Other organisations such as the Australian Red Cross have access to the facilities to provide tracing and other services to detainees.</para><para>The detention services provider is required to provide all the basic facilities and services needed by the detainees. It can, and does, subcontract the provision of some of these services to community groups but whether it does so is a matter for the services provider. </para><para>Community groups are also represented on a number of the Centre Consultative or Community Reference Committees. DIMIA is currently undertaking a review of these committees.</para><para>Some community groups and organisations wish to have access to detention centres not because they have a link to a particular detainee or because they are providing services to detainees but because they wish to assure themselves of the conditions within centres or that detainees are being treated in a humane way. DIMIA understands this motivation and is looking at ways in which such access might be granted. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 15</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">That, as a matter of urgency, the Department negotiate Memoranda of Understanding with relevant States and Territories about the detention of asylum seekers in their jails.</inline></para><para>The Department is already in the process of negotiating MOUs with correctional authorities. Finalisation of these MOUs is a priority for the Department.</para><para>In particular, a Service Level Agreement between DIMIA and Queensland Corrective Services is close to finalisation. MOUs with NSW and Victoria, are progressing towards finalisation. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 16</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">That the Minister consider the establishment of a higher security facility, either within an existing centre or as a new facility, for the housing of a particular group of detainees that could include those who have been:</inline></para><para>6.	<inline font-weight="bold">Charged with a criminal offence and are awaiting trial; or</inline></para><para>7.	<inline font-weight="bold">Convicted of a criminal offence and have completed their jail term: or</inline></para><para>8.	<inline font-weight="bold">Found to have been convicted of a criminal offence in another country; or</inline></para><para>9.	<inline font-weight="bold">Instigated serious disturbances in existing centres.</inline></para><para>DIMIA is continually examining the most appropriate and optimal use of our immigration detention facilities and streaming of certain groups of detainees, possibly including high risk detainees, is something it is prepared to consider.</para><para>There are pros and cons to the proposition that high-risk detainees be accommodated together in one purpose-built facility. Concentration of all difficult detainees in one centre would remove the benefit of the ameliorating influence of better-behaved inmates, making the management of this cohort much more difficult. This is why many prisons do not segregate in this way. </para><para>It would also mean that detainees who are community compliance cases would have to be moved from states where they have lived and have community support. This may provoke criticism from the courts and legal representatives of those who are pursuing litigation. There would also be increased costs associated with transporting and escorting detainees, including for tribunal and court hearings.</para><para>On the other hand, if high-risk or difficult detainees are accommodated along with the general population of the detention centres, they are in a position to take the opportunity to stir up trouble and to influence other detainees to participate in unacceptable activities, and potentially to expose detainees, including women and children, to the risk of harm.</para><para>The recommendation presumes that DIMIA can accurately predict the reactions of detainees and identify those people who are likely to present behaviour management difficulties and who should, therefore, be transferred to such a facility. This is not a simple matter. While the key points and events which may trigger a negative or violent reaction are known, not all detainees respond in this way. Moving people, of itself, could prompt a violent reaction from otherwise compliant detainees or provoke protests or other incidents by detainees remaining in the centre.</para><para>While continuing to assess these issues, DIMIA is aiming to ensure that, in time, all IDCs and IRPCs will have some capacity to manage closely detainees who pose behaviour management problems.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 17</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">That DIMIA hold discussions with ACM, with a view:</inline></para><para>10.	<inline font-weight="bold">To ensuring an appropriate relationship exists between staff and detainees at migration detention centres;</inline></para><para>11.	<inline font-weight="bold">To ensuring appropriate briefings are given on arrival at centres, so the detainees are made aware of the range of assistance and facilities that is available;</inline></para><para>12.	<inline font-weight="bold">To strengthening the role of counsellors and welfare officers at the centres to ensure as far as practicable that all detainees are aware of the role of these staff members and the assistance that they can provide; and</inline></para><para>13.	<inline font-weight="bold">To nominating an appropriate, independent person for each detention centre to whom complaints can be brought by detainees who claim harsh or unfair treatment by officers of ACM.</inline></para><para>DIMIA has a range of mechanisms through which discussions with the detention services provider take place. The Contract Management Group (CMG) comprises senior DIMIA and ACM officials who meet every quarter to consider both broad strategic directions and general operational issues in relation to ACM's management of immigration detention centres. </para><para>It also provides a forum for both parties to discuss aspects of ACM's performance and gives ACM the opportunity to communicate their views to DIMIA on a range of issues. </para><para>The Contract Operations Group meets monthly to consider general operational issues, concerns and trends emerging from monthly reporting, analysis of incident reports and monthly audits of centres. </para><para>In addition, DIMIA Managers and Deputy Managers are on site to provide day to day feedback to the detention services provider.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">ACM Staff</inline></para><para>ACM's service delivery in all detention facilities must meet the quality level established in the Immigration Detention Standards. These standards set out the service provider's obligations to meet the individual care needs of detainees in a culturally appropriate way while at the same time providing safe and secure detention for all detainees. In addition to the selection and training requirements of detention officers through contractual obligations, including the requirement for appropriate cultural awareness training, ACM officers must abide by the company's Code of Conduct. </para><para>The vast majority of ACM staff at the facilities accord high priority to maintaining appropriate relations with detainees, DIMIA staff and visitors to the centres. Where ACM staff have not met their obligations with respect to detainees, however, they have been dealt with under ACM's Code of Conduct. Where criminal conduct has been alleged and investigations have sustained those allegations, charges have been laid.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Briefing on Facilities/Availability of Counsellors</inline></para><para>On arrival at detention facilities, detainees are advised of the range of assistance, programs and services available to them, including the availability of counsellors and welfare officers.</para><para>There is a significant amount of information provided to detainees in the induction phase and, in recognition of the difficulties for detainees in absorbing all this information, there is an ongoing process of continual information provision. Trained interpreters are employed at each centre to assist with the provision of information in appropriate languages. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Independent Person</inline></para><para>Given the existing extensive scrutiny of immigration detention centres, the need to establish an additional position to monitor conditions and talk to individual detainees is not warranted.</para><para>In addition to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (HREOC) and the Commonwealth Ombudsman who regularly visit detention centres to investigate complaints and conduct enquiries, the Minister established the Immigration Detention Advisory Group (IDAG) in February 2001. </para><para>The Advisory Group provides the Minister with advice on the appropriateness and adequacy of services, accommodation and facilities at detention facilities. The group has unfettered access to all immigration detention facilities and is able to visit the centres at any time and without prior notice. During these visits they have access to staff, individual detainees and detainee representative committees to obtain first hand information on the operation and environment of each centre. </para><para>The group comprises Australians who have been chosen for their individual expertise and commitment to immigration, refugee and humanitarian issues. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 18</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">That the Department undertake, as a matter of urgency, a review of the Immigration Detention Standards and include the revised document in its contractual negotiations with ACM Pty Ltd.</inline></para><para>A review of the Immigration Detention Standards (IDS) has been undertaken. The revised IDS will form part of the new detention services contract. The draft revised IDS were included in the Request for Tender for the new contract for detention services, released on 28 June 2002.</para><para>The revision of the IDS has drawn on the experience of DIMIA in managing and monitoring the current detention services contract and has been guided by the recommendations of the Flood Inquiry and various Commonwealth Ombudsman inquiries. DIMIA has consulted with the Ombudsman, HREOC and IDAG, among others, during the process of revising the IDS. </para><para>The new IDS will also provide an updated framework of performance measures to ensure quality performance by the Services Provider. The greater degree of specificity in the standards and the clearer link between the IDS and performance measures will enable DIMIA to be more precise in its monitoring of service delivery.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 19</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">That the visual checks of detainees, including waking them during the night to establish their identity, should cease except where special security concerns exist.</inline></para><para>The Government does not support this recommendation and accepts that the detention services provider undertakes musters and visual checking of detainees as part of their responsibilities to ensure that escapes from immigration detention are minimised. Visual checking at night occurs only where there are specific security or safety concerns. In general, it is expected that with recent improvements to physical security including enhanced perimeter fencing, the need for night time checks should be lessened.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 20</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">That a review be carried out by the Department and ACM into the adequacy of psychological services provided to detainees.</inline></para><para>The psychological needs of detainees are addressed in the Immigration Detention Standards.</para><para>In addition, the Immigration Detention Advisory Group (IDAG) is addressing health, including mental health, services as part of its mandate to advise the Minister on the adequacy and appropriateness of accommodation, facilities and services in detention centres.

Government Objectives</inline></para><para>1.1	The Government remains strongly committed to meeting Australia's international obligations under the Refugees Convention. </para><para>1.2	The Government also remains committed to fulfilling its non-refoulement obligations to persons who are not found to be refugees under the Convention, but who are found to have humanitarian reasons to remain in Australia under the Convention Against Torture and Other Forms of Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT), or the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).</para><para>1.3	The Government meets these international obligations through the grant of protection visas to those persons who are found to be refugees under the definition in the Refugees Convention, and through the exercise of the Minister's discretion to grant visas to persons who fall under the provisions of the CAT or ICCPR.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">2.	Background</inline></para><para>2.1	In 1997 the Government, concerned that increasing numbers people who did not possess genuine refugee or humanitarian reasons for remaining in Australia were making unmeritorious applications for protection visas (PVs), introduced a package of measures designed to reduce the scope for abuse of the PV process. One of these measures was the introduction of a $1,000 fee for protection visa applicants who were unsuccessful at the Refugee Review Tribunal (RRT).</para><para>2.2	The fee is payable only after an adverse decision is handed down by the RRT. Successful review applicants do not become liable for the fee. Further, the fee is refunded or waived for applicants who are unsuccessful at the RRT but who are subsequently granted visas through the exercise of the Minister's discretionary public interest powers under s417 of the Migration Act 1958. The effect of this arrangement is that genuine applicants are not deterred from seeking review at the RRT by the operation of the fee.</para><para>2.3	The regulations (Migration Regulations 4.31B and 4.31C) establishing the fee were subject to a two year sunset clause to take effect from 1 July 1999. Following a review in 1999 of the operation of the fee by the Joint Standing Committee on Migration (JSCM) the sunset clause was extended to 30 June 2001. </para><para>2.4	In August 2000, the JSCM was again requested to review the impact of the fee and to report to the Parliament. The Report of the JSCM â2001 Review of Migration Regulation 4.31Bâ was tabled in the Parliament on 18 June 2001 with a majority of the Committee recommending an extension of the sunset clause to 30 June 2003. A dissenting report was made by Senator Andrew Bartlett.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">3.	Majority Report</inline></para><para>3.1	The majority report accepted that:</para><para>Â·	there is significant deliberate abuse of the PV process (paragraph 2.15);</para><para>Â·	a decline in the take-up rate for `low refugee producing' nationalities indicated that there was a deterrent effect for mala fide applicants (paragraph 2.37);</para><para>Â·	the available statistical information indicated that bona fide applicants were not being discouraged from applying for review (paragraph 2.51); and</para><para>Â·	that many suggested proposals for administrative change were not appropriate (paragraphs 3.6, 3.10, 3.13, 3.16, 3.22 and 3.25).</para><para>3.2	The Committee consequently recommended that:</para><para>Â·	DIMIA systematically examine the full range of existing migration processing and review arrangements with a view to further streamlining them (Recommendation 1âparagraph 2.16);</para><para>Â·	the activities of migration agents be brought under closer scrutiny by DIMIA and the Migration Agents Registration Authority (Recommendation 2âparagraph 3.47); and</para><para>Â·	that Migration Regulation 4.31B be retained, subject to a two-year sunset clause commencing on 1 July 2001, and that its operation be reviewed by the Committee early in 2003 (Recommendation 3âparagraph 4.59)</para><para>3.3	The Government accepts the Committee's findings contained in the majority report. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">4	Majority Recommendations</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic">Recommendation 1</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic">The Committee recommends that DIMA systematically examine the full range of existing migration processing and review arrangements with a view to further streamlining them.</inline></para><para>4.1	The Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs Client Service Charter commits the Department to striving to improve its services.

Dissenting Report</inline></para><para>5.1	A dissenting report was tabled by Senator Andrew Bartlett. Senator Bartlett recommended that Regulation 4.31B cease to operate after 1 July 2001.</para><para>5.2	This report commented that:</para><para>Â·	nearly two thirds of submissions to the review opposed the fee; and</para><para>Â·	many submissions raised the issue of hardship caused to applicants by the fee and cited an example given by Kingsford Legal Centre to show the effect of the fee on an asylum seeker. </para><para>5.3	The dissenting report concluded:</para><para>Â·	that it is not obvious that there is significant abuse (of the PV system); </para><para>Â·	that the positive effects of the fee which were expected have not occurred; and</para><para>Â·	the fee has a negative effect on applicants.</para><para>5.4	The Government acknowledges the contribution of Senator Bartlett and accepts that his intentions are similar to those of the Government, in seeking to ensure that Australia continues to fulfil its international refugee and humanitarian obligations to a high standard, and to reduce the levels of abuse of the system.</para><para>5.5	However, the Government considers that the dissenting report's recommendation would have a significant negative effect on the outcomes for the protection visa system.</para><para>5.6	The review has clearly shown that there is still substantial abuse of the PV process. Evidence was given by the RRT and Migration Institute of Australia to that effect. An indicator of the level of abuse is that 34% of all RRT decisions are affirmed without the applicant availing themselves of an opportunity to attend a hearing to present their case. While the Department's submission to the Committee advanced reasons for this, no other submissions or evidence to the Committee were able to provide a plausible alternative explanation why this occurs.</para><para>5.7	The Government does not accept the conclusion in the dissenting report that the expected positive effects of the fee have not occurred. Evidence submitted to the Committee clearly showed the fee has been a deterrent to prospective RRT applicants of `low refugee producing' nationalities, the group in which more non-genuine applications are found.</para><para>5.8	While some submissions argued that the fee had a negative effect on some applicants, the Government does not accept that any perceived adverse effect outweighs the positive effect the fee has as a deterrent and a partial cost recovery measure. The research on review applications and success rates indicates that the disincentive effect of the fee focussed on those applicants who are not refugees. The Government also notes that no concrete evidence was supplied to the Committee to show that the fee dissuaded any genuine applicant from applying to the RRT for review of their primary decision.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title><type>Delegation Reports</type><page.no>7450</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Parliamentary Delegation to the 48th Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference</title><page.no>7450</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>7450</page.no><name role="metadata">DEPUTY PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name.id>10000</name.id><electorate>PO</electorate><party>N/A</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOn behalf of the President, I present the report of the delegation from the Commonwealth of Australia branch of the 48th Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, which took place in Namibia in September 2002.</para></talk.start></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>7450</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Resolution of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly</title><page.no>7450</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>7450</page.no><name role="metadata">DEPUTY PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name.id>10000</name.id><electorate>PO</electorate><party>N/A</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOn behalf of the President, I present a resolution agreed to by the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly relating to the plight of the East Timorese asylum seekers, together with copies of members' speeches, sent to me by the Speaker of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, the Hon.

This motion relates to the current plight of the East Timorese asylum seekers based in Darwin in the Northern Territory who are seeking to stay in Australia. I want to reiterate some of the comments that were made during this debate in the Northern Territory when this motion was endorsed. As the Chief Minister said at the time, the Territory leads Australia in many respects. Of course, the most important among those is the cultural diversity of our society in the Top Endâthat is, the way in which people from many parts of the world and from many parts of Australia live together in peace and harmony with a sense of complete cooperation in Darwin.</para><para>We often hear people pay lip service to multiculturalism in other parts of our country but in the Territory it actually does work. It is readily seen in the schools, on the sporting fields and in our workplaces. We are a small community and a very tight-knit one, so we rely on this peace and harmony and the integration of our multicultural groups to a very large extent. What happens to one family affects all of us in the Top End. That is why the plight of the 80 or more East Timorese who have made the Northern Territory their home and are now probably facing, at the end of the day, deportation back to East Timor has raised many concerns within our community. That is why there are so many people working to ensure that this is not the case. </para><para>Many of these people are known to us. Some have spent up to 10 years or more living in the Top End and many have had children there. They have opened businesses. Many are studying or working. They are good neighbours, good friends and, in fact, they have been good immigrants. They are part of the Territory. As the Leader of the Opposition, Denis Burke, said in his contribution to this motion last week, everyone refers to them as Territorians. We feel they are a part of our community and they are Territorians.</para><para>These are people who once faced very grave fears for their safety in East Timor, some fleeing for their lives and losing family and friends in the outbreaks of violence leading up to and following the independence vote. They have found peace in Australia. They have found a home in Darwin and a haven in which they can bring up their children. That is why I thinkâand I agree with the Chief Ministerâthat it is devastating to hear that the federal government has given them a short deadline before planning to send them back to East Timor forcibly. Many of these people will lose everything if they leave now, and they will return to nothing. They face a very difficult time of dislocation, language problems for their children and unemployment. The small Territory population needs building up through good immigrants like the East Timorese, not the loss of families such as these.</para><para>We note that the federal government does not consider these people to be refugees following Australia's involvement in restoring peace in East Timor, but, of course, those of us who are fighting to ensure that these people stay in this country do not accept the federal government's ruling. There was a belief in, and a commitment to, ensuring that they would be considered a special case because of their great contribution to the Darwin community and the widespread support and respect they have won. Unfortunately, our attempts to date to get the federal government to agree to a special purpose category visa have failed.</para><para>I believe it would be so easy for Minister Ruddock to decide to grant resident status to the 1,700 or so East Timorese refugees who came to this country having fled East Timor many years ago prior to the start of that country's campaign and crusade to become an independent nation. It is unfortunate that this government has seemed to actually put a fence around these people and designate them as having a special case for refugee status as was the case in the 1980s when the Labor government recognised that needed to occur for people from China who were here during the Tiananmen Square massacre. Seventeen hundred people is not a lot of people for this country to welcome with open arms and to have as residents of this country forever without having to put them again through the trauma and dislocation that they will experience if they are sent back home.</para><para>We have 80 or more East Timorese people in the Northern Territory. Many of them, of course, have relatives amongst those 1,700 East Timorese who are in Melbourne. As I have said before in this chamber, they have played a significant role in contributing to our community. It is a role that should be acknowledged and these people should be accepted as part of our population in this country. It is within the minister's powers to do that. It is unfortunate, I must say, that Minister Ruddock was in the Northern Territory over the weekend. I came across him out at Jabiru on Saturday night. I realise that he had been in the Territory to take part in a land hand back at Kybrook Farm and he had flown on to Darwin on Sunday.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>EP5</name.id><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator Ferguson</name></talker><para>âIt was not unfortunate.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>7Y6</name.id><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display">Senator CROSSIN</name></talker><para>âIt is unfortunate that he did not make himself available to meet these people or their representatives or to perhaps give them some acknowledgment that he knows there is a path that they are endeavouring to take. It is unfortunate that he did not make himself available to meet with representatives of this community while he was in the Northern Territory.  </para></talk.start></continue><para>However, the community has been working long and hard on this. I noticed in the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Territorian</inline> last Sunday week that some schoolchildren from Karama Primary School were raising funds to assist these people to gather together the $1,000 that they will need to appeal the initial decision. Last night at the Italian Club in Darwin there was a fundraising concert, again to gather together the funds that these people are going to need to appeal the decision to send them back to East Timor. That is exactly the nature of multiculturalism in Darwin when you have the Italian community offering their venue and their services to assist the plight of the East Timorese families. The work of St Vincent de Paul has been significant in that, and Mick Fox has been crucial in coordinating this campaign.</para><para>The Northern Territory government has pledged assistance through the Office of Ethnic Affairs, which will be supporting the Northern Territory Legal Aid Commission to provide assistance to these people so that they get the best sound advice and strong legal representation to be able to mount a case to stay. I understand that the Chief Minister had a conversation with Minister Ruddock in which he gave an undertaking that each case will be looked at individually under section 417 of the act, which is where the minister has the discretion. I hope that the minister would find that he has the discretion, at the end of the day, to grant these people residency in Australia based on humanitarian reasons. I hope that is the path these people go down and that they are entitled to stay, and are welcome to stay, in this country.</para><para>This motion passed by the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly is an important one. It continues the campaign to ensure that the East Timorese people are recognised as being strong contributors to the community, to support those who are living in Darwin and to support the affected families. Of course, it also recognises the many contributions of individuals, businesses and community organisations that are supporting the East Timorese people. One of those would be the Hakka Association. In the speeches that have been tabled that accompany this resolution there is recognition of the role that the Chinese Timorese association has played and the role that significant Chinese Timorese leaders in Darwin are playing in an effort to try to ensure that this federal government recognises that they can be in a win-win situation here. The win-win situation is that they could grant people a visa under particular humanitarian reasons or for whatever reason the minister chooses. This would acknowledge the substantial contribution of these members to our community and ensure that they can stay forever in Darwin, and in Australiaâa place they have made their home and want to continue to make their home for themselves and for their children.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>7452</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI speak on behalf of the Australian Democrat Party in noting the motion relating to the proposed deportation of East Timorese asylum seekers that was passed by the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly last week. My understanding is that the motion was passed unanimouslyâthat is, with the support of Country Liberal party members. If I am wrong, I am sure someone will tell me otherwise. The assembly certainly passed it and it is a motion that the Democrats wholeheartedly endorse. Indeed, it should be one that the Senate endorses because it expands upon a view already expressed by way of a motion agreed to by the Senate a few weeks back in relation to the situation faced by people of East Timorese background who are now well and truly part of the Australian community.</para></talk.start><para>It is particularly relevant for people in Darwin and for the Territory community, which is no doubt why the Northern Territory assembly has taken this issue so seriously. It is also particularly relevant for people in Melbourne, where there is another large East Timorese community made up of many of these people who have been made to suffer for such a long period of time and who have been left in limbo because of the consistent policy of this and the previous Labor government when people first arrived while the Indonesian occupation of East Timor was, of course, still well and truly a reality. </para><para>The resolution of the assembly rightly acknowledges the substantial contribution which members of the East Timorese community have made to the Northern Territory community over many years. That applies to those who are in other parts of the country as well, but it is probably more noticeable in Darwin because it is a smaller community than somewhere like Melbourneâthe proportion of East Timorese there is more noticeableâand because Darwin has stronger historical links with the region, obviously, being a lot closer geographically.</para><para>The Democrats are pleased that the Northern Territory parliament has expressed its support for the East Timorese asylum seekers and is extending support, including funding for legal aid. It is a crucial issue and it is one that the Democrats have raised many times over many years. It is very unfortunate that it has got to a situation now where, finally, the government is starting to process these people's claims when the situation is such that they are unlikely to meet the very strict refugee criteria that apply in Australia. It is probably the case that many people do not fit the very tight criteria for refugee status, although it is undoubtedly the case that most or all of them did fit the criteria when they arrived in Australia and when they put in their initial applications many years ago.</para><para>The opinion of the Northern Territory government and parliament is that the East Timorese should remain in the communities that they are now well and truly a part of. Certainly I and, I expect, many others in this chamberâparticularly the Northern Territory representatives, Senator Crossin and Senator Scullionâhave received many representations from individuals wanting assistance to ensure that they can remain in Australia, in some cases permanently and in others at least until they can finish their studies. Surely it would be in Australia's interests, let alone those people's individual interests and in the interests of the East Timorese nation, that people who are partway through higher education should be enabled to finish that education, which they could then use much more effectively to assist their former nation of East Timor. There is no doubt that Australia still owes a significant debt to East Timor, in terms of not just the actions and occurrences during the Second World War but also, as a government, our insistence on turning a blind eye to their plight for around 25 years.</para><para>Clearly, East Timor is now amongst the most impoverished nations in our region. The East Timorese are clearly in a situation of significant instability and they need our support. They do not need a government that dumps 1,000 or so people back into the middle of that fledgling nation, many of them without homes to go to, without support and, for the younger people, without even the ability to speak a language other than English and with no real direct experience of or connection with the land that they are now being sent back to other than their historical connection to it.</para><para>The Democrats note and endorse the statement seeking support for the resolution and for the deportees' applications to the minister for immigration. It is another sign of how the stringent, very hardline approach to migration law which this government takes is not only harsh and cruel for the individuals involved but also counterproductive for Australia. Here we have a group of peopleâ it is not particularly large; 1,500 to 1,700â all of whom are desperate to stay in Australia. Certainly all those whom I have met, which would probably be about 30 individuals with different histories and backgrounds in Australia for many years, desperately want to contribute. There is no doubt that, on average, they would contribute to this nation far more, far more passionately and in a far more committed way than many others in the country.</para><para>In addition to that, we have a process where, rather than simply apply a blanket approach to all of them, which has been done in the past, the minister, for what seem to be policy purity reasonsâor perhaps it is because he is not allowed to do so by the government more broadlyâis insisting that each case be dealt with individually. Each of them has to go through the departmental assessment. Over 700 have been assessed already, every single one of whom has failed. Each of them will have to go to the Refugee Review Tribunal, which could certainly do without the extra workload. Each of them would then almost certainly also fail. Then, and only then, are they able to apply for discretion from the minister. Rather than circumventing all that process and simply having ministerial intervention at the start and, even better, rather than having ministerial intervention looking at each case individually, which would also take an enormous amount of time, it will tie up not just the department and the minister, who have to make these decisions, but all the advocates, supporters in the community, legal aid and legal services staff who will help to prepare their cases and people such as ourselves who will assist in advocating on behalf of these people. Huge amounts of effort will be put in just to get the minister to exercise his discretion to allow those people to apply for some other visa. It will take a long time and it will lead to ongoing suffering for these people, who will have an uncertain future. They will not know what is going to happen.  </para><para>One of the worst things about ministerial discretion, as the Democrats have pointed out time and again, including in the Senate committee report on our onshore refugee determination processâit was clearly a unanimous recommendation by all those who participatedâis that it is totally arbitrary. You cannot compel the minister to use it and you cannot appeal against it. Whilst there are guidelines that he is required to use, you have no idea what it is that led him to accept one person or to agree to exercise his discretion with one person and not to agree with another. Nobody knows and nobody can ever know. It is almost a massive global lucky dip as to whose future is positive and whose future is negative. Those people and all the people helping them are in the middle of that ridiculous environment and they will suffer it for many months to come. </para><para>It is worth noting that it has been done before. There is the well-known case of the Chinese students in the Tiananmen Square massacre. A blanket exemption for all those people ended up allowing 42,717 visas to be granted. You say that that is a special case, and it was. I argue that the East Timorese people have a better case than even the Chinese had, not that I opposed that case. It was also applied back in 1997, when the present immigration minister, Minister Ruddock, announced decisions to resolve the status of certain groups of people who had been in Australia as long-term residents. That clearly applies here. Those groups included people who had come from Kuwait, Iraq, Lebanon, China, Sri Lanka and the former Yugoslavia. </para><para>I argue that this case is more compelling than any of those cases. They are people who, as we all know, are part of our community, are effective and will contribute well. Let us save ourselves all the trouble and expense; let us save these people the extra suffering. Let us add our support to the Northern Territory parliament. Let us get state parliaments around the country, particularly Victoria, which has a large East Timorese community, to build the pressure on the immigration minister and the federal government to change their minds, to do the right thing by these people and by Australia and to show a bit of commonsense as well as compassion.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>7454</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI support the previous two speakers and note that it is not without precedent, nor is it common, for us to receive such messages from state or territory administrations or governments. It should be given special credence and supported. I have given notice in writing to convert that motion into one that the Senate can support and I foreshadow that I will be asking Senator Crossin and Senator Bartlett to add their names to that motion when it comes before the Senate on Wednesday. </para></talk.start><para>Senator Bartlett has just referred to the special exemption given in the case of the Tiananmen Square students from China, and there have been other cases. But it is quite extraordinary that the suffering of the East Timorese has been ignored by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and the Prime Minister in the case of those who came to Australia and who have never been given a home here in the sense of security, in the sense of knowing that they could get jobs in the long term or that their kids could go to school here, and in the sense of recognising that Australia was, in effect, their home. Ordinary immigration processes should have allowed them to be granted citizenship long ago. But they have been denied that and they have been held in limbo. Now the minister is saying that they have to pack their bags and go back to East Timor. Just last week we saw the eruption of troubles in East Timorâthe death of two people and widespread looting and destruction. As an Australian, I feel partly responsible for that. There is no doubt that underlying the troubles that East Timor has at the moment is insufficient support coming from the Australian government, private enterprise and insufficient backup from the rest of the world. It has fallen far short of what it should be.  </para><para>Instead, we are seeing the Australian government, in conjunction with a number of big oil and gas companies, trying to defraud the East Timorese people of their greatest potential source of revenueâthat is, the Timor Gap oilfieldsâunder the so-called Timor Gap Treaty. This is a total travesty by a big, rich neighbour like Australia on a poor country like East Timor that needs so much to get revenue and income for its future. Talk about good neighbour policy! It is anything but that. If there is one thing that East Timor needs it is foreign investment. One de facto way of getting that investment is from the thousands of East Timorese who are gainfully employed in Australia and who are repatriating moneyâand that is what they do. </para><para>Just last week in parliament, we had a delegation of such folk here under the auspices of the Catholic sisters. In speaking to those East Timorese, they said they want to finish their school here and they want to develop their skills here. We know that if they go home that will stop. What use is that to the future of their country? What use is it if the income earners here who are sending dollars home to their folks in East Timor are suddenly going to be sent home where they will have no income at all? They will become extra mouths to feed and they will have people to support in a country whose economy is in great trouble. What an alien attitude it is for the minister, the Prime Minister and this government to be taking to these poor neighbours of ours who have suffered so much. They have been bypassed or left on the wayside for a quarter of a century. Finally, after gaining their initial freedom, they have a different wayside to deal withâ that is, the direct statement, implicit in the processes that Minister Ruddock is going through, that they are foreigners, they are not wanted here and they should get out. </para><para>Where is the heart of this great country of ours? It is missing from the pronouncements of the minister for immigration to these East Timorese friends of oursâthese lovely people who are in our cities, particularly in Melbourne but in all other cities around the country, including this great community in Darwin. The Territory administration is right: they deserve our support. I ask all members to think about that in converting this motion, which went through the assembly, into one that we can support in the coming days.</para><para>Question agreed to. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Responses to Senate Resolutions</title><page.no>7455</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>7455</page.no><name role="metadata">Chapman, Grant (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Chapman)</name><name.id>10000</name.id><electorate>PO</electorate><party>N/A</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI present a response from the Chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, Professor Fels, to a resolution of the Senate of 12 November 2002 concerning an order for the production of a report relating to tobacco.</para></talk.start></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>7455</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee: Joint</title><page.no>7455</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report</title><page.no>7455</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>7455</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator FERGUSON</name><name.id>EP5</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOn behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I wish to make an oral presentation by way of a report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Annual review of</inline><inline font-style="italic">Australia's relations with the United Nations </inline>and present the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard </inline>record of the proceedings and submissions received by the committee.

Many of the former committee's recommendations focused on the need for greater and more stable funding of the United Nations and called on the Australian government to actively support reforms directed at promoting efficiency, transparency and accountability in the UN's administration and financial management and encouraging more representative structures in various UN institutions, including the Security Council. The former committee also expressed the view that more active involvement by parliament in discussing and debating Australia's activities at the United Nations might help improve community awareness and understanding of the role of the United Nations. To help promote greater parliamentary debate, the report proposed that an annual program of public hearings be conducted on the subject of Australia's participation in United Nations activities.</para><para>I can report to the Senate that earlier this year the committee resolved to convene an annual program of review hearings, as recommended by the former committee. The first of these annual hearings was held on 2 July this year and involved an examination of officials from the government agencies most closely involved in facilitating Australia's activities at the United Nationsâ namely, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Attorney-General's Department, the Department of Defence, the Australian Agency for International Development and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. The hearing focused on a series of issues identified by the former committee as warranting continuing attention: the status of Australia's treaty obligations; Australia's involvement in UN peacekeeping operations; Australia's involvement in UN programs, funds and specialised agencies; the work of Australia's permanent missions to the United Nations; the progress of structural and financial reform in the United Nations; and the overall costs and benefits of Australia's participation in the UN.</para><para>We also invited those organisations and individuals who had contributed to the former committee's inquiry to provide additional or updated information. A number of witnesses chose to do so and we received 20 written submissions. I would like to present to the Senate the transcript of evidence taken at the review hearing in July and copies of the written submissions received. Copies of all these documents are also available on the committee's Internet site. We found the hearing to be a valuable opportunity to be briefed on and to discuss the nature of Australia's current activities at the United Nations. We were pleased to note, for example, that Australia's initiative to promote reforms in the way that the UN treaty review bodies conduct their work is making good progress, despite initial reservations being expressed in some quarters; that reforms to the management of UN peacekeeping operations are being implemented; that Australia is developing strategic partnerships with United Nations agencies, including the United Nations Development Program and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, to increase the engagement and effectiveness of these agencies in the Asia-Pacific region; and that the leading role taken by successive Australian governments in developing the statute for the International Criminal Court has come to fruition, with Australia's ratification of the statute and the creation of the court on 1 July 2002. </para><para>There is also some evidence that the Secretary-General's second term reform agenda, which includes a focus on improving internal financial and administrative processes, is being implemented effectively, although much remains to be done. It seems, however, that little progress has been made or is expected on the bigger issues of institutional reform. Proposals to expand both the permanent and the non-permanent membership of the Security Council and to remove the veto power held by the existing five permanent members, which Australia and others have advocated for many years, are deadlocked. The reality seems to be that in the absence of dramatic shifts of geopolitical opinion, particularly on the part of the existing five permanent members, the prospects for Security Council reform are slim at best.</para><para>While there is growing agreement that the United Nation's informal system of voting blocks, or electoral groups, is out of date and does not accurately reflect current membership, there is little agreement on alternative models. Unless there is widespread acceptance that a credible alternative would work more effectively than the current blocks, there seems little prospect of change. Despite these and other limitations, we have seen in the last 12 months that the United Nations can play a central role in giving voice to and helping bring together world opinion. It has been an influential forum for the coordination of responses to the threat of terrorism and the debate about crises such as Iraq's development of weapons of mass destruction. We remain firmly of the view that it is in Australia's interests to be fully committed to the United Nations.</para><para>This is not to say that we should be uncritical of our engagement with the United Nations. As a large organisation driven by international political will and with a complex agenda, the United Nations does have many failings. For example, sometimes the agenda of its conferences is hijacked by special interest groups, sometimes its programs or initiatives are poorly focused or managed and sometimes individuals working on UN sponsored activities act in an unethical or illegal manner. In our view, the appropriate response is not to withdraw but to build coalitions with other member nations and the organisation itself to challenge resistance to reform and to ensure that when mistakes are made remedial action is taken. As noted by the former committee:</para><quote><para>... remaining fully committed to the United Nations is the only choice ... the United Nations has the potential to provide a more ordered and just international community, in which smaller powers have some influence in the world and serves to promote our national interests.</para></quote><para>As I have already remarked, this annual review has been a valuable opportunity to continue the process of parliamentary consideration of Australia's relations with the United Nations. Given the dramatic changes in world affairs over the past 12 months, particularly the new and unpredictable threat posed by terrorism, I have little doubt that the committee will continue to review Australia's relations with the United Nations on an annual basis.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee: Joint</title><page.no>7457</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report</title><page.no>7457</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>7457</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOn behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I wish to make an oral presentation by way of a report entitled<inline font-style="italic"> Annual review of Australia and the World Trade Organisation</inline> and present the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record of proceedings and a list of exhibits presented to the committee. I rise to make a statement on behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade about the committee's ongoing scrutiny of the World Trade Organisation. In the last parliament the joint committee resolved that in the context of the examination of the annual report of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and in order to allow for continuous and cumulative parliamentary scrutiny of the WTO, the Trade Subcommittee should institute an annual one-day public hearing on the WTO with specific reference to its progress towards trade liberalisation and the implications of its activities for Australia.</para></talk.start><para>The committee was of the view that the parliament should take an active role in reviewing the manner in which Australia engages with the multilateral trading system managed by the WTO. Moreover, with the international desire to reach agreement on a new negotiating round at the Doha ministerial meeting in November last year, and given the scuttled 1999 Seattle ministerial, an annual parliamentary review of the WTO had an added significance. The former Director-General of the WTO, the Hon. Mike Moore, in the lead-up to Doha, stressed that openness, fairness and predictability are at the heart of the multilateral trading system. He emphasised the vital role that parliamentarians have to play in bringing international organisations and people closer together and holding the WTO and governments accountable. He said: </para><quote><para>Parliamentarians need to engage in the critical global issues and be perceived by the public to be doing so.</para></quote><para>Two broad categories define Australia's interest in the WTOânamely, market access and the system of rules and disciplines that is provided by WTO agreements. As a nation we are dependent on international trade, and strong and enforceable international trade rules are of vital importance to us. The World Trade Organisation is the only organisation that sets enforceable international trade rules and provides the best available mechanism for us to gain real improvements across the board in market access for Australian goods and services. In its first annual review hearing, which was held on 23 August 2002, the Trade Subcommittee decided to focus on the prospects of the Doha Round negotiations. The discussions covered market access issues in the key negotiating areas of agriculture, services and industrials, and the issues of intellectual property, trade and environment, and special and differential treatment of developing countries. This last issue is especially important as it allows for capacity building to enable active participation by all member states, particularly developing country member states.</para><para>The public hearing was conducted in three sessions. Session 1 provided an overview of the WTO and the Doha Round negotiations; session 2 looked at market access and the negotiations for agriculture, services and industrial products; and session 3 examined the issues of intellectual property, trade and environment, and trade and development. We invited organisations and individuals to give evidence on the issues within the three sessions and received 10 exhibits to the scrutiny process. I would like to present to the Senate the transcript of evidence taken at the review hearing in August and the list of exhibits we received. The <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> transcript of the hearing can be viewed on our web site: www.aph.gov.au/house/committee/jfadt.</para><para>At this point I would like to place on record the Trade Subcommittee's appreciation of the time the witnesses gave to appear and give evidence at the hearing. The hearing provided a valuable opportunity to review progress on negotiations and to raise and canvass issues of critical importance to Australia in the Doha Development Round. The difficulties facing our agricultural products, particularly dairy and sugar, in the multilateral trade negotiations were discussed. Market access is the No. 1 issue not only for our agriculture but for our services and industrial products as well. Australian agricultural producers also face barriers in the form of export subsidies and trade-distorting domestic supports. The transcript clearly sets out the difficulties we face, notwithstanding the commitment contained in the ministerial declaration launching the Doha Round last November to correct and prevent restrictions in world agricultural markets.</para><para>We were told that progress in agriculture is important, not just because agriculture contributes vitally to Australia's export performance and remains the most distorted of all international markets but because progress in agriculture is necessary to ensure progress across the entire round. Unless Australia actively drives the case for change along with our fellow Cairns Group members there will be little fundamental reform. Furthermore, there was discussion on the significant gains in services that are up for GATS negotiations, particularly in the areas of market access and the domestic regulations that support it. The complexity of the area was highlighted by its diverse mix of policies and impediments as well as the need for managing change and the significance of the sequencing of reform for Australia. It was pointed out that, although there are gains at the end, `there are some real tricky dangers in how you get there'. </para><para>Evidence presented at the hearing showed the interlocking nature of what is up for negotiation in the Doha Round. Besides the well-scrutinised issue of trade and development linkages, the importance of intersectoral effects was stressed. For instance, the success of the agricultural sector depends on having an efficient service sector in place, and the export of education services online depends on an efficient telecommunications sector being in place. Moreover, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade pointed out that the negotiating dynamics in the WTO dictate that without a big outcome in agriculture there will not be a big outcome in financial services or in telecommunications and other areas.</para><para>Parliamentary scrutiny of the WTO and the trade liberalisation negotiations by the Trade Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade are an ongoing process, with another public hearing planned for mid-2003. In this short statement to the Senate, it is not possible to touch on all the issues discussed with the witnesses at the hearing. The committee's transcript of evidence does, however, contain the full details of the issues we covered and the comment and analysis provided by the witnesses in response to our questions. Moreover, the evidence provides for a better understanding of the dynamics and complexity of the World Trade Organisation negotiations, which are due for conclusion by 1 January 2005, and their importance for Australia's future. This importance has been reconfirmed, with Australia having hosted the mini-ministerial meeting of 25 WTO trade ministers in Sydney from 14 to 15 November 2002 to inject political momentum into the Doha Round of trade negotiations.</para><para>In conclusion, we have been pleased to provide some parliamentary scrutiny of these important negotiations. Openness and transparency are vital ingredients of our democracy, and for that reason we urge the government to be mindful of the need to keep the parliament, through the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, fully informed of progress in negotiations across all sectors and, if necessary, on a confidential basis.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>7459</page.no><name role="metadata">Nettle, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator NETTLE</name><name.id>00AOR</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âby leaveâI move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the statement.</para></motion><para>I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title><type>Delegation Reports</type><page.no>7459</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Parliamentary Delegation to the 171st Inter-Parliamentary Union Council</title><page.no>7459</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>7459</page.no><name role="metadata">Chapman, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator CHAPMAN</name><name.id>FF4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âby leaveâI present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the 171st Inter-Parliamentary Union Council held in Geneva, Switzerland, from 23 to 27 September 2002.

Over the last couple of years the IPU has been debating reform of its own practices and procedures, and as part of this process a second conference was not held in 2002. Instead a council meeting of the IPUâthe 171stâwas convened in Geneva to advance this reform process. Mr Con Sciacca and I, as the permanent delegates to the IPU Council, attended these meetings from 23 to 27 September.</para><para>The report I have just tabled documents in detail the debates and decisions taken in Geneva, and I would like to review a number of these. Senators should note that Senator Sergio Paez of Chile was elected as the new president of the council of the IPU. Mr Sciacca and I met informally with Senator Paez on several occasions, as we were staying in the same hotel, and we are confident that he will enhance the work of the IPU during his presidency. We congratulate him and look forward to working closely with him. </para><para>In the past, successive Australian delegations have taken a keen interest in the budget of the IPU and in a constructive way have argued for comprehensive reforms, including financial discipline and clarity in reporting. In Geneva, the IPU council noted that the draft budget proposal called for a 10 per cent increase in member feesâa situation that Australian delegations argued could be alleviated by more comprehensive cost cutting. It was particularly pleasing when the council was told that the executive committee had reviewed the spending estimates carefully and that, as a result, assessed contributions would be increased by seven per cent and that further cost-saving mechanisms would be explored. Reference was made to the influence Australian delegates had exerted in achieving this spending discipline and greater budget transparency.</para><para>The meeting in Geneva also included a special session to debate the topic `financing for development'. I welcomed this debate at the IPU, having participated in a similar debate at the parliamentary meeting arranged under the auspices of the IPU at the World Summit on Sustainable Development, which was held in Johannesburg. At this meeting, I had highlighted the need to reduce trade barriers as a prerequisite for sustainable development in poorer countries, and I consequently secured amendments to paragraphs relating to trade issues in the final declaration. At the Geneva meeting of the IPU, I drew the attention of delegates to the Australian draft memorandum and draft resolution and indicated that the Monterey Consensus represented a significant step towards increasing understanding of what is needed to promote economic growth and reduce poverty in today's globalised world. Combating global poverty and providing a stable and secure future for all requires an integrated approach, including pursuing dividends from meaningful trade liberalisation; enhancing aid effectiveness; governance reform; capacity building; harmonisation of aid delivery; and integrating all streams of finance, including foreign direct investment, available to developing countries for their sustainable development.</para><para>I again emphasised the need to reduce trade barriers as a prerequisite for sustainable development in poor countries. In this regard I advised that, according to the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, complete liberalisation of global agricultural trade, including removal of agricultural subsidies, could generate benefits to developing countries of $A28 billion per year through improved market access, higher export prices and economic efficiency gains. The IPU adopted a resolution on this issue and this appears in full in the delegation's report, along with the IPU budget, member contributions and details of other meetings and decisions made at the council meeting. I thank the Hon. Con Sciacca MP, one of my colleagues from the opposition side, for his contribution to the success of the Australian effort at the IPU Council meeting in Geneva, and I also thank the delegation secretary, Mr Neil Bessell, for his assistance and efficiency in ensuring that the trip went smoothly. I commend the report to the Senate.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>7460</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee</title><page.no>7460</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Membership</title><page.no>7460</page.no></subdebateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Alan (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Ferguson)</inline>âThe President has received a letter from a party leader seeking a variation to the membership of a committee.</para></talk.start><para>Senator ALSTON (VictoriaâDeputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (4.45 p.m.)âby leaveâI move:</para><motion><para>That Senator Moore replace Senator Wong on the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee for the committee's inquiry into the Australian telecommunications network.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para></interjection></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ASSENT</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>7460</page.no><id.no></id.no></debateinfo><para>Messages from His Excellency the Governor-General were reported, informing the Senate that he had assented to the following laws: </para><para>Workplace Relations Amendment (Registration and Accountability of Organisations) Act 2002 (Act No. 104, 2002)</para><para>Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Registration and Accountability of Organisations) (Consequential Provisions) Act 2002 (Act No. 105, 2002)</para><para>Criminal Code Amendment (Offences Against Australians) Act 2002 (Act No. 106, 2002).</para></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>MEDICAL INDEMNITY BILL 2002</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>7461</page.no><id.no>R1677</id.no><cognate><cognateinfo><title>MEDICAL INDEMNITY (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2002</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>R1675</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>MEDICAL INDEMNITY (ENHANCED UMP INDEMNITY) CONTRIBUTION BILL 2002</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>R1674</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>MEDICAL INDEMNITY (IBNR INDEMNITY) CONTRIBUTION BILL 2002</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>R1673</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>7461</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bills received from the House of Representatives.</para><para>Senator ALSTON (VictoriaâMinister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts) (4.47 p.m.)âI move:</para><motion><para>That these bills may proceed without formalities, may be taken together and be now read a first time.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bills read a first time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>7461</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>7461</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI table a revised explanatory memorandum relating to the bills and move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That these bills be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>I seek leave to have the second reading speeches incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speeches read as follows</inline>â</para><para>This package of bills will enact key elements of the government's new framework for medical indemnity insurance announced by the Prime Minister on 23 October 2002.</para><para>These bills contain measures designed to make the medical indemnity market more sustainable and provide affordable medical indemnity coverage for doctors.

We will continue to urge State and Territory governments to implement the recommendations of the Ipp review to ensure that these law reforms are carried out in a nationally consistent manner where possible.</para><para>MEDICAL INDEMNITY BILL 2002</para><para>This bill provides for the IBNR indemnity scheme.</para><para>The reality is that some MDOs just don't have adequate funds to meet these claims for which they are liable but that haven't yet been reported. These MDOs have not been charging high enough premiums.</para><para>Without the IBNR scheme proposed by the government, those MDOs with unfunded IBNRs would have had to fund them either by raising premiums further or by making compulsory `calls' on their members. </para><para>This scheme will give affected MDOs such as UMP/AMIL the chance for a fresh start unencumbered by past claims incurred liabilities.</para><para>Under the scheme, the government will assume responsibility for the unfunded IBNRs of any MDO that has them. The scheme will allow members of MDOs with unfunded IBNRs to fund these liabilities over time, through an affordable tax deductible levy.</para><para>The High Cost Claims Scheme is also provided for in this bill. Under this scheme, the government will assist with the cost of large claims, ensuring medical defence organisations pay out less on big claims and enabling them to reduce the amount of reinsurance they have to purchase. In this way, the scheme should have a direct impact on premiums. </para><para>Insurance markets currently have little appetite for taking on large and uncertain risks. This is especially the case in the medical indemnity insurance market where it is difficult to assess risk and to price premiums appropriately. </para><para>By paying half of the amount of any insurance payout greater than $2 million, up to the limit of an individual practitioner's insurance coverage, the government will reduce this uncertainty and help ensure that adequate cover is available where incidents result in catastrophic injuries for patients.</para><para>Finally, the bill provides for the introduction of premium subsidies for doctors. </para><para>Whilst premiums have been rising generally for doctors over recent years, for some doctor groups these increases have been particularly large. This government will introduce arrangements to help these doctors afford their premiums while the broader reforms take effect. </para><para>We propose to provide subsidies to practitioners who face the most serious premium affordability problems relative to their peersâobstetricians, neurosurgeons and procedural GPs.</para><para>These subsidies will bring the premiums these doctors pay closer to those paid by other doctors in a comparable professional group.

Establishing this framework will fulfil the Government's election commitment to provide Australia with a world's best practice investment vehicle for venture capital. These measures form a crucial part of the Government's program to encourage new foreign investment into the Australian venture capital market and to further develop the venture capital industry. </para><para>The Australian venture capital market plays a significant role in providing patient equity capital to start-up and expanding companies. It also supports the rejuvenation of more mature companies through managed and leveraged buy-outs.</para><para>This market has experienced significant growth over the past decade, including through foreign investment. By unlocking the potential for more rapid growth of Australia's venture capital market the measures in this bill will assist in realising Australia's innovation potential which this Government has recognised as a key element to Australia's future prosperity. </para><para>In recognition of this potential, this bill, together with the Venture Capital Bill 2002, contains measures to encourage additional foreign investment into the Australian venture capital market and to facilitate the development of the venture capital industry by encouraging leading international venture capital managers to locate in Australia.</para><para>The bill will amend the existing tax treatment of two types of limited partnership used to invest in Australian venture capital companies: venture capital limited partnerships and Australian venture capital funds of funds. These limited partnerships will be taxed as flow-through entities in accordance with internationally recognised best practice for venture capital.  </para><para>The bill also provides a tax exemption to eligible non-resident partners of these limited partnerships on the share of the profit or gain made when the partnership sells its interest in an eligible venture capital investment company. This tax exemption extends that currently available to certain foreign pension funds in similar circumstances.</para><para>Eligible non-residents that may qualify for the tax exemption are tax-exempt residents of Canada, France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States; venture capital funds of funds established and managed in Canada, France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States; and taxable residents of Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands (excluding the Netherlands Antilles), New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Taiwan, the United Kingdom or the United States of America who hold less than 10 % of the committed capital in a venture capital limited partnership or an Australian venture capital fund of funds.</para><para>The bill further provides that other countries may be added to this list by Regulation.</para><para>The bill also provides for the general partner's share of gains made on eligible venture capital investments by the venture capital limited partnerships and Australian venture capital fund of funds they manage to be taxed as a capital gain to the individual fund managers. Unlike managers in the passive funds management industry, venture capital managers are actively involved in the management of the companies in which the funds invest and typically share in capital gains on investments made by the fund after all the investors' committed capital has been returned. This is referred to as the carried interest and is designed to strongly align the interests of the fund manager and investors. To ensure the capital gain treatment of such gains flows through to the individual fund managers, if the general partner is a limited partnership, it will also be treated as a flow-through entity for tax purposes. </para><para>The measures recognise that venture capital limited partnerships with flow through taxation treatment are the preferred investment vehicles internationally and that countries competing with Australia for capital offer exemption from taxation on gains from the sale of those investments. Taxing the carried interest of venture capital managers as capital is also consistent with the international tax treatment of these gains.

They seek to ensure that appointments, such as those of ACCC commissioners, are done using a merit based process. The Democrats were delighted to hear the comments made by ALP frontbencher Mark Latham on the ABC program <inline font-style="italic">Insiders</inline> on 24 November 2002, which appeared to suggest that, after many years, we can finally look forward to the support of the ALP on merit based appointments. Mr Latham's comments attacked what he called `the establishment figures who've had power concentrated in their hands'. His comments about political appointments of mates to the ABC board were particularly strong.</para><para>Every Democrat senator has at one time or another called for an end to jobs for the boys. Wherever appointments are made to the governing organs of public authoritiesâwhether they be institutions set up by legislation, independent statutory authorities or quasi government agenciesâthe process by which these appointments are made should be transparent, accountable, open and honest. One of the main failings of the present system is that there is no empirical evidence to determine whether the public perception of jobs for the boys is correct, as these appointments are not open to sufficient public scrutiny or analysis. It is still the case that appointments to statutory authorities are left largely to the discretion of the minister with the relevant portfolio responsibility. There is no umbrella legislation that sets out a standard procedure regulating the procedures for the making of appointments. Perhaps more importantly, there is no external scrutiny of the process and merits of appointments by an independent body.</para><para>The Democrats have put up amendments designed to compel ministers to make appointments on merit on 17 occasions in this place over the last few years, and this will be occasion No. 18. Every single time, Labor and the coalition have combined to block them. Thus the trend of parachuting mates into lucrative positions on various boards and authorities at the expense of the taxpayer continues. Perhaps Mr Latham's remarks indicate that Labor is at last in the process of changing its mind. Another encouraging sign was the ALP's recent support for Senator Murray's notice of motion which noted the rejection of Graeme Samuel by a majority of the states and territories as nominee deputy chairman of the ACCC. In that motion the Senate asked the federal government:</para><para>(i)		to ensure that it consults fully with the state and territory governments regarding Professor Fels' replacement, and</para><para>(ii)		to establish criteria for the selection and appointment process that include not just selection on merit, but that any candidate should be demonstrably independent, and have a strong interest in consumer and small business needs. </para><para>Even the British eventually accepted appointments on merit. Lord Nolan, head of the 1995 Nolan commission, managed to persuade the UK government to accept that appointments should be based on merit. He set out key principles to guide and inform the making of such appointments. They were: (1) a minister should not be involved in an appointment where he or she has a financial or personal interest; (2) a minister must act within the law, including the safeguards against discrimination on the grounds of gender or race; (3) all public appointments should be governed by the overriding principle of appointment on merit; (4) except in limited circumstances, political affiliation should not be a criterion for appointment; (5) selection on merit should take account of the need to appoint boards which include a balance of skills and backgrounds; (6) the basis on which members are appointed and how they are expected to fulfil their role should be explicit; and (7) the range of skills and backgrounds which are sought should be clearly specified. The UK government fully accepted the committee's recommendations. The office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments was subsequently created, with a similar level of independence from government as the Auditor-General, to provide an effective avenue of external scrutiny. </para><para>I go back to Mr Latham's comments on 24 November, when he finally recognised the importance of appointments on merit, which the Democrats have been advocating so strenuously. In particular, we have referred to and used those Nolan committee recommendations in our amendments. Mr Latham argued, `Labor should be pro-market but not necessarily pro-business, in the sense that, wherever power and privilege is concentrated, Labor needs to be anti-establishment, to give them hell.' He also commented:</para><quote><para>Insiders look after themselves.</para><para>You've only got to look at some of the appointments and actions of the Howard Government to see this is an administration that governs for just a small clique of Australians.</para><para>They're into preferment, they're into appointments for their mates and this is a real problem.</para></quote><para>	...	...	...</para><quote><para>We need to break up the insiders and disperse power as widely as possible, particularly to the outer suburbs and the great regions of this nation.</para></quote><para>It is hypocrisy for Labor to criticise the Howard government's insider recruitment program and the moralities of corporate responsibility when it is a well-known fact that Labor indulged in the same practice for years. Here are some recent examples. The Bracks government in Victoria has the worst track record on jobs for the boys, and the adequacy of its methods of appointment has been exposed and heavily criticised. In Queensland, the factional heavyweight Jack Camp was appointed to a $72,000 a year, four-day-a-week state government job without the position being advertised and without proper procedure. A former Labor Kirner government minister was paid almost $10,000 over a two-month period for a report that has never been published. Freedom of information documents have revealed that former police minister Mal Sandon was paid $320 a day for at least 28 days work on a VicRoads road safety strategy. And, of course, there was the appointment of disgraced former Senator Mal Colston to a water board. There are dozens and dozens of other `mates' examples.</para><para>Meritorious appointments are the essence of accountability. Until the notion of jobs for the boys is nipped in the bud, there will not be that much moral difference between the political patronage of Suharto's Indonesia, Marcos's Philippines or Mahathir's Malaysia, where nepotism and favouritism have run rife, and our own system of political patronage.</para><para>The amendment I have moved today would insert into the bill a section requiring that a code of practice be determined for the nomination or appointment of ACCC members. It is recommended that the process of appointment be based on merit, be subject to independent scrutiny and have transparency, openness and probity. The bill in its current form has no provision at all for this process, which in my opinion would be negligent to ignoreâespecially for a body as important and powerful as the ACCC.</para><para>We need to establish a workable system to ensure that appointments on merit occur. This amendment does that. The public needs to be reassured that there is an adequate system of transparency and independence where favours are not exploited and mates are not rewarded. Political patronage is corrupt and corrupting. It should be reined in, particularly for a body as important as the ACCC, where its role in the competition regime that we have been discussing is fundamental and where its powers are so overriding in ensuring that the public interest is protected. We need to ensure that the ACCC is independent and fair and that the best possible brains are brought to bear on the task, which is why merit based appointments are so important and why I commend this amendment to the chamber. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>7468</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>Australian Capital Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âAlthough there is merit in striving for a balanced range of views on the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, Labor do not believe the Democrat amendment is an appropriate way of achieving that goal.

We are of the view that the procedures proposed in the amendment put forward by the Democrats are unnecessarily prescriptive.

A nominee for appointment must have knowledge of or experience in industry, commerce, economics, law, public administration or consumer protection.

You get into conversation and basically ask them what is the purpose of them being there.

In that circumstance you are considering the appointment put up by the federal minister.

This issue was subject to some discussion during the inquiry. I want to hear the minister's explanation as to why the definition of core services is limited in the way that it is, particularly in relation to a service like ISDN, which provides for a slightly faster Internet connection rate. My question is: why was that not included in the core services definition for the purposes of model access undertakings?</para></talk.start><para>A general criticism of this bill not being strong enough is that many of the provisions deal with fixing or trying to fix some of the problems with the access regime and with disputes and arbitration that have been held in the past. While many of the provisions are designed with that intent, two issues stand out that I think are worthy of clarification. The core services issue concerns those model undertakings and exemptions related to technologies that are of the past, not so much of the future. So in that respect the bill does not extend itself into the types of services that will be used and in demand in the futureâ such as ISDN, which is a faster connection service but which is not captured by the model undertakings. I think it would be quite helpful in preparing new infrastructure providers and existing infrastructure providers to provide those types of services. I would like a response from the minister in relation to that.</para><para>The other issue, on which I think it is important to hear the minister's explanation, is his assurance that the removal of merits review from arbitrations will not result in further interplay or regulatory gaming between the merits review process for access undertakings and exemptions and the arbitration process, which now has no merits review. Witnesses at the inquiry expressed a lot of concern that the changes would just lead to regulatory gaming in another forum or in another way, despite the efforts outlined in this bill to prevent further regulatory gaming and to put a stop to some of the existing regulatory gaming, which I think everyone acknowledges has occurred. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>7470</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOn the first point, core services were essentially identified as those where there has been continuing disputation in industry. In practice, those services are always where there is the greatest degree of difficulty in getting access to the existing network, particularly where you have bottleneck services and where you are beholden to the incumbentâthose are classic opportunities for gaming. As a result, you want some cut-through arrangement. But you ought to proceed sparingly in the sense that it is not the job of the government or the regulator to try to resolve every dispute ahead of giving the parties commercial opportunities to sort matters out for themselves. It is a last resort situation where the minister is persuaded that there are ongoing difficulties which warrant the declaration of core services. The three that we did nominate are the ones where there have consistently been problems. That does not for a moment mean that you cannot add new services, and the bill specifically allows for that.

It has always been my view, despite Telstra's vigorous protestations to the contrary, that to have a situation where PSTN disputes could still not be finally resolved by way of a definitive judgment after five or more yearsâand, even if a decision had been forthcoming from the ACT, in theory it still could have been taken to about another three levels of courtsâlends itself classically to gaming. We do not eliminate gaming by removing that merits review appeal right. All we do is truncate the appeals process to a limited extent. The idea of being able to go back and start all over again and to introduce new material, which is what led to our identification of this as a problem area, is quite unacceptable. The problem with future gaming is that you do not really ever know about it until people find ways of stalling the system or stringing things out. Gaming does not arise because someone says, `You've got a right to game.' It arises because what seems to be reasonable on the surface is misused. And people can misuse the courts. The classic example of that, if you remember, was in the early nineties when there was a licence hearing for a third free-to-air commercial television licence in Western Australia. It was in the interests of the incumbent to make life as difficult and expensive as possible for potential new entrants. As a result, there were something like 18 appeals at all levelsâAAT, Federal Court, High Court and back again. </para><para>That is gaming. Do you therefore take away people's appeal rights? You cannot do that. But if you found, for exampleâand there is some evidence to support this, and again the Federal Court judges would not like itâthat the Australian Competition Tribunal were taking forever to make a decision (the Sydney airports matter, which went to the ACT, took nearly two years) and that comes about because judges are getting around to it when they are ready or because they have a lot of other things on their plate and they do not regard this as having any particular priority and someone takes advantage of that knowing that it is likely to slow things down quite dramatically, then you may well say, `Enough is enough, we will have a new streamlined body.' So I am quite happy to say, here and now, for the benefit of the industry that if we see evidence of those sorts of practices we would look very seriously at some sort of cut-through to ensure that the system was not just dragging on and on. </para><para>I probably said to you before, Senator Lundy, that the best book to read on this is the <inline font-style="italic">Deal of the century</inline> which describes how MCI spent the first 10 years of its existence in court trying to get access to AT&amp;T's network. That was a classic example of using the courts. Fortunately, MCI had the stomach and the pockets to be able to survive the exercise, but lesser players could not have done that. The American system seems to be almost unable to come to grips with that sort of gaming. We do not want that to happen here. I think we have been remarkably free of it. It is not a litigation industry at the present time, and it should not be. We have made three sets of changes over the last four or five years designed to speed up the process in various waysâfinetuning, getting information out earlier, making sure that people have access to the system as quickly as possible and then speeding up the process. They are all anti-gaming measures, if you like, but you cannot say in advance where gaming is likely to surface. But when it does the trick is to ensure that you do not let it go on for too long. </para><para>Bill, as amended, agreed to.</para><para>Bill reported with amendments; report adopted.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Third Reading</title><page.no>7472</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Senator ALSTON (VictoriaâMinister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts) (5.22 p.m.)âI move:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a third time.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to. </para><para>Bill read a third time. </para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BANKRUPTCY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>7472</page.no><id.no>R1525</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title><page.no>7472</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Consideration resumed from 3 December.</para><para>Senator ABETZ (TasmaniaâSpecial Minister of State) (5.24 p.m.)âI move:</para><motion><para>That the committee does not insist on its amendments to which the House of Representatives has disagreed.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>7472</page.no><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator LUDWIG</name><name.id>84N</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI echo the comments of the shadow Attorney-General in the other place that, while the opposition supports many of the measures in the <inline ref="R1525">Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Bill 2002</inline>, it is disappointing that the government has not heeded the opposition's criticism of it. The amendments moved by the opposition were intended to alleviate the harsher consequences of the bill for low-income bankrupts and to address abuse of the Bankruptcy Act by high-income individuals intent on avoiding tax. In this instance, it is worth reminding the House that Labor's amendments would have retained the early discharge provisions in the Bankruptcy Act and enabled an application for early discharge to be made after two years. They would have also ensured that a person could not be prosecuted under section 265(8) for incurring reasonable or necessary personal or household expenses, such as utility bills, rent payments and so on.</para></talk.start><para>One of the amendments which Labor supported was the repeal of section 271 of the Bankruptcy Act. This had the potential to retrospectively criminalise problem gamblers. We left that amendment for the Democrats to move, and I will comment on that shortly. We also supported and sought to have strengthened provisions in part X of the Bankruptcy Act for protection against abuse by high-income individuals intent on defrauding the Taxation Office. I will not go back over the speech I made then in relation to part X; I understand the government has a review of that provision under way. We welcome the fact that, in response to the opposition's concerns, the Attorney-General has asked Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia to undertake that review. The opposition of course welcomes the opportunity to make a contribution to that.</para><para>It is regrettable that the government has failed to acknowledge the inequities in its approach to reforming the bankruptcy law. As I have indicated previously, there are measures in this bill that the opposition do support. For that reason, we will not oppose the passage of this bill now. However, we will monitorâto the best of our ability, and with the assistance of community organisationsâthe impact of these changes on persons on low to middle incomes who struggle the most under the Howard government. We will revisit these issues where it seems appropriate to do so.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>7472</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Attorney-General in the House of Representatives is a thoroughly nice man, but I think he has one terrible flaw. I think in his education he was trained in the school of Russian negotiation, which consists of just one word: no. I have had dealings with the Attorney-General for different bills over a number of years and I have never seen a proposition go down to the House, to the Attorney-General, to which he has found the ability to say yes. Only numbers are ever able to beat the Attorney-General. Despite being an astonishingly nice fellow, I do think he has a flaw in his character and I hope that at some time he will take some therapy to try to address it. </para></talk.start><para>Here we are again. We have eight good opposition amendments and two good Democrat amendments and, essentially, the House of Representatives has sent back a message which is longspeak for the Attorney-General's no. There are some inconsistencies in the arguments. For instance, some good points were made in the attempts by Senator Ludwig and his party to address part X, and that is why we supported them. But if you read through the summary of the House's views the logic is quite strange. Referring to Senate amendments (2), (3), (4), (5), (6) and (7), sheet No. 6 says:</para><quote><para>The Government has announced a comprehensive review of Part X which is currently under way. It is appropriate to wait for the findings of that review ...</para></quote><para>That is quite a reasonable approach. You would expect them to say: `We think you may have a point but we really need to look into this a little more deeply. We'd rather put it aside and address it again later on.' Instead they say, `The amendments will add to the cost and complexity of Part X arrangements,' and, `There is no evidence that these amendments are needed,' et cetera. They are going to look awfully silly if the review of part X agrees with the opposition. Frankly, what it signals to me is an attitudinal issue. It is quite reasonable to say, `There's a review under way and we'll hold off an opinion until then,' but it seems to me a little inconsistent.</para><para>I briefly draw attention to Senate amendment (10). The Senate has made that amendment, I think, four or five timesâ certainly three or four timesâand each time the House has rejected it. This bill did amend the Corporations Act; otherwise you could not have put that amendment in there. The amendment addresses the Senate's very real concern with the intersection of insolvency and related corporations. To simply say, `The House of Representatives doesn't accept the amendment because it is inappropriate to make amendments to this bill,' runs away from the very issue that it is attempting to address.</para><para>Whatever the House of Representatives may think of senators or their parties, the fact is that neither Labor nor weâand I am quite sure it is true of all other parties and Independentsâwill make amendments for the fun of it. The amendment reflects a concern expressed to us from the constituencies whereby it is believed that the legislation needs to be changed. I remind the chamber that Senate amendment (10) comes from the 1988 Harmer Law Reform Commission recommendation. It is well grounded in a review process. I would hope that the rejection of our amendments has a little more substance in the future.</para><para>Turning to Senate amendment (9), the House of Representatives message statedâ and it summarised the amendmentâthat the intention of the Senate was to repeal section 271 of the Bankruptcy Act. Section 271 is the criminal offence provision, whereby gambling or speculations are regarded as criminal in nature. We argued, and the opposition agreed with us, that where gambling or speculation derives from an addiction it is absolutely inappropriateâprobably to use that word inappropriatelyâto jail somebody or to have the potential of a criminal conviction arising from it. Addictions are things people cannot help. Lo and behold, when I looked at the wording of the House of Representatives message I was quite excited, because they actually accepted the proposition. They said:</para><quote><para>The offenceâ</para></quote><para>that is, the existing offence in section 271â</para><quote><para>is not directed at gambling which results from addiction and removing the offence will not address problems relating to such addiction. The existence of the offence also assists some trustees in the administration of estates. Trustees and creditors report that some mischievous bankrupts will often claim that they have incurred losses `at the races' or `at the casino' when they are questioned about what has happened to money they have borrowed. When trustees mention the offence, the bankrupt will often come up with a more truthful answer which helps locate assets.</para></quote><para>We do not disagree with the governmentâ you do want to nab the crooks, the fraudulent and the people who abuse the offencesâbut we were merely trying to address the issue of addiction. </para><para>We have decided to say, `We'll accept your rejection of our amendment and simply produce an amendment which acknowledges in legislation the very argument that the House of Representatives accept and that is that the offence is not directed at gambling which results from an addiction.' So we propose an amendment which very narrowly and succinctly confines and reflects our concern. Since the House of Representatives, in their remarks on Senate amendment (9), accept that that is the policy purpose of the act, we see no reason why the government should not support it. Although the remarks in the message from the House of Representatives confirm what government policy is, neither the act nor the new bill does. We therefore propose putting into law a clear intention which they acknowledge and which is not yet in the legislation. Accordingly, I move Democrat amendment (1) on sheet 2766:</para><quote><para>Add, âbut agrees to the following amendment:</para><para>(1)	Schedule 1, page 42 (after line 3), after item 182, insert:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">182A  At the end of section 271</inline></para><para>Add:</para><para>	(2)	It is a defence to the offence in subsection (1) if the person became bankrupt as a direct consequence of a genuine addiction to gambling or hazardous speculations.</para></quote><para>I seek the support of the opposition for this amendment.

We understand Senator Murray's passion in relation to this. We also understand his view that, by the look of it, the Attorney-General is playing a game of Russian answers to questions. But we have come to a conclusion, having had a long look at the amendment moved by Senator Murray. Ultimately, we were not persuaded to support the proposal; however, it is worth setting out some of the reasoning we went through to get there.</para></talk.start><para>The Democrat amendment to section 271 of the Bankruptcy Act was moved by Senator Murray at the committee stage. Although this amendment is not one that we will finally accede to in this debate, it is one that we saw particular merit in. When you unpack the argument put by the government you find that the amendment would make it a defence under section 271 if a person became a bankrupt as a direct consequence of a genuine addiction to gambling or hazardous speculation. In essence, the government has argued that prosecutions are only brought under section 271 where there has been a blatant attempt to defeat creditors by a person who patently does not have a gambling addiction. The government has stated that in the majority of cases it only takes a reference under section 271 by a bankruptcy trustee to prompt debtors to remember where they really disposed of their money. That is the shallow argument that was put.</para><para>That may be. But the government still fails to acknowledge the advice of the financial counselling community, which fears prosecution under section 271. In the opposition's view, in this instance it could act as a disincentive to problem gamblers facing insolvency to admit their problem and turn their lives around. Looking at section 271, this amendment does not appear to us to add anything to the offence or the evidentiary burden of the prosecution. The government's view is that it would undermine the effectiveness of section 271. To our mind, this amendment would place a not-insubstantial burden on a defendant to prove on the balance of probabilities not only that they had a genuine addiction to gambling but also that this was a direct cause of their bankruptcy. </para><para>Therefore, save from the conclusion we finally came to, although it sounds an argument in supportâwe think the original motion is very good and the amended one is also goodâin the end, the difficulty we have is that we accept there should be a period of consultation on the motion and the proposed amendments, which would allow the matter to be fully aired and be in a better position to be able to become effective. We then find that, in response, the government has accepted the task of doing a review, and we understand that Senator Abetz will outline that at the committee stage of the debate. We accept that the review will include this option. We then say, perhaps both to the government and as encouragement to Senator Murray, that we will reserve our right to revisit all of these issues, including the ones that we have not insisted on today, such as the proposed amendment to section 271, and to take another look at it the next time these matters are before the chamber.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>7475</page.no><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator ABETZ</name><name.id>N26</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe government has previously explained why it does not support the amendments made by the Senate when it considered the <inline ref="R1525">Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Bill 2002</inline>. Those reasons have been confirmed by the House of Representatives. As the reasons for disagreeing with the amendments are set out in the statement from the House of Representatives, I will not repeat them; however, I urge the committee to pass the bill today. From the contributions of honourable senators, I understand that that is what will happen. The measures have broad support amongst stakeholders in the bankruptcy industry. The bill was first introduced in 2001 and industry has been waiting for these changes since then.</para></talk.start><para>I will turn to the Democrat amendment. Can I say to Senator Murray that I thought he was unusually grumpy in his contribution. Something that may cheer him up is that, on the news on Sydney radio this morning, Mr Barns indicated that he is going to allow his membership of the Democrats to lapse. That will undoubtedly come as very good news and cheer Senator Murray up. The government does not support the Democrats' amendment to section 271. As we have said previously, in practice very few people are prosecuted for this offence. The reasons for our wanting that section to remain in its current form have been indicated in previous contributions. More thought needs to be given to the amendment.</para><para>The application of the Criminal Code may in fact make the amendment quite unnecessaryâI refer to section 7.3 of the Criminal Code. The Criminal Code generally provides a range of generic defences, including the defence of mental impairment. These defences may apply to these circumstances. I am not sure as to whether they do or not, but they may applyâit would depend whether an addiction is seen as a mental impairment or not. But that also raises the issue of whether an addiction should, of itself, provide a full excuse in relation to other matters that excite the attention of the criminal law. But that is undoubtedly a debate for another day.</para><para>I am happy to indicate to the committee that the Attorney-General will ask his department and Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia, ITSA, to examine section 271 of the Bankruptcy Act and determine whether an amendment to address the issues raised by financial counsellors is required. The Attorney will ask ITSA to consult with relevant stakeholders, including financial counsellors and the Director of Public Prosecutions, in its examination of the issue. In light of this, I suggest to the chamber that the amendment proposed by the Democrats is not required at this stage. Should the examination determine that an amendment is required, this can be considered in the context of future legislation that amends the Bankruptcy Act.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>7475</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI thank the two senators for their reaction to our amendment.

The Senate has already considered this issue in the context of regulations that were rightly and very firmly rejected by the Senate some months ago. The Liberal government has repackaged the excision, removal, exclusion, of these thousands of islands around Australia's shore into the bill that we are now dealing with.</para></talk.start><para>This bill is a political opportunity for the government to rerun the 2001 election campaign, which, as we all know, was conducted on the themes of exploiting the intersection between race and fear. The Liberal government knows this is fertile ground politicallyâbut exploiting it, and exploiting it continuously, inevitably leads to self-destruction, a loss of national confidence and a nation that turns inwards and is paralysed by the issues that confront us. There is no lofty motivation for this bill. There is no assertion of principle in relation to it. It is just another piece of opportunistic politics by the Liberal government that has proven time and time again that it is willing to do anything and say anything for political advantage. The words `children overboard' summarise that approach. </para><para>It is a blatant and incorrect attempt to characterise the Labor Party as soft on border security. Nothing could be further from the truth. When Australia faced a border security threat in World War II, when it truly faced the threat of invasion, it turned to the Labor Party to lead, and it was the Labor Party that delivered. It repudiated Mr Menzies, who was the creator of the party that currently holds the government benches and was the mentor of the current Prime Minister, Mr Howard. </para><para>I will now go to the ineffectiveness of this piece of legislation. The Liberal government is somehow pretending that excision, exclusion, removal, of these islands would stop people-smuggling. It is trying to create this image that excision is somehow a stop sign. How on earth does it follow that you can exclude thousands of islands from the Australian political jurisdiction? Determined people will still come. If a part of the nation is removed and if they think they would be advantaged by landing at some other point in the country, particularly on the mainland coast of Australia, that is simply where those people attempting to land will head for.</para><para>If we excise all of these islands, Australia will be sending a signal that people should go to the mainland. How does it help with border security if we send the signal `Go to the mainland'? We will have unauthorised arrivals on the mainland of Australia, with all of the associated disease, security risks and humanitarian issues that follow, as people will pull up on very remote stretches of the Australian coastline. It cannot be logically contended that excising islands that you can see from the coastline, that you can swim toâand you can actually walk back and forth to some of these islands at low tideâis going to effectively prevent people-smuggling. It is a nonsense claim.</para><para>If we look at the other side of the coin and assume that the Liberal government gets this bill through the Senate and these islands are excised, is that a stop sign? No, it is not. People come to excised places now. What happens when they go to these excised places is that they are taken to Papua New Guinea and Nauru for processing. Excision is not a stop sign: it is a different processing regime in a different place. As these people who enter Australia, refugees, are processed they are sorted into refugees and non-refugees. What happens in the longer term? We take the genuine refugees. But what else happens over the longer term? We have all of the return problems with the non-refugees that we have with those who are processed on mainland Australia. It is a fantasy world of getting this wider excision in place.  </para><para>Labor support fast processing arrangements. If the Liberal government had a credible plan to make Australia's arrangements faster, we would support it. The Labor Party came up with a faster processing regime in their policy announcement last week. The Liberal government knows that it is not going to be able to operate the so-called Pacific solution forever, no matter how many excisions it can obtain. We have to confront the real problem. The Labor Party will support genuine attempts to deal with the real problem. A comprehensive and long-term solution is necessary. Activities that have been undertaken overseas by the Federal Police and by Immigration Compliance have made a difference. They have made a difference to people-smuggling and the opportunity for people smugglers to go about their evil trade.</para><para>What we have is a Liberal government that is adopting a political strategy rather than a credible strategy for dealing with the refugee issue. It is very important that refugees are processed in their source countries. Fixing the issues which cause them to flee, engaging in processing and care and protection in countries of first asylum, and engaging in agreements with those transit countries are all important aspects of finding a long-term solution to this issue. What has stopped boats coming, so far, is the effective work of the Australian Federal Police and Compliance personnel. The Labor Party supports that. If there is anything additional that can reasonably be doneâand the Labor Party has outlined a number of additional initiatives in its policy launch of last weekâthe Labor Party is prepared to support it, consistent with the policy it announced last week. But the Labor Party does not support this irrational political agenda which calls for the removal of thousands of islands from the Australian political jurisdiction.</para><para>We have had a number of so-called border protection strategies from the Liberal government. This bill represents its fifth strategy. The first was the pre-<inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline> strategy, when 213 boats came into Australian waters carrying thousands of refugees and, of course, nothing happened. Then the government adopted its second strategy, which was the post-<inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline> strategyâthe so-called Pacific solution. It is no coincidence that that was adopted shortly before the election was called. In April we had the third strategyâ the long-term detention strategy for Australia. Then in May this year we had a fourth strategy put forward in the context of the May budget. The fourth strategy was different from the April strategy announced only some 34 days before. Now we have the fifth strategy from this Liberal government, which is to remove from Australian jurisdiction thousands of islands around the coastline of Australia.</para><para>What sort of defence of Australia as a nation does removing thousands of islands from our political jurisdiction represent? It represents a capitulation, a surrender. Removing bits and pieces of Australia represents an admission that we cannot defend the longstanding borders of Australia. What will be next? Presumably, if this fifth strategy does not work, the government will go on and remove places like Fraser Islandâor King Island or Flinders Island located in Bass Straitâor perhaps go even further and remove the island on which I live, Tasmania. Where does all this stop? To cut out bits of Australia is not an effective strategy for dealing with refugees.</para><para>Since one of my colleagues spoke on this matter in the other place, the legislation has been before the Senate committee for a comprehensive examination. I understand that Senator Bolkus and other colleagues of mine in this place carried out a thorough examination of this legislation. Looking at the transcript of the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee to which this bill was referred, there are a couple of very interesting pieces of evidence. The first that I refer to is that of the Acting Secretary of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Mr Ed Killesteyn. He told the Senate committee that the effect of the bill would be to encourage people smugglers to head for the Australian coast. He said: </para><quote><para>It is a simple matter of geography. If you remove the outlying islands from the capacity of smugglers to simply drop off their cargo, they are forced to look for other routes ...</para></quote><para>Then we had another piece of very interesting evidence from the Australian Federal Police Commissioner, Mr Mick Keelty. He went even further and confirmed that with regard to refugees seeking to enter Australia they would prefer to have people arrive on shore. He said:</para><quote><para>This is a far preferable way for us to go ...</para></quote><para>	...	...	...</para><quote><para>... if they are going to commit a crime in the way they are sending people to Australia, we can at least try to get them sent to where there is ... some infrastructure support for them.</para></quote><para>These are two statements from senior bureaucrats. They show that aiming for the mainland is not just an effect of this bill; it is the intent. The Liberal government is effectively saying that the job of defending our borders is so difficult that we will cop out of it and surrender off bits and pieces of Australia. It is an indication that this government does not care about genuinely solving this issue. It is simply playing politics and maximising votes in respect of the matter.</para><para>Over the last three or four years unauthorised boat arrivals have landed on Australia's east coast in places such as Cairns, Townsville, Macksvilleânear Kempsey in New South Walesâand even as far south as Port Kembla. This government bill is fundamentally flawed. It is fundamentally stupid and counterproductive legislation. It simply lays out the welcome mat for similar landings to occur in future. It is in the national interest that the Labor Party will not be supporting this particular bill, as on the previous occasion we voted against the regulations that sought to accomplish the removal of thousands of offshore islands from political jurisdiction, islands that have been within the jurisdiction of the Australian nation since Australia was founded as a nation. Effective defence is defending all of Australia's bordersâthe Australian nationânot cutting bits and pieces out of it and establishing different political jurisdictions. This bill is a surrender sign from this government. It is a sign, given that this is its fifth strategy since September of last year, that the government intends to surrender up parts of the Australian jurisdiction. It should not be tolerated. Consistent with its previous vote on the regulations that were attempted to be shoved through this place, the Labor Party will not be supporting this particular bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>7478</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI speak on behalf of the Australian Democrats to the <inline ref="R1578">Migration Legislation Amendment (Further Border Protection Measures) Bill 2002</inline>. In short, this legislation is re-running an initial attempt to put through by regulation an excision of many thousands of islandsâI think over 4,000 was the eventual advice the committee receivedâ across all of Northern Australia. The area is basically from halfway up Western Australia, all the way over the top of Australia, then back down past a large chunk of Queensland, with the intent of having all of that area exempt from the operations of the Migration Act for the purpose of claiming protection. The Democrats opposed the attempt by the government to excise those islands by way of regulation earlier this year and we likewise oppose the attempt to do exactly the same thing now by way of legislation.</para></talk.start><para>I commend to the Senate and to the public at large the report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee into the migration zone excision issue. The report put forward a number of recommendations, one of which was to oppose the legislation, and quite a good outline of the issue. From the Democrats' point of view it is a great tragedy that before the last election the major parties in the Senate prevented the Senate committee from having the opportunity to examine the whole proposal to excise islands from the Australian migration zone. The Democrats welcome the Labor Party's opposition to this legislation. It is impossible, however, not to comment on the Labor Party's ongoing support for the existing excision of Christmas Island, the Cocos Islands and Ashmore Reef from the migration zone. It is difficult to see the logic in opposing the excision of all the other islands but continuing to support the existing excision of some islands from the migration zone. Obviously we need to welcome the Labor Party's willingness not to extend those excisions, but what is needed is a winding back of that injustice. </para><para>An interesting component of this report, which I have recommended that all people read, is the last couple of pagesâappendix No. 3âwhich talk about the classes of visas and the merits review and judicial review rights of various people depending on how they entered Australia and which part of it they entered. The additional levels of complexity that this government, with the support of the ALP, has put into the Migration Act, creating all these different classes of people depending on that aspect, are a source of continuing amazement. If unauthorised people land on the mainland or on these other islands that the government is attempting to excise, without having contact with Christmas Island, for example, then they could get an onshore temporary protection visa. If they land on the mainland with a tourist visa or a visitor visa of some sort and then claim protection, they can get a permanent protection visa. In both cases, they can get their applications reviewed by an independent tribunalâindependent in theoryâ such as the Refugee Review Tribunal or the Migration Review Tribunal. In both cases, there is still scopeâalthough it is very limited scope and it is still arguable how limited it isâfor them to appeal through the courts.</para><para>On the other hand, if they land on the mainland in an unauthorised way having previously landed at an excised place such as Christmas Island, then that same person can be standing next to another person in Australia but have no right to any visa in Australia unless the minister exercises his discretion and lifts that bar on applying. Therefore, they have no right to a visa and no right to merits review by the Refugee Review Tribunal; they are called an offshore entry person.</para><para>Similarly, if people apply whilst at sea in territorial waters and with no previous contact with Christmas Island, they are eligible to make an application. As they are not in the migration zone, their protection claim would be assessed, subject to meeting criteria. But they would have no rights to review, although an Australian sponsor might have review rights to the MRT for certain classes of visa and they might still have review rights in the courts. Again, there is a different set of criteria for people who apply while at sea having previously had contact with an excised place but whose boat was not intercepted at those areas. So they land on Christmas Island, go back out to sea and then apply while at seaâthere is a different set-up again. If they apply from the Christmas Island processing centre after being intercepted at sea, then again they have no rights to a visa.</para><para>What this means, and what will be continued under the Labor Party's policy, is that people who are on excised lands in Australia have no right to apply directly for a visa under the Migration Act. Therefore, they have no right to any independent review of that visa and no access to the High Court, at least in relation to a visa decision. Ironically, they will have access to the High Court in relation to anything else that happens to them on Christmas Island under Australian law, as long as it is not to do with the actions of Commonwealth officers operating under the auspices of the Migration Act. For example, if they were robbed or anything else whilst they were on Christmas Island, they would have access to the courts for that but not in relation to a visa decision.</para><para>Similarly, people who apply from a declared country processing centre such as Nauru and who have had previous contact with an excised place such as Christmas Island do have access to a visa classâan offshore visa class called a secondary movement offshore entry (temporary) visa class. If they apply from a declared country processing centre such as Nauru after being intercepted at sea but without being in contact with Christmas Island, then there is a different visa class againâthe secondary movement relocation (temporary) visa class. All of those have no right to review and usually have no right to a judicial review.</para><para>So, apart from anything else, you have this ridiculously complex visa regime applying to a whole lot of different people, all of whom are basically just seeking protection or asylum, and, depending on when they were intercepted and which piece of dirt they put their toe on first, they have a whole set of different rights. This is clearly a blatant breach of the refugee convention. Despite this, as we have heard time after time in various inquiries in this place and in government responses to opinions from the UNHCR, other UN bodies, and Australian bodies such as the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, the Australian government simply says, `That might be your opinion but it's not ours; we don't breach anything.' It just so happens that nobody else in the world agrees with them, but that does not matter! This legislation is simply another attempt to extend that absurdity. </para><para>The report is useful because it also highlights the way the whole process works in terms of the offshore entry components of the Migration Act. In terms of what this bill seeks to do, the fundamental principle from the Democrats' point of view is that you should not have people in different parts of Australia with different rights depending on which part of Australia they are in or, even worse, people who are side by side in Australia with different rights depending on whether they got here via the mainland or got here via Christmas Island and then were put on the mainland. That is a ridiculous principle and it should not be recognised in any context.</para><para>Once it is recognisedâas it currently is, unfortunately, under the existing Migration Actâthen the same sorts of principles can be extended or applied to other areas of the legislative regime. That adds an extra reason to why the Democrats so strongly oppose this whole legislative regime. It is not just because of the terrible impact it has on genuine asylum seekers but also because of the general principle, the general undermining of the rule of law and the introduction of very dangerous legal precedents that, once they are in place, are able to be pointed to by this government or future governments to say, `This is already operating in this area of the law. There should therefore be no objection to extending it to another area of the law.' That is a very dangerous path to go down.</para><para>Fundamental components about equal treatment under the law are something that should not be waived, except in the most extreme circumstances. And despite all the rhetoric and all the hype about the so-called security risk and the need to protect Australia's borders et cetera, it is quite clear that asylum seekers do not pose a significant risk to the Australian community. They certainly do not pose a security risk and they certainly do not pose a threat to our safety. As we are now so tragically aware, the real threat to our safety comes from terrorists and extremists in our region, not from asylum seekers, many of whom are trying to flee such extremists and terrorists in the areas which they came from.</para><para>Surely it is now time to revisit the entirety of the Pacific solution and to recognise that we need to refocus our attention and our resources. By that I mean refocusing not just the money but the enormous amount of defence resources and personnel, intelligence resources and personnel and bureaucratic resources away from this area, which does not present a significant threat to Australia's security, and channelling those resources to where the real threat is.</para><para>Similarly, we can scrap the absurd legal regime that puts in place legal principles and legal precedents that fundamentally undermine our rule of law and instead once again have a legal framework that is consistent, that meets our international obligations and that enables us to have a framework for assessing refugees that we can once again market to the rest of the world, which has a much bigger issue with this matter than we do. That is where this debate needs to go. I hope the fact that the ALP are holding firm on this provides a good benchmark for us to then start winding back in some of the other areas. I recognise the political difficulties they are in, and I do not want to make massive political capital out of it, but eventually they have to decide which side they are on. I think there has been an attempt to reconcile two fundamentally contradictory positions.</para><para>I go to some of the recommendations in the Legal and Constitutional References Committee's quite positive report. I was a member of this committee during its inquiry and signed up to its recommendations. The committee recommended: </para><quote><para>... initial assessments of claim for refugee status by offshore entry persons should be reviewed by an external body such as the federal magistracy or the Refugee Review Tribunal.</para></quote><para>I agree with that, but that does not match Labor's new policy. The abolition of declared countries should be welcomed, and I understand that Labor's new policy does go that far whilst shifting things across to Christmas Island. The one thing you could say is a benefit of Christmas Island rather than Nauru and PNG is that at least it is in Australia, at least there is potential scope for people to try to exercise their rights under the Constitution. I have no doubt that there will be some interesting legal cases in the next year or two trying to determine exactly what those rights are and whether or not the legislation that was passed last year in a rush before the federal election is constitutional in some aspects. I certainly hope that it is not. There is no doubt that there are strong legal arguments that parts of it are not. As always, we will have to wait for the judgment of the High Court in that regard, rather than speculating about it here.</para><para>An interesting part of the report goes to section 46A of the Migration Act. This is the part of the act that allows the minister to exercise discretion to enable people to apply for a visa. The committee recommended that the government review the operation of section 46A:</para><quote><para>... to ensure that those asylum seekers coming directly from a place of persecution are not penalised by virtue of their place of entry into Australia.</para></quote><para>It is quite clear that the law as it currently stands means that asylum seekers can be penalised by virtue of their place of entry into Australia, and that will continue. Thankfully, with this legislation being defeated this will not be expanded, but the fact remains that an offshore entry person who comes directly from a place of persecutionâand that has occurred; people have come direct from Sri Lanka, for example, across to the Cocos Islandsâwill be treated differently from a person who has come direct from a country and landed in some other part of Australia. That is a legal absurdity and it is an arrangement that beggars belief, particularly when you look at trying to build alliances with other countries about how best to deal with this broader problem.</para><para>I was fortunate to be able to spend two or three weeks in July visiting a number of countries in Europe, looking at how they are dealing with the issue of unauthorised movements of people. All of us here would know that the numbers of unauthorised people that European countries have to deal with are vastly greater than those which Australia has had to deal with in recent years. People may also know that a much lower percentage of those people that apply for asylum in most parts of Europe end up being accepted and recognised as refugees, although another proportion are accepted on humanitarian or family grounds.</para><para>This does not contrast at all with the sort of situation that Australia has had. Previously, Australia could have been engaging, selling internationally and highlighting the strengths of our positive system with our humanitarian program, our resettlement program and our migration program across the board, which many European countries do not have. We could be looking at greatly increasing our direct assistance to countries of first asylum. Instead of spending all of the hundreds of millions of dollars that we are spending, for example, on building the new detention centre on Christmas Island, that money could be put into countries of first asylum or countries adjoining refugee hot spots. It would make a great deal of difference in preventing secondary movements of people.</para><para>All of this would be far more effective and far more constructive in terms of the long-term solution, which will only come about through working cooperatively with other countries. Instead of that, we have put out a message and a legislative regime that says, `The way you deal with this is to put up a wall, take away people's legal rights and be as nasty to them as you possibly can so that they will not come here and will go somewhere else.' All that could possibly doâif that worksâis encourage everybody else to do the same thing and be equally as nasty. I do not think that is an effective or sustainable long-term way of dealing with the issue. The global pressures are too big to simply deal with it by having all of the developed world saying, `We'll just be more nasty towards people fleeing persecution and that'll stop them coming here.' That is not going to work. You do not need to think about it for too long before you recognise that it is not going to work. </para><para>The government may say, and I am sure that the minister in his final statement will say, that this policy has succeededânobody has arrived for a year: success. They have already said that a number of times in this chamber. On a very narrow definition of `success'âwhich is, `Let's not have people arriving here unauthorised in boats'âthat is successful. If you are looking at a broader definition of `Let's not cause immense suffering to vulnerable people, let's not split up families, let's not have people drown at sea, let's not have people who are part of the Australian community suffering enormously in immense poverty for prolonged periods of time'â</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name></talker><para>âHa!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT6</name.id><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name></talker><para>âSenator McGauran finds that amusing, but I do not think many other people doâthen let's not call that successful.

That is a principle we should never adhere to. Once the principle is accepted that one group of people in the communityâbecause of particular characteristics they haveâcan be treated differently under the law in the assistance they get or do not get and in whether or not we will let them be part of the community, it is a very short step to create different political dynamics to make it acceptable for another group of people to be so treated. And who knows what the next group of people to be targeted will be.</para><para>That is why it is important to resist these sorts of things. More broadly, we have already seen the targeting of Muslims in some of the rhetoric of Senator McGauran and his fellow travellers. We have seen a targeting of people who want to promote peace, rather than just blindly going to war. Once you get a divisive approach that is legitimised via a legislative framework, it could be applied in all sorts of different ways. That is why it is crucial that people stand up in the face of legislation like this. That is why the Democrats will continue to oppose this measure.</para><para>We welcome the ALP's opposition to it as well. We will continue to encourage themâ constructively, I am sureâto move their position even further so that the disgracefully negative and destructive legislative framework that was passed by this chamber in September last year can be wound back and, once again, Australia can hold its head up high as a country that defends human rights and tries to work with vulnerable people rather than punish them.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>7482</page.no><name role="metadata">Scullion, Sen Nigel</name><name role="display">Senator SCULLION</name><name.id>00AOM</name.id><electorate>Northern Territory</electorate><party>CLP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to speak in support of this very important bill, the <inline ref="R1578">Migration Legislation Amendment (Further Border Protection Measures) Bill 2002</inline>, and I rise not only proudly as part of government but also as a senator for the Northern Territory.

They have comprehensively told me that they would like me to support this bill going through this place.</para></talk.start><para>This bill is a very important part of the coalition's overall strategy to combat people-smuggling. I can recall, even before I came to this place, as someone who was a user of the seas in the Northern Territory, that much of the discussion revolved around what appeared to be almost a tidal wave of people coming to this country. In the first three weeks of August 2001âit was almost unprecedentedâwe had 1,212 unauthorised arrivals in Australia. Credible intelligence suggested that another 5,000 people were already signed up to travel in the same way. Clearly, unless something was done, around 8,000 unauthorised arrivals were due in 2001-02, growing to 12,000 in 2002-03. </para><para>Not only was this tidal wave of people coming to this country in an unlawful manner and giving great concern in relation to our resources; it would also have eliminated our capacity to help the most needy in this particular regardâthose forgotten refugees; those people who cannot afford to pay people smugglers to bring them to places of protection. I am talking about the people in long-term camps in Palestine who, for three generations now, have been behind the walls of refugee camps. I am talking about individuals in Somalia. You can imagine their plight. For example, there is the plight of one woman with five children in a camp in Somalia who now has to prostitute herself just to feed her children. Even if she survives AIDS, the chances of her being able to get to this country while other people interdict the process and pay people smugglers to come here are extremely unlikely. While her positionâwhere things may seem to become better every month because one of her children dies and she has fewer mouths to feedâis not a very palatable one, it is a fact.</para><para>Australia has been particularly attractive to what is parochially referred to as queuejumpers. They get access to a comprehensive and generous refugee determination and to medical benefits and income support, and the support of various NGOs, churches and civil libertarian groups. That is what this country is all about. It is a beautiful sun-kissed country, and no-one denies the right of people to wish to come to live here. The rest of the world probably want to come to live in Australia, but they will need to do so in a lawful way. Most importantly, people smugglers are able to offer refugees the potential to obtain lawful residence in Australia. That is well beyond what the convention on refugees gives anyone. Refugees do not have the right within the convention to determine the place under which they can seek protection. It is interesting, in terms of leadership, to hear a bit about the policy from the other side. Mr Kim Beazley, the leader at the time, said:</para><quote><para>It is in the national interest of all Australians that our generous attitude towards refugees is not undermined by people who seek to flout that generosity by placing themselves ahead of others in the queue who are determined by an orderly process to be more deserving. These are all positions which ought to be commonly agreed in this nation and commonly agreed in this parliament.</para></quote><para>Good adviceâand no doubt some in the Labor Party would say it was good advice from a good leader.</para><para>Something had to be done at that stage to prevent the growing trend of people-smuggling. People smugglers were selling this very attractive package of Australia and what it had to offer, which would effectively have undermined the international system of protection. How were we to respond? How did the Howard government respond? There were a number of steps. This was a very comprehensive challenge which needed to be met with a comprehensive suite of processes to ensure that we could ameliorate the scourge of people-smuggling. In a legislative sense, we had the power to move people to declared countries like Nauru and Manus Island. We had the power to detain vessels and to interdict at sea. We introduced a new offshore humanitarian program that would encourage people not to take this very dangerous journey from the places which they departed to come to Australia. It was run by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Organisation for Migration, a very respected organisation. These were accepted processes which ensured that those people, under this Australian government funded program, who wished to have a determination made on their refugee status could be heard in those places so that they did not have to leave those very safe shores.</para><para>We introduced a maximum sentence of 20 years and a mandatory minimum sentence of five years for people-smuggling. We introduced a $220,000 fineâcertainly a disincentive to come to this place in that way. But, most importantly, we prevented visa applications from unauthorised arrivals on Christmas Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Ashmore Reef and Cartier Island. They were very important parts of legislation that we changed. We went beyond that. This is not only about legislation but about policy. It is about how we act in a number of other ways. We have increased the number of speciality compliance officers in key overseas posts. We have placed departmental officers in key overseas airports where they train airline staff to ensure we do not get bogus documentation. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Sitting suspended from 6.30 p.m. to 7.30 p.m.</inline></para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AOM</name.id><name role="metadata">Scullion, Sen Nigel</name><name role="display">Senator SCULLION</name></talker><para>âBefore the dinner break I was sharing with the house the very positive nature of the comprehensive strategy and policy regime laid down by the Howard government to ameliorate the worst parts of the heinous crime of people-smuggling. In terms of policy, the government have not only posted special liaison officers to key overseas posts to liaise on important issues like re-admission and resettlement but also maintained multifunction task forces, both in Australia and overseas, which coordinate investigations and, very importantly, collect intelligence. The task forces frequently update Australia's movement alert list, which is a key tool governing the entry of non-citizens and in establishing the character and security status of those people.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The intergovernmental consultations on asylum in Europe, North America and Australia are leadership roles. We are showing the world the way in regard to these matters. The Asia-Pacific consultation on refugees concerns irregular migration and migrant traffic in East and South-East Asia. There is the Pacific rim intelligence officers conference. Another great step in leadership was taken and a real bipartisan approachâunlike what we get from the other side of the chamberâwas shown by both Indonesia and Australia when they cohosted the regional ministerial conference on people-smuggling in February this year.</para><para>All the changes the government have made are quite clearly not only lawful but also consistent with our international obligations. At the moment we have credible information to indicate that people smugglers could be turning their interests away from the areas we have excisedâbecause those very good disincentives have worked, have hit homeâand looking to places further to the east, particularly islands further to the east. Most importantly, people smugglers are looking for places that are not excised offshore locations, because the product that they are selling requires a migration outcome.</para><para>This information has not come from someone we just had a yarn to in the pub; this came from the People Smuggling Task Force, which was set up to coordinate all aspects of intelligence, including from the Attorney-General's Departmentâand ASIO through that departmentâthe Australian Federal Police and Customs. The task force coordinated all the intelligence it could get together in a cooperative sense to ensure that the information we had was validated. As I said, we had credible information to indicate that people smugglers have now turned their interests to non-excised places to the east, which are clearly the islands we are intending to deal with in this legislation today. The Migration Legislation Amendment (Further Border Protection Measures) Bill proposes nothing that is too complicatedâit is further border protection, which this entire house agreed to.</para><para>Mr Acting Deputy President, I have just laid out for you the credentials of the Howard government that show that we are experts in this policy. We are international leaders. I wonder why the Labor Party are resisting this border protection measure. In their recent policy announcement, they actually supported the existing legislation regarding Christmas Island, Cocos Island, Ashmore Reef and Cartier Island. In fact, they fought so hard for it that it has been reported it was a substantial plank in the decision of one of their frontbenchers to move from the front bench. Why would they have gone through all of that division in their party? It was because they knew that there is only one policy in this regard. If you look at the great mountain in front of you there is only one path up it. The Labor Party should just see that we have the right path. We are internationally renowned experts in this matter, and the Labor Party should look to us for the policy. </para><para>The whole issue of trying to pander to the far left of the Labor Party is really going to put them out of step with reality and the wider community. As Kim Beazley, one of the previous leaders of the Labor Party, said at the time:</para><quote><para>This bill is being supported because it is legal, because it is workable and because it will be effective</para></quote><para>These are prophetic words indeed because that is exactly what this legislation was. This legislation became the most effective suite of policy measures that has been put in place to ameliorate the problem of 1,212 people coming to these shores in three weeks. I have heard people say in this place: `What's that to crow about? You've only gone for 12 months without a boat coming here.' This is absolute evidence that this is the only policy.</para><para>I am absolutely mystified as to why the Labor Party think walking on both sides of the street is going to somehow impress people. The current leader of the Labor Party, Simon Crean, said:</para><quote><para>I don't see how we strengthen our borders by surrendering them ...</para></quote><para>He is alluding to the issue of sovereignty. A bipartisan committee looked at the issue of sovereignty and found there was no issue with sovereignty. In fact, we are talking about the sovereignty of the islands that I represent in my constituencyâand that Senator Crossin represents in her constituency. Those people have said to us clearly: `We support the legislation. Make sure it goes through the house. It is most important to protect our borders, our culture and our environment.' The existing excision of Christmas Island has worked comprehensively and it has been based on excellent policy. Again, I will quote Mr Sciacca, a former opposition spokesman on immigration, who stated:</para><quote><para>I want to say on behalf of the opposition that we support these bills in the spirit of bipartisanship, because we are concerned about the effects of people-smuggling and about the integrity of our borders. </para></quote><para>I do not see that bipartisan spirit here today. I would suggest to the opposition: do not be ashamed of following the only path up the mountain; do not be ashamed of following the only good policy that is around; do not be ashamed of perhaps admitting that, coming from a policy-free zone in this area, we actually have to go somewhere. If the Labor Party continue to pander to the Jurassic Park of the Left, they are going to continually be out of step with the wider community. I really believe that, unless the Labor Party support this legislation, the public will quite rightly see that Labor have been soft on border protection and out of step with the views and demands of the Australian people.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>7485</page.no><name role="metadata">Kirk, Sen Linda</name><name role="display">Senator KIRK</name><name.id>00AOO</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe <inline ref="R1578">Migration Legislation Amendment (Further Border Protection Measures) Bill 2002</inline> is a self-defeating bill that, if enacted, will do much harm to Australia's international reputation and will show the government's defiance of international law conventions and proper practice. It will do little to achieve the government's stated aim of border protection. With this bill, the government is attempting to excise from Australia's migration zone approximately 4,900 islands off the western, northern and eastern coasts of Australia that are home to approximately 21,000 residents.</para></talk.start><para>The bill seeks to extend the definition of `excised offshore place' under the Migration Act, such that any person arriving on these excised islands would be deemed an offshore entry person. Some of these 4,900 islands are so close to the Australian mainland that, as Senator Sherry said earlier, they can actually be seen by the naked eye, and in some cases you can even walk to them. We have to ask ourselves why an asylum seeker, after a torturous and dangerous journey on a leaky boat, would land on such an island with mainland Australia in sight. In my view, this is beyond comprehension. The effect of the bill will be to establish mainland Australia as the goal for asylum seekers arriving by boat. The bill will not stop asylum seekers from coming to Australiaâdesperate people will do whatever they can, and there is no doubt that asylum seekers are desperate people. An ill-conceived bill such as this will not form any part of a long-term solution for border security. </para><para>This was the conclusion reached by the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee, of which I am a member, which inquired into this legislation and reported to the Senate in October this year. Despite ministerial statements that the objective of this legislation is to enhance border protection by deterring people from arriving on mainland Australia, the committee heard that this will not be achieved under the terms of this bill. For example, in its submission to the committee the Australian Federal Police acknowledged that this bill will `draw people towards the mainland'. DIMIA also told the committee that the bill will require people smugglers to bring their vessels closer to mainland Australia. In an answer to a question on notice DIMIA acknowledged this when they said:</para><quote><para>The Bill, by extending excised offshore places to islands off the northern coast of Australia, and therefore requiring people smugglers to bring their vessels closer to mainland Australia ...</para></quote><para>Not only will people smugglers bring their human cargo closer to the mainland if this bill is passed; they will also put those people in even graver danger than at present. The International Commission of Jurists argued before the committee:</para><quote><para>... by forcing refugees fleeing persecution by sea to push on for the mainland in order to activate their rights under the [Refugee] Convention, Australia is placing them in a more perilous situation with further grave risk to their health and safety, particularly in areas with coral reefs.</para></quote><para>It is because of these concerns that I have referred to, and others to which I will refer shortly, that recommendation 1 of the Senate committee's report is that the bill not proceed. It is the self-defeating nature of this bill that has led the opposition to oppose it both here and in the other place. After hearing evidence given to the Senate inquiry into this bill, I for one was left wondering when the government would begin to excise parts of the Australian mainland from the migration zone. The Prime Minister has claimed that excising parts of the Australian mainland is an absolutely ludicrous proposition, but does that mean never, ever? Senator Scullion, from the Northern Territory, who spoke a moment ago but has now left the chamber, has said that he feels very strongly that we should excise parts of mainland Australia. While the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs told Senator Scullion that excision of the mainland is not the government's current policy, Senator Scullion has since stated, `But I'm not so sure that that's necessarily off the radar.' So with that public admission from a government senator that this may be a future plan of the government, one does wonder where the excisions will stop.</para><para>The Senate and the Commonwealth parliament must not head down the legislative path of passing this bill in an unamended form. The Senate committee that I referred to earlier heard of numerous other concerns about the bill over the course of its inquiry. Many witnesses warned of the possible breaches of Australia's international obligations that will be effected by the bill if it is enacted into law. The committee heard of significant concerns in this regard from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, international law experts and legal and human rights groups, as well as many other individuals and organisations. It is clear, and it was made clear to us over the course of the committee's hearings, that the refugee convention applies to all of sovereign Australia, based on our signing of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 1969. Article 27 of that treaty provides that a state cannot `invoke the provisions of its internal law as a justification for its failure to conform with the provisions of the treaty'.</para><para>Much of the evidence that the committee received concerned Australia's international obligations, particularly the obligation of non-refoulement of refugees under the refugee convention. When Australia signed the refugee convention, it committed this country in article 33(1) to non-refoulement of refugees. This obligation prohibits Australia from returning a refugee `in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his or her life or freedom would be threatened.' This article also extends to `chain refoulement', whereby Australia shall not send a refugee to a country where he or she will be returned to the place of persecution. Similar obligations are imposed under the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, to which Australia is also a party. The committee heard about instances of possible refoulementâin particular, when the government turns boats around and sends them back to Indonesia. The Australian Lawyers for Human Rights submitted to the committee: </para><quote><para>If an asylum-seeker is returned to Indonesia by Australia and subsequently refouled, Australia remains responsible for that person. Australia is the precipitator of chain refoulement.</para></quote><para>Because Indonesia is not a party to the refugee convention, we in Australia can have little confidence that, by sending boats back to Indonesia, the asylum seekers will not be refouled. We could be creating a situation where refugees are in effect left in limbo: they find themselves in Indonesia without protection, they cannot find a resettlement location and, most certainly, they cannot return to where they were persecuted. Concerns were also raised with the committee of possible refoulement in the situation where Australia sends refugees from excised islands to declared countries such as Papua New Guinea and Nauru in accordance with the government's so-called Pacific solution. When this occurs, again there is no guarantee that asylum seekers would not be refouled, particularly those sent to Nauruâa country which is not a signatory to the refugee convention. As South Australian law lecturer Rebecca LaForgia told the committee:</para><quote><para>If the non-refoulement provision is to mean anything, then it must be a substantive right that, if you are a refugee, you will not be returned. A substantive right requires a certain element of publicness, accountability and lawfulness. </para></quote><para>This is the core of the issue. It is impossible for Australia to know whether or not these refugees sent by Australia to other nations are being refouled or not. This government will not make inquiries as to, nor will it monitor, the fate of these asylum seekers. Our international obligations are not satisfied by turning people around and sending them on their way. As I said, under this bill Australia will send offshore entry personsâthe asylum seekers who land on excised islandsâto countries that are declared by the minister. However, there is no requirement in the Migration Act that these countries give an undertaking of non-refoulement. Furthermore, because of the government's well-known dislike of judicial review, the minister's declaration under section 198A is not reviewable in any court.</para><para>The committee, of which I was a part, heard various concerns about the lack of open and accountable guidelines in processing claims of asylum seekers in these declared or third countries. Before the committee, DIMIA denied that there is any breach of Australia's international obligations associated with the processing of asylum seeker claims in declared countries. In evidence to the committee, DIMIA said that our international obligations are met through ensuring that any asylum seeker who arrives at one of those places has his or her claims for recognition as a refugee individually assessed. Despite the assurances of DIMIA, the committee still had significant concerns about the entire process of declaration of countries for the processing of refugee claims.</para><para>Under the bill, as I said, the minister will have the power in section 198A of the Migration Act to declare a country as one for processing. This power is not reviewable. It requires no undertaking by the country concerned as to the non-refoulement of asylum seekers and it does not require the minister to revoke the declaration if he or she is no longer satisfied that the country meets appropriate human rights standards. In response to these concerns expressed to the committee, the committee in recommendation 3 of its report stated:</para><quote><para>... that the use of declared countries for holding and assessing claims for refugee status by those who have entered Australian territory at an excised offshore place should be abandoned.</para></quote><para>The committee further recommended in recommendation 4 that if the government does not abandon this practice then the Migration Act should be amended to incorporate requirements as to the meeting of appropriate human rights standards and in recommendation 5 that there be statutory recognition of standards in processing claims. </para><para>Further concerns expressed to the committee in relation to the bill focused on the reliance on the ministerial discretion under section 46A. Under this section, the minister has a discretion to lift the prohibition on an offshore entry person applying for a visa while in Australia. However, there is no obligation on the minister to take any action in relation to offshore entry persons, nor even to consider an application. The committee heard evidence that the act does not oblige Australia to take any action but merely allows the government to detain and transfer offshore entry persons. There were also serious concerns expressed to the committee that offshore entry persons could remain on an excised island and be left, in effect, in legal limbo with no recourse to apply for a visa and no right to judicial review. Such persons may be unable to apply for a visa while still in Australia and yet be barred from initiating any legal proceedings. Under section 494AA of the act, certain legal proceedings relating to offshore entry persons are barred. These include proceedings relating to an offshore entry, to the status of an offshore entry person and to the taking of a person to a declared country. Although this provision recognises that the jurisdiction of the High Court under section 75 of the Constitution is not affected, this would be of little practical benefit to an asylum seeker. The committee was of the view that the ministerial discretion to `lift the bar' is not an adequate mechanism. Recommendation 7(i) of the committee was that the government review the operation of section 46A to ensure that there is no possibility that offshore entry persons are left in a `legal limbo'. </para><para>The committee also heard submissions that article 31 of the refugee convention is another international obligation which is not complied with in the terms of this bill. Article 31 deals specifically with people coming directly from a country where their freedom is threatened and states that no penalties shall be placed upon them for their illegal presence. The government points to the ministerial discretion to allow a refugee application under section 46A, to which I just referred, in order to show its compliance with article 31. However, the committee was not satisfied with this for the reasons I stated earlier: the ministerial discretion does not require the minister to do anything in relation to people coming directly from persecution and it is not judicially reviewable. There is no guarantee under this legislation that such persons will not be penalised, contrary to article 31. As a consequence, the committee recommended in recommendation 7(ii) that the government review section 46A to ensure that this cannot occur.</para><para>Finally, the committee was concerned about the retrospective operation of this bill. The bill proposes retrospective excision of the islands to which I have referred, back to 19 June 2002âthat is, the date the regulations were rejected by the Senate. Retrospective legislation will always require a high level of justification for it to be enacted. The committee was of the view that there is no such justification for this bill. Even if such retrospectivity may have once been justified because of concerns that boats were en route to Australia, the lapse of time has made such retrospectivity unnecessary and excessive. Recommendation 10 of the committee's report is that if the bill does proceed its application should not be retrospective.</para><para>This bill is a short-sighted attempt at border protection. There are better, more sustainable ways to protect our borders and to ensure a fair opportunity for refugees to seek asylum in this country. I refer to Labor's recently announced policy on asylum seekers and refugees. A Labor government would put an end to the Pacific solution, which was the subject of extensive criticism during the hearings into this bill. Labor's policy will implement a long-term solution to the processing of asylum seeker claims. It will end processing of claims in declared countries, such as Nauru and Manus Island, thereby removing any potential for refoulement of refugees contrary to our international obligations. The committee heard many concerns about this during our inquiry. Under Labor's policy, Christmas Island will be maintained as a processing and detention facility where refugees will be processed in accordance with UNHCR guidelines. Such processing will deter unauthorised arrivals, because there will be no incentive to come to Australia by a leaky boat when the same processing guidelines apply on Christmas Island as in overseas refugee camps. </para><para>Unlike Labor's long-term approach to providing a just and fair processing system for refugees while at the same time protecting Australia's borders, this bill fails in every intended respect. It fails to achieve border protection and at the same time exposes Australia to criticism for its failure to adhere to its international obligations. The Senate should not allow this cynical, short-sighted bill to pass unamended. I urge senators to support the opposition's amendments, which will reflect the recommendations in the report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>7489</page.no><name role="metadata">Tchen, Sen Tsebin</name><name role="display">Senator TCHEN</name><name.id>86Y</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>â I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1578">Migration Legislation Amendment (Further Border Protection Measures) Bill 2002</inline>. It is important to recognise that this bill does not introduce any new concept in border protection. It does not propose any new measures in migration law. And it most certainly does not affect the rights of any Australian citizen or resident. It is entirely noncontroversial, except that it exposes the uncertainty and ambiguity that the Labor Party tries so desperately to hide as to how or even whether it would protect Australia's national interests. Rather, this bill makes minor extensions to the definition of excised offshore place which was inserted into the Migration Act by the Migration Amendment (Excision from Migration Zone) Act 2001âan amendment that was supported by the Labor Party and, it should be noted, continues to be supported by the Labor Party. This bill is an important part of the government's overall strategy to combat people-smuggling. We should all recognise the simple fact that this strategy has already worked. The message has gone out and it has been heeded. There has been no unauthorised boat arrival in Australia for nearly a year. Indeed, the Senate should note that the effectiveness of the government's policy has been recognised by the Labor Party. The retention of the excision of these offshore places is a key part of Labor's asylum seeker policy announced last week after much agonising by the ALPâand further agonising since then.</para></talk.start><para>The Labor Party says it opposes this bill because of concerns about Australian sovereignty. The provisions in this bill have no effect whatsoever on the rights and wellbeing of any Australian citizen or resident in Australia on a valid visa, whether it be for permanent or temporary residency. This is an extremely important observation to make because of the type of red herring that the Labor Party constantly raises. The simple fact is that if Mr Crean, Ms Gillard and the rest of the Labor leadership were truly concerned about sovereignty then they would haveâindeed, they should haveâraised these concerns during the debate about the excision of Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands last year. They did not raise them then and, as I noted before, they do not today.</para><para>So why do the Labor Party make such a hoo-ha about the nation's sovereignty being violated by excision? They do not want to be seen to oppose a policy that obviously works and they know that the extension of this policy would further strengthen the border protection capabilities instituted by the government, yet Mr Crean persists with the fiction that this bill means that we would be surrendering our borders. The truth is that Mr Crean is trying to walk both sides of the street, but he runs the risk of pandering to the lunatic sections in the Labor Party only to assist the people smugglersâthose international criminals who are Australia's real enemies.</para><para>This bill was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee when it was introduced into this chamber. That inquiry turned into a classic political stunt by the Labor opposition. While every non-existing concern about human rights received an airing, notwithstanding lack of evidence, the only submission the inquiry received that expressed substantive and verifiable concerns, from the Indigenous communities in those places to which this bill is applicable, received no consideration in the recommendations of the inquiry. </para><para>What the inquiry process did make clearâthough this was not reflected in the inquiry's reportâwas that the provisions of this bill will have no effect whatsoever on Australia's continued observation of international treaty obligations regarding asylum seekers. We heard earlier Senator Kirk quote chapter and verse supposedly from the inquiry's report. What Senator Kirk did not tell the Senate is that none of the witnesses she quoted would declare, when pressed, that they were certain that any breach of such obligations would result from this bill passing into law. In fact, the representative of the UNHCR, when asked this question, specifically said that he did not believe this bill would cause Australia to violate human rights under our international treaty obligations.</para><para>An important outcome of this bill is that it would reinforce Australia's prospect of continuing to protect the people, the communities and the environment of Northern Australia from introduced pests and diseases by successfully discouraging unauthorised arrivals of people assisted by people smugglers. This was a concern repeatedly raised by the Indigenous communities of Northern Australia, who gave the bill their unqualified support. Senator Scullionâundoubtedly the one genuine representative in this chamber of Territorians and especially of the Indigenous communities in the Northern Territoryâhas already covered this aspect in his excellent discourse on this matter. I need only note that the ALP has once again ignored the interestsâthe expressed interestsâof Indigenous Australians when these do not coincide with the ALP's own agenda.</para><para>This bill is about the government's commitment to work comprehensively in Australia's national interest by ensuring strong border protection and that no weak messages are being sent to people smugglers overseas. The previous decisions to excise Christmas Island, Ashmore Reef, Carter Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands have, with a range of other initiatives, been successful in deterring boats from seeking access to Australia. The government believes that the additional excisions proposed would provide an additional deterrent and are an important part of the broader strategy of prevention, interdiction and deterrence. I urge ALP senators to put Australia's interests first and support the passage of this bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>7490</page.no><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display">Senator CROSSIN</name><name.id>7Y6</name.id><electorate>Northern Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise this evening to add a contribution to the debate on the <inline ref="R1578">Migration Legislation Amendment (Further Border Protection Measures) Bill 2002</inline>. As we all know, this bill is intended to excise more than 3,000 islands off the coast of Australia. As Senator Sherry said in his contribution, this bill was introduced probably minutes after the Senate disallowed the regulations under which it was first proposed to excise these islands. The government claims that this bill is aimed at deterring people smugglers. However, there is very little evidence to support this claim. The government has not offered a clear justification for the excisions detailed in this bill.</para></talk.start><para>The government has stated that people smugglers are likely to look for new routes, given the excision of the usual routesâthat is, to Christmas Island and Ashmore Reef. If the response to this is to cut off more islands, what is stopping the government from excising sections of the mainland nextâ Broome or Darwin, for exampleâunder the same justification? Many of the islands lie extremely close to the Australian mainland. In some cases, people are able to walk to islands off the Northern Territory coast during low tide. That is certainly the case with islands which are as close to the northern shore as Milingimbi. The Darwin Surf Life Saving Club row their boat to the Tiwi Islands, and it only takes them some hours to do it. So we are not talking at all about sections of land that are large distances from the mainland. That demonstrates how close some of these islands are and how ridiculous it is to expect this bill to deter people smugglers. </para><para>This legislation expects people smugglers to go past the islands to the mainland. This would in fact encourage those people smugglers to move past the islands to the mainland, rather than deter them. It also shows the level of understanding the government has about the region of Northern Australiaâ which seems, as the days roll on, to be very littleâand the practical inadequacies that this bill presents. In addition, these islands are not necessarily on any direct route from Indonesia. A boat travelling from Indonesia could reach parts of the mainland more easily than it could divert to a number of the excised islands. </para><para>I also mention that this bill does nothing to impact on the number of unauthorised airport arrivals, for example, which constitute a significant number. Unauthorised arrivals who land in an excised zone are not covered by Australian law, and consequently do not have any right to appeal a decision to the Refugee Review Tribunal or to access any Australian court. But, of course, that is exactly the way this government would want it. At the same time though, Australia has signed and ratified conventions and is obliged by international treaties not to expel, return or extradite people who are in danger of being persecuted. Therefore, it seems that asylum seekers who make the dangerous journey to an excised island will be stranded on an island that possibly does not have the resources or the infrastructure to support the people, and they may be homeless, desperate and traumatised, living in fear of their own and their families' lives.</para><para>Let us have a look at the process that this bill underwent in order to get here. We know that the local communities, particularly the ones that I have spoken to in the Northern Territory, were not consulted about this piece of legislation. In fact, there was much confusion about what this bill would generate.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>YW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Macdonald</name></talker><para>âWhat did the Tiwi Islanders say?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>7Y6</name.id><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display">Senator CROSSIN</name></talker><para>âLet me pick up on that interjection from Senator Macdonald. The Tiwi Islanders are not happy about this piece of legislation. Robert Cleary, the new executive officer of their local government association, spoke without authorisation on their behalf and has since been chastised by those Indigenous people for doing so. Senator Macdonald, you know that Mr Cleary is a former local government minister for the Liberal Party in Tasmania. Given his background, why wouldn't he go on radio to champion the benefits of this legislation without the authorisation of the Indigenous people for whom he worked? So it is not correct to say the Indigenous people on the Tiwi Islands supported this legislation, because their spokesperson had no right to make the comments he did on radio. Perhaps you should do your homework before you make such interjections, Senator Macdonald.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The lack of consultation on behalf of the government has led to considerable community confusion about the nature of this measure. Even Senator Nigel Scullion himself admitted on radio that there has been significant confusion in the Northern Territory and on the islands as to what this is all about. He also admitted that the island residents were not consulted at all. Senator Scullion was sent on a rescue mission to the islands to save face. In the government's defence, however, Senator Scullion stated in a radio interview:</para><quote><para>But, because it had no impact at all on Australians, there was an assumption that we didn't need to talk to anybody.</para></quote><para>When it was suggested by the reporter that the idea to excise over 3,000 islands off the coast of Australia was hatched overnight, Senator Scullion replied, `Well, it was pretty much overnight.' It is no wonder Australians are confused, and no wonder there is little explanation given for this measure. It is little wonder that it has received so much criticism from the community and from the Labor Party as being an ad hoc bill.</para><para>The extent of these misunderstandings is not insignificant. There were newspaper reports of people in the Torres Strait actually welcoming the excision, based on a misunderstanding that it would increase their independence. People deserve to know what the government is conjuring up behind their back, especially when it is literally in their own backyard. These misunderstandings are not surprising, considering the government's lack of consultation with Indigenous people and people who live on these islands. No affected Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander communities were consulted before the government made the decision to excise them from Australia. In fact, I travelled to Goulburn Island and Croker Island and spoke to the people about this very matter. They were quite confused about it and wondered why on earth we would want to excise islands that they believed, under their law, were part of the mainland. </para><para>If you know anything about Croker Island and Goulburn Island, you will know that they have a significant attachment to Oenpelli and Maningrida, which are communities on the coast of Northern Australia. That is their traditional land and cultural link, so to them this made absolutely no sense. The other thing that worried them when I spoke to them was that they were very frightened that this would mean that, if people landed on their island or were struggling on a boat off the shore of their coastline, they may be somewhat hesitant to assist those people. A comment was made to me: `Perhaps we should head out with a boat and ensure they get to the mainland so that their rights are protected.'</para><para>So it is true: these people were not consulted and did not understand this legislation. Then the government went ahead and launched an information kit 13 weeks after a decision was made, which simply compounded the insult. Regulations were made by the government to excise these islands on 7 June 2002; however, it was not until September that an information kit was distributed by mail to community organisations in the Northern Territory. Are we surprised at the date of the launch of the release of this kit? It happened to be the day before the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee was coming to town to conduct its inquiry. My, my; what a coincidence!</para><para>Given that the government attempted to make regulations to excise islands in early June, it is interestingâand quite appallingâ to note that an information kit was distributed three months after the decision was made to excise over 3,000 islands off our coast. If I remember correctly, what this government actually asked Indigenous organisations and ATSIC to do was to distribute the kit on its behalf. This made matters far worse. My office had a number of phone calls asking if I knew where the kit ought to be sent toâpeople in ATSIC were wondering what they ought to do with this kit. Far be it from me to suggest that, as always when it comes to Indigenous people, the government had not done its work and consulted them properly and consistently. But that is never an issue or a priority with this government. Despite the fact that no-one at all on these islands was consulted prior to either the regulations being made or this legislation being drafted, the government intends to excise those islands. The minister has asked island residents to look out for suspicious vessels in the region. The government has actually decided that these residents will now be Australia's front line of defence. Consultation prior to the decision being made to excise islands was not even attempted by this government.</para><para>This is quite significant, as it illustrates very well the lack of thought that has gone into this so-called policy. This is not even a quick fix in an attempt to discourage people-smuggling. This bill is ill-conceived and ill-targeted, to say the least. Not even the Premier of Western Australia, the Premier of Queensland, or Clare Martin, the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, were consulted on this issue. They were subsequently informed, on 6 June, but no initial consultation was pursued prior to the decision being made. When the government was questioned about the level of consultation with the communities and how information was distributed, a response was given that was absolutely inadequate. In answering questions that I put on notice, Senator Ellison, representing the Minister for Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, stated:</para><quote><para>The Government's Anti-People Smuggling Taskforce provided information in early June that people smugglers would target islands closer to the Australian mainland. The organisers were believed to be avoiding Christmas and Ashmore Islands, and intending routes via waters off northern Australia.</para><para>In order to ensure the integrity of Australia's borders, it was necessary for the Government to act as quickly as possible to discourage future people smuggling operations. Accordingly, the Government made Regulations on 7 June 2002 to excise further offshore islands.</para></quote><para>Given this explanation, and reasoning given by this government, there is nothing stopping the government from excising parts of the mainland. If the government receives similar information which suggests that people smugglers will in the future target the mainland, what on earth will be the government's course of action then? It seems logical that this government will simply excise those parts of the mainland that may be targeted. In fact, Senator Scullion, again in a radio interview, stated: </para><quote><para>I felt very strongly that we should excise in fact parts of mainland Australia.</para></quote><para>Senator Scullion only changed his mind in relation to this statement because, I understand, the minister called him and explained that that may be a breach of international conventions. Therefore, Senator Scullion changed his tune, but he still maintains that it is `not off the radar'. The minister may want to clarify for us whether or not there are plans to excise parts of mainland Australia. It certainly has not been ruled out in radio interviews in the course of this debate.</para><para>There is obviously no genuine policy agenda behind this bill. In fact, this bill has been inaccurately titled as including `further border protection measures'. There are no further border protection measures included in this bill. The government is simply cutting off parts of our country for immigration purposes. There is a significant lack of evidence justifying the excision, and this is primarily because it is an ineffective solution. This is a political decision, not a long-term policy solution. It takes no consideration of the current global situation and does not even attempt to provide a humane and long-term commitment to Australia's national security.</para><para>Labor reaffirm our support for tough border protection and for smashing people smugglers. However, Labor can see the inadequacies of this bill. We have recently produced a policy which encompasses the current global and national situation, international treaties and conventions, as well as consideration of community attitudes. We have presented Australia with an alternative that is both humane and practical in protecting our borders. The government in this bill has delivered nothing more than a fractured and minimal approach which does not provide any solution to the current inadequacies. </para><para>The excision of islands does not strengthen our border protection. It weakens us. It shrinks our borders. It is in fact an invitation for people smugglers to attempt to reach the mainland. The inevitable consequence of this policy is that the risk that unauthorised persons would end up landing on the mainland is in fact substantially increased, not diminished. There has been serious criticism of the idea of distinguishing between different parts of Australia for migration purposes and it has been suggested that excisions will only result in asylum seekers seeking to land on mainland Australia, further endangering the lives of asylum seekers, potentially increasing the quarantine problems on the mainland and potentially leading to the situation where parts of the mainland of Australia might also be excised from the migration zone in the future. </para><para>This legislation was the subject of an inquiry by the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee. That committee stated:</para><quote><para>There is little evidence to support assertions that the excision of islands close to the mainland is likely to deter asylum seekers. In fact, some evidence was received that the likely effect of the Bill would be to drive asylum seekers closer to the mainland, either with the intent of landing there, or incidentally. Either may increase the likelihood of landings on the mainland.</para></quote><para>The very first recommendation that features in the report from the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee is:</para><quote><para>The Committee recommends that the Migration Legislation Amendment (Further Border Protection Measures) Bill 2002 not proceed. </para></quote><para>It is plain and simple: this is not the solution to people smugglers. </para><para>Finally, the budget papers disclose that the Howard government intends to maintain processing in third countries such as Papua New Guinea and Nauru over the next four years, at a disclosed cost of $430 million. Clearly the government faces substantial difficulty with the strategy, given that it does not have a four-year agreement with either Papua New Guinea or Nauru and that recent comments by the President of Nauru indicate considerable dissatisfaction with the current agreement and disputation over the terms of the agreement. It should be noted that, in respect of the <inline font-style="italic">Tampa </inline>asylum seekers, the Howard government has called for global burden sharingâthat is, nations other than Australia should offer resettlement places to any of these asylum seekers found to be genuine refugees. There are no future global burden sharing arrangements for non-<inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline> asylum seekers, and Australia will have to resettle those found to be genuine refugees. The government has no ongoing agreement with any country, not even with Indonesia, our closest neighbour. </para><para>The budget papers disclose that it is the Howard government's intention to have no new asylum seekers processed on mainland Australia. It is obvious that this government has avoided creating adequate solutions, because it was not provided for in the budget. This government has no intention of providing a long-term solution to this global problem which would include strong relationships with not only our neighbours but also the UNHCR. This government has not bothered with that. The Howard government thinks that it can simply dump asylum seekers on Pacific Islands and New Zealand. This has proven to be a flawed policy which has cost the Australian taxpayers millions of dollars and taken away from important aid programs elsewhere.</para><para>This is an inappropriate bill. It has been introduced without adequate consultation, explanation or justification. It shows, once again, that this government has taken the attitudes and the views of Indigenous people, particularly those living on the islands, absolutely for granted. We have had regulations not passed by the Senate which were followed by legislation minutes later. Then it took some three months before an information kit was produced and, in a fairly clumsy way, distributed to those communities so they were aware of what was happening. This government surely is not serious about making sure that everyone who will be affected by this legislationâand people in these communities will be affected by the legislation if a boatload of people rocked up on their beachesâunderstands the impact of this legislation, understands their rights and responsibilities and understands what their response ought to be. People smugglers will not be deterred by this legislation; they will be encouraged to go right past those islands to the mainland.

This is only one example of his abuse of international law and long-held international standards, as this country dives below the surface of those standards on which we once so proudly floated and were so keen to uphold. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, in making a submission to the government on the matter, pointed out that these amendment bills erode the universal application of human rights. It is a basic tenet of human rights, they said, that such rights should be applied equally, without distinction. Everyone within Australian territory is entitled to have his or her human rights respected and protected. For example, Australia has undertaken to ensure those rightsâin the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Childâto all persons within its territory. Our nation, under more noble past leadership, signed these international conventions.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>YW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Macdonald</name></talker><para>âWho was that?

Article 26 of the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights provides for the rights of non-discrimination. This piece of legislation is inherently discriminatory. HREOC points out that the bills undermine core international human rights guarantees, including the right of non-refoulementâthat is, Australia's obligation to people presenting in its territory, people coming to any part of our territories, claiming to be at risk of persecution. They are set out in four international treaties to which Australia is a party, not only the refugee convention. That convention and those treaties are debased by this legislation. Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or Punishment provides:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>No State Party shall expel, return ... or extradite a person to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture.</para></quote><para>The right of such a person to resist expulsion is not made dependant upon him or her satisfying the definition of `refugee'. Yet, in this legislation, that right is being denied people in Australian territory. Under the Convention on the Rights of the Child:</para><quote><para>No child shall be deprived of his or her liberty unlawfully or arbitrarily.</para></quote><para>What a disgraceful abrogation of its duty as a national citizen Prime Minister the Hon.

And now we are going to remove the rights of such children, not only to not be arbitrarily detained but to be heard under the laws of Australia, by excising 1,000 islands around the north of Australia from the reach of the international conventions to which we are signatories.</para><para>The Greens will, of course, sit on the other side to the government on this legislation. We totally oppose it. We will fight it all the way down the line. It is interesting that the government which brought this in as a regulation and had that defeated in the Senate is now trying to pass it as legislation. In so doing, the government simply compounds the abrogation of its responsibility to uphold Australia's reputation as a lawful citizen around the world. This is a government that talks about law and order, and breaks it internationallyâin front of the world and in front of its own citizensâand uses the parliament in an attempt to stamp approval on the serial breaching of international law. This is a government which says, `We line up with the United States in an impending attack on Iraq'âthey will, and it is inherent in everything we have heard so farâin another breach of international law, which is in fact the Charter of the United Nations itself, as we move into a new period of lawlessness by the most powerful states on the face of the planet, without an ability to understand history or to understand the danger which the Howard government puts Australian citizens in by that line of action. All of this goes counter to the whole last century of Australia being at the forefront of promoting international rights for all human beings equally.</para><para>Senator Crossin mentioned Mr John Cleary, a former minister in the Tasmanian parliament in a number of Liberal governments between 1979 and the late 1990s who is now administering the Tiwi Islands in the Northern Territory. I happened to be in the parliament with Mr Cleary for at least half of that period. Senator Crossin reiterated the appalling fact that the Indigenous people of the islands that are being excised have not been consulted by this government at any point in the development of these regulations and this piece of legislation. What an appalling insult that is to those people! It is again an indictment of the arrogance and narrow-mindedness of a government which not only breaches law, as I have outlined, but breaches the whole spirit of recognition that people, where their rights are affected by government action, ought to be consulted. The difficulty, I guess, for the Indigenous people on those islands is that they are not recognised as equal citizens by this government. Whatever else Mr Cleary is doing in his administrative post, let me reiterate some of the things he stood for during that period in Tasmania. It may enlighten us a little as to why that consultation did not occur or, if it failed to occur before he became the administrator, why it is not occurring now.</para><para>Mr Cleary was an avid proponent and supporter of the destruction of the Franklin River and all the Aboriginal historyâthe cave sites and the connection for thousands of yearsâinvolved with that river. You might remember, Mr Acting Deputy President Brandis, Aboriginal people leading the protests and being taken to jail while trying to defend their cultural history in Tasmania. Mr Cleary was one of those who passed the legislation which enabled them to be arrested and sent to jail. When it came to the great forests of Tasmania, Mr Cleary was always at the forefront of supporting legislation and regulation that meant they would be destroyed in the interests of the wood chippers sending those forests to Japan.</para><para>When it came to the Wesley Vale pulp mill in northern Tasmania, where there was concern that farmlands would be polluted and that 13 tonnes of organochlorines would go into Bass Strait each year, Mr Cleary avidly supported the pulp mill against the wishes of the fishermen, the farmers and a great number of members of the Tasmanian community. Western Tasmania, which is a great job producer and attractor of investment in Tasmania, was largely made a World Heritage area because of its Aboriginal history and extraordinary importance to the world, given the Aboriginal sites and the ongoing connection for the Aboriginal people. Mr Cleary opposed that all the way down the line. </para><para>When it came to establishing Aboriginal land rights in Tasmania, which were proposed by the Labor-Green accord in 1989-92, John Cleary opposed that as well. He opposed gun law reform before the Port Arthur massacre. He was also opposed to legislating to help with the establishment of support for those who wanted home births in Tasmania. Of course, there is much more to it, but I thought that those things should go on the record.</para><para>I want to get back to the legislation and say that this is not just an ordinary piece of end-of-year legislation. It is again an indictment of a government which has gone far off centre and far from the average of the thinking of this country over the past decades to put Australia into an age of right-wing, sectionally divisive government interested not in the Christian philosophy of share and do unto others as you would do unto yourself, but in a philosophy of greed, selfishness and walking to the other side of the road to avoid even looking at people who have great misfortune, are down on their luck and are down on the road in this life.</para><para>I do not know what the creed of this government is. Could somebody explain its philosophy? What is the human thought behind this legislation? Perhaps one of the two government senators opposite might get up and explain. What is the spiritual, humanitarian, Christianâif you willâcredo that manifests itself in a selfish, rejectionist, antihumanitarian piece of legislation like this? I suspect that neither will attempt to answer that, because this legislation is built on self-interest, greed and denial of the misfortune of others.</para><para>We have a government that says we must globalise and bring down the barriersâbut that is for money. Here we have a piece of legislation which is the exact opposite and says, `Let's compartmentalise and put up the barriers,' because we are not dealing with money here, we are dealing with human beings. Can a senator opposite get up and explain that? I do not think so. We will be opposing this piece of legislation.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>7497</page.no><name role="metadata">Stephens, Sen Ursula</name><name role="display">Senator STEPHENS</name><name.id>00AOS</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âDuring the course of the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee's inquiry into the <inline ref="R1578">Migration Legislation Amendment (Further Border Protection Measures) Bill 2002</inline>, we were presented with very little evidence to suggest that this legislation will be able to achieve its stated aims. It is a piece of legislation that in fact has the potential to do more harm than good. According to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, the bill has the aim of border protection. It is intended to prevent people from using excised offshore places to achieve migration outcomes. Its aim, then, is to prevent people from entering Australia without a visa.</para></talk.start><para>However, I am not convinced that excising almost 5,000 islands along Australia's coastline, many of which are very close to the mainland, will in any way add to the efficacy of the existing system. This bill may well prevent people from using excised offshore places to seek asylum, but it is likely to encourage them to head for the mainland instead. The committee found conflicting reports amongst and between government departments as to what role this excision could play in the border security of Australia. The one thing that they could agree on was that excising islands so close to the mainland would force boats to make that extra step and land on the mainland itself. So, like the Pacific solution, this bill can be seen as nothing more than a PR exercise. It sounds tough but in fact it achieves little.</para><para>This government has engaged in what has become an extremely dangerous world contest with other destination nations to develop the harshest deterrence mechanisms, because in the current system there is a sense that the country with the weakest deterrence mechanisms will be targeted. This is a gross and punitive waste of resources in an international competition that no-one can win. Labor has proposed to work cooperatively with other nations to stop competing to deter asylum seekers and start developing multilateral policies for resettling or repatriating them. This is not a situation we can ignore. It is not going to go away. This bill is yet another Howard government mechanism to make it look like it is doing something about the problem when really it is just biding its time, wishing it would all go away. </para><para>The minister has claimed that such legislation `will significantly reduce incentives for people to make hazardous voyages to Australian territories'. Many submissions to the inquiry questioned whether this will be effective as a deterrent: `What,' they asked, `is standing in the way of them simply landing elsewhere?' Obviously, the danger of a journey to Australia on an overcrowded boat is a much stronger disincentive than questionable migration outcomes. If someone is fleeing their home or, as is so often the case now, travelling to join a family member who is in Australia on a TPV and has no right to family reunion, the incentive to find somewhere safe for them and their families is particularly strong.</para><para>But this bill will not deter asylum seekers from coming to Australia, as the islands it has excised are simply too close to the mainland. Deterring people smugglers from making the journey would be a legitimate policy aim, but this is clearly not the aim of this legislation. I am quite sure that people smugglers would not offer a money back guarantee if their cargo did not achieve migration outcomes.</para><para>Apart from the fact that the legislation will not achieve its stated aims, the major concern that I have with it is that it has the potential to add to the costsâthe financial, social and political costsâof the disaster that has been the Pacific solution. According to the repeated pledges of the Australian government to the people of Australiaâand to Nauru and to Papua New Guineaâthe processing of asylum seekers in these Pacific nations is a temporary measure. The government, however, has budgeted $430 million over the next four years for offshore processing in Pacific island countries. The memorandum of understanding between Australia and Nauru and Papua New Guinea also allows for the situation to continue for `as short a time as is reasonably necessary'â in other words, the time frame is open ended. This causes enormous difficulties for these countries and, in my view, is an unnecessary extension of the policy of detaining people in conditions far worseâand at far greater expenseâthan those in Australia.</para><para>In 2001-02, the detention of asylum seekers on Nauru and Manus Island cost the Australian taxpayers more than $150 million. While expenditure on the Pacific solution and aid to Nauru continues to soar, Australia has been cutting funds to the UNHCR. From 2000 to 2002, funding of $14.3 million was allocated to the UNHCR in the budget. Core funding in the 2002-03 budget has dropped to $7.3 million, although now the UNHCR will be able to compete with other organisations for additional funding. While the minister claims that refugee flows must be addressed at their source, the Australian government is cutting funds to the very agency responsible for dealing with the refugee crisis at its source.</para><para>Under Labor, funding to the UNHCR will be increased to $25 million. Labor will also abolish the special program funding introduced in the 2002-03 budget. This shows a real and serious commitment to addressing refugee flows at their sourceâwe have yet to see such a commitment from the governmentânot only in terms of funding for the UNHCR but also in terms of aid priorities. Labor has also committed to boosting aid to address the root causes of refugee movements, contributing to lasting solutions not unworkable stopgaps. As Margaret Piper from the Refugee Council of Australia noted:</para><quote><para>Iran has 2.5 million asylum seekers and gets $30 million from the international community. Now we are spendingâif estimates are correctâbetween $350 to $400 million on trying to keep out a couple of thousand people. If we were to spend even a portion of that on helping Iran, these people would not have to look to the smugglers to get on the boats to come halfway around the world to risk their lives to get to somewhere where they have protection.</para></quote><para>Using foreign aid to buy the assistance of poorer nations, as this government has done with Nauru and PNG, is a case of really misplaced aid objectives. Pacific expert Greg Fry of the Australian National University argued that the policy:</para><quote><para>... has serious political implications for a number of Pacific states. It has also damaged the way Australia is seen in the region and has acted against the Australian Government's other foreign policy goals in the area (such as promoting responsible governance). </para></quote><para>Aid should not be used as a bargaining tool in this way with Nauru and Papua New Guinea. This policy has damaged Australia's reputation in the Pacific, with the focus on the Pacific solution seen to be overshadowing key priorities in the regionânot least of which is the significant number of internally displaced people and refugees in neighbouring Pacific countries, including the Solomon Islands, Bougainville and West Papua. An Oxfam report states:</para><quote><para>... over $40 million has been spent to establish and run the camp on Manus Island for less than 400 refugees, while church and humanitarian agencies are using limited resources to support over 6,000 West Papuan refugees and border crossers living in official and unofficial camps along the border with Indonesian-controlled Papua. There are also some 17,000 internally displaced people within Papua.</para></quote><para>My concern is that this legislation will create more offshore entry persons, continuing this misuse of justice and funds. This policy was developed in an ad hoc manner and has left the government with promises it cannot keep and people found to be refugees waiting an indeterminate time to be resettled. It makes no sense to create more offshore entry persons when the government already has a major problem on its hands with those who have been taken to a declared country over the past 14 months.</para><para>During the 2001 election campaign, in relation to asylum seekers who were to be detained in the Pacific, Prime Minister John Howard stated, `They are not coming to the Australian mainland; that is one choice that is not available.' Despite such pledges, a total of 281 of these refugees have so far arrived in Australia for permanent settlement under the Pacific solution. There have been 701 approvals for asylum seekers on both Manus Island and Nauru to date. It is taking the Australian government a considerable length of time to find resettlement places for the remaining refugees, with no solution to this problem in sight. Practically, the result of this is the continuing detention of people who have been found to be refugees. Clearly this is not a preferred outcome, by any means. If the majority of them, as seems set to happen, end up in Australia, the whole exercise will have been nothing but a waste of moneyâan expensive and politically expedient diversion.</para><para>There are also pressing concerns as to what will happen to those whose applications for asylum have been rejected and who cannot be returned. Nauru and PNG do not want them to stay indefinitely, and it is not clear whether they can be forcibly repatriated. These people are stuck in limbo because the government did not consider the results of this policy beyond the 2001 election date. As Oxfam-Community Aid Abroad found in their report of August this year into the Pacific solution:</para><quote><para>The Australian government has not been transparent with the Australian or Nauruan public about the length of time to be taken for the processing of applications.</para></quote><para>A lack of transparency can be a feature of bad policy and also a corollary to it. There is very little information in the public sphere about conditions of detention on Nauru and PNG, and certainly there is not enough public scrutiny. This has led to problems in detention conditions and visa processing that would have raised much more alarm had they occurred in Australia.</para><para>Labor's plan to maintain Christmas Island as an excised place is, unlike the government's policy, well considered. Conditions of detention on Christmas Island will not be inferior to those on the mainland. There will also be transparency in relation to the conditions of detention and the asylum claims processing regime, with an expert committee, the Asylum Seeker Claims Processing Review Committee, overseeing the development and functioning of the processing regime. Unlike the Liberal government, Labor will not need to hide its actions. Processing on Christmas Island will be fast, fair and transparent, and there will be no long waits for resettlement, because Labor will take its responsibilities seriously and resettle in Australia all those found to be refugees.</para><para>The delays in processing applications on Nauru have seriously disadvantaged hundreds of Afghan applicants because of the regime change in Afghanistan. These delays, and the lack of clarity as to the future of the policy, have created major difficulties for the Nauruan government. This legislation, in an attempt to deter asylum seekers by excising islands close to the Australian mainland, is just another example of this government's misplaced priorities and open hypocrisy in its stated attempts to deal with the international refugee crisis. Detaining asylum seekers on Pacific Islands was supposed to be a short-term fix. It was not a measured or considered policy, and now we are seeing its results. These results include political instability in Nauru and PNG, regional ill-will towards Australia, delays in visa processing, a lack of resettlement options for those assessed to be refugees and an absolute blow-out in the costs. It would have been more efficient, cheaper and more humane to have processed these asylum seekers in Australia. </para><para>The Oxfam report, in relation to children detained on Nauru and Manus Island, states:</para><quote><para>A particular concern is the status and welfare of these children, who don't have access to the kinds of educational and welfare facilities available to children in Australian detention centresâ</para></quote><para>which are of themselves inadequate. There are currently 157 minors on Nauru and 34 on Manus Islandâthat is 191 children in total. More children are held under the Pacific solution than in onshore immigration detention centres. These children have all been detained for between 12 and 14 months. During committee hearings, a DFAT representative admitted that Australia had not raised with Nauru or PNG the relevant international obligations such as the Convention on the Rights of the Child.</para><para>Mr John Hodges, the Chairman of the Immigration Detention Advisory Group, which reports to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, said:</para><quote><para>Nauru is by far the worst of the detention centres ...</para></quote><para>He admitted:</para><quote><para>... the facilities are just not as good as they are in Australia.</para></quote><para>I am concerned that the results of this legislation would be to detain more children in conditions that are worse than those in the mainland detention centres. There is less transparency and there are fewer procedures for determining the situation of children in these detention centres than there are on the mainland, and conditions for children in mainland centres are in themselves causing widespread concern. When questioned by the Senate Select Committee on a Certain Maritime Incident about educational facilities on Nauru and Manus Island, Mr Hodges mentioned only one detainee who spoke fairly good English and was teaching classes. Mr Hodges said:</para><quote><para>Education facilities I believe are lacking a little.</para></quote><para>Clearly, as Mr Hodges pointed out, there are difficulties in educating children in a detention centre environment, but this is not a reasonable excuse to ignore the question altogether. When asked by the committee whether there had been any sort of qualified assessment of the education needs of the camp populations, the head of the minister's immigration detention watchdog said that he did not know. Education is a basic right for children; it is so in Australian domestic law and in the Convention on the Rights of the Child.</para><para>The UNHCR also raised concerns about the nature of the visas that offshore entry persons are able to apply for. The granting of a temporary protection visa, they argue, should not be defined as resettlement, as it is not a durable solution for a refugee. TPV holders at the moment have no access to family reunion or travel papers and are given little support to settle into the community. This legislation has serious adverse implications for the rights of refugees to family reunion. Members of a family who arrive separately are assessed individually, which allows for family members to be taken separately to a declared country, even if a member of the family is residing in Australia on a TPV. As the UNHCR put it:</para><quote><para>This right includes maintaining family unity for members arriving in Australian territory together, as well as assuring family reunion for members arriving separately. When coupled with the use of Temporary Protection Visas by Australia, which do not provide for family reunion as a basic individual right, the impact of such State action may result in a breach of Australia's formal obligations under various human rights instruments, including the Convention on the Rights of the Child, as well as ignoring standards that Australia has helped to create and promote. </para></quote><para>Labor recognises that the current system of TPVs is not working. The lack of access to settlement services and family reunions creates an underclass of visa holders who have little means of building a life for themselves in Australia and are welfare dependent. Under Labor, the TPV will be of a shorter term, after which an asylum seeker's claim will be reassessed. If circumstances in their country have not changed, they will be granted a permanent protection visa with rights to family reunion. The change that will have the most significant impact on current TPV holders is that, under Labor, they will have access to settlement services, including English language training and the full range of Job Network services.</para><para>Despite its stated aim of deterrence and border control, this bill has clear potential for unintended consequences. Obviously, these had not been thought out in the implementation of the original raft of legislation, as can be seen by the subsequent return to Australia of refugees from Nauru and Manus Island, and clearly they have not been thought through here. A high proportion of those who try to come to Australia via people smugglers are women and children trying to join family members. I for one am not willing to risk more children being detained on Nauru or Manus Island for extended and indefinite periods of time.</para><para>This bill is a diversion. It is part of a strategy of focusing attention away from important questions and drawing the eyes of the nation, using the language of fear, to a phantom threat. I would like to quote from Minister Ruddock's second reading speech on this bill. He said:</para><quote><para>The choice for the opposition is now clear. They can either support strong and effective border controls or they can contribute to the weakening of Australia's borders and the perils arising from this action.</para></quote><para>What is this if it is not the language of fear? This legislation does nothing to strengthen Australia's borders. It is not effective border control. It is a line in the sand, and if we were under some kind of peril it would not be enough to protect us. The government seem to think that there are only two choices. They think that because they have not made the effort to consider other options and because they feel there is no political mandate in innovative solutions. All they can think of doing is adding an ineffectual extra to an already failing system. It does not convince me and it will not convince the Australian people either.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>7501</page.no><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name><name.id>8HC</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ON</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to place on the record the fact that One Nation will be supporting the <inline ref="R1578">Migration Legislation Amendment (Further Border Protection Measures) Bill 2002</inline>.

The government have increased the number of special compliance officers in key overseas posts. They will work with local police and immigration officials to clearly identify overseas nationals trying to enter Australia illegally. </para><para>The government have placed departmental officers in key overseas ports to assist overseas countries in training their staff to identify bogus documents. The Australian government have posted specialist liaison officers to key overseas posts for bilateral and multilateral liaison on readmission and resettlement. They have organised ongoing short-term visits to key countries by departmental document examiners to provide specialist training and technical support to overseas immigration services and to airlines and airline staff. They have maintained multifunction task forces both in Australia and overseas which coordinate investigations, collect intelligence and maintain close liaison with law enforcement agencies investigating immigration fraud. The government also frequently updates Australia's movement alert list, which is a key tool governing the entry of non-citizens who are of security and character concern.</para><para>Who has this message been sent to? It is very clear that the government has sent a message to two groups of people: firstly, it has sent a very clear message to the people who would wish to flout our immigration lawsâthe illegal entry people; and, secondly and more importantly, it has sent a message to the people smugglers and cut off the ability of these people to continue their business. If we look back to last year and the year before, there were times when we had anything up to 3,500 people illegally arriving on our shores. But the moment that the government brought in its first bill on border protection, that stopped overnight. If you are in the business of people-smuggling and all of a sudden you find that Australia is not a soft touch and you have accepted between $A6,000 to $A10,000 from a person to get them illegally into Australia, they are going to be most upset with you. If 3,000-odd people were to come from Indonesia, for example, that would be an injection of approximately $A18 million per month into the black market in that country. Therein lies some of the reluctance of overseas countries to stop this trafficking. The minister in his second reading speech said:</para><quote><para>On average, it costs the government $50,000 for every unauthorised arrival by boat from the time of arrival to the time of their departure from Australia.</para></quote><para>Do the arithmetic: if 3,000 people arrived in Australia in any one month it would cost us, the taxpayers, $150 million just to process them for that one month, and people talk about the costs of the Pacific solution! I think the Pacific solution is one of the most economical actions of the government, because it stopped absolutely overnight the proliferation of people entering this country.</para><para>When Senator Brown spoke before he made a comment about how this fits with our Christian ethos. It fits very comfortably. If you go to the <inline font-style="italic">Old Testament</inline>, there is a section that speaks about the entry into the walled city of Jerusalem. If you know a little history about that period, you will know the gates in that walled city were closed each evening. There were windows in the walls of the city so that people could have some access to fresh air where their homes were built into the walls. So our <inline font-style="italic">Old Testament</inline> clearly says: `He who enters the city through the gates enters that city and has passage. But he who enters by the window is despised.'</para><para>So our own Christian belief sets out very clearly that we accept the person who enters our country legallyâthat is, the person who fills out their application and has it assessed to see if they are a genuine refugee. But the person who comes as an illegal immigrant is the equivalent of the person in the dark, entering that city through a window, and they are to be despised because they are keeping out genuine people who have spent time going through all of the refugee centres, doing the right thing and making an application to come to Australia. They are the ones who are doing the correct thing; they are the ones who as a Christian nation we will open our arms to and accept if it is proven that they are genuine refugees. So there is no problem whatsoever in reconciling ourselves as a Christian society to rejecting those who wish to break the laws of this country and enter like thieves in the night. On top of that, they have the audacity to expect the Australian people to fund court challenges that will keep them here for three or four years. The government does have it right; it has done the right thing. </para><para>If you live in North Queensland and speak to the people who live on Cape Yorkâthey are predominantly pastoralists; lovely people who are doing it hardâon numerous occasions you would hear them voice concern about the vehicles that tend to go up the Cape empty and come back full. You do not have to think too hard to work out what is actually going on. We have even had instances in places like Dirranbandi, in the southern corner of the state, where people in vehicles have been apprehended. One lot were apprehended because the vehicle broke down; it was a group of illegal immigrants heading for Melbourne. If they had arrived in Melbourne they would have had a safe haven. We probably would not even have known they were in the country. Another group that called in at a service station to refuel their vehicle were apprehended when an astute attendant realised that, because of their language difficulties, they most certainly should not even have been driving the vehicle, let alone be in Australia.</para><para>So the government does have it right. The government is protecting the sovereignty of this nation in such a way that the people of Australia decide who will make up the matrix of our community in the future. If we had continued to allow thousands of people to illegally enter this country on a monthly basis, it would not be us as Australians controlling the development of our country but the illegal boat people and the smugglers who are sitting offshore, smugly putting their money in their hip pockets and, I might add, probably not contributing to their own country's economy.</para><para>If Labor's proposal were to be accepted, we would be opening the front door. We would be opening the gates to Jerusalem in the daytime for people to walk in. I do not believe that that is in the interests of the Australian people. People who arrive in Australia with the correct documentation have had that documentationâtheir entry visasâsubjected to scrutiny by our officials overseas. That is the correct way to enter this country. If you want to get the real story on people who enter this country illegally through our airports, stop and talk to a Qantas airline pilot or a crew member who has had to go through the degrading task of sifting through the refuse on an aircraft because someone who had identification papers at their overseas port of exit has cut that documentation up and flushed it down the toilet on the aircraft, arriving here with no ID so as to claim refugee status. If you talk to the airline people and ask them what they think of those sorts of people, you will get a totally different picture. </para><para>Yes, it is extremely concerning that children are held for a long period of time in detention centres in Australia. However, it is a conscious decision of the parents of those children to flout the laws of this country. They know what they are doing when they pay their $A6,000 to $A10,000 to the people smugglers. They know where they are going to end upâin a detention centre. They consciously made that decision before they left their country.</para><para>On the issue of forum shopping, have a look at Europe. The European Economic Union have passed legislation to ban forum shopping. I would like anyone in this chamber to tell me of any personâother than our close neighbours East Timor and West Papua who have no other option but to enter Australiaâwho has travelled to Australia as an illegal immigrant and not passed another safe haven before they entered our waters. I believe that the government, with this legislation and with its previous attempt at the regulation, has actually stopped forum shoppingâand that is exactly what should happen. Even the United Nations human rights commission does not support a refugee who passes a safe haven to continue on to a selected destination. </para><para>In conclusion, One Nation support the government's initiative to further extend the exclusion areas. We support their definition of an excised offshore place and we most certainly support the time frame from 2 p.m. on 19 June 2002 as the time when any person who enters these excised areas is unable to apply for a visa in Australia. One Nation commend the government for the bill and support the government's position. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>7504</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe <inline ref="R1578">Migration Legislation Amendment (Further Border Protection Measures) Bill 2002</inline> is very important for all Australians. The Australian public has a clear expectation that the Australian government should be strong on border protection, tough on people smugglers and act in accordance with the national interest. Those are the issues that underpin this bill. The bill expands the definition of an excised offshore place and sends a strong deterrent message to people smugglers. The bill ensures that persons who travel unlawfully to Australia and who enter Australia at an excised offshore place will not obtain a favourable migration outcome. </para></talk.start><para>The bill does not disadvantage Australians in any way, nor does it cause detriment to those people with lawful authority to be in Australia under the Migration Act. These people will be able to move about freely in any of the excised offshore places just as they would in any other part of Australia. These places remain integral parts of Australia. In fact, there has been much debate about this bill entailing the giving up of sovereignty, that we are giving up pieces of Australia. Nothing could be further from the truth. When similar provisions were before the parliament last year, the Labor opposition found no problem at all in excising Christmas Island and Cocos (Keeling) Islands. We are applying the same principle today, yet the opposition baulks at what we are suggesting. </para><para>It is worth while looking at those people who live in the areas which would be most affected. I went to the Torres Strait Islands in July this year, and the feedback I got was that the people there are in favour of this excision. We had a comment by Senator Scullion, who represents people who could be affected by this. He stood here in the Senate today as a representative of those people in the Northern Territory and said they were supportive of these excisions. We have just heard from Senator Harris, who represents the state of Queensland, that there is no opposition from people in Cape York. When you look at those Australians who live either in the areas we are talking about or in close proximity to those areas, you find no opposition to the government's proposal. They want the government to be strong on border protection.</para><para>This bill is an important part of the government's comprehensive strategy to combat people-smuggling. I remind senators opposite that people-smuggling is criminal. Earlier this year, the Australian and Indonesian governments cohosted a conference on people-smuggling in Bali. People from many countries attended that conference. I heard first-hand accounts of what people smugglers do. The head of Interpol indicated that people smugglers are often tied up with illicit dealing in guns, drugs and other contraband. It is also not uncommon to find them tied up in the sexual trade of women and children. People smugglers are not generous, altruistic people who are trying to help others find a better life. They are organised criminals who trade in human beings as they would in drugs or guns. We are providing a deterrent to these organised criminal syndicates.</para><para>We have even seen tragedy at the hands of such people smugglers. People who criticise this deterrent underestimate the evil trade of people smugglers. People smugglers do not care about their human cargo. As long as they have the money in their hands they do not care whether their customers reach their destination or not. That is the blunt truth. These provisions are part of a suite of provisions implemented by this government to deter people smugglers from their unlawful operations. There is a clear indication that this strategy is working. It has been about 12 monthsâI think it is in excess of 12 monthsâsince any substantive attempt has been made to enter Australian waters. The results of our strategy speak for themselves: people smugglers have been deterred from their illegal activities.</para><para>We cannot afford to be complacent. We cannot afford to sit back and say, `We've done enough.' Credible intelligence reports indicate that people smugglers are looking for ways and means to get their clients to other parts of Australia and to other destinations in the Pacific. This bill will not force asylum seekers onto the mainland, as the opposition and minor parties suggest. Rather, failing to pass this bill will give people smugglers the green light to continue their trade to either Australia or other destinations in the Pacific. This is totally unacceptable to the Australian government and, more importantly, to the people of Australia. </para><para>The government has carefully considered the report and recommendations of the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee. We note that only two of the recommendations relate to the bill itself, and the other recommendations concern elements of the Pacific strategy. The government does not accept recommendations 1 to 7. All of these involve issues which were before the Senate last year when the opposition supported the original excision bill. It is incomprehensible that the opposition is seeking to raise these objections now, when it had ample opportunity to do so when the legislation was passed last yearâwith its support.</para><para>In relation to recommendations 8 and 9, the government recognises the significant role that Indigenous communities already play. We will continue to ensure that Indigenous communities are involved in border protection as appropriate. I speak with first-hand knowledge of Indigenous communities that I have visited which have assisted Customs in looking out for Australia's borders. As the Minister for Justice and Customs, I have acknowledged the great assistance we have had from Indigenous communities in the north in that regard.</para><para>This bill is an integral and vital part of the government's legislative and administrative measures to combat people-smuggling and to protect Australia's borders. It is irresponsible not to support this bill. It shows a complete lack of regard for Australia's border security, deterring the illegal activities of criminals such as people smugglers and acting in the national interest. I commend this bill to the Senate.</para><para>Question put:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>21:33:00</time.stamp><para>The Senate divided.</para></division.header><para>(The Deputy PresidentâSenator J.J.

I am sure there is a great deal of interest in my speech from the government benches. I understood that is why we had such a good attendance. While Labor support these bills, we do so noting that there are many steps the government should have taken and still must take before medical indemnity in Australia is sustainable in the long term. In this light, Labor believe it is important to emphasise that medical indemnity is not just an issue for doctors but one that impacts directly on the availability and affordability of medical services for all Australians. Inadequate measures to address medical indemnity in the long term will result in a reduced availability of medical services and patients paying higher prices.</para></talk.start></continue><para>These bills represent the government's package of measures to address rising medical indemnity insurance premiums, announced on 23 October this year. The core plank of this package was the extension of a guarantee to United Medical Protection and Australasian Medical Insurance Ltd, UMP-AMIL, to 31 December 2003. On 23 October, the government also announced partial subsidies for insurance premiums for obstetricians, neurosurgeons and GPs performing procedures; a scheme to meet 50 per cent of the cost of claims payments greater than $2 million; funding of the incurred but unreported liabilities for medical defence organisations, or MDOs, that have not set aside money to cover their liabilities; and a levy to recoup the cost of the funding for unreported liabilities for members of the MDOs over an extended period. </para><para>The announcement of these measures followed the passage of the <inline ref="R1590">Medical Indemnity Agreement (Financial Assistanceâ Binding Commonwealth Obligations) Bill 2002</inline>. The purpose of that bill was to appropriate funds for payments in accordance with an indemnity agreement between the Commonwealth and UMP and its wholly owned subsidiary, AMIL, and to confirm the government's commitments relating to UMP-AMIL.</para><para>It is worth while to discuss in somewhat more detail the three main measures that these bills give effect to. The first measure is the unreported liability scheme. This will assist those medical defence organisations that had unfunded liabilities as at 30 June 2002 to pay the claims when they crystallise. In other words, the Commonwealth will help these MDOs to pay for claims which they have not made adequate provision for in the past. Part of this cost will be recouped by a levy payable by any person who on 30 June 2000 was a member of an MDO that was assessed as having unfunded, unreported liabilities at 30 June 2002. For practitioners who are liable to pay the levy, the levy will be set as a proportionâa maximum of 50 per centâof their medical indemnity premium paid for the 2000-01 financial year.</para><para>The second key measure that the package of bills gives effect to is the High Cost Claims Scheme. The High Cost Claims Scheme aims to lower premiums by reducing the potential cost of large claims to insurers. Under this scheme, the Commonwealth will meet 50 per cent of the cost of claims payments greater than $2 million. This scheme will apply to claims notified on or after 1 January 2003 but will not apply to claims relating to the provision of public hospital services.</para><para>The third main measure that this package of bills gives effect to is subsidies. A subsidy will be provided to obstetricians, neurosurgeons and procedural GPs who undertake Medicare billable procedures. It will be the equivalent of 50 per cent of the difference between the cost of their premiums plus the unfunded, unreported levy, and a corresponding cost for gynaecologists, general surgeons and non-procedural GPs respectively, in their relevant state or territory. In light of the particularly high premium costs faced by some neurosurgeons, the subsidy rate will increase to 80 per cent on the portion of their premium plus the levy, if applicable, that exceeds $50,000. </para><para>This package of bills provides for the implementation of these key measures of the government's package. Although positive and necessary measures, they are inadequate in the long term to address Australia's medical indemnity shortfalls. The bills provide an administrative framework for the policy response made by the government so far. For instance, the <inline ref="R1677">Medical Indemnity Bill 2002</inline> establishes a mechanism to determine which MDOs have incurred but unreported liabilities. So far as financial implications of the bills are concerned, the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook documents indicated that funding of $246.5 million over four years will be provided for the medical indemnity insurance assistance package. However, disappointingly, the MYEFO documents do not disclose the amount budgeted for the UMP-AMIL guarantee or the amount expected to be raised from the unreported liabilities levy to fund the guarantee.</para><para>As I have indicated, the opposition supports these measures. However, it is important to get on record again Labor's view that the government's handling of medical indemnity problems in Australia has been far from satisfactory. The government was slow in recognising that there was a problem at all, and it has not been prepared to make its eventual response comprehensive or far-reaching enough to address the range of medical indemnity problems that exist. It is also worth remembering that, whilst the crisis in medical indemnity insurance was publicly brought to a head by the financial difficulties experienced by UMP and by the appointment of a provisional liquidator, problems with medical indemnity insurance are not of recent origin. For example, as far back as 1991 the then Labor federal government established a review of professional indemnity arrangements for health care professionals. This review was chaired by Fiona Tito. It was responsible for examining the arrangements relating to professional indemnity and the experience with compensation for medical misadventure.</para><para>Fiona Tito's report was completed at the end of 1995. Amongst other things, that report identified the need to develop evidence based medicine and define best practice; called on health care institutions to develop a system for error identification and analysis to deal with errors in a positive manner; discussed the need to ensure that people with severe disabilities obtained early access to rehabilitation services; recommended the wider use of structured settlements; recommended that medical defence organisations, using common accounting and reporting standards, ensure that members and policyholders be able to assess their relative financial strength; and recommended the establishment of an MDO fund to cover the costs of claims incurred but not reported, which is of course one of the major problems that this bill attempts to deal with, albeit seven years after the Tito report identified it.</para><para>The Tito report was largely ignored by the Howard government. That is in contrast to the Labor Party, which in the run-up to the last federal election identified what areas of medical indemnity insurance remained neglected and in need of reform. Labor's medical indemnity reform package was accordingly announced in July 2001. It drew attention to the following requirements: the need to reduce the frequency of medical injuries by setting national benchmarks and guidelines and by promoting the use of information technologies to help doctors decide on the best treatment and avoid misdiagnosis or incorrect treatment, the need to promote structured settlements by changing the tax treatment of periodic payments to ensure injured patients have adequate regular payments to cover their health care costs for the rest of their lives and the need to establish a national database on health care litigation to target the problem areas and ensure that adequate support mechanisms are in place. </para><para>The Labor package responded to these health system needs in a range of specific, targeted ways. In particular, the ALP sought state and territory law reforms encompassing court procedures, calculation of damages and the regulation of medical indemnity organisations. Labor sought to tighten the prudential regulation of medical indemnity insurance, in order that all funds operate soundly and have transparent accounts; to require all doctors to hold the appropriate insurance for the work they undertake; to reduce red tape by harmonising requirements, from doctor registration to improving risk management by medical indemnity funds; and to refer the current problems with indemnity insurance for midwives to the then Senate inquiry into nursing, in order to develop options for keeping homebirth as an option for expectant mothers.</para><para>The Howard government has proved reluctant to address any of these problems with medical indemnity insurance, taking only preliminary steps after the last federal election. In December 2001, the Prime Minister announced a national medical indemnity insurance summit, which was ultimately convened in late April 2002. The summit's communique, which was issued following the summit, simply announced that work would begin on a range of issues that had been identified much earlier.</para><para>Problems surrounding medical indemnity insurance are complex and there is no single solution. As a consequence, action is required by all governments and change is required of medical defence organisations, the medical profession and lawyers. However, any comprehensive plan for solving the medical indemnity insurance problem must be coordinated at the Commonwealth level. Given this, the government's response to medical indemnity problems has been inadequate in the following ways.</para><para>Firstly, almost all of the efforts for reform have focused on tort law and not on the need to improve clinical outcomes and reduce clinical risk. Comparatively little attention has been given to reducing the number of adverse events through the encouragement of safer medical practice. Improvements in the quality and safety of medical care would lead to better health outcomes for patients and reduce the likelihood that doctors would be sued for inappropriate treatments. Whilst it is certainly the case that Australia performs well internationally, we can always do better. As a consequence, the Howard government should make the reduction of clinical risk a much greater priority.</para><para>Secondly, more work needs to be done to consider the viability of setting up a national scheme for the long-term care of the most catastrophically injured. Labor has consistently advocated that a special national scheme is necessary to address high-cost cases in which catastrophic injury has resulted from medical procedures. It is clearly the case, both anecdotally and statistically, that the majority of these cases involve brain and spinal injuries and obstetrics. Complex cases involving catastrophically injured people take years to resolve through the courts and waste millions of dollars in legal fees. These cases place a disproportionate burden on the cost of medical indemnity insurance. Putting in place a catastrophic injury scheme would be a significant contribution to stemming the exponential increase in premiums for the cost of medical indemnity insurance.</para><para>The Commonwealth also has a significant role to play in assisting medical defence organisations to secure reasonably priced reinsurance. Australia has a multiplicity of state based organisations that provide medical indemnity insurance. With a more united front, Australian MDOs would be much more likely to succeed in obtaining affordable reinsurance and helping to stop medical indemnity insurance costs from increasing exponentially. Changing the way in which medical indemnity insurance is regulated would also be a helpful advance. Medical indemnity insurance has historically been provided by MDOs that have offered doctors membership rather than insurance. It is important that the Commonwealth ensure that APRA has sufficient resources to fulfil this greater regulatory role. </para><para>The Commonwealth should also ensure the prevention of price exploitation resulting from premium increases, by way of an increased role for the ACCC. It is now well known that very many patients are being asked by their specialist to make large up-front payments before surgical procedures are carried out, with the explicit justification that these up-front fees are necessary to defray the increased costs of medical indemnity insurance. We have also seen, in more recent times, indications from the Australian Private Hospitals Association that, in the course of next year, up-front fees in the order of $150 will be imposed to cover the difficulties that Australian private hospitals now find in gaining medical indemnity insurance. </para><para>While it is expected that medical service providers will not be able to absorb the increased costs of medical indemnity insurance premiums and will pass those costs on to patients, Labor believes that consumers should not be required to pay amounts that bear no relation to the increased premium costs. The Howard government envisages the ACCC playing a role so far as monitoring the increase in medical indemnity insurance premiums is concerned. However, the ACCC should be tasked to ensure that, whatever changes occur, no unfair or unreasonable costs flow on to patients for the cost of their individual health care.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>7509</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>âOrder!

Some time agoâand months before the Prime Minister did itâSimon Crean and I visited drought affected communities in Bourke, Brewarrina and Condobolin to gain a first-hand appreciation of the drought's devastating impact on those regional communities. As a result of that visit, we renewed our call for the Howard government to speed up its assessment process for exceptional circumstances drought relief and get funding flowing to families in need. This call, and the call of farm families in drought affected Australia, at that time fell on deaf ears. It took the Howard government a full 64 days to assess the Bourke-Brewarrina exceptional circumstances applicationâ what an insult to those farmers who had to wait for the government to get its act together, and in this time had to feed their herds, feed their families, and field the inevitable calls from the local bank manager.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Labor and farming representatives have criticised the inability of the Howard government, and particularly the ministerâWarren Trussâto deal with this drought and deliver relief to farming families in a timely manner. But Labor have done much more than criticise. We have released a six-point plan to deal with the current crisis. I can advise the Senate that the government has, in the absence of its own policy, started to implement ours. The first point of our plan is the minimisation of red tape. Labor have proposed a target of a seven-day turnaround for the prima facie assessment of exceptional circumstances applications, and a 28-day turnaround for full exceptional circumstances assessments so that funds flow to farm families in need more quickly and provide certainty to farmers about the EC process. Unfortunately, the government has not set itself these targets. Who can blame it? Mr Truss has failed for two years to reform the exceptional circumstances process, so it would be an act of extreme political optimism to set fixed deadlines for this minister to conclude assessments. He is simply not up to the task.</para><para>The second point of our plan is the reform of the Farm Management Deposits scheme. Again, it is pleasing to note that the government has picked up our policy to allow farmers in exceptional circumstances declared areas to withdraw deposits within 12 months, without penalty, in this financial year. But this occurred only after it was revealed that the farm management deposit legislation is flawed, exposing farmers to unexpected and potentially crippling tax bills. Mr Truss has known since July last year of this legislative flaw. Rather than fix it in a timely fashion, Mr Truss allowed the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister to wander through speaking engagements, lunches and dinners spruiking this scheme and, in effect, selling farmers a giant tax problem when what they need is effective drought assistance. </para><para>The third point of our plan is the provision of help to farmers to protect core breeding stock through interest rate subsidies. Although the government has pinched our policy, unfortunately for drought affected farmers, the tight-fisted Treasurer will only allow a subsidy of either five percentage points or 50 per cent of the prevailing rateâwhichever is the lower. Compare this with Labor's policy. A full 100 per cent interest rate subsidy is what Labor proposed for those suffering the impact of this drought. Labor is also aware of the broader impacts of the drought beyond the broadacre farm gate. That is why we have proposed measures to address feed grain shortages and their concerns, including an immediate national audit to assess current and future national grain needs and supplies. This would enable intensive industries, such as the pork and poultry industries, to plan possible import needs to manage potential feed shortages in 2003.</para><para>Mr Truss has finally convened a feed grain meeting, but has taken no action to investigate the impact of import protocols for feed grain to ensure current quarantine standards can be protected without unnecessarily impeding imports. The minister's lack of action is risking the future of Australia's intensive industries and their hard-won export markets. It is a very important point. Industries such as our pork industry have been the recipients of millions of dollars in private and public investment and have worked extremely hard to earn international success.</para><para>The minister claims that a grain audit would expose commercial-in-confidence information. This argument was discredited by ABARE when they told me at a recent estimates hearing that they had been handling and collating this type of data since the 1940s, without any release of confidential information. It is not commercial-in-confidence information that is holding up the audit and risking the future of our intensive industries and the thousands of jobs they support; it is that Mr Truss lacks the will or the competence to take on vested interests and order an audit. Labor called for a grain audit by the end of the year, but I do not hold out much hope that the minister will realise his responsibilities in the near future.</para><para>Unlike Mr Truss, Labor wants the buck-passing and squabbling with the states to stop. A federal Labor government would work with the states to streamline the exceptional circumstances application process. Labor knows it can be done, because we have done it before. It must be remembered that when Simon Crean, as minister for primary industries, developed the national drought policy, seven of the states and territories were in conservative hands. But they signed up to the plan because it was the right policy for the nation, and Simon Crean negotiated in good faith. He did not do what Mr Truss has done, which is attempt to ram a package down the states' throats, only to sit back and blame them for choking on it. Additionally, Labor will use the COAG process to ensure a whole-of-government approach to drought policy. Finally, Labor proposes the coordination of existing rural and regional programs to assist communities to manage drought. Under this plan, regional programs would be adopted for drought affected communities and application processes would be fast tracked.</para><para>There is one area in which the government has taken a lead on drought assistance, and it might have made an excellent seventh point of our plan. Mr Howard's key policy initiative on drought has been the removal of Mr Truss from the policy process. Once removed, the minister has effectively been kept on the sidelines. Anyone who saw today's announcement by the Prime Minister, and the following question and answer session, can be in no doubt that Mr Truss is minister in name only. After the announcement, Mr Howard continually pulled Mr Anderson to the podium to answer questions, and kept the man theoretically responsible for the portfolio standing stoic and stony-faced in the background.</para><para>Some might object to the elimination, effectively, of a federal minister, but in this case it serves the national interest and Labor does not demur. With Mr Truss now safely on the sidelines, it is time for Mr Howard and Mr Anderson to do the right thing and implement the rest of Labor's drought policies. Government senators should not hesitate to wander over and collect a copy of Labor's six-point plan from me here in the chamber. But if you miss me tonight, give the Prime Minister's office a call and ask for it by name. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Telecommunications: Interception</title><page.no>7511</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>7511</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âEveryone accepts that government law enforcement agencies need powers to covertly intercept selected telecommunications. Effective attacks on crime and lawlessness require nothing less. Everyone also accepts that such powers are dangerous and intrusive and need to be properly controlled. The law was changed a few years back. Its most notable change was to give AAT members the power to issue warrants, and it is they who now issue the bulk of them. The consequence has been dramatic, with a tremendous growth in telecommunications interception in Australia. This must call into question the adequacy of the existing accountability regime to monitor and regulate. The question has always been as to whether potential abuse is minimised and whether controls are effective. As readers of previous speeches of mine on this topic would know, I have had my doubts on that score.</para></talk.start><para>Modern terrorist threats have raised the stakes. More intercepts will be the result. How do we balance national security with privacy and civil liberties? The issuing of warrants is governed by the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 as amended. Commonwealth and state ombudsmen monitor and oversee the use of telecommunications interception. Under the act, warrants can be obtained for two purposes. The first is for security and intelligence. The second is for law enforcement. The main area of libertarian concern to date has been with the latter due to the soaring number of telephone interceptions, which have increased exponentially. The number of warrants issued each year has increased nearly ninefold since 1988-89, the first year official statistics were published.</para><para>Where a law enforcement agency wishes to obtain an interception warrant, an application must be made to an eligible judge, a federal magistrate or a nominated member of the AAT. Interception warrants can only be issued in relation to the investigation of what are called class 1 or class 2 offences. Class 1 offences include murder, kidnapping, narcotics offences and terrorism offences. Class 2 offences include offences punishable by imprisonment for life or a period of at least seven years, where the offender's conduct involves serious personal injury, drug trafficking, serious fraud, bribery, corruption, serious arson or child pornography. An application by a law enforcement agency for an interception warrant must be accompanied by an affidavit containing prescribed information. There are also differences in the statutory prerequisites for issuing warrants for class 1 and class 2 offences. Thus, before issuing a warrant in the case of a class 2 offence, the judge, magistrate or AAT member must consider the gravity of the offence and how much the privacy of any person or persons would be interfered with as a result of the warrant application being granted. Further additional information must be supplied before a warrant can authorise entry onto premises.</para><para>In 2000-01, a total of 2,157 telecommunication interception warrants were issued to Australian state and federal law enforcement agencies. Compared to a number of 675 four years ago, this is more than a threefold increase. Federal and state law enforcement agencies have spent more than $17 million on interception activity in 2000-01. The most common categories of offences listed in telecommunications interception warrants are narcotics, drug trafficking, bribery or corruption, and murder. Telecommunications interception is seen as a vital weapon in the fight against crime. Is its greater use because criminals are increasingly using sophisticated telecommunications services or because getting interception warrants is so much easier? Are we reassured that, in the process, innocent persons are not accidentally or deliberately targeted for improper reasons and regardless of the immense intrusions into personal privacy? </para><para>The Australian Democrats believe there needs to be stronger external scrutiny of telephone tapping and covert surveillance activities by Australian law enforcement agencies. The body that oversees the function of inspecting the telecommunications interception records of the Australian Federal Police and the National Crime Authority is the Commonwealth Ombudsman. This is also the same for each state whereby the ombudsman for each jurisdiction oversees state police and law enforcement agencies. The technical and audit competency of the ombudsmen to perform these tasks is suspect.</para><para>In a media release on 15 September 2002, the shadow minister for justice and customs, Daryl Melham, said that the overseeing function performed by these bodies is questionable. The Commonwealth Ombudsman only employed two staff for an approximate time period of two months of the year to inspect the relevant AFP and NCA records. How do record inspections of warrants and their application process prevent abuse? Do the ombudsmen staff do random listen-ins and in-field checks themselves? Mr Melham mentioned that the two staff members were assigned to inspect records relating to 598 AFP warrants and 284 NCA warrants. Individual warrants are in force for an average of 72 and 42 days respectively and generate enormous volumes of information from a variety of intercepts and communications with a variety of people. It begs the question as to whether the level of external supervision for such intrusive surveillance activity is adequate. Statistically, on the grounds of human nature and probability, it is difficult to accept that no misdemeanours occur. If angels populated our police forces, we would not need periodic royal commissions into them.</para><para>Basic accountability and prudential considerations require the tremendous growth in telecommunications interception to be matched by an increase in audits and checks. There is an urgent need to strengthen the resources available for the external scrutiny of telephone interception activities and to provide more effective and proactive scrutiny beyond desktop review. One of the options is to take oversight away from the ombudsmen and give it to a dedicated office. Australia could consider an external oversight agency similar to the United Kingdom's Chief Surveillance Commissioner, which monitors all telephone interceptions, use of listening devices and other surveillance by law enforcement agencies.</para><para>The <inline ref="R1481">Telecommunications Interception Legislation Amendment Bill 2002</inline>, part of a package of counterterrorism legislation introduced by the Howard government on 12 March 2002, is now law. The provisions of the act broaden the purposes for which intercepted information can be used. They provide for, firstly, the addition of terrorist acts as offences that can be investigated by means of a warrant. The phrase `an act or acts of terrorism' is not defined in the bill. In the wrong minds, terrorist acts could simply end up being political activities that are disliked. They provide for, secondly, the inclusion of an existing state body, the ICAC, and a new state body, the Western Australian royal commission into police corruption, as bodies that can receive lawfully intercepted information from an intercepting agency when that information relates to their investigations. The purpose of those amendments was to ensure telecommunications interception was available as an investigative tool in relation to these offences. This is particularly seen as important in relation to conduct involving terrorist acts and child pornography offences, the latter because of offenders' increasing use of telecommunications services such as the Internet and email.</para><para>The Australian Democrats recognise the importance of telecommunication interception in helping combat crime and in assisting the fight against terrorism. But warrants and their use are open to abuse by any law officer or agency that lacks integrity. If we are increasing power and increasing the use of intercepts significantly, then we must put equivalent effort into protecting Australians from abuse. Our audits and checks must be beefed up. There is no sign of that happening. One of the definitions of `liberal' is favouring individual liberty. We must remind ourselves that this is a conservative government, not a liberal one. We need therefore to be on our guard. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Veterans Review Board: Annual Report</title><page.no>7513</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>7513</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name><name.id>2L6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise tonight to address the annual report of the Veterans Review Board. The tabling in the parliament of annual reports such as this and other papers is an important part of our democratic process, whereby accountability is guaranteedâthe assumption being, of course, that such reports are read and scrutinised. This we do in the Senate in the context of estimates hearings but, personally, I believe that we should more actively avail ourselves of the opportunity to comment within the Senate proper as well as acknowledge the matters being reported on in the various reports.</para></talk.start><para>The Veterans Review Board has a special place in veterans policy and legislation. While in its current form it has only existed since 1986, its antecedents go back much further as a specialised body of review with the express purpose of safeguarding the rights of veterans to compensation for their war-caused injury and illness and, in the case of war widows, ensuring fairness and justice for those who quite often are unable to represent themselves adequately. The VRB, as an independent body of review, has a special significance for veterans and in recent times, as the government has sought to introduce some rather misguided and ill-considered reform to our processes of administrative review across the board, the ex-service community have reacted sharply to any suggestion that their specialised tribunal might in some way be compromised. This is understandable, simply because veterans and war widows have long held a special place in our political system.</para><para>Within the law on veterans' entitlements there are also some unique characteristics which go to the benefit of the doubt. These are not well understood and are based on the respect and sympathy shown by a grateful nation for service rendered in times of war. For that reason, the VRB has a strong in-built commitment to ensuring that consideration of veterans' appeals is managed sympathetically, as the parliament and the Australian people intended, and with an actual understanding of service life, which is generally not available in other tribunals with a more legalistic approach to assessing fact and the requirements of the law.</para><para>In reading the VRB report for 2001-02, it is clear that these principles remain paramount but that, at the same time, serious endeavours are being made to ensure that service levels are improved and that maximum help is provided to veterans in having their cases heard expeditiously. Clearly, this is a huge problem for the board because, notwithstanding the desire to provide expedition and service, the difficulties seem to me to rest more with the veteran community, who, by nature, find dealing with the complexity of the law and government quite difficultâthis, of course, is perfectly understandable. Indeed, it is for this reason that administrative review is so important in a democracy such as ours. It is simply counterproductive to provide a system of care and support to people in need if the very process designed to help them makes it impossible to access it.</para><para>The veteran jurisdiction is a complex one, having grown over a period of 80 years with frequent legislative changeâoften ad hoc and driven by budgetary considerations or by politicsâproducing confusion and, quite often, plain contradiction and injustice. The basic point remains, however, that no matter how a review system such as that available under the VRB is constructed and managed the weak point is the capacity of the veteran or the widow to make their case and to have it argued before tribunals which necessarily must also perform effectively and efficiently.</para><para>There is a view that in theory the longstanding requirement is that veterans' claims for compensation should be investigated by the Department of Veterans' Affairs, with full consideration given to veterans' lack of access to records and lack of ability to come to grips with the complexity of the technicalities of the act and the associated procedures. That is to say that the department must take the veteran's claim, go beyond its actual contents and make an assessment on all the information available to it, substantiating and adding to the evidence submitted and then making a determination on the total merit. As all veterans say, however, this intention is fine but contradictory in that the department is so pressed by performance indicators and the savage reduction of resources over the period of the Howard government that this simply does not happen. In fact, the more hardened members of the ex-service community say that any departmental research undertaken invariably entails research for reasons to deny a claim rather than to accept it. </para><para>Whatever the circumstances, it is clear that the department cannot act for the interests of the claimant and adjudicate as well. Yet the dilemma then is this: how does the claimant make a full and well-supported claim? The answer to date has been to rely on the services of ex-service organisations such as the RSL, Legacy, the VVAA, the VVFA and many others whose voluntary and paid resources are stretched to the point where they simply cannot cope with the demand. The value of this effort is reflected by specific programs of supportânamely, the BEST Program, which provides quite inadequate resources to those bodies as well as training under the TIP program. However, this is only minor and is not sufficient to allow ex-service organisations to properly prepare cases under review.</para><para>As I have travelled around Australia over this year speaking to veterans and ex-service groups, this issue more than any other dominates the conversation. These organisations simply are not coping and, as a result, veterans are not being served. The sad fact of life in this jurisdiction is that appeals against a rejected decision are a given as the success rate of reviews and appeals is very high and so there is a direct incentive by example for veterans and war widows to exercise their rights. Unfortunately though, this attitude, and in fact the entire system, is geared to dealing with symptoms rather than the primary cause, whichâto put it bluntlyâis the poor quality of primary claims, unsatisfactorily prepared and with insufficient evidence in support.</para><para>As I have said, this is the nature of the jurisdiction and the lack of capacity of veterans to deal with the system, especially where the events prompting the claim could have happened half a century or more ago. To appeal a rejected claim is, therefore, standard practice and that is the advice given by all. The odds of succeeding eventually are just so good, and in most cases this is simply because new and better evidence is forthcoming as a result of more professional case investigation. The sad irony is that, in many cases, had this evidence been submitted in the first place the claims would not have been rejected.</para><para>The appeal process for veterans includes, however, much more than the VRB. It includes the AAT and eventually the Federal Court on matters of law. It goes without saying that this is extraordinarily expensive. One can only wonder what difference would be made if some of this cost were transferred to the front end to make sure that claims are better prepared in the first place. The logic simply cannot be faulted. Those costs are those of the VRB and the AAT, the time of the Federal Court and the costs of legal aid. This is on top of the costs of the department's internal review, advocacy function, freedom of information and the costs of others who get caught up in the paper dominated process flowing from the need to justify primary decisions and produce documentary evidence. The sad feature of this very litigious attitude to veterans' claims is that the VRB is often regarded as a stepping stone to the AAT, where legal aid is available free of any means test but where, fortunately, the skills of the legal profession are brought to bear more effectively than are those available from any other source earlier in the chain.</para><para>These matters go beyond the bounds of the VRB annual report, but they must be dealt with. The system is inefficient and does not serve veterans. The role of the VRB is diminished. Try as it might, it is but part of a system desperately in need of review. Such an opportunity does exist, and I make particular mention here of the work being done to develop a new, single military compensation scheme in which review should be a fundamental component but where I suspect the hard issues might be shirked.</para><para>This evening I do not intend speculating any further on that matter. Instead, on behalf of veterans, I simply make a plea that a hard look be given at this system, which can only be described as an expensive folly for not just its cost but also the inconvenience and frustration it causes. Put simply, the system can be managed much better. In saying that, though, I make it quite clear that I believe the fundamental status and make-up of the VRB must be preserved. It is a specialist body with a long history and experience most relevant to understanding the veteran jurisdiction in all its facets. It must remain independent. At the same time, it should not be hidebound by past practice and modus operandi. It should, for example, remain informal. </para><para>The other question which also must be addressed is the future of the VRB and, in the event of a new, single compensation scheme, what its role should be in an environment where it can be expected that most serving people in their career will obtain the equivalent of qualifying service. There is a need for a system of review which is common to all, rather than two separate systems. I look forward to joining that debate whenever the government's legislation emerges. I will stop my remarks here, but in so doing may I compliment the VRB on its efforts in the last year and on the quality of its report.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Roads: Albury-Wodonga Freeway</title><page.no>7515</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>7515</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThis evening I want to speak about a decision apparently made over the weekend, or late last week, by the government that it would effectively change its mind about the Albury-Wodonga freeway. I hope this is not the case, and I certainly will be pursuing it with the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. It was reported that at the weekend the government decided it was not sticking by its reversal about 12 months ago of a decision to take the freeway right through the middle of Albury. At that time the government took the option far preferred by the residents of Albury which was to put in its place an external freeway. There were many reasons why the community wanted to see an external freeway.</para></talk.start><para>In fact, the freeway was called a bypassâ a bypass which was not a bypass at all but went right through the centre of Albury, with all of the noise and all of the threats to health that are involved in living close to a freeway. Nonetheless, after a five-year debate which very much divided the community of Albury and represented a battle on the part of those people who did not want this freeway right through the centre of their town, the government saw the light and decided that it and New South Wales should fund the external bypass.</para><para>So it is a great surprise that the government should change its mind on this and opt again for the internal outcome. It is reasonable that we should ask why this is the case. Certainly the residents of Albury in poll after poll have said that their preferred position is the external bypass. Back in 1997, 61.3 per cent of voters rejected the Albury City Council's then preferred position of building the internal freeway first followed by the external bypass. The <inline font-style="italic">Border Mail</inline> conducted a survey in September 1998 showing that 75 per cent of respondents wanted an external bypass. Every poll and every survey that has been conducted since that time has shown the same kind of result. In fact, elections for the Albury City Council have often been fought on this subject of an internal or external bypass and councillors have been elected on the strength of their position one way or the other.</para><para>This decision makes no sense because, as I said earlier, it will simply divide this community and put in place a barrier which will be pretty much impenetrable. Albury currently suffers from thousands of trucks going through it. The emissions that they generate are already affecting the health of people who live there. Very few of those vehicles stop in Albury. The argument was that if Albury was bypassed then business would suffer as a result. Clearly, that is a nonsense. That is not the case in so many other towns on the Hume Highway, including places like Wangaratta and Benalla. Economically, those townships have never thrived more than they have since the freeway bypassed their town. Nobody wants the noise, the smell and the pollution that so much traffic brings. In fact, it is fair to say that the internal proposal was promoted by a very small sectoral interest within Albury-Wodongaâthose who saw a benefit to be had from a short transport routeâbut at the end of the day not too many other sections of the community were likely to benefit. </para><para>At the time of this debate about the right solution, the cost of the external freeway was talked about a lot. In fact, the government dismissed out of hand the external freeway on the basis of cost. That was said to be one of the original reasons for not proceeding down that path. But, as was demonstrated time and time again during estimates, a true comparison between the internal and the external freeway had not been done. All the costs of an internal freeway had not been taken into accountâfor instance, the enormous amount of acoustic treatment that will need to be introduced to protect residents and schools. A number of schools are on the route, and they would have to have enormous walls of acoustic panels, and that cost was not taken into account. The costs of overpasses, bridges and the like were conveniently ignored in most of the calculations that said that the internal freeway solution was the most cost effective.</para><para>It is a great pity if the government has been accurately reported as having changed its mind on this issue. It is a great pity for democracy. Twelve months ago I visited Albury to celebrate this win with the community, to celebrate that at last a sensible decision had been made by the federal and state governments. To have this decision overturned is a major disappointment. It demonstrates that, no matter what the local community says, no matter what percentage of the community comes out and says, `We don't want this,' it will not matter to the decision makers. They are more likely to be influenced by a very small group for whom there is a vested interest in an outcome one way or another.</para><para>Tonight I wish to complain bitterly about this decision, if it has indeed been made. I intend to follow it up with the minister, as I said. I intend to raise this matter at estimatesin February, when we get another chance to do so. I put on the record my great disappointment that it has come to this. On behalf of those residents of Albury whom I knowâ I have not had a chance to speak with them just yetâI believe they will be feeling very let down by this decision and very puzzled about why the original decision has been overturned at this very late stage. As I said, 12 months ago the government seemed to be seeing the light on this issue. They seemed to understand what the problems were with having a freeway right through the middle of town. They seemed to understand that this was not good for Albury, but for some reason they have changed their mind. This is a shock and a disappointment.

response to QON 490, part 2. Australia was the first country to propose that the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) adopt a Catch Documentation Scheme for toothfish and to propose a model for the Scheme. In later discussions by the Commission, the United States and the European Community also proposed alternative models. The Scheme that was finally adopted by CCAMLR drew heavily on the Australian proposal and also on the United States proposal.</para><para>(2)	Yes. A review of the Scheme is a standing agenda item at the CCAMLR annual meetings in October. Both Australian agencies and the CCAMLR have reviewed the operation of the Catch Documentation Scheme.</para><para>As a result of those assessments, each year since its introduction, the Commission has continued to refine the Catch Documentation Scheme to improve its operation and to counter activities of illegal fishers who seek fraudulent access to the Scheme.</para><para>(3)	(a) Uruguay, Russia, Belize, Bolivia, Seychelles. (b) Bolivia.</para><para>(4)	No. It is not feasible to compile a list of countries that have been the subject of Australian negotiating efforts concerning IUU fishing, given that negotiations have been undertaken at every opportunity formally and informally and at a bilateral and multilateral level. Further, negotiations have been undertaken by Ministers and Australian Government officials across a number of portfolios.</para><para>By way of recent example, Australia is a contracting party to both the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (the CCAMLR Convention). CCAMLR has 24 Members and seven additional States that have acceded to the Convention. There are also over 150 Parties to the CITES Convention. In the lead up to the recent CCAMLR meeting in Hobart in late October, I wrote to my Ministerial counterparts with responsibility for fisheries issues in those States which are also signatories to the CCAMLR Convention urging them to support efforts by Australia and other States to combat IUU fishing.</para><para>Similarly, my colleague, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator the Hon Sharman Stone, wrote to Ministers with responsibility for CCAMLR matters in countries which are also signatories to the CCAMLR Convention urging them to support Australia's efforts to combat the IUU fishing in the Southern Ocean. Australian officials also made numerous representations to officials in other CCAMLR countries seeking their support for the suite of measures Australia was proposing at CCAMLR XXI to combat IUU fishing.</para><para>In terms of Australia's proposal to nominate toothfish to Appendix II of CITES, formal discussions were undertaken earlier this month at the Conference of Parties (COP) in Santiago, Chile. In addition, in developing the CITES nomination for toothfish, Environment Australia wrote to all CITES States that are range States for Patagonian Toothfish and to all CCAMLR Members to seek comments on Australia's proposal.

(b) Coastwatch responded to 85 of these reports.</para><para>(3)	Two separate reports of alleged illegal fishing have been made since the beginning of 2002.</para><para>(4)	(a) In each instance verbal reports were made upon encountering these illegal vessels. The first was in regard to the encounter of the Russian-flagged Lena by the civil charter patrol vessel Southern Supporter in December 2001 (a hot pursuit of this vessel by the Southern Supporter was eventually broken off in January 2002). The second concerned the encounter and apprehension of the Lena and Volga by the Australian Navy vessel HMAS Canberra in February 2002. (b) In the case of the first encounter with the Lena, a verbal and written report was made by AFMA fisheries officers aboard the Southern Supporter to Coastwatch and AFMA. In the case of the second encounter with the Lena together with the Volga, reports were made by ADF officers aboard the HMAS Canberra back to the Australian Defence Headquarters (Canberra). (c) In addition to the initial recipients referred to in 4(b) above, reports were made to other relevant portfolios including the Departments of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Environment and Heritage, the Attorney General and Customs. (d) Russian. (e) Investigations were undertaken by fisheries officers after the vessels arrived in port in order to compile a brief of evidence for submission to the Director of Public Prosecutions office for adjudication on whether charges would be laid. (f) In February HMAS Canberra apprehended two foreign fishing vessels, the Russian flagged Lena and Volga, for operating inside the HIMI exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in breach of the Commonwealth Fisheries Management Act 1991. Upon arrival in port, the vessels, their catch and fishing gear were seized under the Fisheries Management Act 1991.</para><para>The master of the Lena and two senior officers pleaded guilty to all charges brought against them and were subsequently fined a total of AU$100,000. They have since returned to Spain. The vessel and fishing gear have been forfeited to the Commonwealth Government. The catch worth AU$1,127,183 was sold by tender and the funds remitted to consolidated revenue.</para><para>Charges against the master of the Volga have not proceeded due to his death by misadventure. Three senior officers from the Volga appeared in court on 18 November 2002. All three have entered pleas of not guilty. The matter has been referred to the District Court for a status conference on 5 February 2003. The vessel remains in custody in the port of Fremantle where the seizure of the vessel is subject to a separate legal challenge. The catch worth AU$1,932,579 was sold by tender and funds are currently being held in trust pending the outcome of legal action.</para><para>(5)	(a) <inline font-style="italic">Lena</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Volga</inline>. (b) Both vessels were detected fishing illegally within the Australian EEZ around HIMI. The Lena was intercepted inside the Australian EEZ around HIMI whereas the Volga was pursued from within the HIMI EEZ but physically intercepted, by the HMAS Canberra, just outside of the HIMI EEZ, attempting to flee apprehension. (c) The Australian Defence Force was responsible for the apprehension of both the Lena and Volga. AFMA officers were embarked to coordinate the gathering of evidence for the subsequent prosecutions. (d) The HMAS Canberra supported by the HMAS Westralia were used in the apprehensions. A Navy Seahawk helicopter was also used for boarding operations. (e) See answer to 4(f) above.</para><para>(6)	In the interim period between the hot pursuit of the Lena by the Southern Supporter and its apprehension by the HMAS Canberra, the Lena had attempted to conceal its identity by changing its name from Lena to Ana. The vessel's superstructure was also repainted from white to green and a false call sign was painted on the side of the vessel.</para><para>(7)	In December 2001-January 2002, the Lena was able to evade interception and investigation by not complying with the direction to port issued by fisheries officers on board the Southern Supporter. After an initial period of compliance with the direction given by a fisheries officer to the Master of the Lena to take his boat to Fremantle, the vessel then took evasive action, including entering the French territorial sea of Iles Kerguelen and clandestinely dumping significant quantities of catch overboard. </para></quote></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>New South Wales: South East Packaging Operation, Moruya</title><page.no>7523</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 857)</subtitle><id.no>857</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>7523</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'Brien</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 6 November 2002:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	What assessment was made by the Department of Transport and Regional Services of an application made through the Dairy Regional Assistance Programme (DRAP) to fund the South East Packaging Operation in Moruya, New South Wales.</para><para>(2)	(a) When was that assessment completed; and (b) what were the findings of that assessment.</para><para>(3)	(a) What assessments of the application were made by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry or any other federal or state agency; and (b) in each case: (i) who did the assessment; (ii) when did the assessment commence; (iii) when was the assessment completed; and (iv) what were the results of the assessment.</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>7523</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Macdonald</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Minister for Transport and Regional Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	The application was assessed against the Dairy RAP Guidelines.</para><para>(2)	(a) 17 September 2001.

It is not feasible to provide a full list; opportunities have been taken during bilateral visits, at international meetings, through correspondence, through diplomatic representations in Jakarta and other available avenues. Ministers and Australian government officials, across a number of portfolios, have also undertaken negotiations when opportunities arose. For example, in June 2002, Professor Djalal, Special Adviser to the Indonesian Minister for Marine Affairs and Fisheries, visited Australia to attend an APEC meeting in Canberra where officers of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry took the opportunity to speak with him about Indonesia's involvement in southern bluefin tuna. See also (3) below.</para><para>(2)	The management arrangements for southern bluefin tuna are established under the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT). One of the aims of the CCSBT is to ensure that all countries that fish for southern bluefin tuna join the CCSBT or cooperate with its management measures. The CCSBT recognises the importance of Indonesia participating in and cooperating with the CCSBT given that the southern bluefin tuna spawning grounds straddle the Indonesian Exclusive Economic Zone and the high seas. The CCSBT has, over several years, been encouraging Indonesia to join the CCSBT.</para><para>(3)	Since the eighth meeting of the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT) in October 2001, Australia has been acting on behalf of the CCSBT as the main point of contact regarding Indonesia's participation in the CCSBT.</para><para>During the bilateral meeting in February this year between Minister Dahuri, Indonesian Minister for Marine Affairs and myself, Indonesia's participation in the CCSBT was discussed.</para><para>Minster Dahuri advised that Indonesia was willing to join and co-operate with the CCSBT, however, there were difficulties with finding the necessary financial resources to pay for its membership contribution.</para><para>Since that meeting, Australian officials have met with Indonesian officials and with CCSBT members regarding Indonesia's participation.</para><para>In the lead up to the ninth meeting of the CCSBT, October 2002, I endorsed Australia's approach to the meeting which included pursuing ways to facilitate Indonesia's involvement.</para><para>At the ninth meeting of the CCSBT, Indonesia (who was participating as an observer) informed the Members of its aim to be a full Member in the future, and that it wished to join the CCSBT, in the first instance, as a âCooperating Non-Memberâ when this became possible.</para><para>Australia presented to the meeting a draft text of a resolution to establish a âCooperating Non-Memberâ status within the CCSBT. Significant progress was made in negotiating the text of the resolution and the text is expected to be agreed out-of-session. The next step is to negotiate with Indonesia on appropriate commitments as a âCooperating Non-Memberâ with the aim of settling arrangements prior to the tenth meeting of the CCSBT in October 2003.</para></quote></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Marine Affairs and Fisheries Working Group</title><page.no>7528</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 873)</subtitle><id.no>873</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>7528</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'Brien</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation, upon notice, on 7 November 2002:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	On what occasions has the Australian Indonesian Ministerial Forum Fisheries Working Group met and can details be provided of these meetings, including dates, locations and participants. </para><para>(2)	What is the role of the Working Group.</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>7529</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Macdonald</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows: </para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	The Marine Affairs and Fisheries Working Group, under the auspices of the Australia-Indonesia Ministerial Forum (AIMF), was established by Ministerial agreement in 2001.
