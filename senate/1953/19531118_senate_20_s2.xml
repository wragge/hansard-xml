          <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">by leave</inline> - Honorable senators will have heard with deep regret of the death of a member of this Parliament, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas</inline> John Treloar, who died at Tamworth on Sunday last. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Treloar</inline> was elected to the House of Representatives for the division of Gwydir, New South Wales, at the general elections in 1949 and 1951. He had been in ill health for some time and was on sick leave at <inline font-style="italic">the time</inline> of his death. He served in two world wars. In World War I., <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Treloar</inline> served with the 18th Battalion at Gallipoli and in Prance and, as a result of wounds, suffered the partial loss of his eyesight. In World War II., he enlisted in the Royal Australian Air Force in 1942, and served with the Air Training Corps. He was discharged in 1.940 with the rank of pilot officer, acting squadron leader. One of his sons was killed in action whilst on service with the Royal  Australian Air Force in Europe in 1944. </para>

          <para>. - On behalf of the members of the Australian Labour party in this chamber I second the motion. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas</inline> John Treloar had a very fine record of community service in Australia, in peace and in war. For that reason, and because of his high personal qualities, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Treloar</inline> was deservedly respected and admired in this Parliament. We of the Opposition extend to our colleagues of the Australian Country party our deepest sympathy in the loss that they have sustained by his death. We extend also to the sorrowing members of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Treloar&#39;s  family our very sincere condolences in their great loss and we trust that they will be consoled by the reflection that he has passed on to a happier existence. </para>

          <para>. - On behalf of the Australian Country party, I support the  motion before the Senate. The late Thomas John Treloar served his country with distinction both on and off the battlefield. As a result of his service in World War I., his eyesight became seriously impaired. That disability, however, could not daunt a man of John Treloar&#39;s indomitable spirit. On his return from active service, he identified himself with all movements having for their object the amelioration of the lot of his war-time comrades. He was foundation secretary of the Tamworth sub-branch of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen&#39;s Imperial League of Australia and later was appointed  president  of that sub-branch. He was also a northern State councillor and country vice-president of the New South  Wales  branch of the league. After serving in the Royal Australian Air Force in World War II., <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Treloar</inline> was appointed  chairman  of the Tamworth Repatriation Committee and he performed much valuable service in that capacity. In addition, he was a member of Tamworth Legacy. Up to the time that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Treloar</inline> was forced to leave the parliamentary scene through ill health, he was indefatigable in his efforts on behalf of his less fortunate war comrades and he has left an imperishable name among ex-service men and women in his district. On behalf of the Australian Country party, I express profound sympathy to his widow and family and join in supporting the motion. </para>
