                        <para>- Will the Minister representing the Minister for Health consider making some provision in the national health scheme for persons who, through no fault of their own, are not acceptable to an insurance scheme and are not in receipt of a pension but who are badly in need of hospital treatment which they cannot obtain because they have not the money to pay for it? Is the Minister aware that such cases do exist and that some doctors have refused to put patients in hospital for treatment because they know that they have not the money to pay for it ? I assure the Minister that such is the case. Is the Minister aware that in such cases some doctors advise patients to go voluntarily into a mental asylum where they can obtain free treatment although they are quite sane and mentally fit, but physically ill ? Does the Minister consider that such treatment of the sick is in the best interests of humanity? </para>

                        <para>I would like to point out to the honorable senator that the provision of blood transfusion services is closely allied to hospital treatment, which comes within the sphere of State responsibility. 'Nevertheless the Commonwealth is providing substantial assistance to the Australian Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service. The Commonwealth Serum Laboratories are processing blood into serum free of charge. Further assistance has been guaranteed when the blood fractionation plant is installed at the Commonwealth Scrum Laboratories. In response to representations from the National Head-quarters of the Australian Rod Cross Society the Prime Minister recently advised the State Premiers that the Commonwealth is prepared to provide Â£SO,D00 on a <inline font-style="italic">per capita,</inline> basis as a measure of temporary assistance. This represents more than half the additional amount required to maintain the Blood Transfusion Service at the slime level as last year. The majority of States have not yet replied to the Prime Minister's proposal so that the Commonwealth is not in a position to reach finality on this matter. You  will appreciate that the . question of financial assistance of this nature is closely tied up with the future of uniform taxation. The final outcome of financial assistance to the Bed Cross Blood Transfusion Service will therefore not be known until after the Premiers conference, </para>

                        <para>- I direct to the Minister representing the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture a question which refers to the gratifying fact that this Government saw fit, during the recent recess, to make available to the berry fruit-growers of Tasmania a grant of Â£100,000 for assistance in marketing their fruit. There are two aspects of that matter on which I should like some information. The first is, on whose responsibility was it decided that that money should be distributed by way of compensation for loss rather than as assistance to market the fruit as a commercial commodity? Secondly, remembering that the distress was caused by a failure to project marketing conditions sufficiently in advance for the benefit of growers, will the Minister- take early steps to convene a conference so that growers may be advised of the prospects of marketing conditions before they go to the expense of manuring and cultivating their .crops? </para>

                            <para>- I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for- Commerce and Agriculture. Has it been officially stated that the cos; of producing raspberries, black currants and other small berry fruits in Tasmania is lOd. per lb. ? Is the price for the sale of berry fruits fixed at 7d. per lb. ? Is the Government crying out for more production? Is the Minister aware that many tons of small berry fruits cannot be sold and are rotting in Tasmanian fields? 1.9 it a fact that high cost of production of primary products is preventing the sale nf goods? Is the Minister aware that the cost of a lj lb. -tin of raspberry jam is approximately 3s. 3Â£d. and that it contains only about 4d. worth of raspberries? Therefore, is it true that if the farmers gave the fruit free to the manufacturers such a tin of jam would be reduced in price by only 4d., making the retail price only 2s. llÂ£d. ? Is it a fact that the price of sugar has been increased and that incidentally the sugar companies' profits hare been increased and that the manufacturers, the wholesalers and the retailers are receiving increased margins of profit, while the farmers are on the verge of bankruptcy? Will tie Minister take the necessary action', to find  a market for the small berry fruits and arrange that the farmers be paid a price for their fruit that willcover the cost of production plus a margin to compensate them for interest redemption and their own labour and, in addition, provide compensation at the market price for the fruit that is now rotting? </para>

                            <para>- Will the Minister representing the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture inform the Senate whether that Minister or his officers received a letter dated 17th July, 1952, from the council clerk, New Norfolk, pointing out that the farmers, in particular small berry fruit-growers, were making a drive for increased production and that his council wished to learn the true position regarding markets for the new season's crops? If the Minister or his officers did receive the letter why was a reply not sent ? I am informed thatno reply was received by the clerk up till November. Is the Minister aware that because they did not receive the information requested, farmers have lost considerable money, fertilizer, time and work in increasing production and that now, since there is no market, the fruit is rotting? In order to prevent a similar occurrence and to safeguard farmers and enable them to plan ahead will the Minister inform the Senate what markets are available and provide an estimate of the quantity of small berry fruit that will be required for the next three seasons? </para>

                            <para>- I am sure that the honorable senator would not expect me to know offhand whether the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture has received the letter to which he referred. Matters relating to fruit production are solely a State responsibility. As a result of a deputation led by Senator Wright, and having regard to the seriousness of the situation, the Australian Government made a magnificent gesture in making certain money available to the Government of Tasmania. I suggest that instead of trying to make propaganda here the honorable senator should refer his question to the Premier of Tasmania. </para>

Will the Minister request the Prime Minister to bring this matter before the conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers this week and request the State Premiers to pass suitable legislation in each State so that the Australian public may buy with full knowledge of the quality and standard of the goods that they are purchasing? </para>

                        <para>- I understand that the position is as it has been indicated by the honorable senator and that the authority of the Australian Government, so far as the standard of quality of goods is concerned, is restricted to the control of export commodities. I believe that control of the standard of quality for the sale and consumption of locally produced commodities and foodstuffs within Australia is exclusively under the control of the States. I am not familiar with the extent of the supervision that is imposed by the States, but I believe that they are interested in policing food standards only from the point of view of the health of the community. So far as I am aware, no provision is made to ensure that a standard of quality is maintained in articles that are produced in Australia for sale. I agree entirely with the suggestion of the honorable senator that the matter should be placed before the representatives of the various States with a view to the introduction of uniform legislation to provide that, as far as is practicable, the consuming and buying public will be protected by the preservation of a standard of quality of goods. I shall bring the matter before the Prime Minister, as the honorable senator has requested. </para>

                        <para>- I address my question to the Minister for Trade and Customs as the Minister representing the Prime Minister. How does the Prime Minister reconcile his statement that Australian living standards have improved with thestatement which he adduced in support of that contention, that savings bank deposits have increased by nearly Â£200,000,000? The Prime Minister has often told the wage-earner that what counts is not the money wage, but what it will buy. During the last three years, prices of commodities included in the " C " series index have increased by 52 per cent. In December, 1949, savings bank deposits totalled Â£732,000,000. In order to represent the same purchasing power three years later, such deposits should have been 52 per cent. higher, or a total of Â£1,112,000,000, but, in fact, at December, 1952, those deposits totalled only Â£918,000,000. Further, as Australia's population has increased by 8 per cent. during that period, the value of the people's deposits in savings banks is now 17 per cent. less than it was when the Menzies Government assumed office. </para>

                        <para>- I address my question to the Minister representing the Minister for External Affairs. By way of preface 1 point out that last year the Senate ratified the Anzus pact. At that time, it was suggested that the pact would ensure the safety of Australia. On that occasion, I pointed out that there was grave clanger that Australia  might  become involved in. a war to the north of this continent which would literally eai up our military man-power. Events that, have occurred since then have justified my comment. I should like to know whether American policy regarding Formosa has been altered and whether such action has been taken unilaterally or in consultation with Australia as the ally of the United States of America under the Anzus pact. A$ a result of current events in Formosa. - although, seemingly, democratic pressure in the United States of America has produced changes in that country's outlook as n result of what is stated to be taking place in Formosa - there may be an attack by China, or Russia, upon American forces which, in turn, would involve Australia in a war with those countries. In view of that fact, has Australia been consulted with respect to this change in American policy regarding Formosa? If not, has the Government made representations to ensure that in future Australia shall be consulted before any further change is made in American policy in relation to this sphere? </para>

Will the Minister, in order to relieve the hardships and sufferings of unemployed workers by enabling them to return to industry, commence negotiations with the Chinese Government with a view to trading with that Government and issuing export licences to manufacturers who have goods to sell ? </para>

                        <para>- I am afraid that' the opening remarks of the honorable senator were not calculated to do any good. If he continues to harp on the subject of unemployment he will probably do a considerable amount to bring about an undesirable state of affairs. The honorable senator may have seen reported recently the result of an American survey in which it was pointed out that the Australian economy was never in such a sound and prosperous condition as it is at the present time. That condition has been brought about by wise administration, the co-operation of the people of Australia, and the imposition of some very unpleasant but necessary restrictions. However, they have arrested the inflationary spiral, consolidated the economy, and assured permanent and profitable employment for our people. . As far as trade with China is concerned the Australian Government and the Government of the United States of America acknowledge the Chinese Government with its head-quarters in Formosa. So far as the other <inline font-style="italic">de facto</inline> government is concerned, I am quite sure that the Australian Government and the Australian people would much prefer to trade with China than to fight against China, but unfortunately there is unmistakable evidence of very violent Chinese aggression on a large scale in Korea. If that unfortunate state of affairs were cleaned up and that part of the world restored to a state of peace and understanding I am quite sure that it would add to the happiness of all concerned. </para>

That report indicated that there were 115,000 fewer persons in private employment in Australia then than there were twelve months ago. During the three years preceding 1951 there was an average increase of 85,000 persons in private employment in this country. </para>

                    <para class="block">This bill amends the Patents, Trade Marks, Designs and Copyright (War Powers) Act 1939-1946. Although that act was designed to deal primarily with problems occasioned by the war, neither it nor this bill depends for its validity in any way upon the defence power. They are an exercise by this Parliament of the power vested in it to make laws in respect of industrial property. The principal act, in addition to- those provisions rendered necessary by the war, has one section which has no relation to the existence of a state of war and properly belongs to permanent industrial property legislation. This is section 15, which makes effective existing international arrangements concerning patents, trade marks and designs. It was included in the act of 1939 pending the revision of the whole of our industrial property legislation. That revision is at present proceeding, and as honorable senators may recall, has in part been completed. </para>
                    <para>Last year we passed a comprehensive Patents Act which incorporates provisions corresponding to section 15. However, that act cannot be brought into operation for some time, and the revision of the law relating to trade marks and designs has not yet been completed. Therefore, it will readily be seen that the continued operation of section 15 of the 1939 act is necessary. The period of operation of the principal act, however, is limited. Under section 17, it expires six months after the issue of a proclamation under the Trading with the Enemy Act that war no longer exists. This proclamation was published in the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Gazette</inline> of the 2nd October, 1952, and consequently the Patents, Trade Marks, Designs and Copyright (War Powers) Act will expire at midnight on the 1st April, 1953. </para>
                    <para>I shall state briefly the purposes of the present bill. In the first place, it extends the operation of the provisions of section 15 from the 2nd April, 1953, until a date to be fixed by proclamation. In the second place, it amends section 15 by altering certain references in that section to United Kingdom legislation. This amendment is rendered necessary because some of the acts to which the existing section refers have been superseded, since the 1st January, 1950, by new legislation in the United Kingdom. Consequently retrospective operation has been given to the amendment. Thirdly, the bill continues the operation of section 9, it being one of the temporary provisions of the act. It is  a  section which confers on specified authorities, where by reason of circumstances arising from the existence of a state of war it appears necessary or expedient so to do, the power to extend the time fixed by or under the Patents Act, the Trade Marks Act, the Designs Act, or the Copyright Act for the doing of any act. Owing to circumstances directly attributable to the war many acts required to be performed administratively and to a lesser extent by applicants under the industrial property legislation within  a  prescribed time are incapable of performance within that time. It becomes necessary therefore to confer on the appropriate authorities power to extend times in proper cases. </para>
                    <para>The existing act contains no provision for protecting people prejudicially affected by the exercise of the power given under section 9. Clause 5 of the bill effects an amendment which will enable provision to be made by regulation for the protection of persons who may be prejudicially affected by the exercise of this power. As the occasions for the exercise of the power given by section 9 will progressively diminish and the provisions of section 15 will ultimately be incorporated in permanent industrial property legislation, clause 8 of the bill makes provision to enable the operation of the act to be terminated by proclamation. I commend the bill to the senate. </para>

All other proposed amendments contained in this bill are designed to bring the principal act up to date and make its provisions uniform with more recent legislation.

                    <para class="block">The main purpose of this bill is to amend the procedure for determining the terms and conditions of employment of the staff of the Australian Wine Board. The Wine Overseas Marketing Act provides that the salaries and conditions of employment of persons employed by the board shall be as prescribed by regulation. This provision makes it necessary to go through the procedure of promulgating regulations to cover all variations of salaries and allowances and any proposed variations, such as cost-of-living adjustments, cannot operate until the necessary regulations are promulgated. Under the existing act, regulations prescribing rates of remuneration and conditions of employment of staff can validly have retrospective effect only when such rates are increased or the conditions bettered. If, at some future time, it should become necessary to make variations to cover a downward movement in salaries and allowances, some method of adjustment other than by regulation would appear necessary. Furthermore, superannuation adjustments cannot be effected until the necessary regulations have been promulgated. </para>
                    <para>Some statutory authorities which have been constituted under acts passed since  1945,  operate under arrangements whereby the terms and conditions of employment of their staffs are determined by the respective authorities, subject to approval by the Public Service Board. No regulations are required. By this means variations may be made effective without delay and this arrangement has operated satisfactorily. The amendment of the act now proposed is in accordance with the policy adopted by this and previous governments, that variations in salaries and terms of employment of employees of statutory authorities should be approved by the Public Service Board. </para>
                    <para>The principal act provides that fees and expenses payable to members of the Australian Wine Board and the terms and conditions applicable to overseas representatives shall be prescribed by regulation. An opportunity has been taken in the present bill to dispense with the necessity for promulgating regulations to cover all variations in fees and allowances payable to board members or overseas representatives. </para>
                    <para>All other proposed amendments contained in this bill are designed to bring the principal act up to date and make its provisions uniform with more recent legislation. It is the Government's policy to have the provisions of Commonwealth marketing legislation uniform to the fullest extent possible. The amendments do not alter the substance of the provisions of the principal act. I commend the bill to the consideration of honorable senators. </para>

                    <para>During the last parliamentary session of  1951  the Commonwealth Employees' Compensation Act was amended. That act, as its title indicates, covers employees of the Commonwealth Government. Other workers are dealt with, for compensation purposes, by the various State workmen's compensation acts or territory ordinances, but seamen engaged in interstate trade and commerce are outside the scope of the workmen's compensation laws of the various States. To cover these workers, the Commonwealth passed the Seamen's Compensation Act in  1911.  It was amended in  1938, 1947  and again in  1949,  and it is the view of the Government that it should be amended from time to time to ensure that it is not inferior to other similar laws. </para>
                    <para>Since the act was amended in  1949,  all States have increased the monetary benefits under their acts, and as I have stated, the Commonwealth Employees' Compensation Act was amended in  1951  to introduce the improvements made by the State laws. In accordance  with past practice it has been decided to bring this act into line with the Commonwealth Employees' Compensation Act. Honorable senators will, of course, appreciate that it is not possible to make the two acts identical in terms, but by the bill now introduced, the benefits available to seamen and their dependants will be brought to the same scale as those provided in the Commonwealth Employees' Compensation Act. In matters of administration and of detail there is necessarily some difference between the two acts which must be provided for, and some drafting improvements have also been made. </para>
                    <para>I shall set out briefly the more important changes that are contemplated, and which follow the Commonwealth Employees' Compensation Act. The amount at present payable on death of a seaman, namely <inline font-style="italic">Â£1,000,</inline> will be increased to Â£1,500, and the additional provision for each dependent child will he increased from Â£50 to Â£75. For incapacity, the existing provision of Â£4 a week will be increased to Â£6 a week. </para>
                    <para>In respect of minors, the increase is to be from Â£3 a. week to Â£4 10s. a week. The provision for a wife or female dependant will be increased from Â£1 5s. a week to Â£1 15s. a week, and that for each independent child under the age of sixteen years, from 10s. a week to 15s. a week. A requirement of the present act is dependency at the date of the injury, and there is a further qualification that the person shall remain so dependent. The bill provides in respect of a wife or child of a totally incapacitated seaman that the allowances shall be extended to a wife who becomes dependent upon the seaman after the date of his injury, provided that she was married to him when he was injured, and to any dependent child who is born after that date, provided that the child is not of a marriage contracted after the date of his injury. </para>
                    <para>The present maximum of Â£1,250 for certain specified injuries, such as loss of sight or both limbs, will be raised to Â£1,750, with proportionate increases of other amounts shown in the Third Schedule to the act. The maximum sum to which weekly payments of  compensa-  tion may accrue will be increased from Â£1,250 to Â£1,750. The act already provides for unlimited liability in a case of total and permanent incapacity. </para>
                    <para>The maximum payment under the act for funeral expenses is Â£25, which is payable only where there are no dependants of the deceased seaman. Tha bill increases that amount to Â£50 and provides for payment regardless of whether or not there are dependants. The maximum amount payable in respect of medical expenses is to be raised from Â£100 to Â£150, and the Minister will retain his power to increase this amount in special cases. The act provides foi compensation in the event of injury sustained by a seaman while travelling to or from his place of employment, and also when travelling to a mercantile marino office. Following on the lines of the Commonwealth Employees' Compensation Act, the bill will restrict the compensation cover to journeys incidental to the employment itself by providing that the travel be to or from his employment, and when to or from a mercantile marine  office  be for reasons connected with his employment. The act protects the right of a seaman or his dependants where there is legal liability of a stranger for damages in respect of the accident. If the seaman receives both compensation under the act and damages from a stranger, the compensation, up to the amount of the damages, has to be repaid to the employer. The bill provides that the amount recoverable by the employer shall include the medical and hospital expenses paid by the employer. </para>
                    <para>A further proposal, that is peculiar to the Seamen's Compensation Act, relates to the amount that may be added to the weekly payments of compensation on account of the value of board and lodging in respect of a seaman. The act provides for an amount within the limit of 30s. a week. This limit is to be increased to 45s. a week. </para>
                    <para>Apart from the last-mentioned amendment, it can be accepted, as I have already mentioned, that the present bill will merely have the effect of bringing the provisions of the Seamen's Compensation Act into line with those of the Commonwealth </para>
                    <para class="block">Employees' Compensation Act, which was amended in 1951, so that the resultant amounts under that act will be generally comparable with State benefits. </para>
