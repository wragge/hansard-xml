Chamberlain which took place in his home State, Tasmania, on the 16th January last. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chamberlain</inline> had a parliamentary career extending over a period of approximately twenty years.  In  1934 he was elected to the House of Assembly in the Tasmanian Parliament for the Division of Darwin, and was the representative of that division until 1950. In that house be was a member of the Standing Committee  on Public Works, becoming the  chairman  of the committee in 1948. He was  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition from November, 1949, to June, 1950. He resigned from the State Parliament in 1951 to contest the federal election in that year. He was elected to the Senate in 1951 for the State of Tasmania. </para>

                    served in the Australian Imperial Force in the first world war, and was wounded in action. He was an active member of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, and held several executive positions in both local and State organizations.' He was a member of the State executive of the league for more than twenty years. Such was the public life  of our departed friend. It is a record of faithful service to his country in war and in peace. But we, who knew him, even if only a little while, will remember him for his sterling personal qualities, his courtesy and his  unsimulated  friendliness, which endeared him to all who knew him. Whenever he spoke in this chamber, he received respect and attention. He spoke with courtesy and restraint and with impressive earnestness and conviction. The Senate is much the poorer for his passing. When my wife and I were in Tasmania recently, we took the somewhat  melancholy  occasion to call upon

I agree with the honorable senator that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chamberlain</inline> had a fine record of unselfish and efficient public service. Although he was a member of the Senate for only a relatively .brief period, his very lovable personality made a marked impact upon, every honorable senator. He approached all political issues quite objectively. It is true that there was no rancour in his make-up with regard to those issues or any other matters that Were discussed in this chamber. The golden thread of loyalty ran through the whole -career of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chamberlain</inline> - loyalty to his family, to his constituents, to his party and to the various bodies with which ,he was associated. As the Minister for Trade and Customs has stated, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chamberlain</inline> also proved clearly his loyalty to his country. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chamberlain</inline> was known to all honorable senators as a kindly and truly charitable man. ' When I use the word " charitable " I recall the definition of charity that was given by .Saint Paul on one occasion. I thought of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chamberlain</inline> when I read recently this paraphrased version of Saint Paul's words as recorded in his Epistle to the Corinthians - </para>

Although <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> Chamberlain  had been a member of this chamber for barely two years he brought to it a wealth of parliamentary experience, as for seventeen years he had been a member of the House of Assembly in Tasmania. When he was elected to the Senate it soon became evident that he was thoroughly conversant with the conditions and needs of his own State. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chamberlain</inline> served in the 1914-18 war -and he always took a keen interest in the welfare of ex-service men  and women. As Minister' for Repatriation I have had an opportunity to appreciate the valuable work he performed on behalf of the less fortunate " digger ". For over twenty years he was a member of the State executive of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial' League of Australia, in Tasmania. His death will be a great loss to  his " digger " comrades. "We extend our deepest sympathy to his widow and f amily in their bereavement. </para>

By his death the people of the north-west coast, of Tasmania have lost one of the best friends that they ever had in political life. Regardless of polities, or creed, ho was always ready to do a good turn for anybody who sought his aid.

                    <para>- I associate myself with the sentiments that have been expressed by those who have already spoken to this motion. The death of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chamberlain</inline> has brought to a close a very long and honorable career of public service. All of us have lost a valuable and highly respected parliamentary colleague. I have lost a great personal friend. Jack Chamberlain was a man of the people. He was a man of great warmth with deep perception and understanding of humanity.  His  was, indeed, a great Christian character without a trace of bitterness. He loved his fellow men and his fellow men regarded him with the warmest affection. He was a man of high ideals and was prepared to fight for whatever he thought was in the best interests of his country. He gave of his best unselfishly to the people in all that he did. No question was too large or too small to engage his attention. He devoted the whole of his time to the interests of the people whom he was privileged to represent. It can be truly said that Jack Chamberlain served his country well not only on the field of battle but also in the legislative halls of this country and in scores of community activities. We mourn the loss of a true and trusted friend who will be sadly missed. To <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Chamberlain</inline> and members of his family I express my heartfelt sympathy. I trust that the Almighty may assuage their grief, that He may give them strength and courage to. carry their sore burden, and will comfort them in their hour of sorrow. </para>

H. Scullin, who died in Melbourne on the 29th of January last. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scullin</inline> was first elected to the House of Representatives for the Electoral Division of Corangamite, Victoria, in 1910 and represented that Division until  1913.  He was again elected to the House of Representatives in 1922 for the Division of Yarra, which he continued to serve until his resignation in 1949. He was Leader of the Labour party from 1928 to 1935, and Leader of the Opposition in 1928 and 1929. He was Prime Minister, Minister for External Affairs, and Minister for Industry from October, 1929 until January, 1932. He was also Treasurer from the 9th July, 1930, until January, 1931. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scullin</inline> was made a Privy Councillor in 1930. He represented Australia at the Imperial Conference in London and at the Eleventh Assembly of the League of Nations  at  Geneva in the same year. In 1944 he was a member of the joint committee  on  income tax on current income. </para>

But no history of this land will be complete that does not accord to him  an  honoured and abiding place among Australia's most devoted and illustrious sons. All Australians may  well  contemplate  with profit the life of James Scullin. He was a model of all the domestic virtues and an outstanding example of devoted service and complete integrity in public life. To the youth of Australia his record and achievements are an abiding source of inspiration and encouragement, and a constant- reminder that the highest honour within

                    <para>To those of an older generation, his record reveals again the tremendous strain carried by those in high public office. Probably no Prime Minister of Australia in days of peace faced such harrowing and difficult problems as confronted <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scullin</inline> during the dark days when Australia was afflicted by the devastating blight of the world depression. Those years of anxiety and worry left a permanent mark upon a physique never very robust, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scullin</inline> laid down the burden of office a prematurely aged .and physically impaired man. </para>
                    <para>To parliamentarians, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scullin</inline> will long remain an edifying example of parliamentary deportment and behaviour.  His  eloquence and zeal were never marred by discourtesy or personalities. There is a certain cynical section of our people who claim that we parliamentarians always reserve our tributes and compliments to our opponents until after they have died. That is quite untrue. There has existed throughout the years,, and I am happy to say there exists to-day, a bond of deep respect and, in many instances, genuine affection between members whose political views are in violent conflict. Despite political differences, James Scullin enjoyed throughout his long public life the affection and respect of all who knew him.  His  sincerity and integrity were never challenged. I first met <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scullin</inline> over twenty years ago and I know that at all times in days of difficulty and turmoil he was sustained by a simple but profound faith. May he rest in peace ! I move - </para>

                        <para>. - -On behalf of the Opposition,  I second the motion. With <inline font-style="italic">the death of</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> H. Scullin, a figure of outstanding stature has passed from the Australian scene, but we can be assured that he will remain an abiding memory for so long as Australian history is written and preserved. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scullin</inline> was the first native-born Australian Labour Prime Minister. He won that distinction through the most outstanding qualities of mind, heart and character. One of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Scullin's  most notable characteristics was his intense Australianism, which pervaded his whole being and coloured the whole of his outlook. It found expression, honorable senators will remember, in his fostering of Australian industries, his campaign for the Australian right of self determination, and his insistence upon the appointment of a native-born Australian Governor-General. As the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'Sullivan)</inline> has stated, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scullin</inline> had the misfortune to be the Prime Minister of Australia during the economic blizzard  of the 'thirties, a period which we remember so well as the depression. The worry and anxiety of those times, coupled with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Scullin's  distress at the plight of so many of his fellow Australians, wrecked his health but certainly did not impair either his spirit or his character. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>It is conceded, universally I believe, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scullin</inline> was one of Australia's great orators, probably the greatest.  His  speech invariably was marked by a freshness, a virility, and a power of intellect that is very rare indeed. Until 1949, when he retired, his knowledge and his wisdom were heavily drawn upon by Australian Prime Ministers and governments, and he was a tower of strength in many ways throughout the troublous times of World War II. As the Minister has put it in other words, I repeat that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scullin</inline> was marked by a transparent honesty and integrity in matters public and private, in matters great and small. For him there was no compromise when a matter of principle was involved. He was a very worthy and distinguished servant of Australia, and he lived to know the respect and the affection of all Australians. I had the privilege of serving with him oil many occasions on non-official committees in this Parliament. I there had an opportunity to observe the fineness of his mind and of his character. He was a specialist in taxation laws and concentrated upon the removal of anomalies and injustices and upon the closure of opportunities for evasion. It is generally conceded that he had a genius for matters financial. </para>
                    <para>Knowing the depth of his religious convictions and the blameless life that he led, I do not find.it in my heart to-day to mourn for him. It seems very characteristic of him that some years ago, in Canberra, he said to me that he was ready to go; indeed, that he would pray to be taken were it not for the loneliness that would thereafter befall his wife. I suggest that he is a very happy man indeed who is prepared and eager to meet his Maker. I believe that he is now enjoying the reward of a well-spent, busy and blameless life. That is why I do not mourn for him. But on behalf of every member of the Opposition I extend to his widow who was his constant companion and who, in fact, was as familiar a figure in Canberra as he was, our sincere and deepest sympathy in what must be for her a tragic loss. I extend that sympathy to his relatives and to his innumerable friends throughout Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scullin</inline> will never be forgotten by members of the Australian Labour party and I suggest that he has well merited the tributes that have been paid to him by the Minister for Trade and Customs in this chamber and by honorable members in another place. </para>

                            <para>. - The members of the Australian Country party desire to be associated with the motion before the Senate and join the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'Sullivan)</inline> and the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McKenna)</inline> in expressing their deepest regret at the death of the Right Honorable J. H. Scullin. The late right honorable gentleman, who was known to his many friends as Jim Scullin, served his country well over a great number of years. He was Prime Minister at a  very  critical time in Australian history, during the depression years of the 1930's. He was a man of high principles, vast human understanding with a love for his fellow men. The great strain of his period of office took a heavy toll of his health which he never fully regained in after years. We join with the Minister for Trade and Customs and the Leader of the Opposition in tendering our deepest sympathy to his widow and his relatives in their sad bereavement. </para>

                            <para>- I desire to associate myself with the motion  that ha3  been moved by the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'Sullivan)</inline> and seconded by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McKenna).</inline>  In doing so, I desire to  Compliment  those gentlemen upon their excellent presentation of the life of our former Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scullin.</inline> I was associated with the right honorable gentleman  for  many years in the movement which he and I both served. I had my baptism of political life in endeavouring to enter this Parliament under his leadership. When eventually I did reach the Senate the right honorable gentleman was most kind to me as I know he was to others who made their first appearance in the National Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scullin</inline> was a most inspiring man. Reference has been made to his eloquence. Prior to his entry into the Parliament I well remember his espousal of the political beliefs which he held. When he spoke it was obvious that he spoke from  his  soul. Someone has stated that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scullin</inline> was a great Australian. I believe that he was even more than that. He loved not only Australia and its people but also humanity. He believed that he had a political faith which, if it could be fulfilled, would lead to a better world and a better life for all humanity. In addition to his efforts to. establish industries in this country, he also played a great part in endeavouring to popularize Australian literature so that our poets and writers might be enabled to give expression to the spirit of this young land. It was once my very great pleasure to listen to the right honorable gentleman delivering a lecture on the Australian bush. It was an inspiration to all who heard it. He loved our coat of arms and, in fact, all things Australian. </para>

                        <para>It is indeed regrettable that the man who so loved this country and who planned for its welfare should have reached the height of his political career during the dreadful times to which the Minister for Trade and Customs has referred to-day. I Was associated with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scullin</inline> in endeavouring to devise means by -which the depression could' be overcome, but, unfortunately, the forces against us were overwhelming. The depression loft him a. very disappointed and saddened man. However, history has since Vindicated him. To-day it 'is appreciated that had the ideas which he hold been given effect, the duration of the depression and the suffering of the Australian people would have been lessened considerably. It is with regret that I associate myself with the motion before the Senate. As the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McKenna)</inline> has said <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Scullin</inline> was a true friend and companion of her husband. They were mates and were always together. I can appreciate her loneliness to-day. I offer her my sympathy in her </para>
