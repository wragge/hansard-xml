        </quote>
        <para class="block">I submit that motion for two main reasons. The first concerns the personal attributes of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Nicholls.</inline> As nearly every member of this chamber knows, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Nicholls</inline> was  Chairman  of Committees of the Senate for a period of more than five years. During that time, of course, he officiated on many occasions as  Deputy President,  and to those who witnessed his performance both as  Chairman  of Committees and as  Deputy President,  no further commendation is needed.  His  extraordinary memory, his wide knowledge of the Standing Orders, his impartiality, firmness, and tact, were all abundantly evident. Therefore, on that personal ground, it is with very great confidence that I commend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Nicholls</inline> to honorable senators as their  President.  There is a further broad consideration that encourages me to propose <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Nicholls</inline> for this office. At the recent periodic Senate election, the people of Australia intimated that had they been given an opportunity to elect the whole of the Senate, the Australian Labour party would unquestionably have had a majority in this chamber to-day. By about 330,000 votes over all, and in five States out of six, the electors showed a decided preference for Labour party candidates. While I do not put that to the Senate as the sole reason or even as a reason at all for electing <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Nicholls,</inline> I repeat that the facts that I have just recounted encourage me at least to nominate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Nicholls.</inline> I have sufficient faith in the democratic outlook of honorable senators to believe that in choosing their  President  they will have some regard for the democratically expressed will of the people. I rest my main commendation of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Nicholls</inline> on his individual work as already amply demonstrated by him in this chamber. </para>

At this time, it is appropriate to offer our thanks and to express our appreciation to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator George</inline> Rankin for the services which he rendered to the Senate during the period he occupied with such capacity and distinction the position of  Chairman  of Committees.

As the Minister indicated, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid</inline> is already no stranger to honorable senators in that capacity, and all I need to say to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid,</inline> through you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> is that if he carries on in the future as he has done in the past he will continue to enjoy the confidence and co-operation of members of the Opposition in the Senate. I formally proffer to him that co-operation in the carrying out of the onerous duties of his very important office. I also endorse the remarks of the Minister for Trade and Customs regarding the former occupant of the office, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator George</inline> Rankin. We, of the Opposition, regret the passage of his friendly presence from the chair. Every honorable senator on this side of the chamber has great respect and affection for him. I have no doubt that he will facilitate the smooth passage of his successor into the chair and co-operate with him in ensuring the efficient conduct of the duties of the office.

          <para>- I wish to associate myself with the motion. Allan McDonald was a great personal friend of mine for many years. . I served with him in the House of Representatives for about twelve years, and worked with him also on committees, including the Public Works Committee. In both public and private life he was a grand man - a man whom Australia could ill afford to lose. As a soldier his record was unblemished. We loved him, and we shall miss him very greatly. </para>

          <para>- <inline font-style="italic">by leave</inline> - It is with deep regret that I have to announce to the Senate the death on the 13th July last of a member of the House, of Representatives of this Parliament, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Daniel</inline> Mulcahy. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mulcahy</inline> was elected to the House of Representatives for the Division of Lang, New South Wales, in 1934 and represented that division until the time of his death, a period of nearly twenty years. He was. a member of the War Expenditure Committee from J uly, 1941, to July, 1943, and a member of the Public Works Committee from February, 1943, to August, 1946. He was a Temporary  Chairman  of Committees from October, 1943, to October, 1949. Those of us to whom Daniel Mulcahy was a familiar figure will sadly miss that pleasant brogue, and the graceful, charming personality, which was a feature of this Parliament during his association with it.  His  friends, I am sure, will miss him greatly. I move - </para>

          <para>. - On behalf of the Opposition, I second the motion. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Daniel</inline> Mulcahy served both his party and his country honorably and well. Those who knew him regarded him as the quintessence of courtesy, kindliness and generosity. We are greatly grieved at what is to each of us who knew Daniel Mulcahy a severe personal loss. He, himself, grieved very deeply over the recent passing of his distinguished colleague and friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> S. Rosevear, and as it happened, was not long in joining him. This Parliament, I feel, could ill afford to lose a man of the calibre of Daniel Mulcahy. The enormous and very representative crowds which were present at the funeral service in Sydney, and at the graveside by the Pacific Ocean, were wonderful testimonies to the regard and esteem in which the late Daniel Mulcahy was held throughout the community. We of the Labour party extend to his bereaved family our very deep regret; and we extend that regret also to the electors of Lang who revered and respected him. </para>
