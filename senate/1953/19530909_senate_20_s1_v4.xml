                        <para>- I have seen the comments to which the honorable senator has referred. Since this Government has been in office it has doubled the contributions to the States for' road purposes. Responsibility in this matter rests very largely with the States. Unfortunately, costs have risen to such a degree that some States are finding it difficult to stand up to their obligations. Where Commonwealth responsibility is involved, I assure the honorable senator that we are doing all that we can, in the circumstances, to provide reasonable funds to ensure that the work is carried out. </para>

Many factors have operated to force freight charges up, but I assure the honorable senator that everything possible is being done to keep them at a reasonable level. As I have stated previously, the Commonwealth line of ships has not been sold. The matter has been one of negotiation between the Commonwealth and the Australian steamship owners for some time. </para>

                            <para>There was never a real danger to shipping in this case because <inline font-style="italic">Arkaba's</inline> movements were reported from time to time. All ships were asked to keep a look-out for her and report her position which was broadcast for the information of other ships. The weather conditions were known and so also were her rate and direction of drift. Had she been regarded as a serious menace, action could have been taken to dispose of the vessel as a danger to navigation at the expense of the owner. Our latest advices are that <inline font-style="italic">Allegiance II.</inline> towing <inline font-style="italic">Arkaba</inline> left Port Lincoln at 9.30 on the 6th September, bound for Sydney for bunkers. </para>

If so, has his attention been directed. to the shoddy headstones that have recently been erected - headstones with small and almost illegible lettering which convey an impression of pauperism? What is the cost of such headstones? Which firm has the contract for erecting such headstones in Perth? If headstones of this poor type, in comparison with those previously erected, are being provided as an economy measure, will the Minister consider following the procedure that is followed in respect of funeral expenses, and make a cash allowance equivalent to the present cost of headstones to the widow or next of kin of deceased ex-servicemen in order to enable them to provide headstoned that will be more in keeping with the supreme sacrifice that such memorials represent?</para>

It may be that that Government, for reasons of its own, does not desire to do so. Will the Minister inform the Senate of the steps that the Commonwealth is prepared to take to stimulate prospecting for uranium in any State in which it considers that insufficient action is being taken to discover whether uranium is present in sufficient quantity to warrant raining ? </para>

                        <para>- As the Atomic Energy Commission is responsible for dealing with the matter that has been raised by the honorable senator, his question is primarily one for consideration by the Minister for Supply. However, the actual prospecting work is carried out . by the Bureau of Mineral Resources, which is within my ministerial control, and as there is close interlocking of activity between the two instrumentalities I have a reasonably good know ledge of the work that is being undertaken by both of them. The bureau is actively engaged in exploratory work in the Northern Territory. A good deal of that work is carried out by the use of aircraft. During the wet season in the Northern Territory, when the aircraft cannot be used to advantage there, it is available for use in other States. As much work has still to be done in the Northern Territory the Bureau of Mineral Resources is obtaining an additional aircraft. During the forthcoming wet season in the Northern Territory the aircraft will be used at Broken Hill. The Atomic Energy Commission has requested all State governments to inaugurate and develop a campaign to stimulate prospecting for radio-active ores, and I have no doubt that the Bureau of Mineral Resources maintains close contact with the Tasmanian Department of Mines. The Australian Government intends to press forward vigorously with  campaigns to encourage prospecting for uranium, and preference will be given to areas where there are favorable indications of large deposits of uranium. I suggest to the honorable senator that he urge the Tasmanian Government to maintain close contact with the Atomic Energy Commission and the Bureau of Mineral Resources in connexion with prospecting for uranium in Tasmania. </para>

                        <para>- As the honorable senator has indicated, the negotiations at the International Sugar Conference resulted very satisfactorily for Australia. At that conference I had the very valuable assistance of the Premier of Queensland, Mr. Gair, and the Queensland Agent-General, Mr. Muir, and of representatives of the growing and refining sections of the industry. The price of sugar will not rise in Australia immediately as an outcome of the conference and any rise that occurs will not be heavy, but the agreement which was reached has assured the users of sugar throughout the world of an adequate and constant supply at an acceptable price. The agreement has also guaranteed producing countries a market for their sugar at an acceptable price. The effect will be security in the industry and the elimination of wild price fluctuations. As the world production of sugar is about 2,000,000 tons above the demand for that commodity, there would be a grave danger of a collapse in the price of sugar without some rationalization of the industry. Such a collapse would force producers out of production, and following in the wake of such an occurrence would be a shortage of sugar and then a rise in prices. 'Such a state of affair3 would be harmful to both consumers and producers. This agreement will prevent such an occurrence. Indonesia and one or two other countries withdrew from the conference, but agreement was reached between 40 countries concerned which represent the bulk of the producers and consumers of sugar. </para>

If it is not, why was the work not completed while the vessel was on the slipway?

                        <para>- This vessel was an old type of mine-sweeper which it was intended to put into repair and hold against an emergency. However, conditions have now changed and it does not appear likely, that it will be used for that purpose. As I have no personal knowledge of the facts I shall ask the Minister for the Navy to supply the information for which the honorable senator has asked. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to .ask the Minister representing the  Treasurer a question relating to a subject which was discussed at the Premiers conference of 1952 when the Prime Minister offered to return to the States their taxing powers. Since then, treasury officers of the various governments have prepared a very informative report on the practicability of carving up the income tax field between the Commonwealth and the States. Did the Premiers make any statement at the recent Australian Loan Council meeting or at the recent Premiers conference on the acceptance of their responsibility for collecting revenues?' What consideration has the Australian Government given to saddling the States with the responsibility of collecting their own revenues again and removing them from the position of ungrateful and ungracious authorities which cause embarrassment to the Commonwealth Treasurer? </para>

                        <para>- I think that it can be fairly stated that the Premiers, at their recent conference with the Prime Minister, showed no great enthusiasm to accept the return of their taxing powers. Their attitude was that they should take all that they could get from the Australian Government and then endeavour to blame that Government for not supplying them with more. In view of the importance of this issue I should like the honorable senator to place his question on the notice-paper so that the Treasurer himself might furnish a reply to it. </para>

                            <para>The results of surveys made by the Commonwealth Statistician have revealed that a minimum of £40,000,000 of United States funds was invested privately in Australia during the five years between June, 1047, and June, 1052, in the form of direct dollar receipts or goods of American origin. In addition, it has been estimated that profits totalling £22,700,000 were ploughed back into the Australian business of subsidiaries of United States companies during that .period, making an increase of a minimum of £69,000,000 in the United States funds invested in Australian companies. The rate of United States private investment in Australia rose sharply from £8,300.000 in' 1947-48 and £5,700,000 in 1948-4H to £17.700,000 in 1050-51 and £27,100,000 in 1951-52. Although the precise value of American investment in Australia in 1052-53 is not yet known, the Department of National Development has estimated that the, total since June, 1051, exceeded £50,000,000. This excludes amounts invested by Australians in American companies here and any other finance these companies may have raised locally. </para>

                        <para>The Commonwealth Office of Education did collect some facts about the number of children who did not complete a secondary school education. This was done as incidental to a wider task for the Government. There is in existence no report by the Commonwealth Office of Education which deals only with the number of children who did not complete their secondary education and it is, therefore, not possibleto meet the request regarding the New Education Fellowship and other interested parties. </para>

However, as I advised the honorable senator previously, it is not the intention of the Government to use the provisions of the Customs (Import Licensing) Regulations as a means of according protection to Australian industries. Such protection is usually granted only on the recommendation of the Tariff Board after a full public inquiry and report by thatbody. In this respect I would point out that a Tariff Board inquiry into the paper industry has recently been held, and I assume that the company in question tendered evidence at that inquiry. In making its recommendations the Tariff Board is, of course, guided by the evidence tendered at its inquiries. </para>

This excludes newsprint' and mechanical printing paper which, although included in the above statistics, are licensed on a separate basis. Prior to the 1st April, 1953, newsprint was licensed to consumers against quotas established on the basis of approximately 47 per cent, of their annual consumption for the year 1950-51. Since the 1st April, 1953, newsprint has been licensed without quota restriction subject to evidence being produced that the newsprint is available and will be imported within twelve months from the date of issue of the licence. Licences to import mechanical printing paper containing more than 25 per- cent, mechanical pulp were issued during the 1952-53 licensing year on the basis of 80 per cent, by quantity, of base year imports. During the present licensing year a similar basis for licensing mechanical printing paper has been adopted.

                    <para>The Treasurer (Sir Arthur Fadden) is to-night delivering in another place his speech outlining the budget proposals for the financial year 1953-54. I propose to inform honorable senators of the principal features of the Treasurer's budget speech. </para>
                    <para>In this budget the Government proposes to make tax reductions having an estimated annual value to taxpayers of £118,400,000. Rates of income tax on individual's will be reduced on the average by12½per cent. and a number of other concessions of great value to individual taxpayers will be introduced. Rates of company tax willalso be reduced, enter tainments tax will be abolished, sales tax rates will be lowered substantially, the exemption limits for pay-roll tax and estate duty will be raised, and customs, excise and primage concessions introduced. Besides these tax reductions, of which I shall give further details later, the Government proposes to increase war pensions and other repatriation benefits. it will also increase age, invalid and widows' pensions and modify the means test by raising the permissible income and property limits. </para>
                    <para>With the added cost of these benefits, total expenditure on social services in 1953-54 will be £184,000,000 which is £18,500,000 greater than expenditure in 1952-53. We are providing £200,000,000 for defence and £189,000,000 for payments to the States, the latter figure being £6,000,000 greater than expenditure last year. Yet, notwithstanding these heavy commitments and the cost to revenue of the tax reductions proposed, the Government is presenting a balanced budget for the financial year 1953-54. </para>
                    <para>In framing this budget the Government has sought as its primary aim to give the utmost possible encouragement to individual effort, to business enterprise and to individual and collective saving. Our economy has come through a difficult phase in which some basic elements were seriously out of balance. We have now, however, practically attained the stability that we set out to achieve in the strenuous days of 1950 and 1951. It has not been easy either for the Government or for the community, and yet it is remarkable that the transition from violent boom to comparative stability has been accomplished with relatively so little unemployment, dislocation and loss. It used to be axiomatic that every boom had to be followed by a slump and, usually, the worse the boom the worse the slump. Yet, the recent boom, one of the sharpest in our history, was brought under control without incurring anything that, by any stretch of imagination, could be calleda slump. That was a quite unprecedented achievement. </para>
                    <para>Now that we have attained this first greatgoal of economic stability we must press on with the great tasks of developing our resources, expanding our industries, increasing our population, and building up our national standards of life. In most respects, conditions in Australia to-day are highly favorable to economic expansion. Nevertheless, there are problems with us which could thwart our efforts to expand just as effectively as inflation did. One is the problem of cos'ts which, during the inflation period, mounted to excessive^ levels, especially in some industries. Another is the problem of savings which are still too low to sustain an adequate rate of national expansion. A third is the ever-present problem of increasing productivity, an element of our national economy which we must always be striving to improve. On this view of the future, with its great possibilities on the one hand and some stubborn obstacles on the other; our economic and financial course for the year must be determined. The job is not wholly, or even mainly, one for the Government ; it never is and never should be in an economy such as ours. But the Government can give a lead in this matter and make a contribution. </para>
                    <para>From its study of the general problem the Government is convinced that the right course at this juncture, and the best contribution it can make to the solution of the current problems of our economy, is a bold policy of reducing taxes, particularly those taxes which are levied directly upon individuals and upon business. We believe that this is the best form of assistance we can give in the attack on costs. Essentially, the cost problem is one to be solved by greater efforts and greater efficiency on the part of both labour and management. By reducing taxes and so making wages and profits more worth earning the Government can provide an inducement of greater effort and efficiency. Furthermore, reduced taxation should give greater scope and encouragement to saving from which the funds for industrial expansion 'and national development are derived. Finally, a combination of harder work, greater efficiency and a higher level of savings undoubtedly holds the key to the third main problem, the promotion df greater national productivity. As the Government sees the1 position, this is the best possible moment, both psychologically and from an economic stand-point, to give a strong impetus to effort and enterprise. </para>
                    <para>In order that the maximum possible amount should .be available in the budget for tax reductions, the Government has rigorously pruned back the estimates of expenditure for which Parliament will be asked to provide. The result is that, despite the additional provision 'being made for such items as war and repatriation benefits, social services and payments to the States, total estimated expenditure this year is only slightly above expenditure in 1952-53. </para>
                    <para>An amount of £200,000,000 is being provided for Defence Services this year, compared with expenditure of £215,300,000 in 1952-53. Although an armistice has been signed in Korea it will, as already announced, be necessary to keep our forces there at least until a peace settlement has been negotiated. Provision must, therefore, be made for their upkeep as well as for our forces in other areas abroad, whilst liabilities incurred prior to the armistice for stores and supplies for Korea must be met during the current financial year. In the meantime, our basic programme of defence preparations is going forward and although considerable re-adjustments have been made in the light of the changing international situation, the Government is not prepared at this stage to slow down further the planned programme. </para>
                    <para>The Government proposes to make increases in war and service pensions and in certain other repatriation benefits. The special rate war pension for cases of total and permanent incapacity will be increased by 10s. a week, making the pension £9 5s. a week; the 100 per cent, general rate war pension by 2s. 6d. to £4 2s. 6d. a week, and the Service Pension by 2s. 6d. a week. War widows' pensions will be increased by 2s. 6d. to £3 12s. 6d. a week and the domestic allowances payable to war widows who have children, or are 50 or more years of age, or are permanently unemployable, will also be raised by 2s. 6d. a week, making the allowance £1 14s. 6d. a week. The new rates will be paid from the first pension pay day after the necessary amending legislation has been passed. It is estimated that these and certain minor proposal's will involve an additional expenditure of £1,211,000 in a full year and crease of £18,500,000 on expenditure in 1952-53. </para>
                    <para>The Government proposes further to increase and liberalize social service benefits during the present year. Age and invalid pensions will be increased by 2s. 6d. a week from the present rate of £3 7s. 6d. while the income which pensioners are permitted to receive without reduction of pension will be increased by 10s. to £2 a week. Thus the maximum permissible weekly income, inclusive of pension, for a single pensioner will be raised from £4 17s. 6d. to £5 10s. and for a- married couple from £9 15s. to £11. For a married couple where only the husband or the wife is a pensioner, the amount of other income allowed without reduction of pension will be increased from £3 to £5 a week. </para>
                    <para>The Government also proposes to increase from £100 to £150 the amount of property which a pensioner may have without reduction of pension; and the limit of property beyond which no pension may be paid will be raised by £250 to £1,250 for a single person. For a married couple the limit will rise from £2,000 to £2,500. The value of a pensioner's home, furniture and personal effects and other exempt property are not, of course, to be included in these figures. The additional  cost of these and certain minor proposals is estimated at £4,114,000 in a full year and £3,080,000 in 1953-54. t </para>
                    <para>Widows' pensions will be increased by 2s. 6d. a week and widows will be granted the income and property liberalizations proposed for age and invalid pensions. The estimated increase in cost is £417,000 in a full year and £313,000 in this financial year. All- new rates will be paid from the first pension pay-day after the necessary amending legislation has been passed. </para>
                    <para>Allowances payable to single and married sufferers from tuberculosis will be increased by 2s. 6d. to £5 12s. 6d. and £9 2s. 6d. a week respectively. The additional cost is estimated at £38,000 for a full year and £29,000 for the current financial year. The cost of all the proposals just stated taken together is estimated tn be £4.570.000 in a full year and £3,420,000 in 1953-54. </para>
                    <para>On the 1st July last the medical benefits scheme came into operation. Under the scheme a Commonwealth subsidy is paid for each medical service covered by the scheme to members of registered medical insurance organizations and their dependants. The cost of the scheme is estimated at £3,500,000 in 1953-54, and between £8,000,000 and £10,000,000 a year when fully established. Taking into account the new proposals that have been described, expenditure from the National Welfare Fund in 1953-54 is estimated to be £184,000,000, which represents an increase of £J.S,500,000 on expenditure in 1952-53. </para>
                    <para>Total payments to the States this year are estimated at £189,000,000 or £6,000,000 more than last year. This increase is due primarily to increased tax reimbursement grants. As already announced, the Commonwealth proposes to supplement the grant of approximately £120,500,000 payable to the States under the tax reimbursement formula by the payment of a special financial assistance grant sufficient to bring the total tax reimbursement payments in 1953-54 to nearly £142,500,000 or just over £6,500,000 more than the corresponding payments last year. In arriving at the figure of nearly £142,500,000, allowance was made by the Commonwealth for the fact that it is not proposed in 1953-54 to make a separate grant to the States to reimburse them for the cost of administering their controls over prices and rents. Last year, the grant for that purpose amounted to slightly over £1,000,000. </para>
                    <para>Total estimated expenditure of business undertakings shows an increase of £3,750.000 over expenditure in 1952-53. Of this increase, £3,170,000 is on account of the Postal Department. £407,000 on account of Commonwealth Railways, and £173,000 for broadcasting services. The increases are due partly to wage increases which occurred . at intervals during 1952-53 and of which the full year effect is now being reflected in the budget. In the case of the Postal Department, some increased provision is  necessary  for handling an increased volume of business and for the operation and maintenance of new telephone facilities. </para>
                    <para>The estimates for  capital  works and services have been further reduced this year and show a total of £101,500,000 compared with actual expenditure of £103,600,000 last year and £110,600,000 in 1951-52. </para>
                    <para>The estimate of £48,700,000 for departmental expenditure represents an increase of £2,300,000 on expenditure in 1952-53. This increase, again, is mainly due to effects of earlier increases in wages,  salaries and 'other costs. </para>
                    <para>The provision for other items of expenditure in 1953-54 is less than last year. Expenditure on territories is expected to increase by £1,600,000 but a saving of £2,500,000 is expected in respect of bounties and subsidies whilst .the estimate for miscellaneous services, mainly immigration, is £3,100,000 less than last year and other statutory payments £300,000 less than last year.' </para>
                    <para>In total, expenditure for 1953-54 is estimated at £982,000,000 which is only  about  £7,000,000 greater than total expenditure in 1952-53. This demonstrates bow the1 steep rise in governmental  expenditure  which has been going on for years past has now been successfully restrained. </para>
                    <para>On the basis of present rates of taxation it is estimated that total revenue in 1953-54 would reach nearly 4' 1, 064,000,000. This includes revenue from taxation, £956,000,000, and other revenue, £108,000,000, and is approximately £76,000,000 higher than total revenue in 1952-53. If revenue were allowed to stand at about £1,064,000,000 and expenditure at about £982,000,000 there would be a budget surplus of nearly £S2,000,000. As I have already stated, however, the Government proposes to make tax reductions worth £118,400,000 si year to taxpayers and it is estimated that the cost of these tax reductions to revenue in 1953-54 will 'be £81,560,000. </para>
                    <para>In framing its tax proposals the Government considered at length the general form which tax reductions should take and, as I have said earlier, it reached the conclusion that the greatest weight should he given to reductions in those taxes which are levied directly upon individuals and upon business. Such reductions will benefit the greatest number of people; in fact they will benefit practically everybody and if the object is to encourage effort, enterprise and saving, that, obviously, is what the Government should try to do. We did not, however, by any means ignore the very widespread representations that indirect taxes, which add. to costs and prices, should be reduced and,, as I shall explain presently, we are proposing some very substantial concessions of that nature. We examined with particular care the numerous requests that pay-roll tax should be abolished, but we were confronted with a number of considerations which precluded that step.. Most decisive was the fact that abolition, of pay-roll tax would have limited very drastically the scope for reducing direct, taxes. I may amplify that point by saying that to abolish pay-roll tax would have involved a cost to revenue of some- , £42,000,000 per annum, an amount which is equivalent to an average 10 per cent., reduction in rates of income tax on individuals. We are, however, proposing toadjust the incidence of pay-roll tax in away which will give a very valuablemeasure of relief. I now propose to  give  the main details of the tax proposals. </para>
                    <para>Reduction of the rates of individual income tax and social services contribution will operate from the 1st July, 1953. Rates of tax will be reduced throughout all income ranges, but the percentage reductions will be greatest in the lower and middle income ranges and will diminish as the incomeincreases. The maximum rate of tax, at present 15s. on the excess of income over £10,00CP, will be reduced to 14s. and apply only to income in excess of £16,000. Tinreduced rates of instalment deduction? will apply as from the 1st November. 1953. Provisional tax in respect ' of 1953-54 incomes will be adjusted to reflect the reduced rates. These proposals represent an overall reduction of about 12-J per cent, on existing rates of tax and wilT cost revenue £51,250,000 in a full  year and  £32.900,000 in the current year. </para>
                    <para>It is proposed to abolish, as from the 1st July. 1953. the differential tax on property income such as rent, interest an&lt;T dividends from companies. Up to the present, property tax, at rates  ranging  from 4d. to 16d. in the £1 has been superimposed on the basic tax  which  i&lt;s  payable  on income both  from personal exertion  and from property. The additional  &lt;cra property lias not applied, however, to incomes of £400 or less or to the excess of incomes over £10,000. It has therefore teen borne mainly by people in the middle income 'groups, most of the tax being payable, in fact, on incomes between £1,000 and £5,000. Whatever justification there may have been for the property tax in earlier years cannot be regarded as applying now. The tax has indeed been an added burden in recent years on many people whose incomes tended to lag behind the rise in prices during the inflationary period. The removal of the tax which, incidentally, will simplify assessments, will cost £3,500,000 in a full year and £3,000,000 in 1953-54. </para>
                    <para>It Is proposed to increase the allowance for a dependent wife from £104 to £130. This increased concession will apply also to taxpayers maintaining a "parent, husband, daughter-housekeeper or :a housekeeper having the care of children under the age of sixteen years. The increase in the concession will cost revenue £5,550,000 in a full year and £3,600,000 in .1953-54. Associated with the increase from £104 to £130 in the wife allowance, it is proposed, as from the 1st July, 1953, to increase from £52 to £65 the separate net income which may be derived by the wife before the concessional deduction on her account is diminished. This further concession will cost £450,000 in a full year and £100,000 in 1953-54. Tables are being circulated illustrating, in respect of various incomes, the effects of the proposed reductions in rates and of the proposed increase in the concession for a dependent wife. Tt will be observed that the changes I have outlined will confer reductions ranging from 100 per cent, for the family man on a small income to something less than 10 per cent, for taxpayers with incomes over £10,000. It will be seen also that the amounts of income tax at the rates proposed in Australia at all ranges of income are substantially lower than the 'amounts payable in the United Kingdom or New Zealand. </para>
                    <para class="block">Last year the Government introduced -for the first time in the history of Commonwealth income tax, a deduction for expenditure incurred by a taxpayer in the education of his children. Because the allowance was novel and, to some extent, experimental, it was considered necessary to confine the deduction to expenditure actually paid to schools and to' place a limit of £50 upon the deduction in respect of each child under 21 years of age. This concession. was very warmly received and, in accordance with the promises then made that it would be extended if necessary, the Government intends to liberalize the conditions and to increase the maximum deduction to £75. Under the conditions now proposed, all kinds of necessary expenditure in connexion with the child's full-time education will, subject to the maximum of £75, be deductible. The concession will thus extend to such payments as boarding charges at hostels, the cost of text-books and fares to and from school. The increased concessions will apply as from the 1st July, 1953, at an additional cost to revenue of £1,950,000 per annum. There will, however, be no additional cost to revenue in .1953-54. </para>
                    <para>Consideration has been given to those cases where taxpayers have been obliged to incur medical expenses in excess of the present maximum deduction of £100 allowed for each member of the family. Although the introduction of the Commonwealth hospital and medical benefits scheme will substantially reduce the number of these cases in the future, nevertheless there will be some cases which merit a more liberal allowance. It is accordingly proposed to raise the maximum deduction from £100 to £150. At the same time, the maximum amount of dental expenses subject to the concession within the total of £150 is being raised from £20 to £30 for each person. These increased concessions also will ' apply as from the 1st July, 1953. There will be no cost to revenue in 1953-54, but in subsequent years the annual cost will be about £100,000. </para>
                    <para>It is proposed to raise still further the concession for aged persons. At present, men over 65 years and women over 60 years may receive incomes of £254 without being subject to tax. A married couple both qualified by age and in receipt of combined incomes of £507  are  also exempt. These exemptions are being raised to £375 in the case of qualified single persons and to £750 in the  case of qualified married couples. This increase in the concession will advance the present exemption levels by £121 and. £243 respectively and will cost revenue £1,500,000 in a' full year and £920,000 in 1953-54. </para>
                    <para>In recognition of the special occasion of  Her  Majesty's Coronation, it is proposed that contributions of £1 ' or more to the Queen Elizabeth the Second Coronation Trust Fund for Mothers and Children shall be allowable deductions for income tax purposes. This allowance may cost revenue about £100,000 in 1954-55 but there will be no cost to revenue this year. </para>
                    <para>Consideration has been given to the hardship which occurs through the operation of the graduated rates, of income tax when authors, artists, composers and inventors receive in a lump sum, or its equivalent, abnormal income which may be the fruits of years of effort. To remove this disability and also to encourage cultural and inventive activities, it is proposed to apply a concessional rate of tax to income which includes such abnormal receipts. In these cases, the taxable income, including the abnormal receipt, will be taxed at the rate appropriate to the normal income plus one-third of the abnormal receipt. This concession will apply as from the 1st July. 1953, and will cost revenue about £50,0.00 in a full assessment year. There will be no loss of revenue, however, in 1953-54. </para>
                    <para>In June last, it was announced that the Government had decided to extend for a period of seven years from the 1st July, 1953, a concession previously granted in respect of profits earned from certain base metals and rare minerals. Concurrently, it is proposed to enlarge slightly the list of metals and minerals to which the concession applies. The concession, which has obtained since 1942, is costing revenue about £500,000 "a year and the extension proposed by the Government will not add significantly to that annual cost. </para>
                    <para>It is proposed that the rates of tax payable .by public companies on incomes of the year ended 30th June, 1953, will be 6s. in the .£1 on the first £5,000 of taxable income and 7s. in the £1 on the balance of taxable income. As it is not proposed to re-enact the additional levy of 2s. in the £1 imposed in 1951-52 and 1952-53,. the proposed rates represent, in the generality of cases, a. reduction in tax of ls. in the £1 on the first £5,000 of taxable income and 2s. in the £1 on the balance of taxable income. In the case of private companies, an overall reduction of ls. in the £1 isproposed, so that the rates for the financial year 1953-54 will be 4s. in the £1. on the first £5;000 of taxable income and 6s. in the £1 on the balance. </para>
                    <para>It will be recalled that in the budget of last year the rate of tax on the first £5,000 of the taxable income of public companies was reduced by 2s. It is also relevant to point out that private companies were not at any time subject to the. special levy of 2s. in the £1 which was imposed on all public company  taxable  income in the 1951-52 budget. The cost to revenue of these changes will be £28,750,000 in a full year and £23,300,000 in 1953-54. </para>
                    <para>Under the amendments made last year to the private company provisions of the income tax legislation, investment income could not be included for the purpose' of calculating retention allowances. Since that amendment was made, evidence placed before the Government demonstrates that although there is not the same need for retention allowances for property income as foi- other income, there is at least some need. Accordingly, it is now proposed that private companies should be allowed to retain 10 ,per cent, of' distributable income from property, except dividends from other private companies.- This retention will be allowed on income for the year 1952-53 and future years. The cost to revenue will be £350,000 in a- full year and £100,000 in the current financial year. </para>
                    <para>In last year's legislation a period of five years to the 31st December, 1957, was allowed for «the distribution of tax-free dividends to shareholders of private companies. These dividends are distributed out of accumulated funds on which tax at shareholders' individual rates has been paid by the private companies. The period of five years is to be extended for a further period of five years to the 31st December, 1962. No cost to revenue will be involved in this extension. </para>
                    <para>It is proposed to remove those rates of sales tax which now stand at 50 per cent., 33^ per cent., and 20 per cent. The majority of goods now subject to sales tax at .those rates will be subject to a rate of 16$ per cent. Some goods, however, mainly sporting goods and equipment, which are now taxed at 20 per cent., will be transferred to the general rate of 12£ per cent. </para>
                    <para> A number of goods now subject to sales tax . will be exempted. These include matches, fruit juice cordials consisting of 25 pei- cent, or more of pure juice, buttons, buckles, hooks, eyes and slide fasteners, aeroplanes used for certain purposes, water softeners, and insecticides. These proposals, of which further details will be given in legislation to be introduced later, involve an estimated cost to revenue of £11,700,000 in a full year, and of £8,760,000 in the current financial year. The new rates of tax will come into force as from the commencement of business to-morrow, the 10th September, 1953. </para>
                    <para>The Government proposes to raise the annual exemption from pay-roll tax from £1,040 to £4,160 on wages and salaries payable ou and after the 1st October, 1953; that is, from the equivalent of £20 a week to £80 a week. This concession will mean that more than 50,000 employers of the 90,000 employers who now pay the tax will no longer be liable to do so and the remainder will, of course, benefit from the higher exemption. The cost to revenue will be £5,000,000 in a full year and £3,900,000 in 1953-54. </para>
                    <para>The Government proposes to abolish entertainments tax and the abolition will become effective in regard to entertainments held on and after the 1st October, 1953. This tax has largely been levied upon those popular entertainments which, in modern times, people have come to value as part of the normal enjoyments of life. Its removal must . therefore be regarded as an aid to both family and individual budgets. The cost to revenue will be £7,000,000 in a full year and £5,300,000 in the current year. </para>
                    <para>It is proposed to raise the statutory , exemptions from estate duty. The cost to revenue in a full year will be £430,000 and in the current year £80,000. Details will be given when the relevant legislation is introduced. It is also proposed that estate duty shall not be payable on the first £5,000 of an estate of a member of the defence forces dying on active service or as a result of injuries received or disease contracted on active service in Korea or Malaya. </para>
                    <para>It is proposed to reduce customs and excise on spirits by 21s. a gallon, while primage will be reduced on a number of items. Details will be given later by the Minister for Trade and Customs (Senator O'sullivan). The cost to revenue involved is estimated at £750,000 in a full year and £600,000 in 1953-54. </para>
                    <para>The estimated cost to revenue of the taxation concessions I have just outlined may be summarized as follows: - </para>
                    <para>In terms of the cost to revenue, these reductions are by far the largest which any government in Australia has ever made in any one year. Expressed as a percentage of total taxation revenue, they are also, greater than any government has made in any one year since World War II. commenced. The reduction in taxation announced in last year's budget involved a cost to revenue in 1952-53 of £50,000,000 and in a full year of nearly £80,000,000. With the reduction in taxation of just over £118,000,000 now proposed, the Government will therefore have reduced taxation within the last two years to the extent of approximately £200,000,000 a year. </para>
                    <para>Bringing together the revenue and expenditure proposals I have outlined, the budget for 1953-54 iri ay be sumin ari zed as follows: - </para>
                    <para class="block">
                        <graphic href="001232195309096_18_3.jpg" />
                    </para>
                    <para>Outside the budget proper, finance -will be required for war service land settlement, estimated at £7,000,000, and for redemption of War Savings Certificates, also estimated at £7,000,000. It is proposed to charge these items to Loan Fund. They arc approximately offset by the amount of the budget surplus of £13,400,000 realized in 1952-53, the investment of which in the special internal loans raised to help finance State programmes relieved loan fund to an equivalent Amount. Although the prospects for public loan raisings are somewhat better this year - they should be assisted by the tax proposals I- have outlined - it will be necessary for the Commonwealth again to provide assistance for State borrowing programmes, though on a smaller scale than in the past two years. It will be recalled that in 1952-53 the Commonwealth made special subscriptions to loans floated to finance State works programmes to an amount of £131,470,000 and in 1951-52 to an amount of £152,865,000. At the Australian Loan Council meeting last May, the Commonwealth offered to assist the State borrowing programmes for 1953-54 up to a limit of £95,000,000. Advances are being made by the Commonwealth to the States on the basis of a total loan programme of £200,000,000, including funds made available under the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement. To the extent that funds available from public loans and domestic borrowings may exceed £105,000,000, the amount of assistance to be provided by the Commonwealth will be reduced". Toprovide finance for State programmes; and for advances under the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement,, in the past two years the Commonwealth invested Commonwealth trust  fund  balances in internal loans. To the extent: that the balances so invested previously have been used temporarily to redeem outstanding treasury-bills, it was necessary to re-issue treasury-bills to make available the funds required. Similararrangements will probably be necessary this year, although the amounts will be smaller and the amount of bank credit required is expected to be less than in 1952-53. </para>
                    <para>Just as our internal economic situationhas improved during the past year, enabling taxation, to be reduced, so hasthere been a great strengthening of  our  trade and financial position overseas,, making possible a progressive relaxation of import controls. During 1952-53,  our  international reserves rose from £362,000,000 to £548,000,000, an increaseof no less than £186^000,000. Apart from the control maintained upon imports, the main reason for this: splendid recovery was a record volume of.' exports which sold generally at good' prices. There was a remarkable increasein the output of wool, meat and dairyproducts whilst the average yield of wheat per acre was by far the highest ever recorded. In part, this was due to&gt; a good season. There can be no doubt, however, that it also showed the benefit our primary producers have had from better supplies of equipment and' materials, in which respect the importsobtained under our international bankloans have made a notable contribution, and also from the valuable tax concessions given to the primary industries in recent years. Total export income last year was- £871,000,000, which is the second highest figure ever reached. </para>
                    <para>Imports were, of course, restrained! by the controls first imposed in Marchlast year to meet the great fall in our- overseas reserves. [Extension of time granted.] But because very large imported stocks were held in the country and because the import restrictions were gradually relaxed during the year, no serious shortage of imported goods has been experienced. </para>
                    <para>The Government has, of course, aimed to build up our overseas reserves from the low point to which they had fallen by the middle of 1952. At the same time, however, we have balanced that consideration against the need to keep up an adequate supply of imported equipment and material, and we have also regarded it as a prime obligation to relax and remove restrictions as rapidly as the balance of payments position made it possible.We undertook to do that when the controls we'refirst applied, and we have lived up to our undertaking. </para>
                    <para>First, we issued import licences valued at approximately £20,000,000 to meet hardship cases and, as from the 1st January last, we cancelled initial debits against future import quotas. The standards of severity previously applied in considering import applications were gradually relaxed and then, by stages, general relaxations of import controls were made. The latest of these general relaxations took effect from the 1st July this year. The result of this action has been that, although total imports in 1952-53 were only £514,000,000, the present annual rate at which licences are being issued provides for a level of imports much higher than that. </para>
                    <para>The subject of future policy on imports and other trade matters will be dealt with by the Prime Minister (Mr. Menzies) in a statement which he will make shortly. </para>
                    <para>When the Government first took office it hadthe strongest desire and determination to ease the burdens of the community in the matter of taxation and to remove restraints upon freedom of economic life and enterprise. Through events beyond our control, we were forced to put those aims aside for a time, and under circumstances of emergency, to take measures which added temporarily to the burdens and restraints upon the community. We did those things in good faith and according to our best judgment, though greatly against our political interests. No government worthy of the name could have done otherwise. </para>
                    <para>There is now everything to show that we acted in the best interests of the people who, to-day, have something they have lacked for many years - the advantages of a stable and abundant economy. </para>
                    <para>Through the success of these measures, the Government has been able to take up again its original aims and purposes. Last year we substantially reduced tax burdens. This year we will do far more. When the budget is passed, the level of taxation in Australia will have been lowered very greatly indeed, and a strong and genuine incentive given to the community. </para>
