            <para>- The piece of evidence read out by the Leader of the Opposition is a piece of evidence that I think I read, but I have no precise recollection of the words. I accept that they are the words which were used on 7 June. I have not had an opportunity to investigate those allegations, although the Leader of the Opposition may remember that there was debate in this chamber about the redistributions in Western Australia. I remember that debate particularly because that country of course, is a part of the country with which I am most familiar. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Members of the Opposition did make some complaints in this chamber, as I recall, that the seat of Kalgoorlie had been altered to the Australian Labor Party's detriment by the inclusion of certain parts of the northern wheat belt. As I recall, the response that was given to that question was that this was part of the process which had been demanded by the Opposition for many years, namely a process of equalisation of the size of electorates. The seat of Kalgoorlie is now within 5 per cent or 6 per cent of quota, a matter which I would have thought would have gladdened the hearts of those who favour one vote one value. </para>
          <para>If there are more serious matters than that implicit in the quotation which has been put before the Senate by the Leader of the Opposition I will, of course, have them checked. I can say in general with regard to the Royal Commission report that it is my view that there are a number of matters in it which require detailed consideration and analysis. </para>
          <para>One other matter that has been raised by the Opposition, by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> and, I think, by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt-</inline> I referred to this matter in the tabling statement that I made on Tuesdayrelates to future practices in respect of the preparation of electoral analyses and when they are prepared what ought to be done with them. I would say to the Opposition that matters such as that are matters which require serious consideration. They need government consideration; they need reporting to this chamber and no doubt debate in due course. </para>

            <para>- As honourable senators probably know, I took the opportunity in the two-week parliamentary recess to visit Washington with senior officers of not only my own Department but also the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs and the Department of Trade and Resources for the purpose of having consultations with the United States Attorney-General and representatives of his Department, the Department of State and the Federal Trade Commission concerning the extraterritorial application of antitrust laws. The Senate will recall that concern about the extraterritorial application of United States antitrust laws led to the enactment of the Foreign Proceedings (Prohibition of Certain Evidence) Act 1976. Orders were made under that Act prohibiting Australian based evidence from being used for the purpose of United States legal proceedings concerning marketing arrangements for uranium. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Those proceedings included a grand jury inquiry and civil action for treble damages by the Westinghouse Corporation, in which action at least one Australian company was a defendant. Since the orders were made the Australian Government and primarily my Department have had detailed exchanges with the United States Government in relation to the grand jury inquiry. I am pleased to say that that has now terminated without any prosecution proceedings being instituted against any Australian company. I believe that submissions that we made to the United States Government in connection with the grand jury inquiry assisted the United States authorities to reach their decision not to institute any such proceedings. </para>
          <para>The arrangements for the consultations which I had last week in Washington were made some time ago, following a meeting between my predecessor and Judge Griffin Bell. The aim was to explore how, for the future, the enforcement policies of the United States authorities might take account of the laws and policies of the Australian Government and the national interest of Australia. The consultations were broadly based in that they were concerned not only with prosecution proceedings but also with civil proceedings which are of great significance because they can result in damages of enormous sums- the treble damages suits- to the detriment of the national interest of countries such as Australia. </para>
          <para>I am pleased to say that the consultations I had last week were both friendly and constructive. When the consultations were first proposed it was hoped that they would serve the useful purpose of enabling each side to obtain a better understanding of the other's position. In fact, they went much further than that and it became clear that there was a desire on both sides to reach an agreement. As a result of the consultations I am looking forward with some optimism to the prospect of that agreement being reached in the near future. A further meeting at officer level is expected to be held soon with a view to reaching such an agreement. </para>

That document, of course, then has to be submitted to us for further consideration. We are hoping at this stage that such an agreement will eventuate within six months. </para>

There were recommendations in the report which, if publicly disclosed, would make difficult the Department's job of ensuring that there is no abuse of the social security system. It was decided by the Government that it was not a report that would be publicly released. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline> has an interest in the systems and procedures that are used within the Department I will see that an officer is able to advise him so that he may be informed of any systems about which he has some questions. It was considered that it would not be in the public interest publicly to release the report of the review team. </para>

            <para>- I direct my question to the Minister representing the Treasurer. Recognising the effect that the sales tax reduction as announced in the Budget will have on motor vehicle registerations and also the fact that motor vehicle registrations are generally regarded as an economic indicator and thus the figures for the September quarter will not be a fair indicator, can the Minister advise the Senate of the number of motor vehicle registerations in the two quarters prior to the Budget? </para>

            <para>- The latest available figures are contained in the August issue of Round-up of Economic Statistics' published by the Treasury. No doubt, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collard</inline> would be aware of that publication and that issue. It discloses that in the month of June registrations of new motor cars and station wagons, seasonally adjusted, rose by 3.5 per cent to 36,900 vehicles. This compares with 35,600 vehicles in May and an average monthly level of 35,900 for the first nine months of 1977-78. In the June quarter, registrations totalled 1 10.300 compared with 106.900 in the March quarter and 105,700 in the December quarter. I have a copy of the latest issue of the Australian Bureau of Statistics' bulletin entitled 'Registrations of New Motor Vehicles'. It contains further details, including the number of new vehicles registrations up to July 1 978 in all States. I will let the honourable senator have a copy of it. </para>

Is the Government concerned at this lack of knowledge in most Australian doctors and does the Government intend encouraging the introduction of such courses for medical students, particularly students in those areas of Australia where the incidents of such diseases is highest? Is the Government aware of the concern of the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories at the lack of knowledge and the widespread misunderstanding among the medical profession about the correct management of snake bite? </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">- Senator McAuliffe</inline>has raised an interesting and important question. In answer to the first two parts of his questionthat is, whether the Government is aware of the little, if any, formal instruction and whether the Government is concerned at this lack of knowledge- I am advised by the Minister for Health that he would answer yes to both questions; he is concerned about the lack of knowledge. In the third part of the question the honourable senator asked whether the Government is aware of the concern of the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories. The Minister for Health is concerned about that matter also and I understand that he has referred it to the National Health and Medical Research Council in the context of its current investigations. As to the first two parts of the question, the Minister for Health also advises that this matter has been considered by the National Health and Medical Research Council which has been investigating the provision of publicity on this information to the medical profession. The matter raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McAuliffe</inline> is one of concern and is receiving the attention of the National Health and Medical Research Council. It is hoped that the problem that has been highlighted can be overcome. </para>

The Government can say to honourable senators that in the course of that review it will take into account the position of persons and companies which presumably recently received assessments of tax based on revised rental values. The honourable senator would appreciate that whenever changes, of either a minor or major degree, occur in revenue laws there is always a cut-off point of some description and some people receive and some do not receive the alleged benefit of the change. I cannot give the honourable senator any assurance other than that I will keep in mind and bring to the attention of the Treasurer that in the course of the review what he said should be given full consideration. </para>

            <para>- Following the transfer of responsibilities to the Northern Territory, I understand that the water supply for Goulburn Island is now the responsibility of the Northern Territory. I can inform the honourable senator that the works to which he refers have been included in the draft 1978-79 civil works program. The estimated cost of the water reticulation system is about $240,000 and the cost of the boat landing facility is about $183,000. The provision of a water reticulation system will be given priority and, subject to its inclusion in the approved program, the Department of Construction expected that it would invite tenders for the work about the end of July 1978. The boat landing facility requires some detailed design work prior to the calling of the tenders, but construction of the project is expected to commence later in the 1978-79 financial year. I note that the Aboriginal councils are concerned about the water supply system. The Minister for Construction has indicated to me that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> can be assured that this installation will be given attention as soon as the project is included in the approved works program. </para>

            <para>-The Minister for Primary Industry has indicated that he has not been approached by the Tasmanian Government to agree to or to comment on any proposal to declare Tasmania as having achieved advanced disease free status for cattle. So, apparently, the State Government has not made an approach for that purpose. The Minister has received representations on this matter from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Archer.</inline> Undoubtedly, he is more interested in that State than many of the people who are involved in government there at the present time. Information available will support a special cattle health status in Tasmania for the diseases of brucellosis and tuberculosis, which have been eradicated. The Bureau of Animal Health has already notified the international animal health organisations and Tasmania is noted in the various animal health year books as being free of these two diseases. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Hydatids eradication is well advanced, whilst other diseases, such as ephemeral fever and tick fever, have never appeared in Tasmania. Perhaps that is because there is a Labor Government there! There is no reason why any declaration on animal health should not receive the full support of the Commonwealth Government provided that such a declaration does not adversely affect the national interest or does not draw undue attention to relatively minor or doubtful cattle diseases in other States. The </para>
          <para>Commonwealth Government would not encourage any State or Territory to declare itself free of a disease agent which might cause disease but which at the present time does not cause disease in the field. </para>

            <para>- The honourable senator has asked a particularly important question. I can assure him that he raises a matter which, even though his Labor colleagues in their ignorance laugh at it, is a very important matter. For instance, those people who are interested in primary industry and those people who have knowledge of this matter are aware that Paterson 's Curse is indeed a curse for many farmers and producers, but it is the lifeblood of some particular primary producers. In the past year, I have received many letters requesting me not to take notice of the pleas that I have received from various councils and from sheep and cattle interests asking that the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation pursue the development of a means of getting rid of Paterson 's Curse. Apparently the beekeeping industry, which is important, is very much involved in the use of Paterson 's Curse in the production of a particular type of honey. </para>

          <para>This presents a problem because the CSIRO has been requested to make some investigation into the biological control of this weed. Indeed, it believes at present that it has had some success. It believes that it is an appropriate time for it to attempt to distribute some small insects which might be able to control Paterson 's Curse. However, with the conflicting interests that are abroad in the primary industry field, the CSIRO has referred the matter back to the Australian Agricultural Council. It is there that a decision must be made as to whether the CSIRO, for which I am responsible, should pursue the policy of attempting to rid Australia of Paterson 's Curse or whether the interests of those people who wish to retain Paterson 's Curse should be paramount. </para>

            <para>- My question which is addressed to the Minister representing the Treasurer refers to the recent Government loan, which closed on 2 1 August. Can the Minister inform the Senate of the details of the loan? Is it a fact that cash subscriptions to this loan constituted an all-time record? Could the Minister say whether, with this Government's credit rating both at home and overseas so high, the August loan result will help create the circumstances for further reductions in interest rates? </para>

            <para>- Even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> ought to be interested in the success of a major cash loan. Certainly the Jeremiahs would find nothing to crow about. That is a matter of judgment for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges.</inline> Addressing myself to the positive question raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Messner,</inline> the fact is that the cash subscriptions for the August loan constituted an all-time record. Subscriptions totalled $780m, surpassing the previous highest Commonwealth loan raising, which was in July 1976, by $54m. Subscriptions from the non-bank sector totalled about $575m, or approximately 74 per cent, and that is particularly significant. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Subscriptions were well spread over the four stocks offered in the loan. The 1980 stock attracted 17 per cent of subscriptions, the 1983 stock 37 per cent, the 1988 stock 24 per cent and the 1997 stock 22 per cent. In addition, of the $44 lm in securities which matured on 15 August, $41 7m has been converted, $18m has been redeemed, whilst holders of $6m have yet to indicate their intention. Yes, the loan result is a clear indication of this Government's credit worthiness. It is also a clear indication of general acceptance of the Government 's economic policy as outlined in the Budget. The loan result will help to create circumstances in which a sustainable reduction in interest rates could occur. </para>

            <para>-I have no more detailed knowledge of the alleged incident than what I have gained from the Press. Therefore, I cannot answer at first hand a question on the factual situation. To be able to respond to that, one would need to know the circumstances and the alleged claims which have given rise to the arrest of the Biko family. One would need to know whether the establishment of a prima facie case has been attempted. Without that background I cannot respond. In general terms, the Australian Government always has been vocal in asserting that democratic rights should be maintained and that people should not be arrested without charge or detained without charge. I think that my best plan, since the question relates to a specific, is to refer it to my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and seek further details for the honourable senator. </para>

            <para>- My question, which I direct to the Minister representing the Treasurer, relates to the taxation of certain lump sum payments which was mentioned in the Budget Speech whereby changes are made in taxation on payments for unused annual and long service leave. In the Budget Speech the Treasurer said: </para>

          <list type="lowerroman-dotted">

          <para>In that sentence no reference is made to the tax on payments for unused annual leave. My question is in connection with unused annual leave accumulated prior to the reading of the Budget Speech. Why are there no phasing-in arrangements for accumulated annual leave? Is not the application of the new provision to entitlements gained earlier than the reading of the Budget Speech unfair and in fact retrospective? Would this not apply in Australia to merely a handful of people who would have accumulated their annual leave over perhaps the last two years or so, no doubt to the detriment of their own health? After all, the measure applies only to salary and wage earners, who are not involved in taxation avoidance schemes. Will the Government reconsider this measure? </para>

What research findings have been made by the Institute of Marine Science near Townsville in relation to the deadly box jellyfish which abound in northern waters during the summer months? Has any research been undertaken by the Institute into the widely held theory that the large turtles prey on these jellyfish and that one reason for the proliferation of the jellyfish is the reduction of the turtle population? </para>

            <para>- The honourable senator asks a question directly relevant to the interests of marine science research and to the research of the Australian Institute of Marine Science. My understanding is that extremely limited research has been undertaken on the box jellyfish although I believe I am correct in saying that at the James Cook University some research has been carried out. I have a recollection of discussing this matter with staff at the university at the same time as they and the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories in Melbourne were looking at the toxic effects of the blue-ringed octopus, which is another marine creature with serious effects found in Queensland. The Institute of Marine Science has been concentrating its work on other projects. It has been looking at tropical marine food webs in a variety of areas and at reef building organisms on the Great Barrier Reef in the honourable senator's State. It has been giving a great deal of attention to marine tropical pollution. The honourable senator will recognise that a specific item such as the box jellyfish requires fairly intensive investigation. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Institute of Marine Science has not at the present time the level of staff that it should have. When the Institute was originally set up by a former coalition government it was intended that it would have a staff of about 1 13. It has little in excess of 70 staff at the moment and for reasons of restriction on finance and restriction on staff it has not been able to conduct all the research that it would wish. Of course, it has scores of years of research in front of it. Investigation into a matter such as the honourable senator mentions requires specialist attention by a particular type of scientist. I know that in part of the program that the AIMS has in introducing overseas scientists for specified tasks it has been unable to find anyone who has shown a particular interest in investigating the box jellyfish. </para>

            <para>- I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs a question. Is it a fact that the rate of appearances of Aboriginal youths before the juvenile justice system in South Australia between 1972 and 1977 was five times the rate for all youths in that State? Specifically, it is a fact that 440 out of each 1,000 Aboriginal youths in South Australia- that is, 44 per cent of all Aboriginal youths aged between 10 and 17 years- have appeared before the juvenile court system? Is the incidence changing and, if so, what evidence exists to demonstrate this change? What positive intervention is being undertaken to overcome the problem, which is probably Australia-wide rather than limited to the State which I have used for illustrative purposes in this question? </para>

            <para>- I have some information on this matter that was provided a day or two ago by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. It is not precisely the information required by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume.</inline> The information that I have is that in this Budget some $325,000 has been set aside for projects to upgrade the serices available to Aboriginal juveniles. These funds are additional to the ongoing expenditure on welfare of $2.089m of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. I understand that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has taken a number of measures to reduce the level of delinquency among Aboriginal juveniles. He convened a national symposium on the care of Aboriginal juveniles in State corrective institutions which took place on 30 May and 1 June of last year. Subsequently the Minister agreed to a recommendation made at this symposium that regional conferences on the topic of Aboriginal juvenile delinquency should be convened in each State with representatives from Aboriginal organisations, the relevant State authorities and any other bodies. I understand that arrangements for these regional conferences are nearing completion and that these conferences will consider draft policy guidelines on measures to improve the situation of Aboriginal juveniles and provide an exchange of views and ideas on any other necessary action. I will look at the question that was raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume</inline> to see whether what I have been able to advise him covers all the points raised. If not, I will advise him accordingly. </para>

          <para>I do not think I can answer directly the question relating to the two waterways about which the honourable senator asked. He may know that I have stated previously that research into carp is not something which comes within my province as Minister for Science. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation does not do any work on this matter. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Knight,</inline> a senator for the Australian Capital Territory, who has an enormous interest in this matter of the effects of carp in Lake Burley Griffin, has discussed this matter with me on many occasions in my capacity as Minister representing the Minister for the Capital Territory. He has been one of the very active senators who have sought to find a solution to the problem of the effects of carp. All I can say is that in view of the very detailed answer which I have to such a question and in case I incur the wrath of honourable senators in giving it, the Senate may allow me to incorporate the answer in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline></para>

For example, the report of the House of Representatives Select Committee on Specific Learning Difficulties in Children and Adults has received very close attention by my Department and other agencies in the portfolio, such as the Education Research and Development Committee. In particular, the study of the Australian Council for Educational Research on literacy and numeracy in Australian schools identified the extent of mastery of literacy in Australian 10- year-old and 14-year-old children. I have responded on this matter to the Senate in the past. This study has had the effect of increasing the awareness of State education authorities of the extent of the problem. They are taking their own action in an area which is their responsibility. The Commonwealth is in consultation with them. The Schools Commission, however, has also set up the Special Education Advisory Group. During 1978 the Commission intends to conduct a national survey which will enable it to make recommendations on provisions for children with learning difficulties. </para>
          <para>Another very relevant initiative is, of course, the first teacher education inquiry which was established in June this year. Among the specific terms of reference, that committee is asked to address itself to the extent and effectiveness of various forms of teaching practice and training in early detection, diagnosis and remediation of learning difficulties and handicaps. An interdepartmental working party on adult literacy is being convened by my Department. It has the participation of a wide range of departments. Concern for the welfare of migrant groups led the Government to commission the Review of Post-arrival Programs and Services to Migrants under the chairmanship of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Frank</inline> Galbally. The proposals contained in the report have been accepted by Government. Included in the $6. 5m provided in the Budget are funds for adult and child migrant education programs which will help to improve the literacy rates. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations. It more particularly concerns <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> because it refers to staff ceilings, with which he is familiar, and in particular the position in respect of the Australian Telecommunications Commission and the Australian National Railways Commission. The Minister will know the great difficulties presented to young people in seeking employment in ordinary occupations but, in particular, in apprenticeships. I put it to the Minister that despite the many support schemes which the Government is presently either proposing or endorsing, such as the Commonwealth Rebate for Apprenticeship Full-time Training Scheme, the Community Youth Support Scheme and the National Employment and Training Scheme, government or ministeral policies and instructions, particularly to the Australian National Railways and Telecom in respect of staffing, are prohibiting the employment of young people, especially apprentices. I ask whether the Ministers concerned would be good enough to examine the position to see to what extent financial or staff ceiling restraints might be lifted to allow more young people to be employed. </para>

I recall <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop's</inline> long interest in this matter and the many questions which he asked me last year on the same subject when in this chamber I represented <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Street</inline> who was then responsible for Public Service matters. I answered those questions as the Minister representing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Street.</inline> At that time there were directives to the Public Service Board that despite staff ceilings the Board should have regard to recruiting young people for training. That was some dme ago and I am interested in what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> has said about other instructions which seem to be in contradiction of the earlier instruction. I certainly will seek information on the latest instructions and pass the question on to the various appropriate Ministers, one of whom will be the Minister for Post and Telecommunications. </para>

            <para>- The honourable senator referred both to the Commonwealth Government's <inline font-style="italic">Style Manual</inline> and to the latest edition of the <inline font-style="italic">Concise Oxford Dictionary.</inline> I am glad to see that in the first and subsequent editions of the <inline font-style="italic">Style Manual</inline> advice is given that the word 'Aboriginal' and its derivatives should be dignified with a capital letter, in the same way as Maori, Negro and Red Indian, when referring to the Aboriginal inhabitants of Australia. I am pleased to note that while it was not common practice in 1966 when the manual first appeared, the use of an initial capital is now accepted not only in government publications but also very widely in the Press and in other publications. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I draw the honourable senator's attention to the entry in the <inline font-style="italic">Concise Oxford Dictionary</inline> immediately preceding the one to which he refers in which under 'aboriginal' the example is given of 'Australian Aboriginals' with an initial capital. I understand that the <inline font-style="italic">Style Manual</inline> committee gave the matter careful consideration before deciding originally to advise using the singular 'Aboriginal' and the plural 'Aboriginals'. Eminent authorities including the <inline font-style="italic">Oxford Dictionary</inline> and Fowler's <inline font-style="italic">Modern English Usage</inline> were opposed to the use of Aborigine' as the singular form. Usage changes, however, and in the second and third editions of the manual the note was added: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The form 'Aborigine' is not acceptable as an alternative to Aboriginal' for the singular noun, but 'Aborigines' may be used as an alternative plural form '. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">There is good cause for encouraging uniformity, at least in official papers. The use of 'Aboriginal ' and 'Aboriginals' is comparable with the use of the abjectival form 'Indian' as the noun also. I know that some people prefer the forms 'Aborigine' and 'Aborigines'. The honourable senator may wish to make representations for a change in the <inline font-style="italic">Style Manual</inline> through my colleague, the Minister for Administrative Services. If so, I feel sure that the discussions he could arouse from the comments he has made in this question would be of interest to the Committee that seeks to give the dignity to the Aborigines of Australia that we all believe signifies the unique qualities that they have. </para>

            <para>- in reply- I understand that in my absence on Tuesday debate on the Excise Amendment Bill 1978 had reached the stage where the Minister was to reply to the second reading debate. First of all, I must apologise to the Senate for my absence during the whole of the second reading debate on the Bill in the Senate. That was due to the fact that I had a long standing engagement to host a reception in Sydney to the International Bar Association. I am sure that honourable senators would understand that welcoming on behalf of the Government of Australia the large number of distinguished guests who were attending the conference of the Association was an appropriate reason for my being absent from the Senate. </para>

              <para>- Thank you, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator. However,</inline> I have ensured that I have been informed of the major matters which were raised by honourable senators in the course of the debate on this measure. I propose to make some comment on some of the major points. If any honourable senators feel that I have overlooked a matter no doubt they will have the opportunity of raising it during the Committee stage of the Bill. </para>

          <para>At the outset of my remarks, I emphasise that the prime objective of this Bill, which is associated with a levy and is a vital component of the imposition of that levy, is to raise revenue in the light of the need of the Government to obtain a major source of revenue for purposes of the Budget for the present financial year. The additional levy that is to be imposed, or that in fact has been imposed- I will deal with that point later because there seems to be some misapprehension about it- is designed to raise an additional $676m this financial year. If we take into consideration the money raised by the levy as it was before this additional levy was imposed, which was running in excess of $300m this year, as a result of the imposition of this additional levy over $ 1,000m is at stake. So, obviously, this levy is a very major component of the Budget and of the Government's budgetary policy. </para>
          <para>That budgetary policy has been designed to further the campaign of the Government, which it has followed since it was elected to office, to fight inflation and significantly to reduce the rate of inflation in this country. Of course, the rate of inflation skyrocketed during the years of the Labor Administration. </para>
          <para>One of the major strategies of the Government has been to reduce the deficit which it inherited. Therefore, when the Government came to make the final decisions in relation to this Budget it felt that it was enormously important to ensure that that process of reducing the deficit should be continued and that it was vitally important that progress in that area should be continued and should be seen to be being achieved. From the debate on the Budget, it is now well known that in this Budget we have budgeted for a deficit of some $2.8 billion, which will represent a reduction of the deficit. In fact, a reduction of the deficit occurred last year and, indeed, occurred in the previous year. </para>
          <para>Therefore, because of the problems that the Government was having on the revenue side, as explained by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard)</inline> in his Budget Speech- I do not propose to repeat them- it was important that, in order to achieve the necessary reduction in the deficit, the Government, bearing in mind all of its expenditure commitments, continuing and of an inbuilt nature, which I am sure the Opposition would not wish to see reduced further, found it necessary to obtain other sources of revenue. This needed to be done without increasing the otherwise inflationary pressure. The steady reduction of the deficit has been, and will continue to be, in itself a major means of reducing inflation. That is the background to this levy; that is the reason for it. I emphasise this because the debate, as I have read it, does not really indicate an understanding on the part of the Opposition as to the nature of, and the reason for the levy. </para>
          <para>It has been suggested that this levy is in some way a substitute for a resources tax. It is not. It is a tax on consumers. It is not a tax on producers. The Government had given long and earnest consideration to the question of imposing a resources tax in this area, as had been foreshadowed in the Budget Speech last year by </para>
          <para class="block">
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch,</inline>but in the end the Government came to the conclusion that, for reasons which were stated by the Minister for Trade and Resources <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> in announcing the decision on 2 July, such a tax would be undesirable. Briefly it was because the Government, unlike the Opposition with its record in this matter, was deeply concerned about the effect that a resources tax would have on investment, particularly in the major areas of exploration and development, which are so important to the economic recovery in this country. </para>

              <para>- I know that honourable senators opposite simply do not understand the situation. I am wasting my breath arguing it. It is not particularly relevant to this debate. I mention it only because the matter of the resources tax was raised by certain senators, and I am explaining that this measure is not being put forward as a substitute for that tax, with which the Government has decided not to proceed. </para>
            </talk.start>

          <para>This Bill is supplementary to the levy which has been imposed. The levy itself was imposed by Excise Tariffproposals (No. 3) which were introduced in the House of Representatives on Budget night. Those proposals enable the Government to collect the increased excise duty of $64.53 per kilolitre on crude oil produced in Australia as from Budget night. The collections are made legally until enacting legislation is passed in the Parliament. A Bill is commonly introduced towards the end of each session to validate tariff proposals. The relevant Bill will be coming forward in due course. The purpose of this Bill is to ensure that the rate of excise duty on crude oil which already is priced at import parity does not attract this increased levy. The Bill provides, in effect, for a simultaneous rebate at the time of the duty payments so that the net duty on import parity price remains at $ 1 8.90 per kilolitre. Non-import parity oil, of course, attracts the increased excise. As I said, the purpose of this Bill is supplementary to the imposition of the higher rate of excise which already has been imposed. </para>
          <para>I will refer to one or two other matters which have been raised by honourable senators in the debate. One was the effect of this levy on the rate of inflation. It has been suggested by some honourable senators that this levy will lead to an increase of perhaps up to one per cent in the consumer price index for the December quarter and that indeed this will flow on into other quarters. The effect of an increase in the price of petrol and other petroleum products, although increasing the costs in the community and therefore being reflected in the CPI, will be offset by other decisions in the Budget. It is not sensible, appropriate or correct to argue that, because this measure will have an adverse effect on costs and therefore on the CPI, that will be the overall effect. The Budget has to be looked at as a whole. </para>
          <para>Very careful consideration was given by the Government to the effect of its budgetary decisions on the CPI as a whole. The Government had firmly in its mind in framing this Budget the overall effect on the CPI. The Treasurer in his Budget Speech clearly explained that other decisions included in the Budget- I refer particularly to the abolition of the health insurance levy and the reduction in the sales tax on motor vehicles- would counterbalance any adverse effects on the CPI which undoubtedly would occur as a result of the increased costs of petroleum products. The overall effect of the Budget will not be an increase in the CPI for the December quarter. Therefore, to argue that this levy will have that effect is to ignore the Budget as a whole. This measure is part of the Budget. It is elementary, I would have thought, that the Budget has to be considered as a whole. </para>
          <para>I now turn to the only other argument which I think I need deal with in summing up. Senators Walsh, Tate and Gietzelt expressed concern about the Government's policies on energy conservation and research and the effect or application of this measure to those policies. Certainly it is true that in the Budget the Government has not predicted any downturn in the demand for petrol and petroleum products. It has not made any forecast in the Budget of such a downturn in the current year. But that would be a very short term effect. Obviously in the long term the pricing of petroleum products at what is really their true market price throughout the world must have long-term beneficial consequences in terms of the efficiency of the use of energy by the community and the rationalisation of the use of energy by the community. That will lead, therefore, to appropriate investment and commercial decisions in relation to the use of energy resources. It will also have the long-term effect of improving the efficient use of fuel in industry and I believe also by private consumers. It will also in the long term inevitably accelerate the trend towards the use of smaller cars. </para>
          <para>Although the Government is not making any immediate prediction as to a downturn in demand, the actual level of demand of course depends very much on the level of economic activity in the community at any particular time. In the Budget the Government is forecasting some increase in gross national domestic product and hopefully in the coming year we will see an increase in economic activity in the community. That inevitably would lead to a greater use of these resources. That is another reason why we should not predict an immediate downturn. But obviously in the long run the pricing of these products at their proper market value will have enormous and very great importance for the efficiency of industry and for the conservation of these resources. For all those reasons the Government indicated earlier that it was its policy to move towards import parity pricing for these products. Now in this Budget the Government has decided to accelerate that process by implementing the policy at this time. </para>
          <para>In addition to the implementation of that policy, which is a very important decision, the Government has taken other steps in relation to energy research and conservation. We have set up the National Energy Research Development and Demonstration Council. We have the National Energy Office and the National Energy Advisory Committee. These are matters on which the Government has taken very positive steps and on which it has very clear policies. It has a very clear determination to pursue these policies leading to a conservation of energy resources and particularly towards the encouragement of the exploration for and the development of new and expanded resources in this area. We have reason to hope that, because of the encouragement that the Government is prepared to give to exploration, research and development in these areas, the upturn in exploration activity of which we have already seen signs will continue. </para>
          <para class="block">This is a major plank in the Government's platform. It is vital for this nation to endeavour to find more petroleum resources. That is part and parcel of the Government's policy as well. It is not simply a question of the conservation of the resources that we have at present. </para>
          <para>This Bill is a vital pan of the Government's Budget and its Budget strategy. This strategy is being pursued and has been pursued since we came to office to reduce inflation in Australia. It is pleasing to note the continuing success that the Government is having with these policies. This was emphasised only this week by the latest figures provided by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development as to the rate of inflation in OECD countries. The Treasurer has already noted that the inflation rate in Australia in the 12 months to July 1978 was 7.9 per cent- the lowest that had been recorded in Australia since 1971-72. The latest OECD figures show that in the six months to July 1978 there was an even greater improvement and in that period Australia's inflation was running at an annual rate of 6.9 per cent. So we are getting a clear further downward movement in the rate of inflation. I believe that the Government has every reason to feel confident that under the Budget policies that trend will continue and that towards the end of this year we will see further significant reductions in the rate of inflation as a result of the firm financial policies which the Government has pursued since we have been in office. </para>
          <para>It is an encouragement to us to see how our nation's economy is standing in relation to those of our major trading partners. The table of OECD countries shows that for the six months to July 1978 the inflation rate of Australia was 6.9 per cent; the United States of America, 10.5 per cent; Japan, 5.8 per cent; France, 1 1.9 per cent; the UK, 9.3 per cent; and Canada, 12. 1 per cent. West Germany had an inflation rate of 3.3 per cent and continues with the successful policies that the West German Government has followed. These policies have been maintained in West Germany consistently for many years. They are unlike the policies that the Australian Labor Party is always talking about. The Labor Party claims an association with the social democracies of the world but the West German social democratic Government is pursuing policies similar to the ones that we have pursued in office. These policies have been valuable in keeping its rate of inflation at lower levels. We have now reduced our rate of inflation to levels which are not only becoming comparable with those of our major trading partners, apart from </para>
          <para class="block">West Germany, but which also are definitely better than most of our major trading partners. I believe that that is a signal achievement of this Government. It is one which can be achieved only by pursuing the Budget policies and strategies of which this Bill is a major component. </para>

          <para>The Minister for National Development shall, from time to time, determine, for the purposes of section ... the price that is the import parity price . . . </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">The key phrase, as far as the purpose of my question is concerned, and I assume, also <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tate's</inline> question, is the 'import parity price'. Given the references by the Minister in his reply to the second reading debate to true market prices and to the Government's intention to apply true market prices, I think this is the crucial phrase in the Bill. I guess that the Government has in mind doing something like adding to the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries posted price on crude oil the freight component, and that would be equated with the import parity price. There are, however, disturbing indications that the posted price of crude oil internationally is something like the Prices Justification Tribunal price of petrol in Australia, that is, a sort of fictional concept which has no direct application to reality. In other words, all sorts of under-the-table discounts are available at least on some occasions and from some suppliers of crude oil. I would like to know, if it is possible, the method that the Minister for National Development will use to determine what the import parity price is, given that there are substantial reasons to believe that the posted price is to some extent a fictional price or certainly is not the price which is actually paid. </para>

          <para>- Two matters have been raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tate.</inline> Firstly, on the question raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh,</inline> the Government is operating not on what is called the posted price but on the actual State sales price. I think that what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> has said is to this extent correct, in that the posted price is the price that is determined by a particular government as the price at which royalty is payable. The Government is basing its import parity price on the State sales price which presumably is the true market price. For instance, in relation to Arabian light oil, which is the basis of the formula, the posted price is $ US 13. 66 per barrel whereas the State sales price, which is the one on which we are basing the components, is $US 12.70 per barrel f.o.b. I think that is only confirming what I have already said. We are dealing with the market price. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The various components and the method by which the import parity price is calculated are pretty complicated formulae and ones with which I am not fully conversant. The details have been included in a statement made on 4 July 1978 by the Minister for National Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Newman)</inline> who fixes the price. The heading of the statement is 'Calculation of the Import Parity Price of Indigenous Crude Oil '. I think it would be more informative for the Committee if I were to incorporate the statement in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> Those honourable senators who are not familiar with the method would then have the full details available.

          <para class="block">CALCULATION OF THE IMPORT PARITY PRICE OF INDIGENOUS CRUDE OIL </para>
          <para class="block">The Minister for National Development, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Kevin</inline> Newman, announced today the details of the formula to be used in future in determining the import parity price for indigenous crude oil. </para>
          <para>The Minister referred to the statement made by the  Deputy  Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> on 16 August 1977 when announcing the Government's new crude oil pricing policy. At that time <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anthony</inline> said the import parity price would be set every 6 months by the Commonwealth Government on the basis of Arabian Light oil at the nearest refinery port, adjusted to allow for an appropriate quality differential, and that discussions would be held with the oil industry to determine the precise basis on which the calculation would be made. The Government had already taken the decision to move progressively to import parity pricing for all indigenous crude oil and producers are currently receiving the import parity price for at least some of their production. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Newman</inline>said that discussions with both oil producers and refiner/marketers had been held and that all their views had been weighed in coming to a decision. The Minister went on to say that he had now decided on the formula that would be used to calculate the import parity price and the principal components to be used in the formula will be as follows: </para>
          <para>Marker crude </para>
          <para>Arabian Light oil at the official selling price in the Persian Gulf. The rate of exchange to Australian dollars will be the Reserve Bank mid-rate. </para>
          <para>International freight calculated on the cost of shipping from the Persian Gulf to the nearest refinery port to the producing field in the largest tanker that can enter the port. </para>
          <para>Wharfage. Insurance and Loss </para>
          <para>Quality differential an allowance will be made for the comparative quality of each crude with respect to Arabian Light as a measure of its ability to meet the Australian market demand. </para>
          <para>Compensation for credit terms an allowance will be made for the difference between credit terms offered by local producers and those offered internationally. </para>
          <para>Domestic freight a deduction will be made for the average cost of domestic freight where the nearest refiners'  port  's unable to absorb all the production from a particular field. </para>
          <para>In addition to the above a special freight allowance will be given to the Moonie producers to cover the cost of actual crude deliveries to the small inland refinery situated at Roma, Queensland. </para>
          <para>The Minister indicated that the new import parity price to be effective from 1 July 1978 will be announced in the near future when the value of all the elements is known. In future the import parity price will be announced as soon after the first day of the new period as practicable. </para>

          <para>- I would like some indication from the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Durack),</inline> if possible, as to whether the average freight rate assessment component is still used in the calculation which leads to the price for imported crude oil. If that is still the case, will the Minister take note of the comments of the Royal Commission into the Petroleum Industry which indicated at page 338 that the average freight rate assessment is in no sense equivalent to the long term charter rate which is the rate which bears closest resemblance to actual market conditions. AFRA- the average freight rate assessment- is an average of monthly rates from all sorts of sources, and there is no actual relationship to long term charter entered into by say the Shell Company six years ago- I am speaking hypothetically- at the bottom of the charter market. In other words, it could bring oil to Australia in vessels chartered, say, six years ago at a very low rate but claim as part of the component in the price of the landed crude the AFRA rate, the current monthly average rate of all charter rates throughout the world. I should like to have that matter attended to, if possible. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Another problem in this area is in relation to transfer pricing. It is obviously in the interests of oil companies to move profits to havens where as little tax as possible is paid. That is a very businesslike mode of operation, lt means, of course, that a company which has several divisions throughout the world can get one division to charter a vessel at, say. $40,000 for a voyage- I am using purely hypothetical figuresand charge the Australian division of that company $80,000 as the freight component in getting the oil. A profit of $40,000 goes straight to the tax haven. These are the sorts of problems which need to be looked at when deciding on the validity of the freight component in the cost of imported crude oil. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">- Senator Tate</inline>is concerned as to the appropriateness of the freight rate component which, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Newman</inline> said, 'is calculated on the cost of shipping from the Persian Gulf to the nearest refinery port to the producing field in the largest tanker that can enter the port'. That statement is in fairly general terms. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tate</inline> is seeking to take the matter into much more detail than that. I am informed by officers present that the method of calculation is to use the average freight rate assessement  rate as modified by the world scale tanker freight rates. Criticisms of the AFRA scale were made by the Royal Commission on Petroleum in 1974-75. It is believed now that the closest independent evidence that can be obtained is, as I have said, the AFRA rate modified by the world scale tanker rates. I should emphasise, of course, that under this legislation the Minister can, at any time and in relation to any matters that he thinks fit, determine the import parity price. I understand that we have undertaken to consider the price every six months. If there is any evidence to indicate that the particular way in which we are proceeding to calculate the freight component of the import parity price at the moment is deficient, the Minister has the power to rectify it at any time. </para>

          <para>- I wish to follow <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tate's</inline> line of questioning. I am willing to accept the good intentions of the Government and the Minister to establish a true market price, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tate</inline> 's question has drawn attention to some of the complexities involved in establishing this price and to what some people would consider to be the impossibility of establishing with certainty what the real commercial price is. That leads me to ask the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Durack)</inline> whether the Government has any policy on the importation of refined petroleum products. I shall give a hypothetical example. Let us suppose that the import parity price was above the true market price but because of all the complications involved the Minister and the Government had not been able to establish this with any certainty. We would then expect that independent operators, such as XL Petroleum Pty Ltd, importing refined petroleum products would be able to undercut Australian refined petroleum products produced from crude oil fed in at prices above the true commercial price. One market mechanism which ought to help to ensure that the import parity price is, in fact, the real price would be to allow independent operators to import refined petroleum products. Has the Government considered this matter? What will be its attitude towards importing refined petroleum products after all these new arrangements have become operative? </para>

          <para>- I am advised that the Government has given consideration to the very important question which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> has raised. Its investigations at this stage indicate that the pricing mechanism which it is adopting means that it would not be cheaper to import refined products and that selling prices would not be lower than the prices at which Australian refined products could be sold in Australia under this particular formula. At this stage, under the present methods proposed, the problem posed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> would not eventuate. I cannot take the matter any further than that. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> raised a hypothetical question. If the problem arose, naturally the Government would have to look at the matter again. </para>

          <para>- If the Government is convinced that the pricing arrangements would not give imported refined petroleum products any price advantage over Australian refined products- if that were so the problem would not arise, as the Minister said- can we assume that at least at this stage the Government would have no objection to the importing of refined petroleum products? </para>

          <para>- I do not think I can give any undertaking in relation to this matter. As I said, it is a hypothetical question at this stage. Certainly any such importers would have to take an allocation of indigenous crude. That is a most important aspect. Nevertheless, this matter is hypothetical. I am not prepared to give any undertakings as to what the Government's policy might be in relation to the pricing formula. When all is said and done, we come back to the fact that the Minister has the power to determine what is the true import parity price on the market basis. That would be another alternative. Instead of allowing the importation of refined petroleum products, the Minister might well decide to change his determination of import parity price at any time. I would have thought that this would be a potent factor in giving consideration to that approach to the matter. On information available to the Government the problem is not with us at the moment; nor is it foreseen as likely to arise. Therefore, I cannot give any undertaking as to what the Government's policy would be if this event occurred. </para>

          <para>- I appreciate the Minister's difficulty in that regard but he now has raised another matter I want to follow. If I heard him correctly, he stated that any potential importer would be required to take a proportion of Australian crude. I want to check whether that will be the position. If so, why should an importer be required to take a proportion of Australian crude, given that it will now be priced at world parity? Would this not have the effect of freezing out of the market any importer who did not have refining facilities within Australia or an arrangement with some other company which did have refining facilities within Australia? </para>

          <para>-I strongly support the point that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> has raised. I was under the impression that in order to get an allocation of Australian crude a company had to take up an allocation of overseas crude. That has been the past experience. It seems that there has been some change, and 1 ask: What is the change? The question that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> has asked is important to the industry because if this move freezes out the importation of refined products, some companies will be at a further disadvantage compared with the major oil companies in Australia that have entered the market in a substantial way and are discounting in a very aggressive mannerperhaps we could almost say, discounting in an unfair manner. It may lead even to the closing down of what we term Australian-owned companies under the pressure of discounting by the major overseas-owned companies, such as Shell Co. of Australia Ltd and British Petroleum Co. of Australia Limited. I would like to be assured of the ability of the small operator, and perhaps an independent operator, to continue operating. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sykes</inline> is or was an independent and he has indicated that this new policy will allow the independents to come back into the field and to import products. The Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Durack)</inline> seems to be indicating, and this has led to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> pressing his question, that this will not be the case. Refined products purchased overseas are protected by dumping laws. I take it that we will not allow the dumping of refined spirit on the Australian market, although I do not know how it can be avoided because already there is dumping of the product on the Australian market in such a way that many people are being hurt. I support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> 's questioning and if the Minister, who is not directly responsible for this matter, is not certain of his ground perhaps he could get the information for us from the Minister who has direct responsibility. </para>

          <para>-Has not the quota system for indigenous crude applied since it was first introduced by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gorton</inline> when he was Prime Minister? Virtually what has happened is that there has been a reversal of the position held by imported crude. At one stage Australian crude was dearer than imported crude but as time has gone on the position has reversed and Australian crude has become cheaper. Once there was a problem in trying to use Australian crude. Today there are benefits in doing so because the users are getting a cheaper crude. As I understand it, this system has continued since it was introduced by John Gorton when he was Prime Minister. I ask also whether this system has created any problems for small independent companies. My understanding is that it has not. In fact, some small companies have been able to do some exporting of refined spirit. </para>

          <para>- That being the case, the would-be importer of refined petroleum products would be required to take an allocation of Australian crude. I want to place on the record that if that is so there is then no market mechanism to keep the pricing honest. There would be no market mechanism to prevent import parity pricing being written up above the true commercial price and consequently Australian consumers would be overcharged in terms of true world parity for petroleum products produced from both domestic crude and imported crude. There would be no market mechanism to prevent them from being overcharged for both. The only protection would be the ability of the Minister and the Government to determine what is in fact world parity price. </para>

            <para>- In <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh's</inline> eyes there may not be a perfect market mechanism. He is such a great market economist I do not know why he sits on the Opposition benches and has not joined the Liberal Party. I would have thought that some of the fervent views he expresses on the market economy are more akin to our philosophy. I have stated the Government's intentions. The Government has entered into agreements relating to the use of Australian produced oil which will have a very beneficial effect on Australia. These agreements are operative until 1980. Although perhaps without exactitude, the Government has ways and means of determining the international market price and this is the objective of the exercise. As I have said, the Minister has the power to vary his determination from time to time. I assume that that is the way in which he would proceed. </para>

            <para>- So a company needs an allocation or substantial sales in order to get an Australian allocation. Having got that Australian allocation the company is required to import a certain amount of crude from overseas? Has the situation not changed? Let us suppose that I, as an independent, desired to import or buy crude. It is now not a disadvantage for me to buy overseas crude because the price is the same. Parity has been established. So I go overseas to purchase substantial amounts of crude. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack</inline> is now saying that, having done that, I am required to take up an allocation.

            <para>-We should not be engaging in this type of debate, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chairman,</inline> but it is as to our entitlement. The reason I am asking these questions is that there was a faint hope that the dislocation in the market place caused by wholesale discounting by major companies was likely to end because of the new policy that we are discussing. Apparently, that is not the case. So the discounting that exists at present will continue to operate in the manner that it has been operating to the disadvantage of so many Australians. </para>

          <para>- I thought that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> was concerned about a logical difficulty arising out of something I had said, namely, that one has to have sales before one can get an allocation and so on. I am advised that one can import crude and sell it. The allocation is based on sales. However, one has up to six months in which to determine sales before being required to take the allocation. I think that probably overcomes the problem that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> saw arising. I can understand the honourable senator's concern. What will happen to discounting as a result of these policies is something that we will see when the scheme is in operation. There may be greater difficulties in the path of the discounter- I do not know. We will just have to see what happens. </para>

          <para>- The remarks of the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Durack)</inline> have now thrown a great deal of doubt on the Bill. It is quite apparent from what he has said that the Government has not made any analysis of the results this Bill will have. He has just said that we will have to wait and see what will happen with the discounters after the Bill becomes operative. He said that we will probably have to wait six months. There is a great deal of concern amongst users of the refined product, particularly amongst primary producers. They get a cut rate for the refined product by buying in bulk; yet, in the metropolitan area it is possible to buy super grade fuel from discounters at a cheaper rate. There is a difference of 9c to 10c a litre in price between Adelaide and the country areas. We were led to believe that it was the Government's policy not to have a difference of more than 2c a litre in fuel prices. That is not so. There is a difference of anything up to 40c a gallon. In answer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> the Minister said that the allocation of Australian crude oil is based on sales. All retail sales outlets are one-brand service stations. Yet in the metropolitan area of Adelaide super grade fuel can be bought at 16.2c a litre. </para>

Is the retailer losing his profit or is the fuel company subsidising him behind the scenes? That is what I would like to know. Can the Minister answer that? What check can the Government make on this cut-price petrol that the fuel companies are selling through their onebrand outlets? I have seen super grade petrol at 16.2c; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elstob</inline> has seen it at 15.9c. Yet the same brand in other outlets costs over 20c. Who is subsidising whom?

            <para>- I do not know where we are. We are getting into a debate about whether there ought to be orderly marketing in the petrol industry. This Bill has nothing to do with the subject at all. This is a revenue raising Bill for the purpose of the Government's Budget. That is what the debate is about and these other issues are quite different. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> dealt with the policy about equalisation of prices and the freight subsidy scheme which was introduced some months ago. That still pertains. Even if the price of petrol goes up, as it undoubtedly has gone up and will go up in the future, as a result of this measure, the same differential should still be available under that equalisation scheme. The fact that there might have been discounting in cities has nothing to do with this measure. </para>

The Minister has said on more than one occasion in the Committee stage of this Bill that the world parity price, as well as being a revenue raising measure, was designed to encourage further oil exploration in this country. What he has said is on record. The Minister now says that there are signs that there is increased oil exploration. </para>

Minimum exploration commitments over the next five years total in excess of $400m. Interest is centred especially on the Exmouth plateau off the coast of Western Australia of which probably <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren,</inline> with his insular attitude, has never heard. </para>

          <para>- Still on the matter of import parity pricing, I want to make it quite clear that my questions about potential importers referred to importers of refined petrol. I want reassurance that that was accurately understood. If it was and if the situation is that a potential importer of petrol would have to take an allocation of Australian crude oil, does the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Durack)</inline> agree that unless such a potential importer could arrange to have that Australian crude oil refined in Australia by one of the few companies that have refining facilities it would have to be exported to somewhere else, which obviously would be expensive, or it would have to be just dumped. Will these marketing arrangements not protect the oligopolistic distribution and marketing system which is controlled by those few companies which have refining facilities in Australia? If the objective of the Government's policy is to allow the market forces to operate, why will the Government not allow the market forces to operate by abolishing this obligation on potential importers of petrol to take an allocation of Australian crude oil? </para>

            <para>-Just prior to the adjournment of this debate on Tuesday evening I was speaking on the matter of human rights and had completed reading into <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> a letter from friends and relatives of political detainees in Singapore. I had mentioned earlier that I had some information relative to what I believed to be a lack of human rights in South Africa, but that I was conducting inquiries to try to establish the truth or otherwise thereof; also, that because of changing events, the information I had was some two or three months old and I wanted to bring it up to date. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I am now informed that throughout May and June of this year, at least 18 young Catholic workers were arrested in South Africa. The latest information I was able to receive by checking around, as of yesterday afternoon, indicates that many, perhaps all, of these young Catholic workers have been released. However, the people from whom I sought the information expressed the opinion that it was extremely hard to get authentic information of this nature out of a country such as South Africa. Whilst they are prepared to concede that all may have been released, they somehow feel that a number of them are still in prison. I am advised that those who have been released have not at any time been given reasons as to why they were detained and incarcerated in gaol. Furthermore, the latest information available indicates that it is suspected that persons belonging to the Young Catholic Student Movement in South Africa have also been arrested. There has been, and there continues to be, harrassment of young Catholic workers in that country. </para>
          <para>For the information of honourable senators, I will outline briefly what detention under section 6 of the Terrorism Act of South Africa means to people such as these who are picked up by the police. It means unlimited detention without trial. No information as to one's whereabouts is given to friends or relatives. There is no contact with family or friends. There is total control by police. There is no legal assistance. There is total isolation. There is torture to obtain information about friends and organisations. No information is given, as I have said, concerning why one is in prison. In short, the Terrorism Act is a means for the police to impose terror on the people. To be in such a situation means being in solitary confinement, which is a form of psychological torture, with frequent visits from an interrogator, who is the only link with the human race. </para>
          <para>Those who have already been in prison in South Africa have given the following details: For three days one is prevented from sleeping. The electricity is on day and night. Then one is locked in a room with no lights. There are beatings and other forms of punishment. Meals consist of the following: Breakfast, soft porridge; lunch, boiled corn; supper, a light soup. I do not want to say much more about the matter, but I relate those facts because I believe, as I said on Tuesday, when I began to discuss this matter, a one-sided approach has been taken by this Parliament, and perhaps by many people in this nation who seem to believe that there is a lack of human rights in only one country of the world. Recent reports- as late as yesterday in the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times- refer</inline> to trials in South Africa in which it has been alleged that prisoners have been chained and beaten. There are further reports that 10 associates of Steve Biko have been picked up; that others have fled the country as, I am given to understand, is the case with a number of young Catholic workers. Young people have been forced into hiding, or into fleeing the country. </para>
          <para>It does seem a pity that the sub-committee of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence was not given a wider reference in relation to human rights than the single reference of human rights in the Soviet Union. It is a world-wide problem. It seems to me that, as a nation and as a Parliament, we tend to be very moralistic about it when it happens thousands and thousands of miles away from home; but when it happens on our doorstep, as it has been happening over the last three years in Timor, we act, as I have said already in this Parliament, like a nation of dingoes and do nothing about it. It is happening right around the world. It is happening in Indonesia, Timor, West Irian or Irian Jaya, right on our border. We say nothing; we acquiesce. It is alright to protest when it happens 12,000 or 15,000 miles from home. </para>

            <para>- I support the Pig Slaughter Levy Amendment Bill 1978 and commend the indus.iry upon the action it has taken in bringing about an increase in levy fees, which will stimulate research and promotion within the country and no doubt assist exports. It was very interesting to note from the second reading speech in another place of the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> that within the industry various committees, such as the Pig Industry Research Committee and the Pigmeat Promotion Advisory Committee, refer to the Minister requests for increased levies before they are submitted to the Governor-General. I believe this is a very healthy sign: The industry itself is prepared, without government assistance, to increase the levy in order to improve techniques in the production of pigmeat and in the promotion of sales of such meat. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>This is one of those unusual measures upon the first reading of which, in the Senate, we can refer to various matters. It is my intention to speak briefly on matters associated with animals other than pigs. I turn to the beef industry, to discuss briefly the situation concerning bluetongue which, although it is a disease that affects sheep and not beef, has had an enormous effect on that industry. It is the beef industry of Australia that has had to suffer the effects of the calamity that has occurred. I say calamity because the disease of bluetongue has not been found in Australia. Only the virus has been found. Yet, to all intents and purposes, that news has been received by the nations that import beef and livestock from Australia in such a way that they are acting as if the disease itself has been found in Australia. I emphasise, not a disease but a virus has been found. </para>
          <para>To go back over the last year or so, since the finding in the Northern Territory by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation of the bluetongue virus known as serotype 20 in a group of insects collected there, various steps, which I shall outline, have been taken. It is mainly the Northern Territory that has been affected. I say 'mainly the Northern Territory' because I recognise that the disease has had a severe effect in the north of Queensland. In the Northern Territory an endemic area was proclaimed in which absolutely no movement of cattle was allowed. Two other areas of the Northern Territory were affected to a lesser extent and movement was allowed to a greater degree. As I have indicated in the Senate before, at the time of the outbreak the live beef market in various neighbour countries to our north was rapidly increasing. The market collapsed overnight. In some areas there has been a slight easing. In the main areas of export, such as Kong Kong, whose large neighbour, </para>
          <para class="block">China, is alongside it, there has been no easing of the situation. A very healthy export industry, which as I said before was developing rapidly, was cut off overnight. </para>
          <para>The producers were so concerned that at least two big delegations came to visit the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> at Parliament House, Canberra, late last year and this year. They asked for various things, such as full compensation for mustering, holding, handling and other costs involved in bluetongue testing for control or for movement of stock; the full market price for animals slaughtered because of bluetongue infection, including valuable stud cattle; carry-on finance at no interest and a moratorium on Commonwealth Development Bank loans, primary producer board loans and all other government loans; and the remittance of lease rentals until the industry is re-established and an extension of eligibility for carry-on finance to all affected properties. These were reasonable requests- and still are, in many respects. </para>
          <para>The beef industry has been in an extremely poor condition. This has been brought about by distance from markets, poor returns and so on. When bluetongue first hit the industry, the industry was practically on its knees. In fact, the Government, because of these various representations to it, saw fit to make certain moves. Honourable senators will recall that on 1 7 May 1978 the Government announced, subject to agreement by the States to share costs on a dollar for dollar basis, an aid program which would include payment at the rate of $3 per head of cattle to offset mustering costs incurred in bluetongue virus control and for movement of stock in the control areas in north Queensland, the Northern Territory and the Kimberleys. A maximum payment of $3,000 per property was proposed for mustering during the period 1 January 1978 to 31 December 1978. Also, payments were to be made to producers to compensate for the cost of blood testing of cattle, at the rate of $5 per head for survey and surveillance testing and $10 per test for movement testing for export. The payments were available to all producers required to test both within and without the control areas. Payments were to be made for all tests conducted to the end of 1978, including those undertaken since the commencement of the bluetongue incident in October 1977. It was mentioned also that a grant of $225,000 would be made for the urgent acquisition of virology laboratory equipment. Western Australia was allocated $50,000. Queensland $75,000 and the Northern Territory $100,000. A laboratory is now part of the new Northern Territory Government's works program for this financial year. </para>
          <para>I have taken this opportunity to outline the problems that have been experienced and the aid that has been given by the Government. As the delegations have said to the Government, the advent of the bluetongue endemic area meant that about 1 50,000 square miles of cattle country will go practically out of production; assets worth over $500,000 will become worthless and exports worth about $10m a year will be lost to Australia; and 25 years of valuable and costly government experimental work on pastures and cattle in the Top End will go for nothing. Since the outbreak of bluetongue various moves have been taken. Further research is being done. I have here a statement by the Minister for Science <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Webster)</inline> on further bluetongue research. I have discussed the incorporation of the statement with the Minister and have shown a copy of it to the Opposition. I seek leave to have the statement incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline></para>

              <para>- This information statement is of considerable interest. The statement indicates that CSIRO scientists have evidence that at least two insect species found in Australia are capable of transmitting the virus. Perhaps that has not been said before. Perhaps one of the species was the one that was found in New South Wales in the last few months. However, at least work is taking place. Unfortunately, while the work is taking place the cattle industry still has many problems. </para>

              <para>I) Bluetongue control areas were introduced following the discovery of a bluetongue virus ( serotype 20 ) in northern Australia in October 1977. The Australian Agricultural Council has continually reviewed the original restrictions and the present movement centre's arc as follows: cattle from properties with no evidence of active or recent infection can move out of the bluetongue control areas without further testing. This applies to slaughter, breeding and store cattle. cattle from properties with evidence of recent or active infection are required to satisfy further conditions before movement. Slaughter cattle may be consigned for slaughter within 14 days of leaving the control area either to a sale or direct to an abattoir without further testing. Breeders and store cattle must be further blood tested before movement and only cattle negative to this test will be allowed to move to a suitable location in the control area for a further retest after 14 days. Cattle positive to this second test must be removed for direct slaughter or returned to the property of origin. Cattle negative to the second test may move out of control areas. </para>

              <para>- I have had the question and answer incorporated in order to save time and to indicate to the industry and to people who are interested in the problem of bluetongue what the actual situation is today. I draw particular attention to the problems that still exist with the sale of livestock overseas. The answer shows that many countries still have total bans on the importation of Australian live beef. Until the problem can be overcome and countries can be assured that no danger exists in importing cattle livestock from Australia for killing, the beef industry in Australia and particularly in the Northern Territory will remain in considerable trouble. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>However, this is not quite the case in the Northern Territory, which has made some step forward. The new Minister for Industrial Development. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Roger</inline> Steele, announced in July last that the Territory Government had agreed to new bluetongue zoning proposals which would free a large number of stations from movement controls on cattle. The scheme, which has been agreed to by the various States, will replace the present restricted zone that has applied for the past eight months with a two-zone system. The Minister made various comments regarding this situation. He said that the scheme represented a major breakthrough for Territory producers and would mean that at least 20 more properties would be able to move cattle without restriction. I am now referring to the Australian scene, not to overseas movements. The proposed free zone would consist of the Alice Springs district, most of the Barkly district and the southern Victoria River districts which run into many hundreds of thousands of square miles. In the proposed control area any property which was free or showed signs of serological evidence only in older cattle there would be no restriction on movements. On properties in the control zone where young cattle showed virus activity two specific tests would be required 14 days apart before movement would be allowed. As I have indicated, he also stresses that the proposed controls are only within Australia and that the existing export restrictions outlined in the paper I have had incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> still remain. </para>
          <para>Naturally the people in the primary industries in the outback of the Northern Territory are extremely concerned. As an indication I read one or two excerpts from a letter written by a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Moore</inline> who is recognised as a leading cattleman in the Top End of the Northern Territory. He is general manager of a place called Mount Bundey which is one of the W. R. Grace Australia Ltd properties. He was referring to the legislation that was passed in the Federal Houses of Parliament a little while ago relating to the financial assistance that would be given to the producers affected by the bluetongue virus controls. I believe that letters such as this warrant airing. The writer is a commonsense, stable cattleman. Without any emotion or hysterics he outlines the situation. He recognises the value and worth of government assistance and he makes suggestions that could possibly assist the industry and bring about a more satisfactory solution. He said:. </para>
          <para>The Bill itself is very general, however, no doubt regulations  wili  be drafted shortly and then we can get a better feel for the impact on producers. I have talked to a number of Top End cattlemen and without question, the S3 per head and S5 per head payments will be very well received. </para>
          <para>So far as the $10 per head for movement testing is concerned, this will prove of great assistance, although, there seems to be some question as to how widely this will be applied. My understanding is that the $10 per head will apply only to those animals which pass negative to the test and are actually moved or exported. This does not help a producer with the animals which pass positive and which thus must be retained on the property as a possible future source of infection, or else sent to the local abattoir probably at distress prices. </para>

            <para>Heavy bullocks probably won't present that much of a problem as the abattoirs are paying reasonably well for this class of animal.

            <para>I cannot help but feel that a more satisfactory solution would be to encourage producers to send all positive 's to the abattoir (irrespective of weight) immediately following testing and this could be done by making even these animals eligible for the $10 per head. I know there is possibility of abuse, however, if at the time of drafting (which is done under Stock Inspector supervision), all positive's were marked and loaded out direct to the Works, this would overcome much of the problem. </para>

For many years now there have been very many discussions about the value of feral animals to Australia. Also there has been a great deal of talk about the damage that feral animals cause in Australia. In fact a question was asked yesterday by a senator from Queensland about a feral animal. I think that person wanted that particular feral animalthe cat- to be saved. He thought that we should pussy-foot around with the cat and treat it very gently. </para>

              <para>- It would be a catastrophe. I agree with the honourable senator. That particular feral animal is a catastrophe for Australia now. The domestic cat that has gone wild has become a very fearsome and ferocious animal throughout Australia. I do not think we fully recognise the damage that it is doing to the small bird life and the animal life- the lizards and so on and all those other small animal citizens- of Australia. I believe that the cat has already removed some species and that many others are endangered by this animal which has the hunting instincts of a tiger. I suggest that rather than being looked upon as a gentle animal that should be retained, this animal should be hunted and exterminated and a bounty put on its head wherever possible. We see this happen in Fiji. Anybody who has been to Fiji will have seen the absolute consternation that occurs in the islands if the residents find that a cat is loose on their land. I was with the people on a particular island one day when it was discovered that a cat was loose. Practically the whole community turned out to hunt it down because they realised the dangers of that animal. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>However, I was discussing the feral animal inquiry board. This board now for the first time- I do not know whether it has happened anywhere else- is looking at the question of the future of feral animals in this part of Australia. I applaud the fact that the board has been established and has its terms of reference and is now working. Many questions have to be asked and answered as to the future of various animals that are looked upon as being in varying degrees either a pest or of some commercial value to Australia. I refer to various animals such as the dingo that are being investigated now. We know that for 10 or 20 years the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation has carried out research in the outback on the dingo. If I remember correctly part of that research was financed by sections of the cattle industry. Substantial subsidies were given to the CSIRO to carry out that work. As those payments have ceased, the research work has been discontinued. I think that that is unfortunate as those who were carrying out this research work on the dingo were really getting down to an understanding of the basics of this animal. If further research had been carried out, the findings would have been of extreme interest to Australia. </para>
          <para>I mention next the buffalo. Exports of buffalo meat have been worth millions of dollars to Australia. Buffalo meat has been used for human or animal consumption. Our trade with Germany benefited by $2m to $3m a year through buffalo meat exports. For various reasons concerned with interpretations as to the classification of the type of meat that it was, that export trade in buffalo meat was lost. This loss was very costly. The future of the buffalo is a controversial matter. Should it be removed, hunted out, exterminated completely or allowed to remain. I will not pre-empt or forecast what the board may decide but I must say that the domesticated buffalo has a commercial value to the Northern Territory and thus to Australia. It will continue to carry disease, as it does now, while it runs wild. The future improvement, control and stabilisation of the beef industry in the north of Aus.traslia depend upon the control and domestication of such animals as the buffalo. </para>
          <para>In this context, I refer to the pig, which is the subject of the Bill now before the Senate. This animal must be viewed- no doubt it is- as another curse on Australia. As a carrier of tuberculosis and such, the pig endangers in the Top End the beef industry. As we all know, endeavours are being made to eradicate by 1984 diseases such as brucellosis and tuberculosisbrucellosis particularly- in this big industry which contains many hundreds of thousands of animals in the Northern Territory. </para>
          <para>Last but not least I mention the rabbit. The rabbit problem is one of the reasons why I have taken the time to speak on this Bill. When these days the rabbit problem is mentioned, I suppose we think of the time 10 years, 20 years or 30 years ago when Australia was absolutely ravaged by plagues of rabbits. The destruction caused to this country by rabbits was so complete that in some areas not a blade of grass was left as feed for cattle or sheep. But by various means, including diseases such as myxomatosis, the rabbit to a degree has disappeared from the rural scene in most parts of Australia. Where it has not disappeared, its numbers have been controlled. We do not see the problems caused by rabbit"; that were experienced years ago. But there remain areas in Australia that are still very much contaminated and over-run by rabbits. The creatures are leaving the country absolutely desolated. </para>
          <para>The Northern Territory has experienced good seasons for seven or eight years now. Rainfall that used to average, say, 10 inches a year, has averaged from 18 inches up to even 30 inches a year recently. The country has been rejuvenated. The comparison between the condition of that country now and its state in the drought years of the 1950s and early 1960s is absolutely amazing. Last week people close to the Northern Territory-South Australian border in the Erldunda area south of Alice Springs invited <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sam</inline> Calder, the Federal member for the Northern Territory, and me to visit their districts. We saw a botanical garden the like of which I have never seen before. Every type of wild flower and shrub was in full flower. It was a beautiful sight. Then we came across literally hundreds of square miles of desolation where the country appeared as though it was suffering drought conditions. </para>

              <para>- Yes. This area has been a breeding ground of rabbits for many years. The use of neither myxomatosis nor 1080 has eradicated the rabbit problem. Not only was the ground bare of growth but also were the trees and shrubs ringbarked. It is hard to imagine this, but rabbits in such areas not only eat from the ground but also actually climb trees. This claim is not fallacious. In areas such as this evidence can be seen where rabbits actually get into the boughs of trees in their endeavours to eat every portion of those trees. And so the trees are killed. </para>

          <para>The point I am making is that it is ridiculous in these times of good seasons that such rich country should be denuded. I wonder what can be done. There has been much discussion about the introduction of the rabbit flea. Fears about its use have been expressed. The rabbit flea is another method by which myxomatosis can be introduced into rabbit populations. People in the community have feared that the rabbit flea would infect dogs and other types of domesticated animals and bring about chaos. But, as far as I know, this view is a fallacy. My understanding is that rabbit fleas will live only on pregnant does and perhaps on young rabbits. I understand that this would have tremendous effects which would reduce the numbers of rabbits rapidly. I suggest to the Government and the Minister that they should not look upon this area as containing a problem local to the border of South Australia and the Northern Territory alone but as an area that could continue to be a source of potential danger to and contamination of many areas of Australia if it remains a breeding ground. I support the legislation. I think the pig breeders and the pig industry of Australia are to be congratulated for their efforts in bring about more research on and promotion of their product. </para>

            <para>- Debate on the first reading of a money Bill certainly ranges over a conglomeration of subjects. I take the Senate from bluetongue to black faces. I am greatly concerned that most correspondence I receive these days contains some complaint about the treatment of Aborigines and particularly the treatment by the Federal Government of the Aborigines at Aurukun and Morington Island. Today I received a letter from the Quakers Society of New South Wales asking that the Government take over that land in Queensland and whether I would declare my position on the Government 's intentions with regard to the demand for recognition of land rights of Aborigines at Aurukun and Mornington Island. I would have thought that it would be well known from my speeches in this House that I had made that declaration many times during debate on this subject. I have always tried to approach the question of Aborigines on a non-party basis, in the belief that despite what may appear to be the position at the present time there are many Government members with good intentions of trying to assist these unfortunate people who have been done a disservice in Australia. It occurs to me at this time that even the Cabinet which may be desirous of helping Aborigines may feel that it is restrained because of the legal position on the question of Aborigines. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>It is not only speakers on this side of the Senate but also people throughout the whole of the community who say that the Government has the constitutional authority to acquire land and to hand it over to the Aborigines. I often wonder- I have some doubts- whether the Government has such constitutional power. I am of the belief that the legal advisers to the Government and the Department of Aboriginal Affairs also may have some doubts as to whether the Commonwealth has the constitutional power to take over land for Aborigines. Although it is said that in the 1967 referendum the people gave this power to the Federal Government, I think it is open to legal challenge that the people of Australia did give that power to the Federal Government in that 1967 referendum. </para>
          <para>I, as a layman, am not the only person to express this doubt. Many legal authorities whom we could accept as constitutional authorities have expressed this doubt. It is a doubt that will never be resolved unless there is a challenge to the High Court. I am of the belief that the people of Australia voted in the 1967 referendum the way they did because they believed it would mean a better deal for Aborigines. About 92 per cent of the people in all electorates in Australia, including Queensland, voted to give to the Federal Government power for the purpose of bettering the welfare of Aborigines. The lowest percentage in any Federal electorate was 82 per cent. If the legal position is that the Commonwealth does not have this power the feeling is that a referendum today supported by all political parties would make sure that we do not have that power. The Government, despite any possible fears about what power it has, should act upon the basis that it believes it has the power and should acquire land on behalf of Aborigines in such a way that there would be a challenge to the High Court for the purpose of determining the actual legal position in Australia. </para>
          <para>We know that sometimes on questions of who is the authority on interpretation the High Court brings down many unusual decisions. The judgment of the Chief Justice in the Webster case was that the words meant something different from what everyone thought they meant. Although everyone today thinks that in 1967 the people gave power to the Federal Government for the control of Aborigines, is that the real position? I have some support for my doubts. I launched a book by a <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Hannah</inline> Middleton in Sydney on 30 June entitled <inline font-style="italic">But Now We Want Our Land Back.</inline> The book deals with the land rights of Aborigines. I sent a copy of the text of my speech to every legal person in the Federal Labor Party and asked them for their reactions on the legal points I had raised, I did not get a reply from them all, but of those replies that I did get the best that one could get was: 'I think the High Court may rule'. None of the legal authorities were definite. </para>
          <para>I was fortunate in the short time that I was a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs to get, without a meeting having been held, a report from Professor Colin Howard, the Dean of the Faculty of Law at the University of Melbourne on the paper he gave to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Kirby, the  Chairman  of the Law Reform Commission, on the question of Aboriginal law. I fe$! that I cannot quote from it. </para>
          <para class="block">I think that so far it is a privileged document, although it was given to the Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee with the approval of Professor Howard. Nevertheless, I have no knowledge as to whether he would permit its use in the Senate or publication. I can say only that he says that the High Court may uphold a challenge. There is nothing definite. </para>
          <para>As Minister for Aboriginal Affairs there was much legislation which one would have liked to have brought forward and which on the advice that we had could have subjected this question to a challenge in the High Court. In my time as Minister it was the last thing that we wanted. Whilst the Constitution says that we have the power to make special laws for people of a particular race- much of the legislation that I would have presented would have dealt with part Aboriginals- it was not thought by the legal profession that a part Aboriginal would be classified as a person of any particular race. It was possible that he would be classified as a person without a race. Therefore, it was considered that that sort of legislation would be declared invalid. I can see the same thing happening to the legislation that this Government has brought in. I refer to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Reserves and Communities Self-management) Bill. I was somewhat critical of the Government because it permitted the Bill to go through this Parliament in such a way that the next day the Premier of Queensland could declare a reserve not to be a reserve. So that Act could never have any application. The Government should have accepted Labor's amendment which would have meant that a reserve was declared to be a reserve on the day that the legislation was passed. The Minister's reply was that it would open up the question to legal challenge. I came back with the question of whether constitutional law could be declared to be unconstitutional because of a change in date. Some legal authorities on the other side thought that it was possible. In looking at the legislation I think that possibly they were right because the declaration of a reserve as an Aboriginal reserve as at that date was a declaration of an area of land which was Queensland Crown Land. Therefore, the authorities thought that a successful challenge was beyond our power. But, as we have found out, without passing Labor's amendment the Bill can never become operative. This means that unless we acquire land we can never solve the problems of Aurukun and Mornington Island. </para>
          <para>Since the introduction of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Viner</inline> has been handing out land titles to Aboriginal land trusts; but there is dissatisfaction in Aboriginal communities throughout the whole of Australia. They want land. Nothing will settle their grievances until they get land. There is feeling among the majority of Aborigines that they are justified in wanting the traditional land that is significant to their culture. Therefore we must introduce a land rights Bill for Aborigines throughout Australia. Even with the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act we found that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Toohey was not overgenerous in respect of Borroloola. So there is no question of the Aborigines taking valuable land. </para>
          <para>I refer now to an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser</inline> of Tuesday, 12 September. It concerns <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lanley,</inline> who is the  chairman  of Mornington Island's Gunamamanda Community Council. He was speaking at a human rights seminar in Adelaide.

          <para class="block">If anyone has witnessed the period of mourning for a dead member of a tribe and seen the bereaved people moaning for nights and simply throwing up handfuls of dirt to their faces, he must realise the significance of land to Aboriginal people. As <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lanley</inline> said, if the Aboriginals do not have land they are finished; the white people are killing them. One can see the responsibility of the government of people who have taken over this country from the people who have lived here for 30,000 years. Although it is too late to turn back the clock we must do something. Many Government members are keen to do something about this matter. Their keenness must be tested. </para>
          <para>When the Founding Fathers wrote the Constitution, under section 51 (xxvi) they gave the Commonwealth the power to make laws for the peace, order and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to the people of any race, other than the Aboriginal race in any State, for whom it is deemed necessary to make special laws. Until 1967 that was the constitutional position. We had the power to make laws for the good government of the people of any race except the Aboriginals. Quick and Garran state that this was similar to the American Constitution. The American Government wanted to make special laws for a migrant group but an American court found that it did not have the power to make separate laws; everyone was covered by the Constitution and the law had to apply to all. So that that did not happen in Australia, section 51 (xxvi) was included in the Constitution. Aboriginals were excluded because it was thought that they were entitled to the same laws and rights as Australians. It was believed that any special laws would be a restriction upon people of a special race. At that time we had Chinese men in the gold mines and Kanakas in the sugar fields in Queensland. Many of the State parliaments had restrictive laws. I believe that in my State a Chinese man could not work in a factory after 2 o'clock on Saturdays. Anyone else could do so, but at that time the Chinese could not do so because they were regarded as a threat to industrial conditions. </para>
          <para>The question arises whether those laws were necessary. Section 51 (xxvi) of the Constitution gives us power to make laws with respect to immigration and emigration. One would have thought that that provision would have covered the situation. But it was believed that some of the imported labour, such as the Kanakas in Queensland, would not have come under the classification of immigrants and, therefore, special laws were made and there was special reference in section 5 1 (xxvi) to put the question beyond doubt. It was claimed that this constitutional provision discriminated against Aborigines insofar as the same laws could not apply to them as applied to other people. Following the referendum in 1967 and despite the fact that it was fought on the ground of a better go for Aborigines, we deleted the words 'other than the aboriginal race in any State'. Now we have power to make laws for the good government of the people of any race for whom it is deemed necessary to make special laws. </para>
          <para>One legal opinion I have seen assumes that the High Court could well rule that Aborigines are not people of a special race. The intention of the Constitution is to restrict the power of the Commonwealth to make a uniform law for its citizens- that is, for Australians if that term can be denned- and another law, a separate law, for people of a particular race. The court could well uphold the view that Aborigines, who were here before us, are Australians as are Europeans who have come to this country since. I do not know what the situation is when a migrant becomes an Australian citizen. Is he a person of a particular race? How about a first, second or third generation Australian? They are some of the things that we do not know and they must be tested. </para>
          <para>If the court upheld that view, all that the 1 967 referendum did was to take out of the Constitution surplus words; the position now is as it was before the referendum. If this is so, then an appeal should be made to the people for the appropriate power. It is no use saying that the people gave the Parliament power to make laws in respect of Aboriginals in 1967; the Parliament has the power to make special laws in respect of people of a particular race. Whether that term applies to Aboriginals will have to be tested eventually. The opportunity should be made to test it now. Despite the overwhelming vote in the 1967 referendum for us to improve the conditions of Aboriginals, neither Labor nor Liberal Federal governments since have done anything for Aboriginals that could not have been done before the referendum. We have passed the Northern Territory Land Rights Bill but it could have been passed at any time after South Australia handed over the Northern Territory to the Commonwealth. We had jurisdiction over the Territory and could have brought in land rights legislation in respect of it long before 1 967. </para>
          <para>The Commonwealth has taken over the policy making, planning and co-ordination of Aboriginal affairs in each of the States other than Queensland but this was done with the consent of the States and could have been achieved without the referendum. We have brought into operation the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Discriminatory Laws) Act, introduced by the Labor Government, and have passed the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Reserves and Communities Self-Management) Bill which we could not have passed before the referendum. However, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Reserves and Communities SelfManagement) Bill can never have any application because of the power of the State Government to declare a reserve a non-reserve each time an Aboriginal community asks for the provisions of the Bill to be implemented. This is what the State Government did in the case of the Aurukun and Mornington Island communities. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Anti-Discrimination Laws) Act, although an Act we could not have passed before the referendum, ensures some protection for Aboriginals, but it is valueless because it is never policed and cannot be policed. </para>
          <para>When one group of Aboriginal road builders on a settlement struck for higher wages because they were getting only a living allowance, their employment was terminated and they had to wait six weeks for social security benefits. I wrote then to the Minister for Social Security stating that the Federal Government was penalising the citizens of Queensland who would not participate in an unlawful action agianst the Commonwealth Government. I received a reply referring to the terms and conditions of employment. The inference there is that they should have participated in an illegal act to get support from the Federal Government. That is a serious position in which a constitutionally elected government should place itself. I then wrote to the Attorney-General asking what he was doing about breaches of the Act. He wrote back saying that there were no penalty provisions in the Act and therefore he could do nothing, but that the Aboriginals had a right to claim the award rates. </para>
          <para>I wrote to the northern Queensland branch of the Australian Workers Union asking what it would do about the situation. The union said that it polices the award and that the award covered work on roads carried out by the Department of Main Roads. The work in question was being carried out by the settlement and only one of the strikers was a member of the AWU. I wrote to the Aboriginal legal aid office asking what it intended doing. It said that it had not been able to do much in this case because it had found difficulty in getting evidence. Then it said: 'Now we have the evidence and we are considering it. but we are so restricted by finance that there is very little we can do to represent a defendant. We cannot at present see that justice according to law is done to the Aboriginal people '. </para>
          <para>Although it can be of no benefit to Aboriginals, the passing of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Reserves and SelfManagement) Bill and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Discriminatory </para>
          <para class="block">Laws) Bill introduced other legal complications and it is worth considering them. I use as my authority Quick and Garran who, it has been hammered home to me since I have been in this Parliament, are the authorities on the interpretation of the Constitution. In the latest edition of their publication, <inline font-style="italic">The Annotated Constitution of the Australian Commonwealth,</inline> Quick and Garran, in dealing with people of a particular race, say: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>In the Draft Bill of 1891, this sub-section appeared as the first of a group of three subjects, with reference to which the Parliament was assigned exclusive legislative power. It is now placed in the list of powers generally described as concurrent; that is to say, the States may occupy the ground until the Federal authority interferes and displaces them. The subsection can only exclude the action of State legislation respecting 'the people of any race', when the Federal Parliament declares, by legislation, that such race is a race for whom it is deemed necessary to make special laws'. Before such legislation the State Parliaments will be free to pass laws concerning any part of their resident population, including the people of any particular race, coloured or otherwise, but as soon as the Federal Parliament by legislative intervention has shown that it has dealt with, or contemplates dealing with, the people of a particular race by special laws, the power to discriminate in respect of that race will thenceforth be exclusively vested in it and the State legislatures  Wili  be deprived of jurisdiction. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The legal personnel in the Australian Labor Party were generally of the belief after considering the replies I got that the matter would have to be covered by a Federal law because there was some contradiction between Federal law and State law and under sections of the Constitution Federal law would be supreme. That is not the opinion held by Quick and Garran. Maybe a mistake was made. Quick and Garran do not say that the State cannot continue to legislate for its citizens. They say that after the Commonwealth moves into a field any discriminatory law of the States in that field is deprived of legality. This would apply also if the Commonwealth contemplated moving into a field. <inline font-style="italic">Quick</inline> and Garran say:   . . as soon as Federal Parliament by legislative intervention has shown that it has dealt with, or contemplates dealing with - </para>
          <para class="block">Even contemplates dealing with-  the people of a particular race by special laws, the power to discriminate in respect of that race will thenceforth bc exclusively vested in it and the State legislatures will be deprived of jurisdiction. </para>
          <para class="block">The conflict arises in that, if the Quick and Garran interpretation is the right one, only discriminatory State law would have no legal effect. In 1974 the Federal Parliament showed its intention to make special laws for people of a particular race, namely, the Aborigines. If Quick and Garran are correct, no discriminatory Jaw of a State concerning Aborigines can have any effect at this time. The general law may have effect. If the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders Anti-Discriminatory (Queensland Laws) Act, under which we decided to accept Aborigines as people of a particular race, is a valid law, then the laws which Bjelke-Petersen is operating today are not valid. The laws which he is using to oppose the Federal law are not legal laws. No one will challenge the Queensland laws. The Commonwealth Government will not. I do not think it could, because it takes the attitude that it has the necessary power. It is saying this, whether it believes it on not. I think it should act. </para>
          <para>Section 5 1 (xxxi. ) provides that the Commonwealth shall have the power for 'the acquisition of property on just terms from any State or person for any purpose in respect of which the Parliament has power to make laws'. We accept that the Commonwealth Parliament has the power to make special laws for people of a particular race, the Aboriginal people. It also has the power to acquire property, as the Constitution provides very definitely. When a law is challenged, a court will not give an interpretation on anything that would lead to an absurdity. We must remember that there are no particular powers written into the Constitution to acquire property for Aboriginals. The only power is the power to legislate for people of a particular race. Aborigines are not mentioned. If section 51 (xxxi.) is interpreted as being a power to acquire property for Aboriginals, it must be a power to do the same thing for other ethnicgroups the Germans, the Italians, the Greeks and everyone else. If that was so, the Commonwealth could simply dismember and destroy a State. I do not believe that a court would ever uphold a claim that that power existed. The mischief it would create would be greater than any mischief it would solve. </para>
          <para>Whilst 1 do not think that the Australian publicwould give the Commonwealth Parliament power to acquire land for all people of a particular race, I am certain that if all parties supported an appeal to the Australian public to allow it to alter the Constitution sufficiently to let the Government legislate to give land to Aboriginal people there would be a successful result. The question is whether we have a government that is courageous enough to take whatever action is necessary. There are two ways to legislate when there is constitutional doubt. A government can either go to the people for an alteration of the Constitution or it can pass a law which would be effective until it was challenged and upset by the court and then go to the people. If there is any honesty and sincerity in the present public agitation for a return of land to the Aborigines, and if we are to recognise a sanctity of land to the Aborigines and the necessity for their continued culture and well-being, then we should do something definite about it. </para>
          <para>I make my appeal today because it is not sufficient for the Commonwealth just to say that it has the power. Let us exercise that power. The place to do that is Aurukun and Mornington Island. Everyone knows that if we acquired either Aurukun or Mornington Island there would immediately be a challenge in the High Court of Australia against the Commonwealth's action. Only by such a challenge can we get some understanding of what the Commonwealth really means and what it is all about. In this debate on the first reading of the Bill I appeal to the Government to take action to try to test the powers it has under the Constitution. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>-This first reading debate on the Pig Slaughter Levy Amendment Bill gives me the opportunity of bringing up a matter that is of concern to me. It relates to Commonwealth grants to specific organisations within the States and the amount of Commonwealth responsibility for the proper administration of these organisations. Under our federalism policy the general feeling of the Government is that the States should be responsible for the administration of the moneys that the Commonwealth gives in untied grants. Considerable untied grants are given to the States for community health programs. In the majority of cases they are on a dollar-for-dollar basis. A considerable amount of money is involved. The figure is $48. 3m for this financial year. The States set their priorities and the Commonwealth meets them on a dollar-for-dollar basis. This is fine. I believe that this is federalism at its best. However, if the Commonwealth states that it has a special commitment, I believe that that alters the whole case. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Let us look at the community health program in general. The total outlay this financial year is $48. 3m which is broken up among the States in the following way: New South Wales gets nearly $ 19.5m; Victoria nearly $14m; South Australia just over $3m; Queensland $5m; Western Australia $4m; and Tasmania nearly $2m. The States divide this money and share it out as they think fit. The priorities of the States vary quite considerably. I will not go through the whole method of how they deal with community health programs. </para>
          <para>I would like to deal with the women 's centres in the various States. New South Wales is quite committed to women's centres. Out of the community health program, it funds five women's centres. On the other hand, Victoria is not committed to women's centres and in fact does not fund any. South Australia funds one; Queensland does not fund any; Western Australia funds one; and Tasmania does not fund any. This is federalism at its best. The money is supplied from taxation and the various States put their priorities where they think fit. If the people of New South Wales look at the Leichhardt and Liverpool women's centres, for instance, and decide that that is how they want their money spent that is fair enough. If they do not want their money spent on these types of organisations, they know what to do about it; they can vote the Government out at that next election. This way they have a proper say in the organisation of their State. </para>
          <para>However, when the Commonwealth has a special commitment, as it does have in the area of women's shelters, I believe that the whole aspect changes. That is the only area in community health where the Commonwealth Government does not make just a 50:50 commitment but makes a commitment to meet 75 per cent of the costs, as opposed to the States' commitment of 25 per cent of the costs. We find that this financial year the Commonwealth, in providing 75 per cent of the money that will go to these refuges or shelters, will make a total grant of nearly $2,800,000. New South Wales will receive approximately $945,000, Victoria $574,000, Queensland $408,000, South Australia $361,000, Western Australia $337,000 and Tasmania $158,750. So the Commonwealth Government feels quite a commitment. To underline the Commonwealth's commitment under which, as I said, it meets 75 per cent of the costs of such shelters as opposed to the States meeting 25 per cent, a short time ago Queensland did not fund its shelters. As a result, because of the Commonwealth's special commitment to these shelters, it decided to fund shelters in Queensland on a direct grant basis. I believe that this underlines completely the Commonwealth's commitment in this area. With this I agree fully. </para>
          <para>What I am concerned about is the fact that if something happens in one of those shelters- if there is misconduct of any description- even though the Commonwealth says 'we have a special commitment in this area and we are willing to make a special effort in this regard ', it says we leave the administration of and the investigations into these shelters to the States. As I said, the States have a commitment to meet only 25 per cent of the costs in this area. I do not believe that that is a very large involvement. I do not believe that all the States do in fact involve themselves very much in these shelters and refuges. </para>
          <para>As you may know, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy President,</inline> at present investigations are being carried out into the shelter at Hobart. The Tasmanian Minister for Welfare is looking into allegations of improper conduct in the shelter. At first improper conduct was admitted by the staff. They said that improper conduct had occurred in the shelter and that the people responsible had been asked to leave. However, later it was reported that women from the shelter had said that the allegations were exaggerated, that there was no improper conduct and that in fact children in the shelter were not at risk. The staff admitted originally that improper conduct did take place at the shelter; now it is claimed that the situation has been exaggerated and that, after all, there was not very much substance in the allegation. To my mind that makes the shelter all the more suspect and makes my worry and concern far more - </para>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">If the State is responsible but the Department of Community Welfare in that State states that it has no regular supervisory responsibility, I can see that things are being left pretty high and dry. Nobody seems to be responsible for the shelters. The allegations that have been made against the Hobart shelter I believe point out that, the way the shelter is at the moment, it is the worst possible atmosphere to which any woman who has recently been abused could go. If she has left her home under circumstances that forced her to go to a shelter, I believe that the atmosphere of that shelter at the moment would be the worst possible atmosphere for her and her children. </para>
          <para>I have asked the Minister- and I certainly will be seeing him later- to withhold the additional grant of $22,000 that has been promised to that shelter until the investigation has been carried out. What I am querying is the fact that the Federal Government is saying that it has no responsibility in this area. It admits that it has a special commitment to this area- it has made it an area of very special commitment- yet it states that it will leave such shelters to the States to administer. I believe that this is entirely wrong. I believe that this commitment should be treated in much the same manner as the commitment to homeless persons hostels. Those hostels have been looked after by the Commonwealth Government and I believe that the Commonwealth Government should look after the shelters in the same way if it has a special commitment. </para>
          <para>I believe that the Salvation Army, St Vincent de Paul and the people in these areas who have had so much experience in running shelters and in caring for all these disadvantaged people ought to be given funding in this area. Yet which House in Hobart, which is run by the Salvation Army, has had no funding. Elim House is a women's shelter operated in exactly the same way as is the Hobart women's shelter, but the latter has received all of the funding. To date, Elim House has had no Commonwealth assistance. It has gone about its work in a quiet fashion and, according to the people who operate it, if it were funded on the same lines as the Hobart women's shelter, it could expand and take in a number of women who are requiring this service. </para>
          <para class="block">These people are experienced. The Salvation Army is respected by the whole community. How is it that it has not been approached? We seem to approach the wrong people in regard to expansion in this area. I believe that the Salvation Army ought to be asked if it will expand, if it will add to Elim House and take over the responsibility for these women, who so desperately need this service. </para>
          <para>I ask the Minister in charge of the House, the Minister for Science <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Webster),</inline> to approach the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hunt)</inline> and ask him whether the Government would fund the efforts of the Salvation Army in this regard; whether the Federal Government could take over some of the responsibility in an area to which it has said it is so financially and philosophically committed, an area to which I too am committed. If the Minister would do that I would be very grateful. I hope that the Minister for Health will be able to see his way clear to meet that request. </para>

            <para>-I do not wish to delay the House on the first reading of a money Bill, but I was provoked by the Comments of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walters</inline> on this matter, and by events which led to her making them. Women's shelters are, of course, very important. The whole program of supporting women's shelters, which was introduced by a Labor government, has been very important to the community in the last few years. I do not suppose that any program has more justified itself. How many hundreds and thousands of women and children who have got into difficulties through the problems associated with nuclear families in this country, who have become split away from the nuclear family, and who have had nowhere to go, have been helped by women's shelters in the various States. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>These shelters are run in all cases by groups of volunteers who devote to them a great deal of their time and effort, both physical and emotional. The people who have gone into these shelters have been in very difficult circumstances and have found the shelters a haven in which they can be protected. This is accepted by everyone. This has been a successful scheme, conducted and funded largely by the Commonwealth. I believe that is the way it should be. It is gratifying to hear, for the first time that 1 can remember, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walters</inline> supporting a Commonwealth scheme which involves what she calls a centralist approach to the conduct of these centres. Usually we on this side of the chamber are condemned for suggesting that the Commonwealth can run and look after national programs as well as, or better than, the States. So we have established that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walters</inline> agrees that this has been a good program, although conducted by the Commonwealth. </para>
          <para>However, there are several disturbing aspects of the matter <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walters</inline> brought up which should be aired in this place in order to get the matter into perspective. There may have been some difficulties in the Hobart women 's shelter. I certainly am not denying that. I am not in a position to question that one way or the other. Allegations about these difficulties have been made, and the State Minister for Community Welfare is conducting an investigation. Most of us who have been interested in women's shelters have been careful to keep them out of the limelight as much as possible, to keep the publicity level low. Even the siting of most of them is, for obvious reasons, kept secret. In this way the women who go there can indeed be protected and sheltered. The difficulties arose in this case because some photographs were allegedly taken at the women's shelter in Hobart- photographs allegedly showing behaviour which was not very proper in such a place. </para>

              <para>- The women who conducted the shelter admitted that something had gone on. They told me that they had corrected the difficulty that arose at the time; but that is not what 1 am talking about, senator. I am talking about the fact that allegations were made; that photographs were taken and delivered to a member of the House of Representatives, who has said that he was asked to investigate the problem, to see what was going on at this shelter. I accept that that is a proper thing to do; that it is perfectly reasonable for a member of the House of Representatives to be approached with such a proposition, and that he should therefore investigate it. The member concerned did that. He took the photographs to the Crown Law officer, notified the local Minister for Community Welfare and then, as he always does - </para>

              <para>- Another one of his colleagues made the statement that this was a disgusting shelter; that shelters should not be conducted anyhow. That is where the trouble starts. We have a Minister who is willing to investigate and does investigate. We have a Crown Law officer who investigates the problem. We have concerned people who, in a voluntary manner, have been running a shelter, who have in most cases been working day and night for no return. We have complaints about the shelter. Those complaints are taken to the local member of the House of Representatives, but what does he do? He runs and gets as much publicity and scandal out of it as he can. That is the tragedy of this situation at the Hobart shelter. </para>

          <para>I hope and I know that the State Minister will investigate this carefully. I hope and I know that he will do whatever should be done to correct any difficulties that have occurred and ensure that such difficulties do not occur in the future. I believe that is as it should be. It would have been just as appropriate for this shelter, having been funded by the Federal Government, to have been under its control. In those circumstances it would have been appropriate for the Federal Minister to conduct an investigation. It is always appropriate for members of the House of Representatives, and for senators, to be approached on difficulties such as this, and to take them to the relevant authorities and have them investigated. I think it is utterly wrong for members of the House of Representatives, or senators, for their own cheap political gain to run to the Press with stories of scandalous photographs, and condemnatory statements about people who, in good faith, have been conducting shelters. This is the first time I have spoken on this subject and I have known about it for weeks. It is the first time that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walters</inline> has spoken about it, to my knowledge, other than by way of a minor comment. She too has known about it for some time. Members of both sides of Parliament, Liberal and Labor, Federal and State, have known about it for some time, but only two Federal members have carried on in this way, to obtain publicity. One State member yesterday stacked on a turn in the Parliament to get publicity. Such tactics are cheap. These people are abusing their position as members of Parliament, and when the inquiry is over I hope that their part in it will be fully publicised. </para>

I believe that what I have to say today is very important. I wish to bring before this chamber today two matters which I believe are important and about which the Parliament and this Government should be concerned. They affect the lives of many people. I refer, firstly, to a matter that I raised in a question to the Minister for Social Security, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guilfoyle,</inline> on 23 August 1978 concerning brain injuries to children. The Minister gave me what I felt was a responsible answer at the time, but I mention it again today because I am pressing for the Government to take more positive action in this matter of brain injured children. </para>

          <para>Some weeks ago while visiting Melbourne on another matter I was brought into contact with the Australian Centre for Brain Injured Children. A friend in Frankston, Melbourne, with whom I was staying, took me to see a child who had suffered brain injury. Never in my whole life have I been as affected as I was by seeing the scheme for the treatment of brain injured children which is administered by the Australian Centre for Brain Injured Children in Victoria. I visited the child's home and saw the devotion, love and affection that emanated from the young couple, who have a boy and a girl who has suffered brain injury. I saw the way that the child was treated under this scheme. It costs so much not only in time, effort and emotion but also in money. At present there is no way that families of brain injured children can get any assistance from the Government. That is why I am raising the matter. I believe that the Government must look at the problem more closely and do something positive. </para>

              <para>- I intended to give the Senate a definition of children who come under this category. A child at the moment of conception is meant to have, as we know, a good brain. But something can happen before, during or after binh to injure the brain. The definition includes children diagnosed as having cerebral palsy or Downs syndrome, spastic children, mentally retarded children, autistic children and so on, and any child who is now functioning below peer level as a result of brain injury, ranging from a severely hurt child to one with learning problems. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Treatment under this scheme can be administered at home. At the home of the child whom I went to see a special room had to be built and special equipment had to be bought. The idea, where brain damage has occurred, is to induce the good parts of the brain to take over the functions of the damaged part. It is a very costly program, as I said, in terms of time and effort. Eight hours a day, six days a week must be devoted to assisting the child. It is certainly best done by parents in the home, but the cost to the parents of setting up the room and buying the equipment and the cost of the treatment through the clinic also has to be taken into consideration. Parents' love and understanding naturally is helpful to the child. The Australian Centre for Brain Injured Children recognises this fact and tries to encourage it wherever possible. The child I am speaking about had no future whatsoever, but today is walking, talking, reading and writing after only 12 months of treatment. The child at eight years of age could do nothing for itself and had the functions of a child two to three months old. The family had to do everything. There was no future for the child. Today there is a bright and beautiful future for this child. </para>
          <para>The payment for this scheme at the moment is about $1,800. Previously parents of children such as the child to whom I have referred had to take their children to America. This would have involved the cost of fares, accommodation and treatment. Thank God the treatment is now available here. So far it is available only in Melbourne. Parents in Brisbane, Townsville, Perth, Adelaide or somewhere else in one of the other States incur on top of the cost of treatment which is $ 1 ,800, the cost of fares for themselves and the child and the cost of accommodation. That expenditure is just not possible for most of the families who have children who need this kind of attention. I suggest that the Government have a look at this matter and under the health scheme or in some other way provide financial assistance for families with children who suffer these problems. </para>
          <para>The success level of the program, from what I have seen and been told, is in some cases 100 per cent. Some of the children who have undertaken this scheme have gone right through the education system and have graduated from university with qualifications higher than people who had never suffered brain injury at all. This has come about because of the devotion of parents and because of the new treatment that is now being used in Australia. I believe that one needs to look at this whole question in a more humane fashion. We are dealing with people who unfortunately, through no fault of their own and because of circumstances beyond the control of the parents, are not able to have this treatment. I believe that the Government must do something to assist them so that they can enjoy a full life in the same way as any other person. I believe that it is the responsibility not only of the Government but also of the community to ensure that this is brought about. </para>
          <para>The other subject on which I want to touch is the matter of sport. As the Senate will recall, just recently young people and some, of course, not so young had the opportunity of going to Canada for the Commonwealth Games. As has been reported in the Press, the Australian performance at the Edmonton Games was not as good as many people would have liked. </para>

              <para>- It was creditable but if the honourable senator will bear with me I think the propositions I have to put forward will ensure that next time we will come home with a lot more gold medals than we did this time. If our performance over there was not as good as expected or as we would have liked, it is not the athletes themselves who are to be blamed. I believe that the men and women who went to Edmonton and all men and women and boys and girls who go into amateur sport not only devote their time but also go to a lot of personal expense. I believe that after events over there Australia's reputation as a great sporting nation will perhaps be regarded by some people as being in tatters. This myth can be exploded and will be exploded when we as a nation realise that when we expect men and women to go overseas to represent Australia in either the Olympic Games or the Commonwealth Games we have a responsibility to ensure that they are not victimised and that they do not suffer any hardships. I believe that it is not the fault of our athletes. It is not because they have not dedicated themselves to their particular sport. They have dedicated themselves. We have not provided training facilities of international standard and I believe we should provide them. As I said earlier, if we want our athletes to go away to represent this country we must provide them with the wherewithal and also facilities. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The lack of properly qualified coaches is another matter. Coaches, too, suffer from lack of support and an inability to travel and study improved methods and to attend sporting medicine clinics. Even the coaches are not on a salary. They are not being paid for this. They have to put their hands in their own pockets. I believe that as a government we must give financial assistance to all areas of sport. International competition with world class athletes is something that in this country we are not able to have to the extent that we should. Our athletes have that opportunity only when they go to places like Canada to compete in the Commonwealth Games or when they compete in the Olympics. They do not have that opportunity here. I believe that this is due to a lack of adequate Federal and State funding. It is not just a matter for the Federal Government; it is a matter for all governments. These athletes are going away to represent Australia as a whole but by the same token they also represent their own States in interstate sport. Therefore I believe it is the responsibility of both State and Federal governments to ensure that some funding is made available to our amateur sporting bodies. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy President,</inline>when honourable senators compare the Canadian figures to the Australian figures they will understand what I am talking about. If we look at Canada's figures for 1976-77 we see that Canada spent $25m in assisting its sporting bodies. In 1977-78 it spent $32m. What did we in Australia spend in 1976-77? We spent nothing. In 1977-78 we spent Sim and I am told that in 1978-79 we are going to spend $1.33m. When we compare those figures with Canada's figures we can understand the situation. Everything is provided to Canadian athletes. They are funded or assisted in every way. The Government of Canada was able to allocate $25m towards assisting amateur sporting in that country, compared with Australia's measley Sim. This is what our athletes in Australia are up against. They are not given a fair go. Yet when they go away and do not do as well as we expect they receive all the criticism. If one reads the papers, if one listens to people around the sticks talking about our athletes not doing as well as we expected them to do one can well understand why they are not doing so well. I believe that they have done the best they can do under the circumstances. If we as an Australian people are not prepared to make the facilities available to them, are not prepared to fund these sporting bodies, why blame the sports men and women? We should not blame them; we should blame ourselves. When they ask for assistance it is not forthcoming. </para>
          <para>I believe that the old adage that it is competition and not winning which is important is not good enough. I submit that any athlete who is good enough to represent our country must be able to compete on a par with those from other countries- not just compete in the field but compete in every way. They must be given that assistance here before they go so that they are able to compete with other sporting bodies or other sports men and women in other countries. </para>
          <para>I am a very strong supporter of amateur boxing in Australia. I happen to be the Australian patron of amateur boxing; I happen to be the Queensland patron of amateur boxing. I had the opportunity recently of attending the Queensland amateur boxing titles in Rockhampton. </para>

              <para>- I do not think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> need have any worries. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy President,</inline> when I attended those titles 62 bouts were run over two nights and two days. Some of these young men came in old broken down motor cars. They had travelled from Mount Isa, from Cairns, from all parts of Queensland; all at their own expense. They had to pay accommodation expenses in Rockhampton. Something like 300 people- boxers, their trainers and their families- had come from everywhere. Not one bit of assistance did they get. That is not good enough. Naturally some of these boys would go to the Olympics, some of them would go to the Commonwalth Games, but they have to put up with hardship because we as a country do not do anything towards assisting them or making facilities available to them. I know that my own amateur boxing union executive in Brisbane is trying desperately to raise funds for a gymnasium for its boxers in Brisbane where for the last three or four weeks before going overseas these boxers can be trained and looked after in a central part of the State. I hope that here as least is an area where governments can lend some support. I have a reasonable knowledge of sport because I played a little sport in my day. </para>

          <para class="block">Therefore I have a sympathy with and an understanding of the problems of participants. </para>
          <para>Again I refer to Canada. Canada finances its team from a national sports lottery. I do not see any reason, if the Government cannot afford to finance our team, why we could not have a lottery in Australia. It could be run along the same lines as the Golden Casket or Tattersalls or something like that. The proceeds could go into a national fund from which all sporting bodies could draw and be given assistance. The sporting bodies are not asking for all the money. They are prepared to work to raise some of the money themselves. But I believe that Australia as a nation also must do something to assist our sportsmen and sportswomen. Australia is a nation of sport lovers and I suppose one can say also that we like to take a gamble occasionally. We gamble on many things, such as horse races; in New South Wales people gamble on poker machines. Of course we do not have those things in Queensland. We do have greyhound and horse races and things like that. I feel sure that, if we had a lottery, people would support it. It would be one way of raising funds for our sporting bodies instead of having to call on the Treasury coffers. </para>

              <para>-They are, but if we had a lottery we could do away with that kind of thing. Sporting bodies receive funds not only from cigarette companies but also from wine and beer companies and all sorts of other things. By setting up a lottery to raise funds for sport, we would not need all this advertising connected with sport. If one is a great cricketer or footballer, naturally the cigarette companies will use one as a drawcard. I am told by my colleague here that smoking is not good for sportsmen or for anyone. That is by the way. </para>

              <para>- I suppose that they would be foolish if they did because it has some ill effects on their health. If they want to be in top condition they would prefer not to smoke. A gallup poll some time ago showed that 70 per cent of Australians wanted government to give more money to sport. But still there has been no action in that area. Perhaps there can be an argument that it cannot be done at the moment because of the economic climate. Again I suggest the setting up of a lottery which would enable Australians to do a bit of gambling by taking a ticket in the lottery the proceeds of which would go towards financing sporting activities in Australia. All of our athletes who are fortunate enough to go overseas are overwhelmed by the facilities that are available. When I visited Canada with my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colston,</inline> we saw a tremendous sporting complex there which would have cost in the vicinity of $200m. But we do not see such facilities for general sport in Australia. We see big football and cricket stadiums and things like that but they are money-making projects; they are not for amateur sport. The complex that we saw in Canada was for amateur sport. The facilities there were the best that one would find anywhere in the world. </para>

              <para>- I have not made any investigations of that. Perhaps Australia could do it first. We could set an example to the rest of the world. We have done that in many areas before; why not as far as our sports are concerned? I cite as a prime example the case of our hockey team which won a silver medal at the Montreal Olympic Games in 1976. 1 believe that this was the result of the players and the hockey association spending thousands of dollars of their own money- I emphasise that- travelling around for a month in Europe to play on synthetic surfaces to get used to the surfaces that they would have to play on in Montreal. That is an example of the kind of opportunities that we should be providing for our sporting teams. We should be making it possible for them to travel to play sport against other countries so that when they go to the Olympic Games or to the Commonwealth Games they have had experience of playing on the kinds of fields or sporting facilities that they can expect at those games. </para>

          <para>Perhaps after we have the Commonwealth Games in Australia, we as a nation will wake up to the fact that we have to do more for our sporting teams. Most of our successful athletes are trained overseas at universities. What is lacking in our homeland? It is simply money. Our sportsmen are dedicated but we do not have the money to support them. Even in this time of economic restraint the concept of a lottery for this purpose is most acceptable and such a proposal would not burden any of our taxpayers. As I said earlier, we Australians like to have a bet on the gee gees or take a ticket in the Casket. I believe that even those who are not terribly concerned whether they win would still buy a ticket in a lottery set up specifically for sport because they would know that the money was going to a good cause- raising funds for our sporting teams. I ask the Government to give this question urgent attention and at least to look at it seriously to see <inline font-style="italic">whether this can</inline> be done. </para>
          <para>I return to the matter that I raised at the beginning of my speech. I ask the Minister for Health and the Minister for Social Security to look more closely at the matter that I raised in relation to brain damaged children and to make some investigations of the Australian Centre for Brain Injured Children. Perhaps we can do something to assist financially the families of children who have brain damage and who are seeking treatment. Every child in this country is entitled to the best that Australia can afford. We must look at this question and do something about it. I urge the Government at least to make some investigations and inquiries and then to devise some means whereby the Australian Centre for Brain Injured Children can receive some assistance. I will certainly visit the Centre again. I have a letter from the clinic director who has invited me to come back to the clinic to learn more about what it is doing and to get a better understanding of what it is all about. 1 will do that in the near future. I again urge both the Minister for Health, the  Hon.  Ralph Hunt, and the Minister for Social Security, the  Hon.  Margaret Guilfoyle, to have people from their departments look at this Centre to see what the Government can do for it. </para>

            <para>-This afternoon we are debating the motion for the first reading of the Pig Slaughter Levy Amendment Bill 1978. 1 think it is worth while occasionally for a speaker to mention why the speeches do not appear to be relevant to the purpose of that Bill. Many people who follow the proceedings of this Senate are sometimes a little bemused to hear or to read the types of comments that are made on certain Bills when we are speaking in a first reading debate. I point out that Standing Order 1 90 states: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>In Bills which the Senate may not amend, the Question That this Bill be now read a First' time may be debated, and in such debate matters both relevant and not relevant to the subject-matter of the Bill may be discussed. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Of course we use that Standing Order so that we may raise matters in the Senate which we think are important and need to be aired in the Parliament. Therefore we use it as a device for the good purpose of debate in the Senate. As my Whip pointed out a couple of days ago, for the first time in his memory he did hear on the first reading of a money Bill debate on the subject matter relevant to the Bill. Of course what I have to say this afternoon will not be relevant to the Bill. I am using the device which is provided to us by Standing Order 190. </para>
          <para>I feel compelled to comment on some remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner.</inline> I regret that he is not in the chamber. I realise that he had to leave the chamber to attend to important business, but I regret that he is not present because I intend to be somewhat critical of his opening remarks. In his opening remarks he said that he supported the Budget, and he was very plain and clear on this. I thought that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> had some compassion for his fellow Australians. Unfortunately, I must have been mistaken, because this is a dishonest Budget, a deceitful Budget and a brutal Budget. Anyone with some compassion for his fellow Australians would not find it possible to endorse it. </para>
          <para>I also mention something about the comments <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> made in regard to sport, not because I disagree with him but because I think there is room for debate on this whole matter of Australian amateur sport. I will not open up the whole debate this afternoon, but I will mention just a couple of matters. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> said that our athletes could have come home from Canada with many more gold medals. If they had it would have been quite commendable. I wonder whether this is really of the utmost importance in amateur sport in Australia. Should we be looking for such excellence so that our athletes can go to the Commonwealth Games and come back with gold medals and perhaps some silver and bronze medals and do the same when they go to the Olympic Games in a couple of years time? If our athletes do win medals I think that is fine, but I wonder whether it is not more important to make sure that the bulk of the population of Australia does participate in some formal recreational program. If Australians do this and if they do it extensively it would be inevitable that we would have people with championship qualifications coming forward and going to games like the Commonwealth Games and the Olympic Games and perhaps coming back with medals. It seems to me that we are placing too much emphasis on the very top quality athletes- the excellence part of amateur sport. </para>
          <para>I think that in Australia there are probably too many people who, although they are sporting enthusiasts, would participate in the main in spectator sport whereby they can go along and look at the various sports being played without actually participating. Of course it is important that we watch other people participate in sport but it is also important that we ourselves should participate. I wonder how many of us here participate in some regular formal recreation. </para>

              <para>-Senator Townley is well aware that I do, and I am well aware that he does, of course. I wonder how many people here participate regularly in sport. I wonder how many people in the Australian population actually have a formal recreational program. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> mentioned the facilities that we saw at Montreal and some of the facilities that we saw at Edmonton whilst we were in Canada. These facilities are of course very good for the amateur athletes of Canada. I point out, without being parochial, that after 1982 there will be some excellent facilities in Brisbane also and that these facilities will be able to be used not only by Brisbane residents but also by residents of Queensland and visiting athletes from other parts of Australia. This is one of the good things which should come from Brisbane hosting the Commonwealth Games in 1 982. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I will just say something about the comments in regard lotteries. Yes, I do believe that we have to give a greater commitment to sport and recreation in Australia. I wonder whether lotteries are really the answer. There is something of a myth in Queensland that the lottery there, which is called the Golden Casket, did, in preMedibank days, in large part fund the public hospitals in Queensland. If one looks at the public hospital costs and the profits which are made from the lottery in Queensland one can see that there is a vast difference. I am speaking from memory at the moment, but I think that the net profit from the Golden Casket in Queensland last year was about $6m. That is a very small amount of money when one considers the amounts of money which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> was speaking of in regard to providing funds for our athletes. This of course was the total profit from the Golden Casket in Queensland. </para>
          <para>I wonder whether there might not be another approach in regard to sport which would be worth while. Of course this approach would cost the Commonwealth money, and therefore it would have to be looked at very carefully. Perhaps we could remove or reduce the sales tax on sporting goods in Australia. This would help not only the people who are going to participate for </para>
          <para class="block">Australia  in  internationalgames but also every person who participates in sport in Australia because sales tax is an additional cost on any sporting equipment that a person purchases. It had not been my intention to traverse those two issues. I will now move to the subject matter on which I intended to speak in this debate this afternoon on the first reading motion of this Bill. </para>
          <para>Some time ago outside this Parliament I made it plain that there should be an independent inquiry into Australia's telegram service. I am still convinced that there should be such an independent inquiry. However, as I look further into the operations of Telecom Australia I am starting to become convinced that there should be an independent inquiry into many aspects of Telecom's charges. Firstly, may I mention just telegrams- the part of Telecom 's service which concerns me greatly at the moment. I would like to outline to the Senate some of the new charges that are to be made by Telecom as from 1 October this year. These new telegram charges did not receive much attention in the Press. I say that not as any denigration of the Press but rather as a denigration of Telecom for not publicising the increased charges widely enough. Let us look at some of the new charges. For a registered telegraphic address which will not concern most people in the community but which will concern the business community, the old price was $25. The new price will be $30 a year. </para>
          <para>Let us look at the actual charges for a telegram. The delivery charge for a telegram on 1 October will rise from 80c to $ 1 . 50. If a person wants to send a telegram and have it messenger delivered by what is often called a telegram boy but what often is now an Australia Post courier, it will cost $1.50. Previously if a person wanted to have the telegram addressed to a telephone number and Telecom just passed on the contents of the telegram through that telephone number there was no charge at all. As from 1 October the charge will be 50c. If a telegram is passed on through a telephone number and then delivered by mail the next day there will now be an additional 40c charge although there used to be no charge. There are a number of other increases in telegram charges. For instance, if a person wants to charge his telegram to a credit card that will now cost 40c. It once cost nothing. If a person wants to have an acknowledgement of a telegram by post that will now cost $1. It used to cost 25c. There are various minor increases in the charges. </para>
          <para>Most people now realise that it will cost 1 5c for every word to send a telegram. This means that if a person wants to lodge a telegram, have it trans mitted and then have it delivered by a telegram boy or by Australia Post the average telegram, which I am informed is about 22 words, will cost about $5. It seems to me that the cost of $5 for an average telegram to be lodged, transmitted and delivered is really outrageous. It is the sort of charge which will make sure that people do not use the telegram service any more. The excuse always being offered by Telecom is that the telegram service is losing money. One could well ask why it would not be. I suppose that we could use the rather exaggerated analogy of a person who wants to sell watermelons for $ 100 each. He would not sell many. At the price we are charging for telegrams it seems to me that people will not use this service very much and, therefore it will lose money. The excuse that is being given by Telecom is perhaps just a convenient excuse. As I said earlier, I wonder whether the aim is really to phase out telegrams. I sometimes suspect that it is. </para>
          <para>I shall digress for a moment. I outlined in this place on 29 May how it took a telegram that I sent on that day almost all day, from early morning to late afternoon, to go from Canberra to Brisbane. I thought that that was bad enough on 29 May. On the same night, however, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick,</inline> who then represented the Minister for Post and Telecommunications <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Staley),</inline> assured me that I would be informed what went wrong on that day with that telegram. It is interesting to know that I am still waiting for a reply. Perhaps the answer was sent to me by telegram. Whenever I try to find out how Telecom arrives at its stated loss on the telegram service I cannot do so. All that Telecom does is state in its annual report how much was lost on the telegram service. I am beginning to believe that some extraneous costs are being charged to the telegram service to boost the loss so that Telecom can say that the loss is so great that it has to increase its charges. We all know that the great money spinners for Telecom at the moment are its telephone and telex services. But I believe that there is a role for telegrams in the Australian community. It is for this reason that I would like to see some sort of independent inquiry into the telegram service to see what we can do to keep the costs low and to see whether the loss stated by Telecom is a loss in the real financial sense of the word. We have a responsibility to provide a telegram service as well as to make profits. </para>
          <para>Let me move away a little from the telegram service to some other aspects which I have seen since I became interested in Telecom charges. I was attracted to an advertisement in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> on Wednesday, 6 September. I read part of the advertisement: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Following reductions in STD and Telex call charges Telecom revises charges for auxiliary services. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">There have been reductions in subscriber trunk dialling charges and there have been reductions in telex call charges; so when the advertisement said that Telecom was revising its charges for auxiliary services I jumped to the conclusionwrongfully, I am ashamed to say- that there was also a reduction in some of the charges for auxiliary services. Further, the advertisement stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>As of September 1st, Telecom advises customers that the charges for a number of auxiliary services have been reviewed and rationalised. This follows on recently announced, significant reductions in the call charges for STD and automatic Telex. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">So far, so good. I still thought the charges would be reduced. The advertisement continued: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Tariff changes will take place on a number of categories of services including the following: Miscellaneous telephone calls- for example: particular person, fixed time, reverse charge, credit cards, reminder calls. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The advertisement went on to mention a few other miscellaneous telephone facilities. Later it stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>In addition, tariffs for private telephone and telegraph lines and Telegrams will also change on October 1st. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I was aware of the increases in the cost of telegrams as of 1 October; so I became suspicious at that stage and thought that I should find out what these revised charges for auxiliary services were. I was dismayed when I did so; because most of them were increases. These increases have not received any great prominence in the media throughout Australia. </para>
          <para>I refer to a sample of these increases in telephone charges in Australia as from 1 September. If we make a particular person call there will be an increase in the charge. The cost of a particular person call depends upon the distance called. In the case of the Sydney-Canberra rate, the increase will be from 20c to 40c. That is a 100 per cent increase. If we want to make a fixed time call there will be a 100 per cent increase, from 20c to 40c. If we want to have a charge connect call- not many people would make charge connect calls, but I can recall that in one occupation I had once I made them frequently- there will now be a 40c charge. Until 1 September there was no charge. If we want to have a reminder call- many people use this service when they do not believe that they can rely upon their alarm clock to raise them in the morning- there will be an increase in the charge. As far as I can see, there will be a 10c increase. The call has now been reclassified from a reminder call to a booking call as well as the actual call itself. The total charge will be 50c, as against the original total charge of 40c. There are various increases in annual rental for intercoms, private manual branch exchanges, private automatic branch exchanges, private wire teleprinters and private telephone lines. </para>
          <para>All these increases did not receive much publicity. One would hardly expect that they would receive publicity when they appeared in an advertisement such as this, which stated that there were revised charges for auxiliary services underneath a line stating that there were reductions in charges for STD and telex services. I subsequently found, quite by chance, that most of the changes that took place as of 1 September were outlined in the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth of Australia Gazette</inline> dated 12 September 1978.I wonder how many members of the public actually read the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth of Australia Gazette.</inline></para>
          <para>It would have been much better if Telecom had been totally honest in this advertisement and, rather than saying 'Telecom revises charges for auxiliary services', had said that Telecom increases charges for auxiliary services. We then would have been aware that there were increases in a number of charges. I repeat what I said when I began speaking about Telecom. There should be an investigation into the telegram service. While telegram rates increase and rumours persist throughout Australia that the service is to be phased out, an urgent independent inquiry is necessary. If we have an independent inquiry we will be sure either that what Telecom is saying is correct or that there will have to be some changes to the telegram service as now operating. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>-I take this opportunity on the motion for the first reading of this money Bill to bring forward a matter which I believe is quite important. I refer to the Government's present policy on national highways. As honourable senators will know, under this policy, which has been in existence for some years, the Federal Government provides a set sum of money to the States for this purpose and leaves it to the States to allocate their priorities. Although this policy seems to be fair in some respects, I am becoming increasingly concerned about the Stuart Highway in South Australia, a link which is most important to the mutual development of South Australia and the Northern Territory. For a number of years now- it seems like a number of years anyway- we in South Australia have been trying to direct the attention of both the State and Federal governments to the significance of this important road. The road is a killer. It is a horror stretch; one of the most disgraceful sections of road in the Commonwealth. It already has claimed lives. A few days ago a tourist bus overturned and several passengers had to be taken to hospital by the Royal Flying Doctor Service. In recent times flooding in the northern part of South Australia has resulted in road access to the Northern Territory from South Australia being cut. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Since the road to Brisbane has been sealed, the South Australian economy has suffered to the tune of about $80m a year because of loss of business to Queensland. South Australia which is going through a period of depression, certainly cannot afford to lose any business to any State at this time. Through the Minister I have suggested to the Government that the policy on national highways ought to be reviewed. For example, construction of the Stuart Highway is estimated to cost about $65m. The Federal Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon)</inline> has indicated that he desires the State Government to undertake some work on that highway and would like to see the gravelled section between Port Augusta and Woomera- 50 kilometres in length- constructed this year. He suggested in a Press statement that $1.3m should be spent on that section. If we spend that amount of money a year on the Stuart Highway it will take us about 80 years to construct it. </para>
          <para>I recall that late last year there was a deputation of members from both sides of this Parliament to the Minister. State members also were present and the Minister for Roads in South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Virgo,</inline> led the State deputation. The group included the Mayor of Alice Springs and representatives of the Australian Road Federation and other interested parties. The deputation was unanimous in its request to the Minister to provide a special allocation of funds to enable this highway to be constructed. After the meeting I drafted a letter, which was approved by honourable senators on both sides of this chamber. It was signed and sent to the Minister requesting that substantial additional funding be made available to enable the construction of the highway to be completed in a matter of six years or so. This means that $10m or so extra a year will be needed for the construction of that highway. The Government should have a very close look at this request with a view to considering a change in policy. It is all very well to have the policy operating generally as it is at the present time but the Federal Minister should be able to make additional funds available for roads of special importance. </para>

              <para>-I believe it will. That is a industry, particularly in South Australia, is in a depressed state. This project will create jobs for 270 people during the construction period. I am glad that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> drew my attention to this very important aspect. Projects of this type, whether they be for roads or railways gauge standardisation, which have a national development significance ought to be considered now at a time when unemployment is a problem and when we can build these facilities perhaps cheaper than we will be able to in a few years' time. In this way we can increase our national assets and ensure the long-term developmental interest of the States and the nation itself. I hope the Government will look seriously at this suggestion as a way of building national assets. We could construct the Stuart Highway within a reasonable time to the mutual benefit of South Australia and the Northern Territory. </para>

              <para>- Because the name has not yet been chosen for the project and I will explain that to the honourable senator in a moment. It is time that this Government looked at the possibility of establishing a judicial inquiry or some other type of public inquiry into the establishment of this complex. It appears that both the Federal and Queensland governments approved of the project with very indecent haste at a time when neither Parliament was sitting. I want to recapitulate some of the points that have been set out, though not quite in this order, in previous debates in this Parliament. My remarks are documented so I cannot be accused of dreaming, saying things off the top of my head or speaking on behalf of some emotive group of people who do not know what the subject is all about. Everybody who has contributed to the documentation I have is a responsible member of the community. Quite frankly, these people are very worried about what is occurring in the central coastal area. To take the matter even further, today I intend putting a question on the Notice Paper about a block of land north of Cape Flattery in North Queensland where it appears that the Iwasaki group, either through nominees or directly, may have had some influence. </para>

( Under the FIRB Policy, the Government then had 90 days, i.e. until 27th July, to reach a decision on this application). 17th June 1978: Advertisements announcing the releases (on 20th June) of the draft EIS on the Iwasaki project were placed in newspapers. </para>
          <para class="block">I think they were available at about only four or five points in Queensland. The report goes on:  20th June 1978: Government Gazette carries formal notification of the public review period; closing date was notified as 18th July. </para>
          <para class="block">As will be stated in the chronological record, this was afterwards extended by two or three days. The report goes on:  23rd June 1978: Despite published announcement, copies of the draft EIS were not available for public purchase in Brisbane until the afternoon of this day. 25th June 1978: Copy of the draft EIS finally made available to the Capricorn Coast Protection Council. </para>

          <para class="block">In two areas the Federal Government has broken its own laws. One breach is in relation to foreign investment guidelines that are laid down and the other is in relation to the environmental impact studies under the 1974 legislation which was introduced by the government of the day and accepted by the present Government.

          <para class="block">Shortly I will read the relevant sections from the Press statement that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Howard</inline> issued at that time. The report indicates that it is pertinent to note that both the Acting Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development and the Treasurer were prepared to give approval for the project based only on a concept plan and a totally inadequate draft environmental impact statement. It then states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Thus decisions were hastily made on the basis of political expediency rather than a proper assessment of the likely environmental, economic and sociological impacts of the proposal.

          <para>That is the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1 974-  or its procedures and to this end the Australian Conservation Foundation is considering taking legal action to ensure the Act is complied with. </para>
          <para class="block">I will not make any reference again to that latter paragraph because I think that a vast amount of material should go into the record so that it may be seen publicly how both the Federal Government and the Queensland Government have hoodwinked the Australian public in their unseemly haste to get this project off the ground. Of course, none of this is going to be exposed properly unless a public inquiry of some sort is held. I suggest that preferably it should be a judiciary inquiry with wide terms of reference and at all times discussion should be open to the public. Incidentally, I and a member of my staff spent several hours going through the original environmental impact statement line by line. Its cost was a bit less than $40, but we were able to gain access to a copy that was made available for public display. Even the people who drafted the statement were unsure of their ground. I think they made something like 55 or 57 suggestions to the effect that further inquiries ought to be carried out into various areas, some of them very important areas. </para>
          <para>Following public outcry at the manner in which the development project was given approval, the people who carried out the EIS compiled a document called <inline font-style="italic">Queensland International Tourist Centre and Resort</inline> and under a series of headings they attempted to refute some of the criticisms.

            <para>In addition the company has a 10 acre (4 hectares) nursery established in anticipation of planting 100,000 plants, trees and shrubs. Most of the 250 varieties will be Australian natives. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>Under the heading 'Building Construction' the following is stated, which gives the lie to the claim that there will be no development: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Building heights will be limited under the provisions of the Queensland Parliament's Bill. </para>
            <para>This means that 'accommodation units'- apartment houses, flats or home units- will be limited to no more than three storeys. </para>
            <para>Hotels will be limited to no more than six storeys. </para>
            <para>In other words, 'skyscrapers ' similar to those at Australia 's Gold Coast, for example, are banned. </para>
            <para>Following is a brief description of buildings: </para>
            <para>The foremost structures will be located on the foreshore with an 80-metre setback. </para>
            <para>In all there will be nine types of buildings: </para>
            <para>Hotels- total 5- one International class hotel of 375 rooms; 4 others each with 350 rooms </para>
            <para>Motels- total 10- each with 50 rooms </para>
            <para>Flats- total 85 blocks each with 35 two-bedroomed flats. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>There will be a total of 1,250 villas. There will be one golf course inn and a total of three beach centres. There will be one international village, representing several cultural regions of the world. Several nations will be represented. The buildings will be in clusters and represent the distinctive architecture, landscaping and lifestyles of Australia, the South Pacific Islands, Japan, South East Asia, the Middle East and Africa, North America, South and Central America, Western Europe and Eastern Europe. </para>
          <para>There will also be one transport centre. Additionally, two international standard golf courses will be established. Awhile ago, of course, the group was skiting about the fact that it was not felling trees as the previous grazier had done; that the ring barking and felling had been stopped. If the group is going to build two international-standard golf courses, each of 18 holes, it is unlikely that large amounts of indigenous trees will be left on either. Incidentally, the planning for the two courses will be under the direction of Peter Thomson, the former British Open champion. The State Government has laid down planning stages which extend over 20 years. The first stage must start on or before 1 April 1978. It has been decreed that in stage 1, in the first five years, the company will commence two of the motels, with a combined total of up to 100 rooms; not less than five, nor more than 10, accommodation units, with about 35 apartments, flats or home units per accommodation unit; one golf course and a beach centre. There is much more detail in the pamphlet. All of it is similar and, as far as I am concerned, in spite of the introductory paragraphs, is non-factual. It does not tell the real story of what will happen to this very fine piece of coast. </para>
          <para>When we get around to stage 4 of the construction, which is in the latter part- in the 16 to 20-year period- the planned completion of the project is in these terms: The fourth hotel, apart from the first class hotel, is scheduled for completion, with 350 beds, in the sixteenth year; another 100 bedrooms will be added in the twentieth year. Two more motels, each with 50 beds, making a total of 10 motels, are to be completed. Thirty-one more blocks of flats, to contain 2, 170 beds, are scheduled that would make a total of 85 blocks of flats. Five hundred villas, with a total of 1,250 beds, would be completed. This would bring the planned number of villas to 1,250. Additional beds would be added in that period to the international village. When it gets to that stage it will be like Disneyland. I think someone asked the Premier of Queensland, after he had made an extensive tour of America, what had made the greatest impression on him and what had affected him most while he was away. The Premier said: 'Disneyland'. Maybe that is why this project is getting so much support. </para>
          <para>In stage 1 of construction some 460 jobs will be created. At least three-quarters of them will be available to the Australian work force. There is no guarantee of that in writing anywhere. In fact, there are stories circulating that are very strongly to the contrary, that it is more likely to be in reverse, with about 25 per cent of the jobs available to Australians. The statement is made that it is aimed to minimise to necessary proportions the number of jobs filled by overseas experts. We have plenty of unemployed experts in this country, so it is not really necessary to import a work force at all. The work force will increase in subsequent stages, because of the increased volume of various construction. On completion, the resort will provide for a staff of 3,420 people. </para>
          <para>It must be remembered that that will be 20 years from 1 April 1979. In other words, on 1 April 1999 the project should employ 3,420 people. A minimum of three-quarters of the staff will be Australian, drawn mainly from the Yeppoon and Rockhampton areas. Then the document goes on to answer some of the criticisms that have been levelled at the project. </para>
          <para class="block">The first concerns the following statement: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The agreement gives 'aliens' freehold ownership of land rightly belonging to Queenslanders. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>The answer, according to this company is: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>A similar statement could be made when any person of an ethnic origin, other than Australian, purchases any property in this country. </para>
            <para>For example, a person of Greek, Italian, German or any other nationality, should be prohibited from purchasing land or property in Queensland if the logic of this argument were followed through to its conclusion. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That is a diversion from what has been said in criticisms that have been uttered concerning this company. I am not aware that any member of my party, or of any conservation group has criticised land being owned by people not of Australian birth. What we are criticising is its being owned by absentee landlords with no stake in the country at all. The fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Iwasaki</inline> might have created 38 parks in Japan has nothing to do with the argument, and should not be used to vindicate the necessity to have this project established. In order to be factual in the true sense of the word, I will complete the reply. It is as follows: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Iwasaki organisation cannot 'roll up the land and take it back to Japan'. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">We did not expect the group to turn the land into instant leases that it could take home to Japan. Reference is made in the statement to this criticism of the project: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The State Government has virtually given away 8,670 hectares of beachfront Queensland, including 106 hectares of land at bargain basement prices. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I think the term 'bargain basement prices' was used in one of my statements. It has obviously been picked up. The statement continues: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>This 106 hectares was 'repossessed' and sold to Iwasaki organisation for $400,000, although nearby blocks cost up to $30,000 for less than .1 hectare. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The reply given by the public relations company is as follows: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>A huge proportion of the land is scrub, swamp and/or poor grazing land. Much of it is inaccessible except by four wheel drive vehicles. </para>
            <para>Locals claim good quality blocks around Yeppoon, with views of the ocean sell for about $ 10,000. </para>
            <para>Some claim that until the Iwasaki plan was mooted there was little interest in real estate in the area at all. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I do not necessarily disagree with that. It is amazing how many National Party politicians, in particular, suddenly looked at the possibility of buying land once the Iwasaki project was mooted. The reply continues: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>They also say that the area under purchase or lease agreement with the Iwasaki organisation was of such poor quality that 'you would be laughed at if you tried to sell it'. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>That is not the story now, of course, and one of the ambitions of the company or one of the end results of the establishment of the project will be the increase in the value of real estate. The document also quotes the following statement: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The resort will be closed to Australians and will be for the exclusive use of Japanese tourists. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>The answer given is that that is untrue. The reply continues: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>It is estimated that during stage one alone, most visitors will be from Australia. They will be joined in later stages by tourists from international ports, because of developments such as the international class hotel and international village which will be capable of accommodating more people than previously. </para>
            <para>It is expected some of the tourists will be Japanese, of course, but there are expected to be Americans, Europeans and many other tourists as well. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>Another statement cited is as follows: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The beaches will be closed to the public. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>The answer given is: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Untrue. The public has free and unrestricted use of the beach, at any time, and at any tide. The Premier, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bjelke-Petersen,</inline> incorporated this guarantee in the Queensland parliamentary record. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">However, the document itself says that areas will be closed off at night-time, so there is a contradiction between what appears on page 13 and what appears earlier in the pamphlet. The next criticism is as follows: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Delicate environmental areas will be destroyed by the proposed development. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">We have only to look at the Gold Coast of Queensland, and at other parts of Australia, to find that development of this nature has destroyed the local environment, it has destroyed the ecological balance. When the Yeppoon development has reached ultimate development it will do the same. I shall not read all the details, but it goes on to point out how <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Iwasaki</inline> stopped the tree felling and now has on his current staff of 10 in Australia, two botanists; how he has built 38 parks in Japan and so on. The final paragraph of the statement is a killer: </para>

          <para>The next document to which I refer is the famous statement issued by the Treasurer on 30 July 1978, at a time when the Commonwealth Parliament and the State Parliament were not sitting. The statement was issued for immediate release. There was no embargo. It reads: </para>

            <para>The Treasurer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Howard,</inline> announced today that the Government had taken a decision on the foreign investment policy aspects of the proposal by the Japanese businessman, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Iwasaki,</inline> and his company, Iwasaki Sangyo Co. (Australia) Pty Ltd, to establish a tourist development project at Yeppoon, Queensland. </para>
            <para>
              <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Howard</inline>said that approval, in terms of the Government's foreign investment policy, had been given to the proposed $1 00m tourist development and associated land purchases subject to a number of conditions designed to maximise the benefits of the project to Australians, and to provide opportunities for Australians to participate in the equity and the management of the project. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">How shallow can one be- if I may make a pertinent comment at this point? It was known that there was no Australian equity in the project and that the so-called policy of the governing party in the Australian Parliament calls for Australian equity and not 100 per cent overseas controlled capital. This sort of" thing is dished up to the members of the Australian public in the hope that they will believe it and fall for it. </para>
          <para>We know that the Commonwealth Government runs in fear of the Premier of Queensland and a handful of his Ministers. Every time a confrontation of any sort occurs we hear loud yells from Queensland and small whimpers from Canberra, and then Canberra knuckles under while <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bjelke-Petersen</inline> continues on his way of tryanny. Honourable senators opposite should have been prepared to stand up to him on a number of great social issues. I refer to Aurukun and Mornington Island and to this sort of thing. Also, testing is going on in the Bloomfield River at the moment for a major tin operation. As far as I know, no EIS has been prepared and no export licence has been granted. But that project will go on and honourable senators opposite will not even know about it. They will close their eyes and hope that it will go away. It may not go away, but the river will.

          <para class="block">A whole lot of other documentation could be added to this contribution to a debate on a Bill that perhaps does not have a great deal of relevance to the Iwasaki project. But as members on both sides of the Senate take advantage of the first reading of money Bills to raise issues that are not likely to be otherwise raised in the Parliament, I am grateful for the opportunity once again of exposing what I believe to be some very weak points in the  establishmei  of this project. There is a craven fear at the Federal Government level of what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Petersen</inline> might do if it did not agree immediately to allow the project to go ahead, regardless of the fact that two major pieces of Federal legislation have been trampled under foot in order to give permission for the project to go ahead. I believe that this scandal is not going to be cleaned up until there is a full and open public inquiry. There is a number of ways that this can be done such as by holding an ordinary judicial inquiry or by the establishment of a Senate select committee. If a </para>
          <para class="block">Senate select committee were established, we would hear great howls from the Queensland Government- not from the Queensland people. A large number of the people would approve of it. There could be a royal commission, to which I referred earlier, or some other public inquiry with wide terms of reference. Then perhaps we would get to the bottom of the scandal and perhaps we could protect that coast, even if the project goes ahead, with tighter environmental control. </para>

However one senator, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tate,</inline> spoke directly to the Pig Slaughter Levy Amendment Bill. He commented directly on the health of pigs and possible research into certain diseases of pigs. I imagine that he is unlikely to speak in the second reading debate on the Bill so I take the time of the Senate to respond to his comments. I note that the matter that he raised was raised in another place <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tate</inline> commented that inadequate expenditure from the research fund to which this levy is paid may be directed to a disease known as poly-arthritis. </para>

I am advised that grants for this type of research totalled more than $16,000 in 1976-77 and close to $8,000 in the year just passed. Apparently losses to the industry from poly-arthritis are estimated to be much lower than from other causes where research is urgently needed and is being pursued at present.

          <para class="block">The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Pig Slaughter Levy Act 1971 to raise the maximum slaughter levy rates payable by producers. The maximum research levy will be raised from 10c to 20c per head slaughtered and the promotion levy from 5c to 20c per head slaughtered. The increases in the maximum rates of levy have been requested of the Government by pig producers through the Australian Commercial Pig Producers ' Federation. The operative rates of levy, within the maximum provided in the Act, are set by regulation. At present they are 8c per head for research and 5c per head for promotion. </para>
          <para>Monies raised through the research levy are used to finance a continuing high level of scientific and economic research in the pig industry. This research ensures that a steady stream of information is available to producers to enable them to improve their management practices and make better informed marketing decisions. The Government matches research funds raised from producers on a $ 1 for $ 1 basis. Since 1975 a promotion levy has also been paid by the industry to ensure that the public is made aware of the range and qualities of the goods that the industry has to offer. Conversely the funds are also used to ensure that the industry remains finely attuned to changes in customer requirements and tastes and that public reaction to new ventures can be tested and assessed. The Government does not supplement funds raised through the promotion levy. As honourable senators will appreciate this legislation will allow any proposed changes to the operative rates to be handled by regulation. Proposals for amendments to the levy rates are made by the relevant industry committees, that is, the Pig Industry Research Committee and the Pigmeat Promotion Advisory Committee. Such requests are considered by the Minister before submission to the Governor-General. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </para>

            <para>- I shall not inconvenience other honourable senators by continuing my speech beyond the suspension of the sittings for dinner. In fact I intend to terminate it before then. The Minister for Science <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Webster)</inline> has outlined the factual content of the Pig Slaughter Levy Amendment Bill in his second reading speech. The present position is that the legislation allows for the collection of a levy of 10c per head for research and 5c for promotion. But the legislation as it will be amended by this Bill will allow for a levy of 20c for each purpose. There is no obligation for the maximum levy to be imposed. The Opposition does not oppose the Bill. Its provisions have been recommended by the Australian Commercial Pig Producers Federation. The moneys raised from these levies will be paid into a trust account under the Pig Industry Research Act. Funds withdrawn from that account will be matched on a $1 for $1 basis by the Government. </para>

          <para>A joke has been passed around Parliament House recently arising from the nickname of a particular senator. The joke is in the form of a question asking whether as a result of events of 7 August the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> would be kicking 40c into the bin under this legislation. I am not sure what is the answer to that. It is not my intention unduly to delay the Senate but for those who have a serious interest in not only this Bill but also the whole subject of the pig industry I wish to draw the attention of honourable senators to, and particularly commend, the detailed and highly competent speech delivered in the House of Representatives on 17 August by my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr John</inline> Brown, the honourable member for Parramatta. Apart from having had some experience of pig consumption, slaughtering, butchering and the sale of pig meats in the industry for some years, he was a member of the New South Wales Pig Industry Research Committee. In his speech in the second reading debate, he displayed a great depth of knowledge of this industry which I have no doubt surprised the members of the National Country Party and particularly the honourable member for Darling Downs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McVeigh)</inline> who followed him in the debate and endeavoured to display a breadth and depth of knowledge comparable to that displayed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr John</inline> Brown- a task which, if I may say so, he failed badly. </para>
          <para>There is a curious aspect relevant to the history of this legislation to which my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr John</inline> Brown, drew attention in the House of Representatives. I think it is important enough to be worth repeating. When similar legislation was before the House in April of 1975, the present Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair),</inline> who I think at the time was the Opposition spokesman on primary industry, seemed to be under the impression that the contributions paid into this fund by the industry were not matched by an equal contribution from the Government as is the case with most levies struck in this manner for the purposes of funding research in agricultural matters. He made this rather curious statement: </para>

          </list>
          <para class="block">I do not know what led the present Minister to believe at that time that it was not the case that Governments were not making a matching contribution. He continued in carping style, I suppose, to criticise the existing Committee on the grounds that there was a government representative on it. He said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I personally find it dashed hard to understand why there should be a government representative if the Government is not going to provide money to this Committee. Indeed, the Committee which is being constituted to carry on promotion will be administering funds being provided by the industry. Yet apparently it is to be so constituted that the Government will be in a position, through its exercise of power on the Committee, to direct to a degree where that money is to be spent. If the Government is going to take that sort of stance, I think it has a responsibility to contribute too. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That is quite apart from the fact that it was contributing. I note for the record that the government representation on this Committee will not be changed as a result of this Bill which has been introduced by the present Minister for Primary Industry in spite of his remarks of <inline font-style="italic">2'A</inline> years ago. Obviously there are some elements in the attitude of this Government as expressed then and now by the Minister for Primary Industry in common with pre-election commitments to tax cuts and post election tax increases; with pre-election promises to provide funds at concessional rates of interest for agriculture; with unequivocal assurances' given in 1974 again by the present Minister for Primary Industry that the nitrogen bounty would be maintained at $80 a ton although the Government now has legislation before the House to reduce the subsidy from $60, to which it reduced the bounty a couple of years ago, to $40. So the attitude of the Minister on this legislation has been consistent with the inconsistency displayed by this Government on a range of matters. We of the Opposition do not oppose the Bill. I think it would be more accurate to say that we actually support the measure. It has the approval of, and indeed was instigated at the request of, the industry, and we do not intend to delay its passage unduly. </para>

            <para>- I would prefer to go on to the the modern justification for Crown priority in bankruptcy proceedings, or liquidation proceedings where a company is concerned. That modern justification is that where the assets of a person or firm are insufficient to meet the claims of all creditors the community's claims should take priority over the claims of individual persons or firms which have provided goods or services, including labour, to the person or company whose financial position has so drastically deteriorated. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>Of course, the equating of the community interest with those of government revenue which is implied in the giving of preference to the Crown in the distribution of what assets remain of a bankrupt or liquidated company is a trap into which I hope we will not fall in considering this report. In fact, one must seriously doubt whether the community is advantaged in any way by putting employees who are unable to recover payment for annual leave or even ordinary wages or ordinary unsecured creditors who have provided goods or services at the end of the queue, behind the Commissioner of Taxation who is seeking, for example, to obtain payas.youearn instalments notionally held by the employer or trying to recover one year's personal income tax in the case of a bankrupt. </para>
        <para>As I understand it, the amounts of revenue presently obtained by the insistence on Crown priority are miniscule. The priority might apply to tax debts in the region of $5m to $8m. Even that figure is highly speculative and is offset by the fact that under the scheme proposed in the report the Crown would still rank as an ordinary unsecured creditor and receive probably partial repayment of its debts in most insolvency administrations, alongside other creditors. More than that, the sums returned to the community via other creditors will increase revenue because of the reduction in bad debts. Further, under the scheme proposed in ther report there is an added incentive to proceed with liquidations promptly and for other creditors to pursue their interests very actively and therefore to recover greater sums. This would be a stimulus to other creditors, whereas at present ordinary creditors, once they learn that the Crown is a creditor of a bankrupt or a company in trouble, are dissuaded from pressing their case because they know that the Crown takes priority and probably will absorb any assets that are available from that bankrupt's meagre funds. </para>
        <para>The healthy commercial effect of reducing the Crown to the same status as other unsecured creditors in this respect was commented on by the Commercial Law Committee of the Law Council of Australia, which expressed the view that the reduction of the Crown to the same status as ordinary creditors would improve standards of commercial morality and observance of the law by corporations and their officers and this must flow from more vigilant protection by ordinary creditors of their legal rights. At the moment they are dissuaded from coming into the picture once they know that the Crown will take priority. </para>
        <para>This report of the Senate Standing Committee has been welcomed generally by all sides of the commercial and trading life of this nation. Certainly I am confident that it will be supported by employee organisations. I shall take a minute to explain why the latter is particularly so. Time and again on the bankruptcy of a person or the winding-up of an employer company sufficient funds have been found to pay only the group tax, the pay-as-you-earn instalments, due to the Commonwealth Crown. Quite commonly, all funds are absorbed in that payment. Families of employees have been left in extreme hardship because, as I said, that payment to the Crown of group tax has absorbed all available moneys. </para>
        <para>I shall give a couple of representative examples that are referred to in the report. It was reported by two very experienced liquidators that in the case of one employer- a large firm called Harry McEvoy Shoes Pty Ltd- employees were not paid the moneys due to them. One employee in particular, who had worked with the company for something like 30 years, lost his job on the winding-up of the company and received nothing; but the Crown got what was due to it. The other company which the liquidators recalled was R. G. Brooks and Sons Pty Ltd. This was a case where the Commissioner of Taxation absorbed all the moneys in hand and none of the employees received moneys due to them. Many of them had long service leave entitlements dating back 17 years. These cases are merely representative of many insolvency administrations. The proposal in the report is that the Crown should not take such priority as to disadvantage employees dependent on such assets as may be available in the winding-up of the firm. </para>

            <para>- As I understand it, most State Companies Acts provide for priority for payment of wages up to a certain level to employees and even long service leave and workers compensation entitlements before the State Crown recovers its debts. I think that is generally true. But the Commonwealth Crown has taken the view until now that, in particular, pay-as-you-earn group tax ought to take priority over the commitments of the firm to its employees and certainly to unsecured creditors who have provided goods or services to the firm in question. It is to the Commonwealth Crown that this report is directed. In fact, one may say, and I think it is said in the report, that whilst the States have been reasonably co-operative over the years and tried to reach an amicable agreement with the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth has been remiss. Therefore, the Committee was driven to quite pointedly say to the Commonwealth: 'Do not hide behind the pretence of needing to engage in further Commonwealth-State dialogue. Good faith virtually has not been shown by the Commonwealth up till now in such dialogue. Do what has to be done '. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>The beneficial impact on employees is sufficient reason to endorse this report. One could add to the reasons for the adoption of the report the problems of complexity which are revealed in its analysis, the problems of delay, and the inhibiting effect which I already have pointed out of the Crown's priority over the vigorous action which might be expected otherwise from other creditors. A further problem is that where the Crown through the Commissioner of Taxation forbears from pressing its prior debt it creates an apparent liquidity in an employer which may be very misleading to other creditors. The Commissioner of Taxation is doing what he conceives to be the fair thing in extending credit to the firm or person in difficulty but, this extension, this grace, this forbearance is unknown to the employees and to other ordinary creditors of the person or firm concerned. Thus, an apparent good situation of liquidity is portrayable by that employer or debtor to the public, and that situation can be quite misleading. </para>
        <para>Another reason to support the proposal of the Committee is that, as is revealed in its report, receivers are put in quite a dilemma in trying to reconcile conflicting Commonwealth and State legislation in this matter, to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> alluded, and this problem is so well outlined on page 38 of the report that really I can add nothing to it except to point to a letter forwarded by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr L.</inline> B. Hunter, a very prominent Sydney chartered accountant, who makes a plea to the Committee to take account of the invidious position in which he was placed by the conflicting requirements apparently imposed on him by Commonwealth and State legislation. Such a conflict may or may not be resolved by litigation but litigation in itself involves considerable delay and, what is worse, very considerable expense which further depletes the assets which are available for creditors. My main point is that every employee throughout Australia could rest assured, if this report were acted upon by the Government, that in the event of his employer being unable to meet his debts, the employee's wages and salaries up to a moderate limit and then his workers compensation and leave entitlement will be met before the Crown comes in with its claims which, under the Committee 's proposal, are to rank with those of ordinary creditors. </para>
        <para>This is the first report of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs which I have had the pleasure of perusing as a senator. It is of a remarkably high standard and my predecessors on the Committee and the officers who serviced it are to be congratulated both on their conclusions, which have found a ready response throughout the community, and for the professional way in which the proposal is argued. It is the Opposition's hope that the proposal finds favour with the Government in the very near future. </para>

          <para>-As the one who moved that the Senate take note of this report I want to thank <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button,</inline> who on a previous occasion spoke in this debate, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tate,</inline> who has made an excellent contribution to the discussion of this subject. I agree entirely with what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tate</inline> said. The Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, which looked into this matter, found it to be of considerable importance and a subject in which there was a lot of public interest despite the fact, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> said on a previous occasion, that it appeared to be a very dull subject. It is a matter which raised a great deal of attention because there was, as evidence disclosed- and considerable evidence was called- a great deal of hardship, expense and wastage of public and private money because of the effect of Crown priority over the years. The Committee has come to a unanimous conclusion and the evidence was overwhelming, from the business community and professional persons who came before the Committee, liquidators and receivers who had had the problem of trying to work with the conflicting laws which exist in the areas of bankruptcy and company liquidation. They were unanimous in the view that there was a considerable need for reform. By a very considerable majority the witnesses were of the view that the abolition of Crown priority was called for in all areas, including the major area where there was some governmental or departmental resistance, namely the area of pay-as-you-earn tax- a substantial item. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Our report shows that the cost of eliminating this priority is not great and that the saving of expense to the community is very considerable. In addition, the saving of hardship for individuals is a very important factor. I think it was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> who tonight asked whether State government rights are affected. They are not affected by this report but, as the Committee pointed out, the Commonwealth stands in a predominant position. Its claims over the deductions which it collects at the moment is the very substantial factor which often enables it to override State government claims so that they do not get met. If the Commonwealth were to come to the conclusion that this report and the recommendations in it should be accepted, it would be in a strong position to persuade the States that they also should abandon their rights because they would then stand in equal position with the Commonwealth and no doubt would gain from it. So the Commonwealth is in a powerful position to negotiate with the States if it were prepared to abandon its rights. </para>
        <para>I do not propose to say any more than what was said in tabling the statement and what the Committee said in the report. We know of the recent decision of the Government that there will be a fairly early statement by it on its attitude to the Senate Committee report. I believe that this will happen quite soon and that then will be the appropriate time to debate the whole matter at further length. The composition of the Committee has recently changed substantially. There are new and eminent recruits to its ranks such as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tate.</inline> This report was the last function of the retiring Committee. We think that it has stood up fairly well to public discussion since then and that there will be a favourable response by the Commonwealth Government to the recommendations contained in it. With those remarks I close the debate. </para>

          <para>- I do not have quite the same confidence as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wheeldon.</inline> I am only too sorry that we have not heard further from him in elucidation. The report of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs which we are now discussing is not perhaps of the same substance as the one discussed previously tonight. This is a report which the Committee made of its investigation of various annual reports which are now referred to committees to consider. I think that the report deals with eight annual reports. Before the debate closes I just want to add, shall we say, a couple of up-to-date facts on one or two matters raised in the report. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Perhaps the most substantial part of the Committee's discussion related to the annual report of the Law Reform Commission. The Committee expressed the same concern as the Law Reform Commission expressed in its report about the lack of staff and the effect it had on the Commission and on some of the other organisations with whose annual reports the Committee was concerned. The Commission expressed concern about staff ceilings and the restrictions which these ceilings imposed upon it. I think at the time of the Committee's investigation the Law Reform Commission had received some eight new references since it had commenced with a staff which had not had any increase. Of course there was an announcement in the Budget, and I regret to say that in the Estimates of the present Budget the expenditure for the Law Reform Commission only increases from $737,000 last financial year to $808,400, an increase of about nine per cent. I think there is a total salaries increase of just over $31,000, and this will enable the appointment of an additional part-time member. </para>
        <para>In the view of the Law Reform Commission there appeared to be a need for an extra five staff members. I regret that the work which the Commission can do is somewhat inhibited by the shortage of staff. If we proceed, and rightly proceed, to increase the workload which we give to the Commission- I think it is highly desirable that this be done- we have to provide it with the necessary staff. When formed the Commission had an approved establishment of 28 staff. The 1976-77 staff ceiling was set at nineteen. Of course the Commission does not have a legislative draftsman. It is very desirable that it have such a person on its staff. This is a matter which is of considerable importance. Very often the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission concern amendments of the law requiring consideration of the detail. Therefore the Commission feels the need for a legislative draftsman on its staff. As the report sets out, there are remuneration problems and problems when new commissioners are moved from one State to another and are not provided with the costs of moving. This is one particular area in the report with which we were concerned. </para>
        <para>In dealing with the annual report of the Administrative Review Council the Committee made a strong plea for greater simplicity in administrative appeals so that this was a matter in which the Administrative Review Council could be expected to make its considerable contribution. The recommendations of the Trade Commission dealt with the travel industry. I hope that honourable senators have looked at the recommendations. They raise problems which we hope have been brought to the attention of the travel industry and which we hope have since been corrected to some extent. </para>
        <para>The report of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs deals with the routine work of the Senate committees, as do the reports of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> 's Committee and others. This is an important part of our work. Not only should annual reports of the various statutory bodies be lodged with the Parliament, but they should be scrutinised by the committees of the Parliament. I think this is appreciated by the organisations themselves, as we learn from correspondence from them. It is also part of the necessary scrutiny which the Senate does and which no one else will do if we do not do it. I do not make very much of this matter but simply say that we feel that in the report we have made some interesting suggestions which we hope honourable senators will have considered. </para>

          <para>- First of all might I say how interested I was in what my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen,</inline> said about the determinations of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, of which he is  Chairman.  I believe he raised some very interesting points, and I hope that the Government will pay regard to them. I would like to say how pleased I was with the reaction of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> to parliamentary reports. I was pleased to receive a letter from him a few weeks ago saying that he had instructed his Ministers to pay regard to parliamentary reports and to inform the chairmen and the committees concerned of the action proposed to be taken by the various Ministers or departments that were referred to. I believe this is a progressive move by the present Government and one which ought to be encouraged. It is a travesty that parliamentary reports should be allowed to gather dust in the libraries of this place without any action being contemplated by the Government. I think the action by the Prime Minister is quite significant. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The report to which I allude now is the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment which it presented in June this year on annual reports referred to it. One significant point made in the report concerns staff ceilings. Whereas I appreciate the need for the Government to keep the public sector expenditure at a reasonable level, nevertheless I am critical of the Government in some areas. In the report, under the heading of the Australian Institute of Marine Science, the Committee noted that the restrictions with respect to staff ceilings appeared to be an inhibition to research in a very important area of activity to Australia. I draw attention to page 1 1 of the report, which states: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The Committee is concerned to see that because of such restrictions the Institute's staff as at 30 June 1977 totalled 60 instead of the 123 provided for in its development plan. The Institute can not be expected to properly influence national development in the field of marine science until it has at least the staff originally projected for it. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">I say that in all sincerity because it is of great consequence to Australia, particularly as we have expanded, and we have approved the extension in legislative form, our off-shore limits to 200 nautical miles. In my view this is a very important area of research and it should be encouraged by the Government, not discouraged by the restriction imposed by staff ceilings. Another point I mention at this stage relates to a statement made on page 1 1 of the report, which reads: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>This, no doubt, is in accord with the then Government's wishes when it set up the Institute in 1972. The Minister for Works at that time, when introducing the Australian Institute of Marine Science Bill in the Senate on 23 May 1972, said: 'In accordance with the recommendations of the Interim Council it is intended, in the first instance, that the Institute should concentrate initially on problems relating to the Great Barrier Reef, the Coral Sea and the coast and adjacent waters of North Queensland '. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">I support that concept. But I believe that the expertise associated with this very important Institute ought to be expanded so that the Institute can pay due regard to the totality of the off-shore area of Australia. I commend that idea to the Minister for Science <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Webster)</inline> and to the Government because I believe that in future this resource- the area that I have describedwill be of tremendous importance to Australia. </para>

          <para>- I take the opportunity to say that almost immediately the practice which the Senate has developed of sending these reports to the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment has shown some considerable reward. It means that reports which sometimes, when they come into this place, are passed without scrutiny when perhaps they contain some very important recommendations or point to some errors which have been made and which need to be debated in this place are in fact scrutinised. The report spoken of by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> and the report with which I am concerned is the report of the Australian Institute of Marine Science in North Queensland. It is important to me that it has been revealed that a substantial reduction in staff which has been caused by the imposition of staff ceilings is affecting the work of the Institute. One would have thought that a staffing priority should have been given to this Institute, especially in its formative period. The tremendous amount of research which needs to be carried out by this Institute- for many years areas of research have been neglected- makes the work of this Institute one of high priority. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Perhaps in this rather stumbling way I am getting to the point that I have raised before in this Parliament, namely, the need to do the research that will protect one of the finest eco-systems in the world. I refer to the Great Barrier Reef. The need to protect the Reef against a variety of threats has been raised many times in the Senate. The report which has come from the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment again highlights the need for the Government perhaps to review its policy on the Australian Institute of Marine Science to allow it to be staffed at the level that was recommended in the first place. If that were done, the Institute could immediately undertake research which is needed to protect the Great Barrier Reef against, for instance, the Crown of Thorns Starfish. We have not heard very much about that lately, but the threat is still there. The progression of that plague- that is the only word that one can use in connection with the Crown of Thorns starfishcontinues and is spreading to the south. </para>
        <para>We in this place have taken it for granted that, after the debates of many years and the establishment of the Institute and of the Great Barrier Reef Authority, something is being done about this threat, if not about many of the other threats. But, having established the Institute, one would have expected that it would have been staffed to the level necessary to carry out research and to investigate the root cause of the problem. But from what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> has revealed tonight in the debate on this report, it seems that there is a serious limitation on the ability of the Institute to do the work for which it has been set up to do. Also, we have heard very little from the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, other than that a marine park has been established. One of the dangers is that, having forced certain decisions to be made over a period of years, the Senate might be lulled into a sense of false security about these matters and might be led to believe that there is nothing further to be done. Therefore, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> 's report tonight should be accepted in that light. There is still much to be done by the Institute of Marine Science and I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> and members of the Government will press in their party rooms the proposal that the Institute should be staffed at its rightful level. </para>
        <para>As always happens on the night when we consider General Business, matters come upon us fairly swiftly. In debates on matters which suddenly we discover to be of interest we contribute in some small way. I will not refer to the rest of the reports which are to be presented because my remarks would then become irrelevant to this debate. But might I say that the short debate we have had tonight gives value to discussions of General Business, even though some of the issues might be dealt with rather scantily. </para>

          <para>- I enter the debate for two reasons. The first is to endorse what my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop,</inline> has said, that is, to welcome the fact that we now have this opportunity to discuss reports that have been presented and to respond to the letter which all chairmen of Senate committees have received from the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> in relation to the action which the Government proposes to take on the tabling of reports. Secondly, if a privilege is granted whereby an opportunity is made available for the discussion of reports, I think it becomes essentially the responsibility of those of us who are interested in the development of the committee system to respond to that opportunity. I think that it would be very poor if arrangements were made in our parliamentary and Senate system whereby an opportunity was provided for the discussion of Senate committee reports and we did not avail ourselves of that opportunity. We have said that the Senate committee system and the Senate committee system of reporting is good. I thing that we should show that we believe it is good. So, I respond to this opportunity to show my interest not only in the system but also in the report that is before the Senate at this moment. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I take slight issue with my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop,</inline> who made some observation about reports gathering dust in libraries. As someone who has had more than a passing interest in libraries, I think I should say to him that reports do not gather dust in libraries; they might gather dust in other places. Indeed, with their modern development, libraries have become lively, positive, active resource centres- outgoing, rather than dust collecting instrumentalities. </para>

            <para>- I note with interest, and some pleasure, the response to my observation. I respond, secondly, to the document which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> has brought to the Senate and which we are debating tonight, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> has done, by referring to one particular item within the report. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> has presented a report on behalf of the Standing Committee on Science and the Environment, in particular the report on annual reports referred to the Committee. In that document there are several references covering a wide range of Australian life and activity. I wish to refer to only one, the third annual report of the Darwin Reconstruction Commission. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>I have a little personal reluctance to entering this area, as one who is not totally identified with the Darwin situation, since we have in this chamber senators from the Northern Territory who from time to time have presented a great deal of information relative to the Darwin situation, but my response tonight is occasioned by my experience during the last few days. Honourable senators may be very well aware that in recent days there took place in Darwin the opening of the second session of the second Legislative Assembly, in which his  Excellency,  the Governor-General was involved. The  Speaker  of the House of Representatives and you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> with a parliamentary delegation from this Parliament, were in attendance and took part in the presentation of two very handsome despatch boxes. This has led me to refer to this Senate Committee report, especially to the report of the Darwin Reconstruction Commission. </para>
        <para>I note in the latter report references to the great amount of progress that has been made since the affliction of Cyclone Tracy. I visited Darwin shortly after the cyclone and have been back there since, but on this occasion I noted with great appreciation the splendid amount of development that had taken place and the total recovery, if I may say so as an observer, from what had been a devastating experience. I think one must extend every word of congratulation to the people who have been engaged in the work of the Reconstruction Commission for the splendid job they have done and for the great amount  of hope, enterprise and faith that they have put into the total reconstruction effort. It is very good that such a report should come to the Senate. Indeed, as I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> 's committee has observed, it marked the termination of the Darwin Reconstruction Commission and was the Commission's final report. </para>
        <para>The report leads us into the matter of self-government for the Northern Territory, which is a fairly simple and obvious follow-on, leading to the opening of the Legislative Assembly program last weekend by  His Excellency  the Governor-General. That occasion prompted a splendid series of functions marked by equally splendid organisation and extremely good speeches of which, if I may say so <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> yours was one, and in particular the address by <inline font-weight="bold">His Excellency, Sir Zelman</inline> Cowen. I take leave to ask the Senate whether this historic occasion might be recorded in the Senate records by the incorporation of the splendid speech made by  His Excellency  the Governor-General. A copy of that speech, which I have with me, has been shown to the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick)</inline> and the Opposition Whip. As I understand the situation, they approve its incorporation. Therefore, I would seek leave to have the document incorporated in Hansard. </para>
        <para>Leave granted. </para>
        <para class="italic">

          <para class="block">ADDRESS BY HIS EXCELLENCY SIR ZELMAN COWEN, A.K., G.C.M.G., K.St.J., Q.C., GOVERNOR-GENERAL OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA, ON THE OCCASION OF THE OPENING OF THE SECOND SESSION OF THE SECOND LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY, AT DARWIN, FRIDAY, 8 SEPTEMBER 1978 </para>
          <para>It is a great thing to take part in historic national occasions. This is certainly one of them. We are assembled in this Chamber to celebrate the establishment of self-government in the Northern Territory, and I am very happy to accept the invitation of the Chief Minister to participate in today's events, in this Chamber, in which the tasks of self-government will be undertaken. </para>
          <para>I am not a stranger to the Territory. Until my last visit, earlier this year, my knowledge of it was confined to the Top End. I first came to Darwin late in 1941 as a very junior naval officer, and I remained here for some months until early 1 942. That meant that I was here when the war with Japan began, and on the night of Pearl Harbour I was duty officer, and as the signals came in, I had to make up my mind whether to wake the Captain to inform him. I must say that there was no man with whom, or for whom, I have worked of whom I was more frightened than Captain E. P. Thomas, but I woke him up, handed him the signals, which he took calmly and meekly enough, and then presumably- for I know what went on in the houses of frightening captains- went back to bed. </para>
          <para>I was here when the air raid took place on 1 9 February, 1942. I have vivid but fragmentary recollections of that difficult day on which substantial damage was done to Darwin. I did not come again, except to pass through the airport on a number of occasions, until early 1974, when as Vice-Chancellor of the University of Queensland, I came to participate in the ceremonies associated with the opening of the Community College. On that occasion I had fruitful discussions with the Council of the College and we planned a relationship between the College and the University of Queensland which might have produced some good results. But the great wind of Cyclone Tracy blew those plans away with much else. </para>
          <para>Then, as I have said, we came on a more comprehensive official visit earlier this year. It was a great pleasure to come to the Territory as Governor-General; to meet with  His  Honour the Administrator, with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Everingham</inline> and his Ministers; and with many others, office holders and citizens, who will bear their various responsibilities in the time ahead. On that occasion, we came to Darwin and travelled to Elcho Island, to Gove and to Groote Eylandt, and then to Katherine, Tennant Creek, Alice Springs and out to the Docker River and Ayers Rock. We saw some of the great mining ventures of the Territory, very many people, and the great expanse of the Territory. It gave us some understanding of the land, and of its human and material resources and problems. It is good to be back again. </para>
          <para>On this occasion it is fitting that I should traverse some of the history, and I shall do so very briefly. The Territory has changed hands more than once: Captain Bremer took possession of the Northern Australian coastline for Great Britain, as part of New South Wales, in 1 824. Almost forty years later, in 1863, the Colonial Office gave control to the then Colony of South Australia. In the years that followed, the Northern Territory was represented in the South Australian legislature, and then in the federal parliament. Following somewhat protracted negotiations between South Australia and the Commonwealth, the Territory was transferred to the Commonwealth under the terms of the Northern Territory Acceptance Act 1910. Then it was, as the Minister for the Northern Territory, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Adermann,</inline> said in his second reading speech on the Northern Territory (Self-Government) Bill on 1 1 May of this year, that the people of the Territory lost the political rights which they enjoyed in common with other Commonwealth citizens. And as he said: </para>
          <para>In a very real sense, the constitutional history of the Northern Territory since that date reflects the endeavours of the people of the Territory to regain the rights which they lost in 1910'. </para>
          <para>It would be wearying, and it is not necessary to traverse in detail the events which have led up to the self-government which we celebrate today. The first step to representation in the federal parliament came in 1922; today, and since 1968, Northern Territory members of the House of Representatives have full and unconfined voting rights, and since 1974 there have been two Senators from the Territory. </para>
          <para>Within the Territory, a Legislative Council first met in 1948; it has evolved, and the elected strength has progressively grown with steps in 1 959 and 1 968, culminating in the establishment of a fully elected Legislative Assembly of nineteen members in 1974. </para>
          <para>Correspondingly, there have been developments in the executive branch of government. In 1910, with the transfer of the Territory to the Commonwealth, legislation provided for an Administrator. There have from time to time been changes in administrative patterns: between 1927-1931, there were two administrative areas of Central and Northern Australia, but the administrative unity of the Territory was restored in 1931. Since that time the relationship of the Administator to the Commonwealth minister has been legislatively prescribed, and as legislative institutions were established as I have related, the Administrator's place within the constitutional structure changed. In 196S he was replaced as President of the Legislative Council by an elected member. In 1 974, with the coming of the fully elected Legislative Assembly, the Administrator's Council was reconstituted to comprise the Administrator and five elected members. </para>
          <para>Under the Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act of this year, the Administrator is charged with administering the Territory in respect of transferred matters, on the advice of his Northern Territory Ministers. The Act establishes a Government of the Northern Territory with Ministers appointed by the Administrator and an Executive Council of the Northern Territory to advise the Administrator on the government of the Territory in relation to matters in respect of which the Ministers of the Territory are vested with executive authority under the Act. </para>
          <para>Even though I claim to be a constitutional lawyer, I should, as I said I would, exercise decent restraint in narrating this history. I have recited the bare bones; it is necessary to an understanding of the significance of the events which have led to the establishment of this new constitutional status for the Northern Territory. </para>
          <para>There are other things to tell, again very briefly. There were moves to establish settlements in the Top End from 1 824; Palmerston, which became Darwin, was surveyed in 1869, and a Government Resident was appointed in 1870. The population of the Territory has risen and fallen, and risen again: gold brought it to 5,000 in the early 1880s, it declined slightly and was 4,850 in 1933, but it grew rapidly after the war. In 1947 it was almost 11,000, and about 100,000 when Cyclone Tracy hit. It has risen again and now stands at about 105,000. </para>
          <para>The Territory has had its tribulations, and Cyclone Tracy was an appalling disaster. We have only to look about Darwin today to see how massive an effort was called for to make good the terrible damage. No doubt, in our rebuilding of Darwin, we have learned from experience. </para>
          <para>I think that it was fitting that the Commonwealth Minister in his speech on the second reading of the Northern Territory (Self-Government) Bill should have pointed out that successive federal governments of differing complexion have promoted the development and changing constitutional status of the Territory. He also drew attention to the economic development of the Territory: </para>
          <para>During the period (he said) there has been a burgeoning of the Territory's mineral production . . . and an increased realisation of the very great potential of the mineral wealth which, as yet, remains untapped '. </para>
          <para class="block">This is very important; the Territory's economic resource is an important factor in giving reality to consitutional development to this point, and for the future. In introducing the Bill, the Minister expressed confidence in the political and economic future of the Territory, and said that he had no doubt that the processes of responsible government set in train would operate for the benefit of the Territory and through it, the Commonwealth. I am sure that we all share that view. </para>
          <para>It was my pleasure earlier in the year to meet and to come to know the Chief Minister and his ministerial colleagues. He and they accompanied us on the various sectors of our travel through the Territory. They were warm and generous hosts. We talked of many things; of problems and of aspirations, and these young men- and they are young men- have a great and a complex responsibility for a vast Territory of comparatively small population, and there will be many problems to be faced. It seems to me that they are approaching these with vigour and with a sense of commitment and of proportion, and we wish them well. They, with their continuing burdens, and we, as fellow Australians celebrating today with them, have the rare privilege of being present at the creation, for that is what self-government is in the history of the Territory, and I have no doubt that I speak for all Australians when I express to all of the citizens of the Northern Territory our heartfelt wishes for the peace, the welfare and the good government of the Territory. </para>
          <para>I wish all Honourable Members well in their deliberations in this place and in their endeavours on behalf of the people of this Territory. </para>

            <para>- I say a few words in conclusion in relation to this report. I was privileged to attend on this occasion in my capacity as representative of the Regional Council of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. As such I was the guest of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker</inline> MacFarlane of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. This means that the branch of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association in Darwin now takes its place with all of the Australian branches, and indeed all of the branches of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, within the Australasian area. This gives it a link with not only Papua New Guinea and New Zealand but a whole range of Pacific Island states about which from time to time I have spoken in the Senate. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>The Australasian region is one of the largest and most unique in the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association throughout the world. The branch at Darwin now becomes part of that group of branches that makes its contribution not only to parliamentary matters but also through the interchange of views on governmental and political issues which go to strengthen the community of Commonwealth parliaments within our particular area of the world. I take the opportunity of making these observations in that capacity. Whilst it may not have special relevance to the report of the Darwin Reconstruction Commission, or indeed of the report of the Standing Committee on Science and the Environment, I would note the following words in the conclusion of the Commission's report:   . . a great deal of civic pride has been engendered by the physical rebuilding of the city and, nurtured by a community oriented Legislative Authority, the result will be a very beautiful Northern Gateway to Australia. </para>
        <para class="block">For these physical reasons, for economic reasons, for political reasons and indeed for Commonwealth reasons, I am glad to take the opportunity to make these few observations upon the Senate Committee's report. </para>

          <para>- The report that we have before us, from the Standing Committee on Science and the Environment, resulted in a unofficial way, from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Melzer's</inline> drawing to the attention of the Senate a program on, I believe, the Australian Broadcasting Commission's <inline font-style="italic">Four Corners</inline> which alerted the population to problems that seemed to be associated with certain pesticides. Members of the Committee felt that as one of its responsibilities was to exert a continuing surveillance of matters associated with the environment, we should take steps to inform ourselves on this matter. We decided to call before the Committee, not in a public forum but privately, members of the community who had some knowledge of the subject. Accordingly, we had discussions with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr L.</inline> R. Kentwell, First Assistant Secretary, Agriculture and Food Services Division, Department of Primary Industry; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr J.</inline> T. Snelson, Pesticides Co-ordinator, Pesticides, Agricultural Chemicals and Veterinary Drugs Section, Department of Agriculture who the day after we had discussions with him went overseas for conferences at The Hague of the world Food and Agricultural Organisation and who is regarded as a world authority on pesticides; <inline font-weight="bold">Dr W.</inline> A. Langsford, First Assistant Director-General, Public Health Division, Department of Health; <inline font-weight="bold">Dr E.</inline> G. Fitzsimmons, Director of the Toxicology Section, Department of Health and  Chairman  of the Poisons Schedule (Standing) Committee and Pesticides and Agricultural Chemicals (Standing) Sub-Committee, National Health and Medical Research Council; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr R.</inline> E. M. Wilson, a pharmacist, and Secretary, Australian Drug Evaluation Committee, Department of Health; and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr B.</inline> B. Brett, Executive Director, Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Association of Australia. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The object of this exercise was to bring some facts before the members of the Committee so that they would be in a better position to understand the problems associated with the pesticides 2,4,5-T and 2,4-D. The Committee believes that, as the matter has been the subject of examination by three State committees- one in Victoria, one in Queensland and also I understand, one in </para>
        <para class="block">South Australia- we ought to reserve our position until those reports are presented. I understand that the Victorian committee is about to report on this subject. I believe- I think this was the view expressed by the Committee- that we ought to be in a position to examine that report when it is presented and also the other reports that currently are being examined by the Queensland and South Australian governments. I believe that we will then be in a better position to assess the problems associated with this pesticide. </para>
        <para>We must bear in mind that these two pesticides have been in use in Australia for some 30 years or so. Little evidence, in my view, has been presented, to associate birth deformities with this form of pest control. The Committee, in its report, drew attention to the fact that insufficient data is collected on birth deformities in Australia. This aspect ought to be made quite clear. The Federal Department of Health and the State health departments ought to recognise the importance of collating information on birth deformities. </para>
        <para>Another point that is important with respect to pesticides and herbicides of all characters is that the labelling ought to have due regard to the people who are using the products. Many people in Australia do not fully understand the English language. Many Italians and Greeks involved in horticultural work may not be fully conversant with the English language. I believe that the Government ought to look at the possibility of providing different language interpretations of the instructions for the use of these chemicals. In many rural and agricultural areas people are not altogether familiar with the metric quantities <inline font-style="italic">of</inline> the pesticides that should be used. Whilst I recognise that the Government has taken the view that the metric system should be the standard of measurement in Australia, I believe in this instance that all labels should bear the imperial equivalents in order to avoid any misunderstanding. I make that point to the Minister for Science <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Webster)</inline> who is at the table. This is one of the areas of his responsibility. I believe that it is important for the Government to have regard to the people who are not altogether familiar with metric measurements. In this case I think we ought to insist, through the appropriate Commonwealth and State forum, that labels carry the imperial measures as well as the metric measures. </para>

          <para>- I would like to say a few words on this report. It is a holding report. The Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment points out that it is taking an interest in and is constantly scrutinising the problems involved. I am glad of that. I feel that some people are only too ready to dismiss the possibility that dangers may arise from the herbicides 2,4,5-T and 2,4-D. It seems to me that some State Ministers are even eager to anticipate reports and to come to the conclusion that there is nothing for the public to be worried about. I have taken a little interest in this matter. I have no real knowledge about it. Certain people in Victoria have been in touch with me and have given me information which makes me somewhat concerned as to whether problems are arising. I am certainly not satisfied, from the knowledge 1 have, that there is not reason for real fears. </para>

            <para>- I do not want <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> to intervene in this pleasant exchange which we are having on this side of the chamber. When I asked the question I was concerned about two areas. One related to the concern expressed in Victoria as to the reasons for the abnormal number of birth deformities in the Yarram area. Also, I had evidence given to me about a farmer living in the Kyabram district who had suffered considerable ill health for a long time following the spraying of properties in the neighbourhood. I know that medical experts were sent to his property to ascertain whether his illness could be due in any way to the effect of these herbicide sprays. Nothing has been proved, but it seems to me that what is important is that we should not regard the use of the herbicides as satisfactory because a close association has not been proved. The fact is that we ought to be overcautious, if necessary, about these matters. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>At the time I was put in possession of materials which related to an action in the United States in respect of which Judge Skopil had made an order restraining the use of one of the two herbicides in the State forests of Oregon. As a result of that decision that herbicide was no longer used in 19 forests in Oregon and Washington. The answer I received from the Minister pointed out that the reason for the judge 's decision was that an environmental impact statement had not been presented to the satisfaction of the court. That is true. The reason why such a statement was not made was that it was not ascertained that damage was not being done to crops and to people because of the use of the herbicide on the outskirts of the various forests. Since that time I have remained somewhat unconvinced by what appears to be a dismissal of the dangers associated with these two herbicides. It may well be that nothing is wrong. I recognise that both herbicides are regarded as important to the agricultural community and that they are certainly of considerable value in the removal of insects and other problems. At the same time it seems to me that more than adequate investigation should be carried out. </para>
        <para>I welcome, therefore, the fact that this Committee is keeping the matter under review. I hope that, even though we may have some dismissal of the importance of these two dangers by a number of State investigations, we will recognise that other people vehemently maintain that dangers are associated with the products. Therefore, there should be no slackening in the investigation being done by scientific experts throughout the country. We always have at the back of our minds the fact that there was no understanding of thalidomide, and other things of that nature, for some considerable time. Of course one could always show by logical reasoning that there was no proof of danger. Too often we discover rather too late in the event that there is a great deal of danger associated with some products. </para>

            <para>- I am sure there are. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> says, there are hazards associated with all pesticides. Of course there are possibilities of over-use or concentration of them. Those are certainly problems which, quite independently of what I have said already, should be investigated. Every possible method should be used to ensure that people are not over-using them and are not confused by reason of language. Those are additional issues to which I am not particularly referring but I do not in any way say that they are not of equal importance. I believe that we should look at all the evidence. We should not accept too readily what is perhaps the desire of people to give a clean bill of health to these instruments. I hope that this Committee will continue to keep an open mind on the subject, will look at the material that comes from here and abroad and will continue its investigations into this subject. For those reasons I commend the report of the investigation the Committee has made. </para>

          <para>- I am prompted by the remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> to rise to speak briefly. I believe, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> has acknowledged, that a Senate committee does a service to the Senate by bringing in a holding report in a difficult situation. I notice that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> is at present on the other side of the chamber. He will recall a reference which he gave to the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare. That Committee has only gone as far as bringing in a holding statement on the Ralkon Agricultural Co. because that is all that seemed appropriate at that stage. There is nothing wrong with a holding statement when one requires a bit more time to unravel a situation. I think that we would all be in agreement with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> in applauding this course of action. But the honourable senator has laid stress on the inappropriateness of reaching a premature conclusion that certain chemical substances are harmless. The point I want to make is quite simple. It is equally inappropriate for anyone to make any premature conclusions about substances of any kind. It is inappropriate that we make any premature conclusion that they are harmful. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I was listening to the honourable senator to see whether he would include that in his prescription that people are making premature statements as though there were established facts about these chemicals. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> by way of interjection established the point that nothing is without hazard. There is no such thing as complete safety. If one looks at some of the modern sciences developing in danger theory, one will see that it is not a question of whether things are safe but of how safe or how unsafe they are. What degree of safety are we willing to accept for certain activities? The drug penicillin is an obvious example. It is not safe. </para>

            <para>-in reply- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy President,</inline> I perhaps might close the debate which has not exactly flourished this evening. This report was debated somewhat on 8 June on a motion that the Senate take note of the report which is the fifth special report of the Joint Committee on Publications. I would not like to see the question put tonight without a reminder of the significance of this report. I hope that we may hear of something that is being done about it. It relates fundamentally to whether the laws which we pass, which are issued by the Government by way of regulation and which are not printed are actually to be brought before the notice of the public. It relates to whether the people will have an opportunity of knowing their laws and being able to read them. The situation which the Joint Committee on Publications investigated at the close of the last session was one we felt was alarming and which we felt ought to be brought carefully to the notice of the Parliament. I propose to read the summary of findings which we made on fact and which I believe require urgent attention by the Government. We took evidence and had submissions placed before us. The Committee found the following facts in its view and reported them in this interim report: </para>

I turn now to what appears in the Estimates for 1978-79 in regard to the Publications Branch of the Legislative Drafting Division of the Attorney-General 's Department. The expenditure in 1977-78 was $542,000. The estimate for 1978-79 was $650,000. But we must look at the explanations which are made. They state that although the amount provided for expenditure on this item in 1977-78 was $1,035,000, actual expenditure was only $542,464. In other words, little more than half the amount that was set aside was actually expended.

              <para>-I thank the Senate. The major recommendation is that consolidated Acts volumes hereafter should be published at fiveyearly intervals. It was felt also that the publications of the various volumes of legislation should be made available within two years of any period to which they refer- in other words, while they are still useful. There was also a number of recommendations in regard to the way in which copy is prepared and the work which the Attorney-General's Department does and a continuing review was suggested. Of course there may be different views in respect to the length of time between the consolidation of statutes. Some might think a seven-year period rather than a five-year period would be preferable. It may be costly for people such as lawyers who have to get consolidations all the time for them to be published so frequently. That is a matter of detail. The important point is that there ought to be regular cycles. It should be known that there will be consolidations and that the publications will be brought up to date. It is obvious that everything cannot be done at the one time. But the various statutory rules, ACT laws, Acts and the laws of Norfolk Island should be consolidated in a regular program so that it is known that they will be published at set periods. </para>

          <para>In this debate I emphasise that we believe that we are in a serious situation. It is no good for us in this Parliament and elsewhere to pass laws if they are not known. It is not possible to be critical of the people who are expected to obey the law if they cannot find out what is the law. It is not sufficient merely to be a lawyer. To find out what is the ACT law one has to be a treasure trove seeker as well and search for the legislation and amendments over a considerable period. This is not a satisfactory situation. I know that it sounds as though I am being extremely critical of officers who are working hard and who I am sure are overworked in trying to operate the system. I know that new methods are being employed in the publication of the legislation. This has caused some of the delays which I hope will be eliminated in the near future. I know that there are mitigating circumstances in regard to these matters but this is a matter on which there ought to be serious consideration and a determination to rectify this poor situation at the earliest possible date. </para>

            <para>- by leave- I enter this debate because I entirely support the remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen.</inline> We are dealing with the very heart of the democratic process in this respect. No laws are to be made in secret and any reasonable citizen by diligent inquiry ought to be able to ascertain his legal position. Any commercial firm ought to be able to ascertain its legal position in respect of penal legislation or legislation which confers some sort of benefit or opportunity. In a purely professional capacity as an academic lawyer I was continually frustrated by the lack of current annual volumes of Commonwealth statutes and reasonably up to date consolidations with their helpful indexes and so on. It is one thing to say that the Acts are available in separate pamphlet form; it is much more helpful to have them in volumes properly indexed and presented. </para>

          <para>I am disturbed that the Joint Committee on Publications should make findings of fact that the publication schedule is as incoherent as the Committee's conclusions would indicate. It would seem that the administration is inadequate for the task, or- let us put the responsibility where it ought to lie- that ministerial pressure or direction has been inadequate. I hope that the Minister concerned can ensure that the funds which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> pointed out were allocated to the task are used in order to remedy an intolerable situation in this democratic State. </para>

              <para>- My admission seems to have enlivened the Senate. I confess to the Senate that my responsibility in this matter is for the Australian Government Publishing Service. I was interested to see that, on page 1 8 of the report of the Joint Committee on Publications, the evidence of the Australian Government Publishing Service is quoted. It appears that the Service expressed dissatisfaction with the state of affairs and was seeking a remedy for it. Therefore, I feel confident that the AGPS will welcome the fact that this report has been promulgated. It may even regard the generous period of 12 months which the Committee has given it to come forward with some suggestions for a remedy as being unnecessarily long. </para>

          <para>It is quite clear that the Government welcomes this sort of activity by parliamentary committees. I think it has already been referred to tonight that the Government has committed itself to responding to reports such as this in a formal way in the Parliament within a period of six months. I think that is a substantial step forward for the committee system. It does mean that I, and the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Durack),</inline> who I think is the other Minister involved in the matter which is the subject of this report, will have to come back to the Senate as a matter of course and respond to the various recommendations which the Committee has made. As both of us are ex-practising solicitors or barristers, or both, we have experienced the sorts of difficulties which have been referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tate,</inline> and I would hope that that means the matter is going to get early and sympathetic consideration. </para>
          <para>May I also say that it is good to see a number of the members of the Publications Committee present in the chamber for the purpose of this debate.

              <para>- It may give you something more useful to do than whipping for the Opposition, senator. I am delighted that you are involving yourself in some constructive activity: I also note that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wharton,</inline> who presumably claims some right of paternity for this report, is also witnessing the debate. I do think it is important that these reports on which people do a lot of work should be taken seriously by the Senate when they are considered because unless that happens it seems to me that it is difficult to expect the Government to take them as seriously as the committees would like. </para>

              <para>- Unlike any previous government, this Government has undertaken that it will formally respond in the Parliament not later than six months after reports of this sort are put down, and that is something which is unprecedented. Your rather ungenerous and almost churlish response to that I think is really no contribution to this debate or to our getting more value out of parliamentary committees. I think the matters which the Committee has raised are matters which are important. I certainly undertake that the Department for which I am responsible will give the matter careful consideration. I hope that we will be able to meet some of the difficulties which the Committee has raised. </para>

            <para>-by leave- Apparently we now follow a new procedure in that the mover of the motion closes the debate and then we all seek leave to continue the debate. In closing the debate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> did such an excellent job of it that I suddenly realised that what I had considered to be merely a formal matter before the Senate turned out to be an extremely important matter. I am a new member of the Joint Committee on Publications. I was appointed to it the other day. I now realise that what I had considered to be merely a formal activity has become a very vital one indeed if one is to take into consideration the debate tonight. May I say that there was an attempt under the Labor Government to correct the situation which has been revealed. Honourable senators will recall that a considerable amount of additional funds were provided and, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> has indicated, there was a shortfall in expenditure of almost $500,000 in the updating of the consolidation. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>One must give credit to ex-Senator Murphy at the time he was Attorney-General for realising the importance of consolidating the various Acts. In fact, I have a very impressive array of books at home which began the process of this consolidation- a process which had been neglected in the past, which was considered for a while to be important and now apparently, according to what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> has said tonight, has again been neglected. Nevertheless, I think the debate tonight will prove that we ought to stimulate those persons who are responsible for this matter. It appears that the person who needs stimulation is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney.</inline> He has admitted that he has responsibility for this matter. What better stimulation can one give to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney,</inline> an ex- Whip, that he should now be on the receiving end of some advice, and that is that he should get about the job as quickly as possible and spend the $500,000 that is available- I trust that the money will be brought forwardtogether with the other $600,000, making a total of $ 1 ,100,000, to do the job that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> indicates is so important. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> referred to me as a member of the Publications Committee newly appointed, I refer to him as the Minister for Administrative Services newly appointed with a very heavy responsibility indeed. </para>

              <para>- No, I am not. As a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations I am rising to speak to the report. The Wiltona Hostel comprises a group of buildings erected between the Melbourne metropolitan cities of Williamstown and Altona. The complex is built on <inline font-style="italic">5lA</inline> hectares of land. It comprises a group of buildings which from the outside appear to be a set of two-storey flats beautifully constructed, if I may say so, in brick and giving all of the external appearance of being very desirable residences. These apparently desirable residences are in fact vacant and have to all intents and purposes been vacant since October 1972 except for a short period of occupancy as a result of the Darwin refugee problem. These vacant buildings are located in an area in which many people are living in conditions which quite frankly are intolerable. One flat was described to the Committee as a flat which had been converted from an aviary. </para>

              <para>- As the honourable senator sits near <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> I would have thought that he would have known all about it. As I said, these beautiful buildings which are vacant create among the local populace much concern because many people are living in this area in premises which ought to be condemned. The reality of the situation is that these premises are designed to accommodate altogether about 1,000 people. In fact, each of the units is specifically designed and was so designed originally by the architect with good and deliberate purpose only for temporary accommodation. To ensure that they would be for temporary accommodation only, each unit comprises one bedroom or two bedrooms and a bathroom. In fact there is no living room although one bedroom can be a convertible living room of a sort. There is no kitchen. There are no general facilities which would make it easy for these units to be converted into what we might call a flat. These buildings were constructed at a total cost of about $2.2m. The replacement value has been estimated at about $7m. Clearly, they have one specifically limited use; that is, as a migrant hostel. As I said, to all intents and purposes, apart from a short time when the buildings were used for Darwin refugees, they have been empty since October 1 972. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The problem which was given to my Committee was to investigate and report on their establishment and operation and what should be done in relation to the disposal of the hostel. Firstly, the Committee looked at the first hostel, which existed between 1949 and 1962. Immediately following the Second World War the Federal Government owned this area of land. It originally had been the car park of the Williamstown racecourse. The Commonwealth erected on this area of land an inferior type of accommodation in response to an urgent need to house a large number of migrants. Nissen-type huts were constructed. It was right and proper that that sort of building be constructed as a matter of urgency to accommodate the large number of migrants who were then flooding into Australia. </para>
          <para>What was a matter of concern to the Committee, as indicated in the report, was not the initial use of the hostel accommodation but the reconstruction of the hostel on that site. What happened was that in about 1 96 1 a large number of people throughout Australia started to complain about the type of accommodation that migrants were being forced to use. This agitation went on for a number of years. It serves to demonstrate what can happen when people become emotionally involved in lobbying the government to take certain steps to do a particular thing, such as upgrading accommodation. No doubt, the media quite rightly were involved in pointing out the type of accommodation in which migrants were being forced to live. Sympathy was coming forward for migrants to Australia. The result of all that was that in 1963 the then Cabinet agreed to a program for upgrading these hostels. No doubt as a result of departmental recommendations the Cabinet set a series of criteria. Those criteria are set out on page 6 of the report. I would like to refer to them, because they are quite fascinating. They were: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Hostels should be situated on Commonwealth owned land . . . </para>
            <para>Hostels should be chosen which already possessed adequate communal facilities (kitchens, dining rooms, stores, etc.) to save the expense of replacing them. </para>
            <para>Priority should be given to hostels where existing accommodation was of an inferior standard. </para>
            <para>Hostels should be within reach of industry which could provide suitable employment, new housing estates or home building sites, schools, shops and general community services. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">One might say that that was not an unreasonable set of criteria to establish in 1963. With hindsight, it is quite clear that Wiltona should never have been developed as a site. In fact, the site was bordered on all sides by a petrochemical and gas complex. Although the complex was not then fully developed, there were indications that it would fairly soon be fully developed. In 1978 it is clear that, although the site fitted the criteria to a T, it was a disastrous site to choose for the Commonwealth Government to spend money on. From there on, $2. 2m was spent in providing 580 rooms to accommodate about 960 people. At the same time- in other words, at the time when these buildings were being constructed- the surrounding petrochemical complex was being developed. The result is that these buildings are situated alongside a series of oil storage tanks. One would have to be quite fearful of what might happen should a fire break out. It is a situation which is clearly undesirable as a residence. </para>

              <para>- It is very difficult to say. The Committee is unable to say, because they both happened at the same time. The petrochemical plant was being developed at the same time as the migrant hostel. The migrant hostel was there in a temporary capacity at the same time as an application was being made for the construction of buildings to develop the petrochemical plant. The petrochemical plant had been approved and the buildings were to be erected when it was decided to convert the temporary hostel into a permanent hostel. The Committee was unable to say which came first- the chicken or the egg. Clearly, they both happened at the same time. Clearly, no one really applied his mind to the question whether this was a suitable area for people to live in. </para>

              <para>- We did not have that sort of town planning in those days. I pay respect to the Mayor of Williamstown, who gave evidence that one would have to acknowledge now that in those days there was a desire to get the migrants out of the local area. Some people did not want the migrants living near them. They did not want migrant hostels established in their area. Here was an ideal opportunity. The site was two miles down the road. There were no residents round about. There were open spaces which subsequently were to be developed for industrial sites. We could get rid of the migrants. </para>

              <para>- We could fumigate them out, yes. That is in effect, what happened. From there on, of course, there has been one blunder after another, until by 1972 a magnificent structure was erected. Once we started to cut back on our migrant intake and we did not need these premises for people in this capacity, the Commonwealth Government found that they were surplus to its requirements. The Committee was confronted with the problem of what to do with them. Quite clearly they are not able to be converted with any degree of economy into residential premises, even if it could be said that it was desirable that they be used for residential purposes. It would not be a sound financial proposition. There is no ready use for them by surrounding industry; there is no ready use for them for office accommodation. The Commonwealth is stuck with these premises. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I would like to refer to the fire hazard problem. The report clearly discloses that there was a conflict of evidence in relation to the use of the premises by people living in them. I do not mean their use by people using the premises throughout the day but their use by people sleeping in them overnight. I admired the courage of the  Chairman  of the Commonwealth Fire Board, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr R.</inline> G. Smith, who in the face of evidence from the Melbourne Metropolitan Fire Brigade officer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr T.</inline> H. Williamson, that in no circumstances would he approve of these premises being used for accommodation, gave evidence that in certain circumstances which he detailed and subject to certain steps being taken he felt that they could be used for accommodation. It was pointed out to him that he was putting his neck on the block and he accepted that position. I admire a public servant who is prepared to stand by his recommendations and I think <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Smith</inline> ought to be congratulated. One really would need to read the evidence to appreciate the nature of the step that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Smith</inline> took. </para>
          <para>The Committee believed that overall the consultative process and the criteria used in reaching the decision to rebuild Wiltona were inadequate. </para>
          <para class="block">One appreciates that it was not 1978; it was 1 963 when there was not the awareness of environmental factors that there is at present. Despite that, the Committee felt quite strongly that not enough consultation had taken place but also that no-one really had had a good look at it and said to themselves: 'We own this land; it meets all those requirements but do we really think we ought to spend money on this hostel for people to live in?' Having considered all the relevant factors the Committee came to the view that the hostel was being used at the moment for no purpose other than as a migrant or refugee hostel of the Commonwealth Government and that there was no other purpose for which the Commonwealth could use it. </para>
          <para>The Committee considered that the premises would be acceptable for use in that capacity subject only to three very stringent steps being taken in relation to fire precautions. They are listed on page 12 of the report: That an audible alarm system be installed in the hostel interconnected with the refinery's watchroom so that in an emergency the residents can be alerted; that procedures be established for the evacuation of the occupants, these procedures to be prepared in consultation with the fire brigade; and, finally, that an assurance be obtained from Petroleum Refineries Australia Pty Ltd that only crude oil or fuels of similar characteristics be held in or passed through tanks 800, 801 and 802 which are the tanks closest to the hostel. The Committee formed the opinion that unless and until those procedures were accepted the hostel be considered unacceptable for use, although the evidence was that the possibility of a fire occurring was very low. </para>
          <para>As to the use of the hostel, it would appear that with the current problem of refugees from Asia it may well be that the hostel will have to be used in the near future, but within the foreseeable future that problem will pass and the hostel will have to be disposed of. To that end the Committee made a number of recommendations for the disposal of the hostel. For the purpose of the Commonwealth taking action in accordance with its undertaking referred to during the debate on the previous report, the Committee recommended that in order to overcome delays brought about by protracted negotiations there should be an early meeting of the relevant Commonwealth and State Ministers and the Mayor of Williamstown to negotiate the disposal of both properties and their future use; 'both properties' being the hostel and the Williamstown rifle range which adjoins it and which is about to be disposed of by the Commonwealth Government. </para>
          <para class="block">That was the penultimate recommendation of the Committee in regard to action to be taken by the Government. </para>
          <para>Finally, I want to refer to ways of overcoming the delays caused by protracted negotiations. There have been negotiations off and on for the disposal of the hostel since October 1972 and these negotiations have not yet reached fruition. The Committee formed the opinion that it was not able to lay the blame for the delay on any particular person or organisation. It seemed that a step would be taken and the matter would sit for weeks or months and then another step would be taken, by which time the circumstances had changed so that the negotiations fell by the wayside and had to be commenced again. </para>

              <para>- Yes, perhaps they did work through solicitors. Ultimately the Committee formed the opinion that a major cause of delay had been the involvement of a large number of Commonwealth and State government departments and a local authority resulting in a bureaucratic maze and an excessive waste of time and money. That is the explanation for the delay. One cannot point to any specific department or bureaucracy, only to the conglomeration of Commonwealth, State and local government bodies passing the problem backwards and forwards from one to the other. This ultimately resulted in enormous delays in action being taken. To overcome this problem the Committee has recommended that there be a conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers together with the Mayor of Williamstown to negotiate the disposal of this property and the Williamstown rifle range at the same time. </para>

            <para>- I make only a short comment because one point should be brought out. I pay a tribute to the former Victorian senator, George Poyser. When some of us came here in the mid-1960s a lot of agitation was being spearheaded by British migrants about a number of hostels that had been constructed as far back as the early postwar years. There was a tremendous clamour and pressure was being applied to modernise hostel accommodation. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The picture that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lewis</inline> sketched came about because of slow development and the bad disposition of hostels. Listening to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lewis</inline> tonight, I found it rather ironical that when I came into this chamber with George Poyser there was tremendous agitation right across the board in Victoria from the trade union movement and from British migrants about the bad situation in hostels. I suppose because of all the agitation we got the problem to the drawing board, only to have events pass us by. I make that point because of the agitation that was known to a number of honourable senators, including that illustrious former senator from Geelong, George Poyser. </para>

            <para>- This is another report which touches on my area of responsibility, as the Department of Administrative Services has responsibility for the Wiltona Hostel. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Austin</inline> Lewis has taken the Senate very fully through the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations, and I do not think any honourable senator could be left in any doubt as to what were the facts found by the Committee and what were the recommendations of the Committee. I am grateful for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> 's intervention, which explains the circumstances of the rebuilding in 1965. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>With this report, as with all other reports, there will be an official considered Government response to the recommendations of the Committee. In some ways this report is quite cheering. Whilst criticising the fact that Wiltona was rebuilt in 1965, the Committee goes on to point out that the procedures which now govern the use of Commonwealth property would ensure that there was no repetition of such a decision. Although the Committee believes that something which was done in 1965 should not have been done, it believes that subsequent changes to procedures will not permit the mistake to recur. It is also of interest to the refugee situation in Western Australia that the Committee has seen fit to say that the temporary use of Wiltona for refugees would be OK provided precautions are taken with respect to fire. </para>
          <para>This is a matter which has come before me and which I have had to consider. I must say that the report of the Senate Committee has been part of the material which has been put before me for consideration. Once again it is an illustration of the extreme usefulness of this son of parliamentary activity. I thank the Committee for its work and look forward to responding in a more formal manner to its recommendations. </para>

          </para>
          <para class="block">The purpose of the Bill is to provide for direct matching grants, with the States, for a range of home care services, and for the salaries of approved welfare officers employed at or in association with senior citizens ' centres. The Act provides for continuation of subsidy, on a $2 for $1 basis, for the capital cost of senior citizens' centres. Thus, the Bill gives effect to policies announced at the most recent Premiers Conference which recognise that the State Governments are in the best position to assess the requirements for home care services and to determine their priorities accordingly. </para>
          <para>As announced at the Premiers Conference, the new subsidy arrangements are to have effect on and from 1 July 1978 in respect of home care services, and for welfare officer salaries for a salary period commencing on or after 1 July 1978. The States Grants (Home Care) Act was introduced in 1 969 on the basis of a recommendation made at the 1968 Health Ministers Conference. The Act broadly provides three forms of assistance: </para>
          <para>Firstly for home care service schemes which provide housekeeping and other domestic assistance to aged people in their own homes; secondly, for the building and equipping of senior citizens' centres; and thirdly, for the employment of welfare officers employed by, or in association with, senior citizens' centres. </para>
          <para>A later amendment to the Act increased the subsidy from one-half to two-thirds of expenditure through the States. The importance of locally based home care and welfare officer services for aged and infirm people is fully recognised by the Government. Indeed, provision is made for significant overall increases in assistance for domiciliary services in this year's Budget. For the States grants home care program overall, there is an increase of 12.28 per cent in the estimates for this financial year, over the expenditure for last financial year. For the home care services component of the program, there has been an 83.5 per cent increase in estimated expenditure for this year over that for the financial year 1975-76, when the Government took office. Details of Commonwealth expenditure for the past three years is set out in the following table: </para>
          <para class="block">The increased funds made available for the program, together with the changed subsidy basis has enabled new welfare officer positions and home care services to be approved for the first time since October 1975. 1 was recently able to announce that Commonwealth support could be extended to an additional 79 welfare officers and 22 home care services. Overall the Commonwealth will subsidise 191 welfare officer positions and 271 home care services. It will also be possible to consider some additional applications for home care services. This particular legislation is but one avenue of Commonwealth financial assistance for those requiring support services to continue to live independently in their own homes. Other important services include mealsonwheels, subsidised under separate legislation also administered by the Department of Social Security, expenditure on which has increased by nearly 30 per cent in the last three years, to an estimated $2. 3m this financial year, and domiciliary nursing care programs, which involved Commonwealth expenditure last financial year of $ 10.7m. The estimate for the current financial year is $ 12.1m. It has been suggested in some quarters that the Government is suddenly withdrawing from funding home care services, causing large numbers of aged and infirm people to look to nursing homes and other institutions for help. The fact is that the Commonwealth will continue to match every dollar allocated by the States for approved welfare officer and home care services. </para>
          <para>As I have already indicated, the new arrangements for the program were announced at the time of the Premiers Conference in June, and of course are fully in line with the Government's policy of federalism, which recognises that State and local governments are well placed to assume greater responsibility for locally based programs of this nature. Provided that State governments act responsibly within the framework of the federalism policy, there is no reason to believe that there will be any reduction in the level of welfare officer and home care services. Indeed, it could be anticipated that the States will allot a high priority to these services, which make a contribution to maintaining people in their own homes. The main function of a welfare officer is to provide a link between aged persons living in their own homes and domiciliary and other supportive welfare services. </para>
          <para>The activities and responsibilities of welfare officers vary according to local needs and priorities, but in general include determination of the needs of the aged population and the development of services and facilities to meet these needs; liaison with committees of senior citizens ' centres and service clubs for the purpose of establishing or extending the centres' services and facilities; supervision of the services provided; fostering co-operation and liaison among various welfare activities for aged persons and encouraging interest in these activities; and providing an education program which will encourage senior citizens' centres to promote purposeful activities. Home care services which can be subsidised under the legislation include home visiting, laundry and shopping services, home handyman and related home maintenance schemes, housekeeper and other services which complement health or welfare programs designed to enhance the independence of aged and infirm people living at home. </para>
          <para>I am sure that all honourable senators will recognise the importance of every encouragement being given to the States to maintain, and as necessary expand, their commitment to the home care program which will encourage independent living of aged and infirm people for as long as possible, and help to reduce the need for people to seek institutional care. As I have shown, it is simply not true that the Commonwealth has in some way absolved itself of responsibility in this field. Rather, the Government is seeking to build on the present partnership with State and local governments in the context of increased overall funding for these services. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

          </para>
          <para class="block">The purpose of the Bill is to extend for a further period of 12 months, those provisions of the Homeless Persons Assistance Act which are due to expire on 13 December 1978. This is to allow for full consultation with the State governments on future arrangements to meet the needs of homeless people in the light of the experience with the program to date. As honourable senators will be aware, the Homeless Persons Assistance Act was introduced in December 1974 on the basis of a report by a working party on homeless men and women. The program has been kept under close review since then, and has been the subject of specific evaluation by the Department of Social Security including careful scrutiny by the homeless persons advisory committees established in each State. A report on the process of evaluation, entitled 'A Place of Dignity' was tabled by the Minister for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Guilfoyle)</inline> on 9 June 1 978. </para>
          <para>The working party on homeless men and women recommended amongst other things, that capital grants totalling up to $5m a year should be made available over a three-year period to voluntary agencies and local statutory authorities for approved projects- such as night shelters, reception and assessment centres, hostels, flats, day centres, special clinics and detoxification units- in order to upgrade and replace existing inadequate accommodation and to build new facilities for permanently and chronically homeless men and women. </para>
          <para>The Act provides for capital grants to be made to eligible organisations, which are defined as non-profit organisations, local governing bodies and charitable or benevolent trusts, towards the full cost of purchasing, constructing or renting buildings, including the purchase of furniture and equipment. It also enables the Commonwealth to pay 50 per cent of the salary of a social welfare worker employed at a homeless persons assistance centre. Approved organisations may also be paid a daily subsidy at prescribed rates for each homeless person to whom both food and accommodation are provided, at a rate of 75c per day, and subsidy of 25c for each meal supplied to non-resident homeless persons. </para>
          <para>For the information of honourable senator's capital grants totalling $9.8m have been approved under the Act to date. Of this amount $3. 5m had actually been expended by 30 June 1978, $3. 6m has been allocated for expenditure in 1 978-79 and the remaining $2. 7m will be carried forward to 1979-80. Expenditure on rental and salary subsidies for the period from 13 December 1974 to 30 June 1978 totalled $646,665. The appropriation for these subsidies in 1978-79 is $285,000. Expenditure under the National Welfare Fund on accommodation and meal subsidies for the period from 13 December 1974 to 30 June 1978 amounted to $2.6m. Estimated expenditure on these subsidies in 1978-79 is $lm. As at 30 June 1978, financial support was being given towards the running costs of 106 homeless persons' centres, with a total bed capacity of 3,410. Subsidy made available in 1977-78 represents 990,759 people assisted. In addition 847,774 meals were served to non-resident homeless people. Salary subsidies were paid for 37 social welfare workers. </para>
          <para>The Government has no doubt about the importance of this program or its effectiveness in helping to upgrade the standard of facilities for homeless men and women in many areas of Australia. Complementary to the assistance that has been provided under this program, 76 women 's refuges have been approved for funding, at an estimated cost of some $3m this financial year, through the Community Health Program. Because of the involvement of the State governments in many aspects of services for homeless people, the Government has decided that it is appropriate at this stage to extend the Act for a further year, to allow full consultations with the States on future arrangements. This is in line with the spirit of the report of the working party on homeless men and women, which recognised the need for consultation concerning the continued development of service by all levels of government and voluntary agencies to meet the needs of homeless people. </para>
          <para>As honourable senators will recall, the Act was extended for a further period of one year from December last, so as to allow time for further development and review. The Government believes that the program is now sufficiently well established to warrant discussion with State governments on their views about the sharing of responsibilities in this area. </para>

          <para class="block">The purpose of the Bill now before the House is to extend the operation of the Nitrogenous Fertilizers Subsidy Scheme for a further year until 31 December 1979, but at a rate of subsidy reduced from $60 per tonne of nitrogen content to $40 per tonne of such content. Following consideration of the Industries Assistance Commission's recommendation in Report No. 58 dated 5 September 1975, the Government decided that the subsidy on this fertiliser was to be phased out. The measures effected by the Bill represent a further step in the implementation of this decision. </para>
          <para>The Minister for Education <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick)</inline> outlined in the Budget Speech various Government initiatives in support of rural industry, including the provision of an amount of $ 10m for continuation of this subsidy for a further year. The level of subsidy to apply after 3 1 December 1979 will be considered by the Government in the light of economic circumstances prevailing nearer to that time. The Bill proposes that from 1 January 1979 to 31 December 1979 subsidy will be payable at the reduced rate in respect of locally produced nitrogenous fertilisers which are sold for use in Australia as fertiliser and also in respect of imported nitrogenous fertilisers which are either used in Australia as a fertiliser by the importer or are sold by the importer for such use in Australia.

          <para>- When this report was put down on 24 August I made some comments before seeking leave to continue my remarks later. This evening I want to follow on from where I left off. I think it is unfortunate that the Budget has superseded some of the statements made in this report. In my remarks on 24 August I referred to the amount of money which we thought was to be available over a period of five years under the National Water Resources (Financial Assistance) Act. I quote from page 8 of the report, in which it is stated: </para>
        </talk.start>
        <quote>
          <para>The recent National Water Resources (Financial Assistance) Act 1978 has re-introduced direct Commonwealth assistance to the States for development projects and initially $200m will be provided over the next five years encompassing all aspects of water resources management for which Commonwealth assistance is considered appropriate. The areas set out in the Act are conservation and distribution works, water quality management, desalination of agricultural land, flood mitigation, and flood plain management and studies or investigations relating to all aspects of the assessment and utilisation of Australia's water resources. The Commonwealth has not announced any further details of the operation of this program. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">In view of the fact that the national water resources legislation had been passed by the </para>
        <para class="block">Parliament in March this year, the Committee was of the opinion that if that $2 00m was to be distributed over five years it would have meant that an amount of $40m would have been provided each year for the implementation of the proposals contained in the National Water Resources (Financial Assistance) Act. But unfortunately this was not to be so. During the course of the hearings and on-site inspections by our Committee, we had brought home to us, I think very forcibly, the very desperate need for money to be expended on Australia 's water resources in the States that we visited. I commend the enthusiasm of the people in the Grafton area, the Bundaberg area, the Mackay area around Townsville, in the Riverina district of New South Wales around Deniliquin and Wakool and in the Sunraysia area of Victoria, which encompasses Mildura. I think that the people who accompanied our Committee on our inspections and when we took public evidence brought home to the Committee most forcibly and most enthusiastically the need for a greater amount of money to be expended on water resources in these areas. </para>
        <para>As I pointed out on 24 August in my brief remarks on this mater, as a South Australian I was very disappointed that the people who depend solely on the Murray in the Riverland of South Australia had not seen fit to make a submission to our Committee. Of course, as they did not make a submission we did not make any onsite inspections in the Riverland of South Australia where, in my view, we could have gained a lot of knowledge which we could have included in our report and in our recommendations to the Government. I hope that the Government will take note of the recommendations that have been made in the report. I will not refer to all of them because it would take too long. I will refer to the ones which in my view are most pertinent. The recommendations are set out in chapter 1 1 of the report at page 62. Firstly, under the heading 'The Commonwealth's role', we stated in the report: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>In order to effectively meet its current and future responsibilities and obligations in the assessment, planning and development of Australia's water resources the Committee recommends that the Commonwealth should: make a clear statement of the areas and objectives of the National Water Policy Statement that will constitute the Commonwealth's water policy; </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">In my view, and I would say in the view of the members of the Committee, that should be done at the earliest opportunity. Another of the most important recommendations was that the Commonwealth should separate its policy and nonpolicy water functions. The Committee recommended that the Department of National Development should have primary responsibility for Commonwealth water resources policy. We explained why on page 56 of the report. I will not go back to that tonight. In the report under the heading 'Development and funding', we state that the Commonwealth should:   . . develop the National Water Resources (Financial Assistance) Act 1978 as the principal means of providing financial assistance to the States for water resources development and that the $200 million upper limit of the live year rolling program be reviewed annually based on the priorities established by the States; </para>
        <para class="block">A lot of confusion exists in the minds of the people whom we saw during our on-site inspections as to the real allocation and the method of allocating this $200 million under this Act. Many of the people to whom we spoke thought that either they or their State governments would have access to that $200m and that the people in the various regional areas could then nominate where the money was to be spent. Of course, this is not so. I think that some of them were very disturbed when we had to explain to them that the $200m was to be spread over five years and was to be shared among all the States involved under the Act. Of course, great surprise was expressed because these people could see that the projects that they had in mind were not going to come to fruition for a great number of years. </para>
        <para>Unfortunately, during the debate on the national water resources legislation it was inferred, both in the other place and in this place, that the $200m would be a direct grant to be shared by the States. It took quite a lot of probing on my part during the debate on this legislation in this chamber to elicit from the Minister who was responsible that in fact this was not so. I am pleased that now it has actually been spelled out in the Budget- I am going to quote the appropriate section- that in fact it will not be a direct grant, as many people were led to believe. I turn to page 120 of Budget Paper No. 1, where this amount of $200m is mentioned under the heading 'Irrigation and Other Pastoral Water Projects'. The following is stated under that heading: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Expenditure under this heading comprises Commonwealth assistance to the States for rural water conservation, irrigation and flood mitigation. Assistance is to be provided to the States for these purposes in 1978-79 under the National Water Resources Program (NWRP) announced in November 1977. This program, which will extend over five years, provides for a Commonwealth contribution of $200 million as grants and/or loans for water related purposes in the States . . . </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">This has created a lot of confusion in the minds of the people who thought that the Commonwealth in fact was going to fund them by way of direct grant to the extent of $200m. This has proved not to be the case. About 70 per cent of that money will be provided to the various States on loan at the bond rate of interest and approximately 30 per cent will be provided by direct grant to the various States. As I said, this caused quite an amount of dismay among people when we advised them of this. </para>
        <para>When we look further in the Budget Paper we see that the amount allocated for water projects is going to cause people, particularly people in the irrigation areas in my view, despite the recommendations in our report, some more heartburning. If we look at page 1 1 5 of Budget Paper No. 1 we see the amount of money that has been expended over the past few years for irrigation and other pastoral water projects. We find that on irrigation the actual expenditure in 1976-77 was $18.6m; in 1977-78 it was $10.3m; and in 1978-79 the estimated expenditure is down to $2. 8m. So the estimated expenditure for 1978-79 for irrigation purposes throughout the Commonwealth, which is partly funded by the Federal Government represents a drop of $7. 5m from the expenditure of the previous year. Of course, last year saw a drop of $8. 3m in expenditure from that of the previous financial year. So the problem appears to be that the Commonwealth is tightening up very severely on money that it is making available for water resources. I think that this will cause great concern. </para>
        <para>If we look at page 1 1 1 of that Budget Paper, under the heading 'Urban Water Supply' we find that the money made available for this purpose has again been drastically reduced in this Budget. We find from a table on that page that in 1976-77 actual expenditure amounted to $35. 7m and in 1977-78 it amounted to $27. 8m, representing a drop of some $8m in 12 months. Then we find that the estimated expenditure for this financial year, 1978-79, is $12. 3m, representing a drop of $15. 5m. So there we have it: In the Budget itself there are drastic cuts in the provision of money for water resources projects throughout the Commonwealth. I only hope that when the Minister for National Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Newman)</inline> reads this report and transmits our recommendations to the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard)</inline> for the next Budget, the Government will see that there is a desperate requirement that the expenditure on the provision of water resources be upgraded to a great extent. I would hope that that could perhaps be done by way of the supplementary Bills that are brought down in the autumn, or even by way of a mini-Budget, if it is necessary. Such provision is most essential. </para>
        <para>I would hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas,</inline> who is the  Chairman  of the Committee and a Government supporter, would stress as strongly as he can within his party the need for extra finance to be made available for water resources in Australia. I hope that the honourable senator will do that. I will conclude my remarks by expressing that hope. </para>

          <para>- I shall speak only briefly. I firstly thank <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> not only for his remarks but also for the enthusiasm which he portrayed in the investigation of this important subject. He, together with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Robertson</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Maunsell,</inline> showed special interest in this matter, and I would thank them for their contribution. I personally, in common with other Chairmen of Senate standing committees, appreciate the new policy that has been announced by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> that the relevant Minister will respond to these reports. I assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> that I shall be pushing as hard as possible for the adoption of not only that part of the report but all of its recommendations. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>We have a good precedent in that the first inquiry that was carried out by the Committee, upon its establishment in March 1976, was into solar energy, and all of its major recommendations on that subject have been adopted by the Government. I would also mention that currently the Committee is investigating the adequacy of quarantine and other control measures to protect the Australian pastoral industry from the introduction of exotic livestock and plant diseases. There is no doubt in my mind- certainly there is none in the minds of my Committee- that we could not do anywhere near the job that we do without the assistance of the staff. We are all pretty busy and have other duties to perform in the Senate, and the staff renders extremely valuable assistance to us. </para>
        <para>The terms of reference of this inquiry into water resources underline a problem that is not shared by other committees: Almost without exception, areas of natural resources come within the purview and\/or responsibility of the States. Most of the matters that are looked at by other committees are within the responsibility of the Commonwealth. This fact was strongly underlined in regard to the question of water resources. The two main parts of the terms of reference- apart from the requirement to look at the assessment, planning, development and management of Australia's water resourceswere to examine in detail the diverse responsibilities of the Commonwealth and the States, and the national water policy statement recently endorsed by the Australian Water Resources Council. </para>
        <para class="block">It took us about 18 months to complete the inquiry. We received 80-odd submissions and 40 organisations, represented by 61 persons, presented further evidence to us. The largest single group which gave evidence to the Committee was from the sugar producing area of Queensland. I pointed out to them- not being completely facetious- that when they ran out of water in Queensland the Ord River of Western Australia was a wonderful place to grow sugar. They did not appreciate that very much. The problem in Queensland is quite dramatic. As is well recognised, it is a highly decentralised State and these large sugar-producing areas on the coast of Queensland are becoming extremely short of water. The growth and expansion of the sugar industry when world prices were very high encouraged the rapid development of the industry of those major cities along the coast- so much so that the water table is dramatically lower than it was in earlier years. Many of the aquifers are drying up and sea water is flowing in to take their place. When one thinks of towns such as Townsville, which has a population of almost 100,000, facing a critical water problem, one understands the gravity of the situation. </para>
        <para>Another matter which we considered, and which involves quite serious consequences, is the situation of the River Murray. No one is better equipped than is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> to appreciate that fact because the State of South Australia, especially its capital city of Adelaide, is so reliant on the water from that river. The salinity problem is of major seriousness and in that regard I should like to quote briefly from the text of the report- not necessarily the recommendation- wherein we set out our concern. We consider that the River Murray Commission, as it is structured now, is totally inadequate to deal with the salinity problems of that river. The report reads: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The Committee considers that the River Murray Commission is not an appropriate body to undertake concerted, long-term action to deal with the problems of salinity, water logging, despoliation of wetlands and saline drainage into the River Murray. The salinity problems associated with irrigation have their origin in the catchments or lands adjacent to the rivers over which the existing River Murray Commission has no control. </para>
          <para>The problems of the River Murray are of national significance and the Committee considers that there is an urgent and vital role for the Commonwealth in respect of the development and preservation of the River Murray Basin. The Commonwealth should take the initiative through the Australian Water Resources Council in preparing and implementing a long-term comprehensive program for the management of River Murray salinity problems including regulation of land use as well as water management. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">Then the report goes on to make specific recommendations. As I said before, the constitutional responsibility for water matters rests almost entirely with the respective States. The only areas for which the Commonwealth is specifically responsible are those of meteorological observations, in the Commonwealth Territories, and in the field of foreign affairs. It is rather interesting to recall that the Commonwealth has been involved in water matters for only a relatively short time- only since the Australian Water Resources Council was established some 1 3 years ago. The role of the Commonwealth has expanded quite dramatically since then and the financial assistance provided under section 96 grants has been the main vehicle for that assistance. I underline, particularly in regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren's</inline> remarks, the fact that an important part of the National Water Resources (Financial Assistance) Act is that the Commonwealth will fund certain projects which, however, must be high on a State's list of priorities. We regard it as very important that the States themselves should support the projects that the Commonwealth wishes to support. </para>
        <para>One of the problems in the past- this is a matter of which the Committee was very critical- has been the ad hoc approach of the Commonwealth to major water resources projects. One does not have to look any further than the Burdekin Dam in Queensland to illustrate that point. In fact, it seems that the best way to ensure that a dam will be at least started is to hold an election. I recall one of the better known sayings of my friend Bert Kelly, the recently retired member for Wakefield who is known far and wide in Australia. When he could feel an election approaching he would say: 'I can feel a dam coming on'. </para>
        <para>As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> said, the first of our recommendations was that the Commonwealth establish a clearly stated water resources policy. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> also said, we recommended that the policy and non-policy functions of the Commonwealth be separated. We must establish a bureau of water resources to handle the nonpolicy functions of the Commonwealth's interest in water resources. One of the important functions of the Commonwealth with regard to water resources is in the area of the Bureau of Meteorology. We were quite disappointed with the evidence we received, particularly from the States which, without exception, were quite critical of the role of the Bureau of Meteorology in the area of recording and the other areas for which it is responsible in regard to water. We recognise, of course, that the Bureau has many areas of interest other than water. For the purposes of those functions with regard to water, we recommend that the Bureau be transferred from the Department of Science into the Department of National Development and that its water functions be part of a separate independent statutory authority. </para>
        <para>I say again that we were particularly disturbed to find that the Commonwealth seems to lack a clearly stated water policy. This is one of the most important things we found. We made altogether 34 recommendations. There is not time tonight to go through them all. They come under several headings: The Commonwealth's role, the assessment of water resources, development and funding, research, the Australian Water Resources Council, flood mitigation and drainage and salinity. One of the recommendations was that the Government should avoid impinging on what have been and are regarded as State responsibilities. A great deal of duplication has occurred in the past, particularly in the area of the assessment of major schemes where it is recognised by the Commonwealth and the States that the main expertise rests with the States. The States have experienced people. There should not be any duplication on the part of the Commonwealth in the assessment of these major schemes. </para>
        <para>We also had a bit to say about the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation- another Commonwealth responsibility. The CSIRO has nine divisions which have some major or minor interest in water matters. We recommend that the Commonwealth try to concentrate its interests in water matters into fewer departments. In fact, at the moment 22 Commonwealth departments and agencies have some interest in water. The States certainly are showing us the way in this regard. They are concentrating water matters in either one or two departments. This is not happening in the Commonwealth area. It is not happening in the CSIRO or the Bureau of Meteorology. Because water is so important and will be of greater importance in the future and could be a limiting factor in many potential production areas in Australia, we recommended that CSIRO set up a separate division of water resources and, just as importantly, establish a mechanism above the divisional level to co-ordinate the work that is already going on in relation to existing water resources. </para>
        <para>It was an interesting inquiry. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> said, we were sorry that we did not receive submissions from the Riverland area in South Australia. That area feels the effects of the salinity in the River Murray and the shortages of water more than any other part of South Australia or any part of New South Wales or Victoria. We were grateful that the relevant Commonwealth departments were so complete in their co-operation with us. In fact, this is probably the only Senate committee inquiry that has had submissions from every State in Australia. The States have a great deal of expertise and interest in water matters. They have a constitutional role. The Committee is of the opinion that the constitutional role should be maintained. </para>

          <para>-In the short time I have available tonight to continue my remarks on this subject I inform the Senate that the members of the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare, like many other people in the community, consider that the report is a very good one. We consider that the report is very important and should be carefully considered by the community and by the Government in particular. For that reason we intend to keep the debate on the Notice Paper for as long as we can. I give fair warning of that. </para>

            <para>- We are very anxious to get <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chipp</inline> into the debate. For many years he has spoken frequently on this subject without as far as we know, giving any definitive views as yet. We think it is important that he and his colleague give some definitive views. So, we will give him the opportunity to do so. When the  Chairman  of the Committee and I last spoke on this matter we pointed out that this report had been very well received in various quarters. Some people did not appreciate it because some of our recommendations may have threatened some of their interests. It is important that Senate committees bring down reports as a result of evidence and careful and considered thought. Although we must consider the interests of others, we must not let them affect our reports and our thoughts on the effects of various drugs on the community. </para>

        <para>Because of the short time available to me and so that I can continue my remarks later, I will inform the Senate of some of the reactions we have received to this report. I refer, firstly, to a letter from Robert L. DuPont, M.D., who is the Director of the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Administration in the Department of Health, Education and Welfare in the United States. He writes: </para>
        <quote>
          <para class="block">Dear <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Baume:</inline></para>
          <para>Thank you for sending me a copy of your very thoughtful report, <inline font-style="italic">D rug Problems in Australia- an intoxicated society? I</inline> and others on our staff were struck by the willingness of the Committee to thoroughly explore the implications of drug abuse regardless of whether it is abuse of a licit or illicit substance. Moreover, the report does not shrink from making some uncommonly sound recommendations with respect to public policy in terms of discouraging all recreational drug use. Your emphasis on alcohol and tobacco as <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> drugs of most serious abuse is also a much needed-recognition of the relative importance of the various types of drug use from a public health standpoint. </para>
