            <para>- I ask the Minister representing the Treasurer: Is it a fact that section 26AAA of the Income Tax Assessment Act, introduced by the Whitlam Labor Government in 1974, imposes a capital gains tax on profits made within a 12-month period and subjects them to a penalty tax at the taxpayer&#39;s marginal rate of income tax as high as 60 per cent? Does the imposition of this penalty apply to all gains including those on homes sold for any reason other than forced sales in connection with changes of employment? Does this narrow definition exclude self-employed people and penalise people who, by reason of a change to their business operations or financial requirements, are forced to change their residential status? If so, is this not discriminatory? More generally, will the Government consider also the disincentive effect on investment of a tax of 60 per cent with a view to lowering the effective rate of tax applicable under this section? </para>

I am well aware that honourable members and honourable senators on this side of the Parliament had something strong to say about it. I am well aware that many parts of section 26, including section 26AAA, are controversial. I do not have a specific response to some of the nuances that have been raised but I will take them on board.

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations. I remind the Minister of recent statements by the Prime Minister to the effect that it is the responsibility of the business community to get the economy moving again and I refer the Minister to reports that the Special Youth Employment Training Scheme is becoming increasingly susceptible to abuse by companies. I ask: Is it a fact that employers are misusing the scheme by retrenching young people when the six months subsidised training period ends and replacing them with other people? What information does the Minister have in his possession regarding this practice? What does the Government propose to do to make it more difficult for employers to abuse this system? </para>

            <para>-My attention and the attention of the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations have been drawn to an article in, I think, the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> of today in relation to this matter, which seems to be the foundation for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button&#39;s</inline> question. I understand that is the basis of the information which the honourable senator is seeking. I have before me some details about the Special Youth Employment Training Scheme which I think indicate that overall it has been successful. Since the introduction of this scheme more than 40,000 young people who previously had been unemployed have been assisted. As at 30 March of this year some 19,000 young people were being assisted by the scheme, compared with only 6,000 young people being assisted by it as at March of last year. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>It is the view of the Government, based upon its monitoring of the scheme, that it has been a successful scheme and has provided practical onthejob training for a significant number of people. The survey conducted by the Department, which seems to be the one to which the article in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> refers, indicates that 59 per cent of the youth trainees under the scheme have obtained permanent employment with some employer but not necessarily the employer to whom they had been assigned under the training scheme. Obviously there has been a wastage in the sense that the balance of the trainees have not obtained permanent employment. Nevertheless they have obtained a good deal of on-the-job training in skills which otherwise they would not have received. As far as their employability is concerned, another aspect of the survey in relation to the trainees themselves is relevant. The survey showed that by and large the trainees were poorly qualified and had worked in few jobs since leaving school. Twenty per cent of them had had no work experience at all. Therefore, I think, one has to have regard to the lack of skills amongst the trainees when they started under this scheme. It would be a bit unreasonable to expect the scheme to be 100 per cent successful in its efforts. However, the question as to whether employers are taking advantage of the scheme and disposing of people at the end of their six months is one that I know the Minister and his Department have been concerned to watch and monitor. I am quite satisfied that they will continue to do so. </para>

That is something on which the Minister, with respect, did not see fit to touch. </para>

              <para>- I will direct that aspect of the question to the attention of the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, but I did say that the officials of the Department had been monitoring the scheme. When I was last asked a question on this subject- admittedly some time ago- I indicated that there was no such evidence. I repeat that 40,000 or more people are being assisted under the scheme. I will ascertain whether there is now any need to reflect further on the answer I then gave. </para>

            <para>- I saw the report, which reflects the increasing number of comments being made throughout the community by both parents and academics that the quality of preparation of students, especially in the basic skills of numeracy and literacy, is not good enough for modern-day needs. The debate becomes clouded by arguments, offered in a defensive fashion, as to whether the preparation is worse than before or better than before. That is quite irrelevant. The only thing that matters is whether we are producing students, at all levels of the education journey, of rising educational quality, and sufficiently effective to take the next step in the journey. Because the Commonwealth Government is concerned in this matter, a great deal of action has been taken to see what can be done. The Williams Committee of Inquiry itself, which will bring in its report in July or August, is looking at all aspects of education in terms of goals, both for human fulfilment and vocational training. No doubt it will have a lot to say on this matter of preparation. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The training of students will be a focal point of the national inquiry into all aspects of teacher education which the Government will be setting up in the immediate future. Discussions with the States have focussed on this matter. As I have repeatedly said in the Senate and elsewhere, the goal ought to be one of uplifting quality. There has been in the post-war years an erroneous belief that we gain better education by gaining more education. That is a fallacy in itself. We gain better education by increasing the quality and relevance of education. In regard to the failure rates in the universities, I do not have before me a comparison of world standards. I shall have a hard look at the whole question of the performance of students and universities. There are many reasons for drop-outs. </para>
          <para>If my memory serves me correctly, the article suggested that universities and colleges recruit students of lower levels of education to keep up their numbers. I simply say this: There is no mileage for universities and colleges to do that. The grants from the Commonwealth Government to universities are based on levels of student load set by the Tertiary Education Commission and, at present, are based on constant intakes. The important point to make is that any increases in enrolments by individual institutions beyond these levels do not result in an increase in the levels of funds provided. So the inference that one is chasing numbers in institutions may be refuted by the fact that the Tertiary Education Commission is a watchdog which tends to watch that situation. Indeed there is no gain for the universities or the colleges as they have to carry the extra expense themselves. But I come back to the fundamental issue of this matter. </para>

              <para>- Yes, on federalism. I draw his attention to a couple of things. First of all, there is the Commonwealth Government&#39;s approach to the seas and submerged lands legislation whereunder the High Court has given all power to the Commonwealth Government. Yet the Commonwealth Government says that because it believes many functions can be done better at the State level or by co-operation, irrespective of the constitutional position, there will be co-operative federalism. No better lesson than that could be studied by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt.</inline></para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I also draw his attention to the fact that operative federalism means that there will be the same growth rate in growth revenue, namely personal income tax, as in revenue sharing and allocation to local government. There are numerous examples. Suffice to say that by contrast with the bitter and corrosive centralism of the Whitlam Government there have been enormous strides in co-operation with the States. At least we have a dialogue with the States whereas there was a Whitlam brutalised monologue during a bitter and unhappy three years of centralism. </para>

            <para>- Is the Minister representing the Minister for Health aware that under the medical benefits tables there is no provision for reimbursement for the purchase of dental mouthguards by sports men and women? As the use of mouthguards in contact sports almost totally reduces the incidence of dental damage and the resultant cost of remedial treatment, conservatively estimated at $300 per tooth for plugging and capping, does the Minister agree that preventive dentistry costing approximately $30 is sound economic sense? If so, I ask the Minister to give the most serious consideration to amending the schedule to include reimbursement of the cost of this essential equipment and thus encourage its use which to date has been restricted for financial reasons. </para>

            <para>- I direct my question to the Minister for Science. I draw his attention to a warning issued in Tasmania relating to the treatment of timber with copper chrome arsenate, or CCA as it is known. The use of this chemical as a preservative and white ant deterrent is becoming widespread and timber which has been treated with this chemical is used extensively in children&#39;s playgrounds and in the construction of log cabins. Will the Minister have officers of the CSIRO issue a warning to the users of timber so treated at places where this timber is distributed that the timber scraps treated with CCA should never be used in indoor fires, household incinerators or barbeques as the fumes and smoke can cause extreme discomfort and even asphyxiation? </para>

            <para>- I am unaware of the concern in Tasmania about this problem which the honourable senator has disclosed. I have certainly been associated with the burning of off cuts that have been treated with various preservatives. However, I am unaware of the problem that could occur as a result of the use of the preservative that the honourable senator has mentioned. I will take up his request and see that the matter is looked at. Should it be found necessary we will attempt to have warnings given, but I should imagine that that would be fairly difficult. Nevertheless, if it is shown that asphyxiation could follow the burning of such timber, certainly the honourable senator&#39;s advice should be followed. </para>

            <para>- Is the Minister representing the Prime Minister aware of the existence in the United States of America of what is termed sunset&#39; legislation which was first instituted in the State of Colorado in 1976 and which is now followed in 22 other States? Is he aware that under this legislation all government agencies are automatically disbanded or placed under review after a set period of years and that this has acted to rid the country of a number of redundant, outmoded or forgotten statutory bodies? In view of this development I ask: Firstly, does any public list exist in Australia which details the statutory boards, authorities, commissions, committees and advisory councils currently in operation? Secondly, in the interests of keeping a constant check on the relevance of these bodies, is the Government willing to consider the relevance and applicability of America&#39;s &#39;sunset&#39; legislation to Australia? </para>

            <para>-There is nothing terribly new about &#39;sunset&#39; legislation. As the honourable senator will recall, it was part of the settlement after the glorious revolution in about 1680 that the Army Act of England had to be renewed each year. I suppose that was one of the first pieces of &#39;sunset&#39; legislation. I do not think that our American cousins in Colorado have been so clever in inventing this operation. As I understand it, the charter of the British Broadcasting Corporation comes up for automatic inspection and renewal every 10 years. The BBC has a life of but 10 years at a time. The Parliament must investigate whether it ought to be renewed. As the honourable senator will know, it has been renewed a number of times over the last 50 years. </para>

          <para>The honourable senator will also know that a number of Bills will be introduced in this session of Parliament, particularly those imposing levies in the primary industry area, which will operate for a year at a time. This applies to the pig slaughter levy and the levy on wool and wheat. To some extent that son of &#39;sunset&#39; legislation exists within this Parliament. The honourable senator also asked whether there was any public list of statutory bodies. I understand that the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations chaired by our colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae,</inline> put together a list of all statutory corporations created by the Parliament which it was able to ascertain. My brief states that they can be found by looking through the Commonwealth Government Directory but I understand that this is what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> &#39;s Committee did and that it did not discover all of them. The honourable senator may not be aware that on 1 1 April the Prime Minister answered a question by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Roger</inline> Johnston in relation to this matter. He said: </para>

I preface it by saying that no doubt the Minister regularly hears, officially and unofficially, of situations in which people who collect unemployment benefit are also working, usually for cash, so that the Government loses not only from the payment of unemployment benefit but also by way of tax not being paid. In view of the cost of unemployment benefit to the taxpayers of this country, has the Government considered offering a reward to those people who help the Commonwealth Police to counter cases where people are breaking the law? </para>

            <para>- A person is determined to be eligible for unemployment benefit on the basis of the passing of a work test which is conducted by the Commonwealth Employment Service and an income test which is the responsibility of my Department. Where advice is received that a person does not comply with either of those tests he is not eligible to receive unemployment benefit. My Department is constantly aware of its responsibility to pay benefits to those people who are eligible and to terminate the benefits being paid to those people who are not eligible. Information is received by my Department from a variety of sources. Sometimes it is in the returns that are made by a claimant himself. In other cases field officer investigations reveal additional information. The Commonwealth Employment Service is also an agent for the Government in this matter. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>People who work and receive cash payments for doing so should disclose that when making an income statement to my Department through the Commonwealth Employment Service. The failure to pay taxation on such cash payments is a matter for the Treasurer. I am sure that he has methods of ascertaining whether taxation is being paid on an equitable basis by all Australians. My Department has not considered offering rewards to people who provide such information. I believe there would be some resentment in the Australian community if a reward were offered by the Government in the cases mentioned by the honourable senator. However, there have been numerous occasions on which my Department has received, either anonymously or from named persons, information about other pensioners or beneficiaries. The Department, in its judgment, follows up the advice given to it and makes whatever inquiries are considered necessary. I believe that the matter of taxation is one that should be dealt with by the Treasurer. I will see that his attention is drawn to that part of the question. </para>

When will the Minister announce new appointments to the Social Security Appeals Tribunals which are below operating strength? On what grounds did the Minister refuse to reinstate <inline font-weight="bold">Mr John</inline> Waters, who resigned from a tribunal to contest the Northern Territory seat as a Labor candidate, having been assured that normal Public Service procedure would be followed if he did not win the seat and that he would be reappointed? </para>

            <para>- I am at present considering appointments to the Social Security Appeals Tribunals in Victoria and Tasmania. There are vacancies on those Tribunals due to resignations and I expect to be making an early announcement about replacements. The Minister appoints persons to serve on the Tribunals. The requirements and procedures of the Public Service do not come into the appointments to the Social Security Appeals Tribunals. It will be recalled that these tribunals were set up by the previous Labor Government. Members are appointed to them by the Minister. They are not appointed for a particular time; they are appointed at the Minister&#39;s discretion. In the case of some of the tribunals, opportunities have been taken to change the membership in order to provide a balance. The best and most effective tribunal appointments are made in all cases. I advise the honourable senator that the matter of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr John</inline> Waters would not come within the ambit of Public Service procedure; rather, it should be understood that these appointments are made personally by the Minister. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry. Does the Minister recall that the Minister for Primary Industry stated in a Press release dated 5 July 1977 that an interim beef producers consultative group nominated by producer organisations was to be set up to enable the October 1977 target date for the formation of the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation to be met, but that arrangements would be made for an elected producer consultative group to succeed the interim body by March 1978? Is it a fact that those elections have not been held? Is it also a fact that the Minister last month wrote to producer group leaders saying that those elections should now be delayed and reviewed at the end of 1978 on the grounds, firstly, that the cost involved was $250,000; secondly, that not all producer organisations supported the concept of an elected producer consultative group; and, thirdly, that the Stage 1 report on amalgamation of producer groups called for the establishment of a federal cattle council to provide the membership of the producer consultative group? </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Was the Government prepared to meet the cost of these elections when the Minister promised an elected producer consultative group last year? If so, why does he now use that as an objection to the Government&#39;s keeping its promise? Is it not a fact that the Government was aware at the time it promised an elected producer consultative group and set up the interim group that the proposal did not have unanimous support of producer groups but nevertheless had strong majority support? In what way has the situation changed that that objection is used now when it was not considered of sufficient importance last year to prevent the formation of a producer consultative group? Is it not a fact that the proposal for a cattle council is at this stage only a proposal, that its achievement is in the distant future and that there is some doubt that it will ever be achieved? If so, how can the Government justify using this as a reason for not meeting a commitment which should have been fulfilled two months ago? </para>

            <para>-The honourable senator asked a fairly involved question of me in my capacity as the representive of another Minister. I accept the fact as put forward by the honourable senator that the Minister announced the setting up of an interim beef producers consultative group in 1977. I imagine it follows that if in March of this year the Minister indicated in writing that he did not think it appropriate that that proposal should go forward because he had been informed that there was not unanimous support for it within producer groups and it needed revision, that is why the group has not been set up. I think the main thrust of the honourable senator&#39;s question was: If the Government envisaged 12 months ago that the cost of setting up a particular consultative group would be $250,000, why is it not prepared to go ahead with the proposal at the present time? I cannot answer that part of the question. I think I should seek a proper answer for the honourable senator from the Minister for Primary Industry. I will attempt to do that today. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister for Science or perhaps to the Minister representing the Minister for Industry and Commerce. Is it a fact that Australia has been neglectful in researching and developing its marine resources? If so, does this mean that Australia is at a serious disadvantage when it declares its 200-mile exclusive economic zone? Is Australia making any effort to overcome what appears to be an acute lack of knowledge and appreciation of the enormous food resources at its doorstep? </para>

            <para>- The honourable senator&#39;s question has much truth in it. The development and a comprehensive knowledge of the oceans and their movement, a knowledge of the resources of the waters, a knowledge of the geology of the floor of the ocean and what is beneath the floor of the ocean obviously are most important matters for any country, and particularly for Australia. Further, I think it is obvious that at present there is no comprehensive knowledge of this enormous area of interest. To this point of Australia&#39;s history, we have concentrated on developing the resources of the land over which we have control. It is certainly my view that there is a great void in our knowledge of the area over which we are likely to proclaim control in the near future. I do not think the answer can be taken to mean that Australia is neglectful of that responsibility, but certainly there is a lot to be done. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I refer to some of the important things that are taking place. I imagine the average person thinks of the food resources within the water. Over past years it has been my responsibility and that of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation in particular to take action in this field. Some of the recent finds have been most important, particularly to fishermen in the honourable senator&#39;s State of Tasmania. We have gained a knowledge of the tides, the currents, the wind action and the sediment movement in the ocean. At present fishermen are taking advantage of this knowledge. I understand that as a result of current research by CSIRO, tuna fishermen are now using sea temperature front information for the purpose of deciding when they will go out and catch fish. All fishermen should take note of this most important matter. </para>
          <para>As honourable senators may know, currently Australia is expending sizable amounts of money, through CSIRO, to build up a knowledge of our marine resources. We have two vessels on lease which are working off the coast of New South Wales. One of these vessels has just completed a survey of the rock lobster resources in Western Australia. We have done quite a deal of work in the Northern Territory relating to prawns. At the moment CSIRO is putting forward a submission to Cabinet for the acquisition of a vessel for oceanographic purposes. It may take some years to get the vessel. In earlier statements I said that marine research is proceeding in the waters between here and our territory in Antarctica. We are seeking an ice strengthened vessel for that purpose. It will include a platform to study marine science and oceanography. In short, at present Australia is doing a great deal for this country in this important area of resources. </para>

I refer to research grants to the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation&#39;s Fisheries and Oceanography Division. Is the study of the protective effect of selenium against the toxic action of mercury compounds in fish important? Is it the practice to permit the interruption of research projects such as this to give personnel engaged on them an opportunity to take sabbatical leave? If not, what were the circumstances which allowed the project supervisor of this study to take sabbatical leave during the course of it? Would it not have been better if he had deferred the sabbatical leave until the research project had been completed? What will be the additional costs to the project as a result of the rise in the consumer price index during this deferment? </para>

As the question relates to the whole area of leave, so it would also concern my colleague the Minister for Education. I am not certain of this, but I do not think that sabbatical leave applies within the CSIRO. Obviously long service leave and other provisions would apply within that statutory authority. I am unable to say whether the leader of the project to which reference has been made has taken leave. I was not aware of any interruption to an ongoing program. I am confident that the CSIRO is capable of managing its affairs so that if the leader of a project were to take leave those who understudy him would be able to continue the project. I shall certainly take up the matter immediately and find out whether there is any disruption to the program mentioned by the honourable senator. </para>

            <para>- I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. Whilst many people have considerable sympathy for migrants and, particularly, refugees coming to Australia, such as those from Timor and Vietnam, they are becoming increasingly alarmed at the continuous flow of foreign boats landing at Darwin or on the northern coast and escaping the scrutiny of our immigration and quarantine officials until they are close to shore or have actually made a landfall. With this in mind, is it correct that yet another vessel has arrived in the Darwin area? Considering the number of vessels that have already landed since the end of the monsoon season, does the Government expect possibly even larger numbers to arrive in the next few months with the consequent possibility of introducing serious and contagious diseases to both humans and animals? As these people are now deliberately by-passing immigration officials based in South East Asia, will the Government consider setting up a quarantine area, say on an off-shore northern island, to carry out full investigations as to quarantine and their backgrounds in an effort to safeguard Australia for the reasons I have outlined? </para>

            <para>- It is a fact that a number of boats have arrived in Australia under the circumstances mentioned by the honourable senator but it is not entirely true to say that boats arrive undetected. They are detected at reasonable distances from Australia and they are escorted, as was the boat which arrived in the last 24 hours. The quarantine precautions, in relation to which the Department of Health is the expert authority, are regarded by that Department as being fully effective. Those who are members of the Estimates Committee dealing with the estimates for the Department of Health will recall that advice was given this week by the officers of that Department on the quarantine precautions that are taken. </para>

          <para>The question of the setting up of a quarantine area in, say, an off-shore area such as a northern island is one of the options under consideration by the Department of Health and I do say on behalf of the Minister that the Department regards the quarantine precautions as being of primary importance at present. As I said, the Department regards them as being fully effective and it will have under consideration an off-shore island on which it may be able to undertake precautions with greater effectiveness than is presently the case. </para>

I ask the Minister whether she is aware that parents of young children attending the Oakbank Kindergarten in the Adelaide Hills are greatly concerned that the hours of operation of this kindergarten have been reduced from a full day to a half day, that children under four years of age are no longer accepted and that staff are being relocated due to a reduction in Federal funding for the employment of kindergarten teachers. In view of the problems I have outlined, can the Minister give an assurance that there will be sufficient funding in this year&#39;s Budget to restore the level of Federal funding to the 1974-75 level of 72 per cent from the now reduced level of 50 per cent for kindergarten teachers &#39;salaries? </para>

The Commonwealth Government, through the Office of Child Care, makes a contribution to pre-school education. It makes that contribution in the form of block funds and any State is able to decide which kindergartens will receive funding at a particular time. If there are the problems at the Oakbank Kindergarten that have been mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren,</inline> it could be that that kindergarten should apply to the State Government for increased funds to enable it to provide a satisfactory service. </para>

It could be that pre-school education is not receiving the emphasis in that State that many people would desire. </para>

              <para>- The block funding arrangement was designed in such a way as to give the States in the past year precisely the funds that they had had in the previous year. How a State government applies those funds is a matter for its own determination. The block funding arrangement was introduced at a time when the new federalism proposals gave to every State government increased general grants which the States could apply as they wished. As I said earlier, it may be that the State of South Australia does not accord to pre-school education the priority that it is accorded in, for instance, the State of Victoria. </para>

            <para>- I acknowledge that the honourable senator asked a question of me on this matter in March. It is my recollection that a letter went to him in April giving him an answer to his question. The Australian Dairy Corporation, in consultation with appropriate sectors of the industry, has been giving consideration to the introduction of a blended butter-vegetable oil spread for the Australian market. That consideration has been continuing for some time. My recollection is that some years ago a volume of this material was produced in South Australia, that some 400 tons were shipped to an overseas destination, that the consignment became rancid or otherwise unsatisfactory before it arrived at its destination and that difficulties in introducing a proper blend have been experienced since that time. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>As the honourable senator will know, there has been considerable debate within the dairy industry over a number of years as to the benefits or otherwise that might flow to the industry through introduction to the domestic market of such a blend. I understand that after a close analysis of all available facts the Corporation decided at a meeting on, I believe, 30 March last, to seek ministerial approval for the provision of funds from, I think, the Dairying Industry Stabilisation Fund to enable a large-scale test marketing of the blended product to be made. The recommendations of the Corporation are presently being examined by the Department of Primary Industry. The major impediment to the development of&#34; a blended product has been the uncertainty about consumer reaction to such a product and the difficulties experienced in obtaining from manufacturers details which would enable the likely costs of producing a particular product to be determined. If I can obtain any further information for the senator I will do so. </para>

            <para>-My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Industry and Commerce. The Minister will recall that about a month ago I asked him when the Industries Assistance Commission&#39;s report on the whitegoods industry could be expected. He advised me at that time that he did not know but that he would seek the information and let me have it. I now ask the Minister: Has the Government considered further the IAC&#39;s report of 21 November 1977 on the tourist accommodation industry, as promised by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fife</inline> on 5 March last. Will the Minister ascertain and advise me whether the Department of Industry and Commerce has yet consulted the tourist accommodation industry on the IAC&#39;s recommendations as was undertaken also by the two Ministers on 5 March? If so, can he indicate the result of those discussions on the matters that were outlined in the Minister&#39;s statement? </para>

          <para>-Yesterday and today <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> asked for certain detailed information regarding essentially the nuclear codes Bill. I sought that information and I now offer the following advice that I have received: The Prime Minister wrote to all Premiers on 3 1 August 1 977 concerning the Government&#39;s decision to develop a uniform code of practice to apply to all uranium mining activities in Australia and to any future nuclear activities. He also said that it was essential that the task of developing elements of the code should take place as a joint exercise with the States and invited participation by State officials. I quote the relevant paragraph of the letter: </para>

        <para class="block">I draw attention specifically to the fact that it was the development of the elements of the code that should be the joint exercise.

            <para>asked about responses from the States. Each of the six States has responded by asking for a deferral. The Government has looked at the responses of the States and agreed, in the light of these requests, that the important sections of the codes Bill, that is, sections 1 1 and 13 which give the Commonwealth the power to apply codes in the States, be proclaimed only in relation to the Northern Territory and not the States until there has been opportunity for considering the States&#39; views on the Bill. I repeat, therefore, that there will be ample opportunities in that regard. Comments on the codes Bill and any of the other uranium Bills have been requested urgently. </para>

        <para>There are basic reasons, of course, for proceeding with the passage of the legislation through the Parliament now. It is important that the development of the Ranger uranium deposit be able to proceed this dry season. Quick passage is also important in the context of the Commonwealth&#39;s negotiations with the Northern Land Council on aspects of the development of the Ranger deposit. When all comments have been received from the States and the Territory there will be a meeting of officials for CommonwealthState consultation. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> I seek leave to incorporate the letter in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline></para>

        <para class="block">My dear Premier, </para>
        <para>In my statement announcing the Commonwealth Government&#39;s decision on uranium mining I referred to our decision to develop a uniform Code of Practice to apply to all uranium mining activities in Australia and to any future nuclear activities. The Government has taken this decision because of its concern to ensure nationwide protection of Australians and their environment from the hazards of such activities. </para>
        <para>Initially, the Code will be developed to cover uranium mining, milling and transport. You will be aware that one element of this Code relating to radiation protection in the mining and milling of radioactive ores has already been prepared in consultation with State authorities, unions, and the mining industry. My Government is concerned to see radiation protection measures fully implemented nationwide and that further work be carried out to specify standards and control measures to protect the environment. </para>
        <para>The Ranger Inquiry recommended that the existing element of the Code referred to above should be made mandatory by legislation. My Government has decided to accept this recommendation but to go further and, together with the States, to establish by legislation a uniform national Code which covers all aspects of mining and milling of uranium as well as any future nuclear activities. </para>
        <para>I recognise the contribution which State authorities have already made in this field and believe that it is essential that this task of developing further elements of the Code take place as a joint exercise and to this end I invite participation in this work by officials of your State. </para>
        <para>Because the Code will comprehend a number of different areas of concern at the Federal level, I have decided to establish a Commonwealth Interdepartmental Committee to develop elements of the Code. </para>
        <para>Arrangements will also be set in hand to ensure that industry is fully informed and consulted in the development of the Code. I anticipate that as the Code evolves satisfactory transition periods will be established for existing industrial activity in the field. </para>
        <para>At the Federal level I have asked the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development to coordinate action on the development of the Code. However, the matter is one of such significance that the Ministers for National Resources, Health and myself will also be involved. I suggest that you might wish to designate a Minister in your own Government as the contact point for further correspondence on this matter. </para>

The answer to his question is that the Australian standard white is not traded on the Chicago futures exchange. The Australian Wheat Board can trade on the Chicago futures exchange but whether it does or not is commercial information and, further, no price has been announced. The honourable senator could see earlier comments relating to this matter. There were no discounts which would alter the earlier figures mentioned in the Minister&#39;s statement. It is the policy of the board not to announce precise details of prices received for individual contracts. </para>

          </para>
          <para>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Commonwealth Banks Act to enable the Commonwealth Development Bank of Australia to lend to all kinds of businesses. The present restrictions which confine its lending to the rural, tourism and industrial sectors will be removed. The amendments will enable the Commonwealth Development Bank to extend its lending to the establishment or development of undertakings in business sectors such as retailing, wholesaling, professional services, entertainment and the service industries generally. As at present, the bank will continue to be required to give emphasis to the provision of finance for small business undertakings. </para>
          <para>Honourable senators will recall that these proposed changes were first announced on 13 October last year when the then Treasurer and the then Minister for Industry and Commerce made a comprehensive statement on small business finance to Parliament. The Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Treasurer also released a Press Statement concerning the proposed amendments on 28 February this year. In the October 1977 statement, the Ministers announced a series of measures designed to assist small business, including extending the activities of the Australian Industry Development Corporation and the provision of equity finance by the Development Bank. These aspects are under close examination and consultations are being undertaken with relevant financial institutions. It is expected that a further announcement will be made at a later stage. </para>
          <para>The Government has responded to the increasing concern in the business community about the adequacy of funds for small business growth and development. In May 1977, a task force was set up to investigate the question of finance for small business. A report was subsequently submitted to the Government. In its deliberations, the Government has been assisted considerably by the Government members&#39; Small Bussiness Sub-committee. This Government recognises the vital part played by small businesses in our economy. Their contribution in terms of employment, growth, innovation and enterprise has by now been well documented. The widening of the charter of the Development Bank provided for by this Bill represents a further step in a series of initiatives by the Government to ensure that small businesses are assisted towards realising their full potential. </para>
          <para>It is expected that the Development Bank will be in a position to implement the expanded lending activities shortly after the legislation is enacted. As is the case under the Development Bank&#39;s present charter, prospective borrowers will need to establish, to the satisfaction of the bank, that the finance sought is not otherwise available on reasonable and suitable terms and conditions. In determining whether to provide finance, the Development Bank will continue to have regard primarily to the prospects of the operations becoming, or continuing to be, successful and will not necessarily have regard to the value of the relevant security. To what extent additional funds may be required for the Development Bank&#39;s entry into this wider field of operations cannot be determined at this stage, but the position will be closely watched. </para>
          <para>I turn now to the specific provisions of the Bill. The Development Bank&#39;s functions are set out in section 72 of the Act which, in brief, enables the bank to provide finance for persons for the purposes of primary production or for the establishment or development of industrial and tourist undertakings. The amendments to section 72 will enable the bank to provide finance for the establishment or development of business undertakings, by removing the present restriction which confines it to financing only industrial and tourist undertakings. Its function of lending for the purposes of primary production remains unchanged. The amendments to section 72 will also extend the Development Bank&#39;s role of providing advice and assistance to the full range of business undertakings that will be eligible to borrow from it. </para>
          <para>The Government regards this measure to expand the functions of the Development Bank as a substantial element in its overall program for the encouragement of small businesses. The Government has also decided to take the opportunity to introduce two further amendments to the Commonwealth Banks Act. At present section 84 of the Act provides that, except with the consent of the Treasurer, the Development Bank shall not borrow a total of more than $4m from the Reserve Bank of Australia and shall not borrow moneys repayable in a currency other than Australian currency. In practice the Development Bank has sought the Treasurer&#39;s approval for all its domestic public borrowings; it has not borrowed from overseas. It is now proposed to replace section 84 with a new section 85 A that wil simply make the Treasurer&#39;s consent a formal requirement. At the same time the new provision has been brought into line with the comparable standard provision in other legislation with respect to statutory authorities. To enable the Development Bank to continue to borrow from the Commonwealth Trading Bank or the Commonwealth Savings Bank for short-term liquidity purposes without having to obtain Ministerial approval on each occasion, the Treasurer proposes to give the bank a general authority for such borrowings. </para>
          <para>The other amendment relates to section 1 1 1 of the Act. Section 1 1 1 provides for officers to borrow from the Commonwealth Trading Bank or the Commonwealth Savings Bank for housing purposes. It also provides for officers to borrow for other purposes from the trading bank where the managing director of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation is satisfied that special circumstances exist. The latter loans are subject to a limit of $1,500 and are made upon such terms and conditions as the managing director thinks fit. They are normally provided to assist in the purchase of cars used by station or in connection with bank business. I emphasise that staff cannot borrow from the Commonwealth banks other than in accordance with these provisions. </para>
          <para>In view of changed money values since the present limit of $1,500 was set in 1968, the Government has agreed to the Commonwealth Banking Corporation&#39;s request to increase it to $5,000. The proposed limit would be consistent with the current standards for staff loans by the private banking institutions and non-bank financial intermediaries. In line with current practice, the amendment to increase the limit will provide for future changes in the limit to be prescribed by regulation. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

          <para>- I want to speak in the adjournment debtate for a few moments. I use as a subject the Iwasaki takeover in Queensland. I feel that unless this Parliament does something about the Iwasaki land deals in Queensland there could be a scandal of international proportions if the Federal Government does not intervene. The Queensland Premier has now become a dealer in real estate. He has used the notorious franchise agreement. This is the second time that the notorious franchise agreement has been used in Queensland. The other occasion when it was used related to the mining takeover of the Mount Larcom farming area, a subject on which I spoke here some months ago. In this case the Iwasaki Sangyo company has now taken control of over 20,000 acres of choice land on the Queensland coast at virtually bargain prices. </para>

As it was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collard</inline> who interjected, he might ask some of his friends in his own party in Queensland why they are suddenly speculating in a certain area.

        <para>The whole deal is very shady and has been carried out with the utmost secrecy. The greatest tragedy is that there has been no effective environmental impact study and the adjacent wet lands will be ruined. The wet lands constitute the main breeding area for a thriving fish and prawn industry which is currently worth about $3m annually and, totally unsubsidised keeps nearly 200 people in almost permanent employment. Two major requirements so far as this Government is concerned are foreign investment controls and the need to comply with federal environmental impact study legislation. There appears to be some reluctance by the Federal Government to intervene. Is this because of the political mauling it received at the hands of Premier Petersen over the Aurukun and Mornington Island affair? I received a telegram today from a member of the Northern Land Council which stated: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Present Qld Bill re Aurukun Mornington completely unacceptable to Aboriginal people in this State. Our people refuse to be brought with propositions of beads and trinkets. We demand Federal Government acquire all Aboriginal reserves in Qld. We will settle for nothing less than freehold land ownership. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">It is signed by Monty Pryor, the  President  of the Land Rights Committee. I refer to the telegram because 20,000-plus acres have been sold to a Japanese national whereas in the case of Aurukun and Mornington Island there is no desire to do the same sort of deal. If the Federal Government fails to take immediate action in accordance with existing federal legislation, the Commonwealth Government will have to share responsibility with the Queensland Government for the social, cultural, economic and ecological disaster that will result from the IwasakiPetersen deal if it goes through in its present form. I have a map here which I am prepared to table if anyone is interested enough to have a look. It shows that the Thomasson area- it is known locally as the bog land- will be one of the areas in which the Iwasaki project will operate. </para>

            <para>- I will make reference to that matter in a moment. I will identify the area which is below the high tide mark where some 1 5 feet of fill is to be dumped. Obviously in the long term that will be a canal area. In simple terms 8,280 hectares or 20,687 acres will come under the control of this organisation. Some 4,700 hectares or 1 1,749 acres will be freehold. Provision is made under the new franchise agreement for this area to be extended considerably. The sum paid was in the vicinity of $3,050 an acre but the price offering in other areas is $ 1 50,000 per acre, as I mentioned a moment ago. I have photographs showing what will happen to the area. If anyone would like to inspect them they are available. I am prepared to table them. </para>

              <inline font-style="italic">-Unfortunately Hansard</inline>has not the facility to be able to reproduce them. The photographs show the damage that will happen to this area. The bog lands area to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collard</inline> referred rather derogatorily a few moments ago is a breeding area for the local fishing and prawning industries. Up to 200 jobs are available on boats which operate as a result of the fish and prawns that breed in the area. In 1976-77 the industry returned $3m. New onshore freezing and prawn receival facilities are being installed. The Queensland Fisheries Service is doubling its capacity at present. The Queensland United Foods Co. is also increasing its capacity to handle the product. The fishermen have not asked for government subsidy at this time when the economy is running at a low level. The fishing industry, in fact, has trebled its output in the last three years. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>The bog lands are a marine nursery for the prawns and produce 70 per cent of the catch for the fishing industry based on Yeppoon. The industry fishes an area 35 miles north and 35 miles south of Yeppoon. This fact has been confirmed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Don</inline> Tuma, a marine biologist with the Queensland Fisheries Department. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Iwasaki</inline> has stated that the average elevation of the developable property is 1.3 to 1.5 metres below the high water mark. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hinze,</inline> the Local Government Minister in the Queensland Parliament, says that this area will be land filled to a depth of 15 feet. This will destroy totally the marine nursery and, therefore, the prawn fishing industry. This is what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O</inline> &#39;Byrne forecast a few moments ago. </para>
        <para>A whole number of questions need to be answered. I will list a number of them which I think ought to receive some sort of public exposition. I will not speak at length. One wonders why <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Iwasaki</inline> is so insistent that he have freehold land. The Aboriginals at Aurukun and Mornington Island have only a 50 year leasehold with no right of renewal. I wonder too why the Queensland Government, through its Local Government Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hinze,</inline> is resuming the 260 acres of beach front land for freehold sale to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Iwasaki</inline> when Australians, both black and white, cannot purchase it. This reminds me of places like Archer River and the caravan park at Ayr. I could speak at length on that too. The franchise agreement is overriding both State and local government requirements. This is precisely what has happened in the Mount Larcom area where the cement companies are trying to exploit the rich clays. </para>
        <para>The development project cannot proceed despite the Queensland franchise agreement if the Federal Government is prepared to make sure that Federal requirements are satisfied. I hope that this will happen because I know that in this chamber, and particularly on the Government side, many smart remarks are passed about the </para>
        <para class="block">Queensland Government and its Premier, but there is a real responsibility on this Parliament and this Government to do something about this proposed development. The State environmental impact study does not meet the Federal environmental impact study standards, and until such time as the Federal standards have been met and a public inquiry has been held under Federal legislation no decision should be taken at the Federal level. As far as we know the only environmental impact study that has been carried out is that which has been done by the purchasing company. Maps of the area that were supposed to be readily available to people interested in the project are not available and the issue of them has been refused by the State Government. I and many other people in the area in particular would like to know why Federal Ministers have not had an opportunity to meet with the opponents to the project, when both <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Iwasaki</inline> and the Premier of Queensland have had the opportunity to put their case. One could almost say that there might be some fear involved in view of recent confrontation about a Federal meeting. </para>
        <para>We want to know what the impact of such a major tourist resort will have on the surrounding area in social and human terms. Yeppoon, the little town which is in the area, has a population of about 5,000 people, but the proposed project will cover a vast area and the employees will mostly be Japanese. I know that there have been stories to the contrary but there is nothing in writing, there is no documentation. So it appears that the Australian employees of the company will mostly carry out only the menial jobs. Will <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Iwasaki</inline> run this operation as he runs operations in Japan, where he has a notorious reputation for being opposed to trade unions, with all aspects of the resort, including transport, hotels and everything else, under monopoly control? There is no guarantee that the development of the major hotel will go ahead because it first of all has to be shown to be a viable proposition. Under these circumstances one can ask what sort of employment will be available to Australians. I think the position will be as I said it would be a moment ago. </para>
        <para>With regard to Federal requirements on foreign investment, has a proposal been received by the Foreign Investment Review Board? The responsible Minister has been very coy about this. He has not made any public statements on it at all, but if the Foreign Investment Review Board or the Reserve Bank of Australia has made any recommendations on this to the Federal Government we ought to know about them because these are the things on which the Premier of Queensland is being carried away. The Windmill Plains- a boglands area- is a habitat for a number of migratory birds. I hope that the Federal Government will stick to the JapanAustralia Migratory Birds Treaty, or will it allow the habitat of these birds to be destroyed? That is one reason why a Federal environmental study is vitally necessary. I have here a number of documents which shortly I will seek to have incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> Earlier I tried to contact you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> and the Minister for Education <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick)</inline> but you both were engaged on other matters. I can assure you that there are no four letter words in the documents. They are in the main technical tables. I hope that when I ask for leave to incorporate them in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> it will be granted. </para>

            <para>-Thank you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Minister.</inline> Queenslanders want to know why the Iwasaki Company has been allowed to bulldoze a road through four kilometres of Crown land. This was done some weeks ago. If any Australian company, organisation or person had done that without the protection of the State Government umbrella it would have been severely penalised. We want to know what is the Tropico Syndicate. The Tropico Syndicate has taken up an area of the land, and apparently it is a front for the Japanese company. We also want to know how much land is owned by other organisations which may be acting as nominees or fronts for the company. The company has already shown contempt for State legislation by illegally bulldozing the road to which I referred over four kilometres of vacant Crown land at Sandy Point which already has caused the destruction of mangroves in the Corio Bay Fish Habitat Reserve and interference with Beach Erosion Control District No. 15. Some of the recommendations that have been made by the State Government recently have not been implemented, and it looks as though this may have been the result of a prior arrangement with the developing company. This action raises the serious question of whether the Government should be prepared to agree to a reduction in authority over the Crown land areas totalling 3,511 hectares which the franchise agreement will vest in the Iwasaki Company, particularly as freehold title is to be offered for most of this land, and that is a very important point. It also raises a very important principle so far is the sale of Crown land is concerned. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>Almost the entire Crown land area is low-lying wetlands or unstable sand dunes. We know from past experience in my own State in particular that when sand dunes are disturbed by sand mining or for any other reason the local area is almost totally destroyed, particularly the indigenous plants and insect life. Frequently the bird life in the area is destroyed or otherwise disturbed. A map released by the State Minister for Local Government and Main Roads, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hinze,</inline> indicates that proposed special leases may involve an area of Fishing Creek presently within the Fish Habitat Reserve. Fishing Creek is another very reliable breeding ground, as is set out quite clearly on the map. The special lease to be transferred from the Tropico Syndicate is almost entirely covered by dense mangroves and tidal channels. The Iwasaki plans to date indicate that this will lead to the total destruction of this area. It is not only the environmentalists who are disturbed; the local professional and amateur fishermen, boards, sportsmen and others are also disturbed about this aspect. </para>
        <para>Freehold title is being offered for the extensive wetlands areas- this is the area that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collard</inline> referred to a while ago as rubbish landpresently under grazing leases. Consequently damage to it at the present time is not great, but under the proposed development damage to the area will be extensive. Freehold lands held by the company contain wetlands and sand ridge areas which are unsuitable for intensive development and subdivision. Those are a number of the points that I have deliberately raised. I want to make reference to two or three short statements which have been made by organisations which are concerned about the proposed development. Firstly, the Littoral Society had this to say: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The area is presently of immense importance to the commercial fisheries of the Capricorn Coast. Corio Bay is the most important known banana prawn nursery area on the east Australian coast. As the Capricorn Coast is increasingly used for public recreation, it is also of rapidly expanding importance to recreational fisheries. The Corio Bay mangrove forests are extremely varied, making it one of the most scientifically and educationally important mangrove areas south of Ingham. The wetlands of the Bay are a stopover feeding area for at least 26 of the 66 bird species listed in the Australian Government Agreement with Japan to protect migratory birds. </para>

        <para class="block">Another point that I want to make is that apparently, unfortunately, there has been some prior arrangement between the Premier and the operating company. Just before I touch on that I want to refer to what the Queensland Conservation Council said in one of the papers that it distributed on the proposed project. It said: </para>

        <para>Then it went on to refer to some of the points I made a moment ago. I want particularly to refer again to the Crown land area and the low lying wetlands or unstable sand dunes. If a deal has been made by the Premier, the Premier ought to come clean and not only tell the Queensland people about it but tell the Australian Government why he is doing these things and what the background to the deal is. </para>

        <para>The franchise agreement was originally introduced to stifle the local government body and to block six years of opposition by the majority of the local people. There is grave doubt as to whether this project will have long term benefits to the people living in that area. A number of other questions will have to be answered. I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> will be happy when I say that there is nothing racial in what I have to state in relation to large numbers of Japanese coming in to work this project, when our immigration policy has been seriously restrictive and when we have such a high unemployment content in the local population. There is no guarantee that the project will be proceeded with according to plans and if one looks at the Press statements made by the Premier, in particular, and by other people in general, that fact is quite clearly borne out. There is no guarantee that the Canal Estate will not be establishedthat is where the fill is going into the boglands  area- and there is no guarantee that the beach will be open to the public in spite of a belated promise by the Minister for Local Government and Main Roads. As far as I know- certainly this is the case in Queensland- there is at the moment no beach that is not open to the public, even on the famous Gold Coast. If what is proposed does eventuate parts of that area which local residents, have used for many, many years will be closed to them. </para>

The people feel that there ought to be greater investigation of this project and, if it is proceeded with, certain safeguards should be introduced. I refer in particular to a public meeting of the Capricorn Coast Protection Council which 350 people attended, and at which the resolutions in this document were carried by 341 votes to nine.

            <para>-Yes, by him, but what are the consequences of that act? It will mean that he will have the right to subdivide a large tract of land and sell it off in his own market- in Japan, Hong Kong and other powerful financial centres in the East. There is a possibility that Australian citizens will have to compete, for land surrounding this resort at Yeppoon, against the power of the yen, which is considerably stronger than that of the Australian dollar and, for that matter, the United States dollar. What has happened in Queensland, and what needs to be investigated from a national point of view, is that the facility of freehold has been made available to aliens. Without being racist, I think it is necessary to find out what is happening, because of that very alienation, in Queensland. Is our land being alienated? In what direction is this freehold control flowing? Is it strongly in favour of the United States? Will it be strongly in favour of Japanese involvement in regard to this project? To what extent are Australians particularly Queenslanders, being disadvantaged? Will Australians be in competition with foreigners for the purchase of their own land? </para>

        <para>There are some unusual aspects of this proposition. For example, there is the closing of the beach, which is an aspect from which the Queensland Government has withdrawn slightly. It says now that the beach will be available from dawn to dusk. What will happen after that period? What is the definition of &#39;beach&#39; under the contract? All these matters need to be investigated before the Australian Government gives the right of exchange support to this project. All I am saying is that it is necessary for this Parliament to debate this project and to risk, shall we say, charges, which comes strangely from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bjelke-Petersen,</inline> that we are racist in our attitude. All I can say is that I would resist any section of Queensland or Australia becoming a special section in which people who are not Australian nationals have a definite advantage. I do not doubt that some honourable senators have travelled to Sri Lanka. They would have found that certain luxury developments have taken place in Sri Lanka for the benefit of foreigners and to the disadvantage of the indigenous people, who look from the outside at the luxury that has been developed for the benefit of overseas visitors. That is a concept that I do not want to see developed anywhere in Australia. Another concept I do not want to see developed anywhere in Australia is the concept of Australians being denied the right to benefits from and enjoy their environment. All these matters need to be taken into consideration. Originally the Iwasaki project provided for an exclusion, an unusual exclusion- from the beach front. As I have said, there has been a movement away from that. But the original intention was to exclude outsiders from the beach. I think that I have made the point that before this project is allowed to proceed it ought to be a matter of investigation, it ought to be a matter of debate and it ought to be the subject of a statement by the Ministers concerned. </para>

          <para>- I seek the indulgence of the Senate to raise what I feel is a very important issue. In the transfer of powers from the Federal Government to the Northern Territory one must expect that there will be some problems. It is an unusual situation and, of course, we have little precedence to guide us. It is about one of these problems that I wish to speak tonight. I believe that the Federal Government has a responsibility to help to resolve any of the problems that arise in this situation. I feel that it has a responsibility to what one might call the fledgling government of the Northern Territory- the Legislative Assembly- to assist it wherever it can with its expertise. The Federal Government has a responsibility also to individuals in the Northern Territory, particularly those individuals whom its departments have recruited over the past few years. Some of the individuals may suffer because of the actions of the transfer. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The matter I wish to raise tonight appears to be a case where an individual has suffered. An attempt has been made to resolve the situation locally. I am not raising it here without having done some work on it in the Northern Territory. </para>
        <para class="block">The Police Association has worked on this matter and representations have been made. But we have not been successful. I am raising the matter here tonight in the hope that the Minister for the Northern Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Adermann)</inline> may be able to give some assistance as regards the responsibility that I see the Federal Government having in the matter. </para>
        <para>Perhaps the best way to illustrate what I am trying to come to is to state the case of a particular individual. Others may be similarly affected, but I shall cite the case of only one person. I refer to the case of a constable who was formerly in the traffic section of the Northern Territory Police. He was recruited in 1974 and in 1975 moved, at his own request, to the traffic section. In August 1976 he was involved in a high speed emergency call which resulted in an accident. He was a passenger in the car involved and at the time appeared to suffer no injuries. Perhaps I should say that there were no visible injuries because a little later in that year- in October 1976- he found that he was getting recurrent headaches and pains in the neck and had suffered a loss of hearing. He then sought treatment from the Darwin Hospital and he was given some therapy for his problem. </para>
        <para>By mid- 1977 he was instructed to attend the National Acoustics Laboratory. I have used the word &#39;instructed&#39; carefully because he was told to do so by one of his senior officers. As a result of the tests made by the National Acoustics Laboratory, he was referred to the ear, nose and throat specialist at the Darwin Hospital. In September 1977 he was put on sick leave by the specialist. In November of the same year he was referred to the Commonwealth Medical Officer. Due to his condition- that is, the loss of hearing- he was told that he was to be pensioned out of the Police Force. He was put on sick leave and stayed on sick leave until 20 December 1977. On 20 December he was instructed by the Commissioner of the Northern Territory Public Service that he was to transfer to a position of Clerical Assistant, Grade 1 . </para>
        <para>Let us look at the result of this transfer to the position of Clerical Assistant, Grade 1 from his former position as a constable with the Police Force. Firstly, he lost the job that he wanted. He had joined the Police Force and, at his own request, had been put in the traffic section where he wanted to serve. He was moved to a job which had no appeal to him. It was one which he did not like and which was not even in the same department. As a matter of fact, it involved putting plastic covers on library books- a job which had no appeal to him. He suffered a drop in salary from $10,195 to $7,550-a loss of over $2,500. He suffered the loss of a rent subsidy and also the loss of a subsidy for sewerage, water and garbage, a subsidy to which members of the Police Force in the Northern Territory are entitled. Obviously, having moved out of the Police Force, he was not entitled to be supplied with a uniform. Also he received no overtime or penalty rates. He claims, and I can understand his feeling in this regard, to have lost a certain amount of status. It is certainly not for me to cast aspersions on the status of Clerical Assistants, Grade 1, but this man personally felt the move to this position was a loss of status. </para>
        <para>The outcome of the situation was that he resigned from the Public Service and left Darwin. As I have said, the job had no appeal to him. He found it difficult to live on his reduced salary. Whilst obviously one can say that other clerical assistants manage to live on their salaries and therefore he ought to be able to manage, I think many of us would understand that, having dropped $2,500 in salary plus these additional penalty and overtime rates as well as losing the provision of a uniform and the subsidies and so on, it would have been very difficult for him to move down the salary scale. At the time he made his complaint he was offered a 50 per cent pension, but to the present time he has not received it. At present he is unable to find work because of his loss of hearing. So we have the situation where he has no work, no pension and no compensation. One of the disturbing features of this case to me is that the man has been penalised for an injury which occurred while he was at work. He went out, of necessity, on a high speed emergency call, he had an accident and he is being punished for it. </para>

            <para>-My understanding of the situation is that the ear, nose and throat specialist attributed the loss of hearing to the accident. It seems to me that if this is the case, an unfortunate precedent has been set. I wonder whether policemen who feel that they are going to lose their job if they have an accident and become incapacitated will decline to undertake dangerous activity. Are we going to have the farcical situation of a police officer saying: &#39;No, I will not do that in case I get hurt. I will not enter into that situation in case I am shot at. I will not get into the car in case I have an accident&#39;? Of course that would be a completely untenable situation. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>Another disturbing situation seems to my to be the inappropriateness of police officers being part of the ordinary Public Service. It seems to me that special demands are made of police officers and therefore special conditions ought to apply to them. I ask the Minister to look at the case of the individual I have mentioned and to decide whether he has been unfairly treated. That is the first point. I ask him also to look at the Police Administration Ordinance to see whether the terms of that ordinance are in line with provisions in the States. Obviously we want in the Northern Territory the same provisions as exist in the States. He might then consider the present situation to see whether the Police Force can operate effectively if there is no compensation in these cases or if as a result of an accident a member of the force can be dismissed or reduced in salary. I think it is most important that we look at that and, while doing so, look also at the powers of the Commissioner of the Northern Territory Public Service because he would appear to have more power than other public service commissioners. It seems incredible that no compensation is available, but it appears that that is so. It appears that this man has received no compensation for what was a traumatic thing, the loss of hearing. It seems to me that we must get the best possible recruits in the Northern Territory, or in other police forces, but I am concerned only about this one at present. Obviously we cannot expect people to move into the service if the conditions which I have described tonight exist. </para>

          <para>- in reply- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> commented tonight on a project known as the Iwasaki tourist resort that is proposed for the central coastal region of Queensland at Yeppoon. My information directs itself specifically to questions raised by both <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges.</inline> My understanding is that late in April the Queensland Government introduced the Queensland International Tourist Centre Agreements Bill. This Bill provides for the establishment and operation by Iwasaki Sangyo of a tourist resort covering about 8,500 hectares. The Bill contains an agreement, referred to as the franchise agreement, between the company and the State, which sets out the obligations and rights of both parties. The main features of the franchise agreement are that Iwasaki is to build to an agreed schedule a resort to cater for a maximum of 22,000 people. It would own all the necessary land and the State would exercise control over most aspects of the proposal. The company would have the responsibility of ensuring that no adverse environmental effects resulted from the proposal. It is important for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> to note that on 1 3 January this year the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Groom)</inline> issued an order requiring the company to produce an acceptable environmental impact study. That order has been issued. </para>

            <para>- The important thing is that the Commonwealth Government has acted in this respect and the company is apparently working on the environmental impact study which is expected to be ready by mid- June. That will be an important document which will relate to those matters which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> in particular and also <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> raised. On 28 April this year the company submitted to the Foreign Investment Review Board an application seeking Government approval on foreign investment policy grounds for the proposed tourist resort and related real estate acquisition. So on two thrusts the matter has come on to the Federal Government&#39;s plate- on the environment thrust and on the question of foreign investment and its implications. Technically one could say that the Commonwealth has 90 days from 28 April in which to reach a decision on the proposal but that, of course, is a narrow view. While it may prove possible to reach a decision on foreign investment policy grounds by that time it should be noted that the proposal is clearly a complex one that is going to involve the responsibilities of a number of Federal Ministers. In accordance with established practice in such cases there will need to be consultation at Ministerial level once the Foreign Investment Review Board has reported to the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard).</inline> That is the advice which I have on those two fronts. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>This is an important matter which should be put under the most detailed study. The governments of Australia, Commonwealth and State, have between them complete power to decide how any land, any project or any aspect of the environment shall be managed for the future, so if this project is developed complete control over it lies with the elected governments. The idea that foreign governments can come to this country and do something within their own power is wrong. They can operate only under conditions that are laid down by our government. It is not for me as a Minister at this distance to evaluate the pluses or minuses of the project and it is not for anyone else to do so without a knowledge of the environmental impact study, without a knowledge of the report from the Foreign Investment Review Board and without knowing what are basically the terms of the agreement with the Queensland Government and what is in the small print as to the nature of the undertaking, the involvement of the Australian people, whether it will be something that will create substantial employment for Australians and whether it can attract considerable tourism to Australia. If it can do those things and meet all the other qualifications then it must merit consideration. But that is not for me to say. It is for me to simply state the facts as I know them. Therefore I remind honourable senators that the Commonwealth Government and the State governments have within their responsibilities the task of ensuring that what is done in the development of Australia is in the total interest of the Australian people. </para>

            <para>As indicated above, the reference to special additions to borrowing programs in the Prime Minister&#39;s statement of 10 March 1978 regarding proposed new Loan Council guidelines is a reference to special additions to the &#39;semigovernment&#39; borrowing programs approved by the Loan Council (Le., the programs for semi-government and local authorities borrowing in excess of Sim a year). In his statement the Prime Minister indicated that the proposed new arrangements while recognising the Commonwealth&#39;s overriding responsibility in matters of national economic management, would allow such special additions where the proposed extra borrowings were necessary to finance development-related infrastructure normally provided by the public sector and which could not be accommodated within the existing Loan Council program. </para>
            <para>As regards the local government sector, the present Government&#39;s tax sharing arrangements have of course resulted in general revenue assistance from the Commonwealth for it increasing from $79.9m in 1975-76 to S 165.3m in this financial year. </para>
