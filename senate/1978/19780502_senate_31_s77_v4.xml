        <para>That it is necessary for the Commonwealth Government to renew for a further term of at least 3 years the States Grants (Dwellings for Pensioners) Act 1974-77, renewed for one year expiring on the 30 June 1 978. </para>

K. Seaman (now Governor of South Australia) which recommended additional funds to State housing authorities to meet the demand for low-rental accommodation in the proportion of $4 for $ 1 with the proviso that the States do not reduce their existing expenditure and </para>
        <para>That the Act include married pensioners eligible for supplementary assistance and migrants as specified by the Seaman Report and that particular consideration be paid to the special needs and requirements of the prospective tenants in the location and design of such dwellings. </para>

Such a loan to be at minimal interest rates sufficient to cover administrative costs and to be repaid by the estate upon the death of a single pensioner before probate or upon the death of the surviving spouse in the case of married pensioners or where two pensioners jointly own the dwelling.

            <para>-I did hear-I believe on the radio- an item which indicated that the Premier of Victoria, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hamer,</inline> proposed to suggest at the next Premiers Conference that sales tax might be made a tax for the States. I do not know the details and I do not know anything about the suggestion that this might be in substitution for any other tax. It is true that for some years in Australia the States have been looking for some tax similar to the purchase tax that the American States impose. On a number of occasions I have indicated that with my limited knowledge of the law I believe that the High Court, in a decision some months ago in, I think, the H. C. Sleigh Ltd case, suggested that the States have the power to impose a turnover tax, which in many ways would be parallel to a sales tax or purchase tax, and that the States might be able to go ahead unilaterally if they desired to impose such a tax. After all, the States have a wide range of taxation instruments which they can use on their own volition and initiative. The States are main taxing agents. It is true that from time to time the States and the Commonwealth find it desirable to discuss means of rationalising taxation, and any discussion of this matter would be useful. However, I have had no official approach yet to have this matter listed for the discussion at the next Premiers Conference. </para>

            <para>- I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Transport: Is it true that representatives of AUS Student Travel Service Pty Ltd exchanged students&#39; onward airline tickets for credit vouchers at Sydney Airport on 26 April? Is it also true, as reported in the Press, that AUS Student Travel was informed at least a week before then that arrangements it was making to sell a cheaper fare to Kuala Lumpur were a breach of the amended Air Navigation Regulations? Is it also true that AUS Student Travel has followed this type of fare construction for some time and is now doing so in defiance of instructions from the Department of Transport? What steps does the Minister for Transport intend taking to prevent AUS Student Travel from either continuing its present illegal practice or issuing credit vouchers at an airport which could later be exchanged for onward airline tickets overseas? Finally, I ask whether other travel agents, operating perhaps more legitimately, are to enjoy the same facilities and have access to the same practices as AUS Student Travel. </para>

            <para>- On my calculation there were five parts to the question asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume.</inline> If I have them correctly, in answer to the first part of the question, I am informed that representatives of AUS Student Travel Service Pty Ltd did exchange students onward airline tickets for credit vouchers at Sydney Airport on 26 April, the date which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume</inline> indicated. As to the second part of the question, I understand it is true that the Department of Transport has been concerned about the arrangements made in Australia by AUS for travel beyond Kuala Lumpur. The problems do not arise from the actual sale of fares in Kuala Lumpur. As to the third part of the question, my understanding is that AUS Student Travel has pursued its own type of fare construction for some time and that there have been exchanges between it and the Department of Transport on this question. In reply to the fourth part of the question, I understand that the legal position with regard to credit vouchers is being examined and that the matter is being taken up with AUS Student Travel at present. Finally, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume</inline> asked whether the same conditions would apply to other travel agents. I have not been advised on this but I will find out and let the honourable senator know. </para>

Was an organisation formed in Sydney last Sunday, by about 200 members of Sydney&#39;s Vietnamese community, known as the New South Wales Chapter of the Greater Overseas Alliance for National Restoration of Vietnam which has as its aim the ultimate overthrow of the Government of Vietnam? Does the Government associate itself with or dissociate itself from this organisation and its objectives? Has the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs called for a report from his Department on the organisation? Bearing in mind the Government&#39;s announced policy of providing for general freedom of information, will the Minister undertake to make the report available to the Parliament? </para>

I am well aware of the conditions in isolated areas in the part of the State which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> mentioned. There is certainly a need for an efficient airline in that area and it may well be that some form of subsidy is necessary to achieve it.

Therefore I cannot respond on this matter at first hand. But I am bound to say that whilst there may be need for continual upgrading of the equipment, the general belief, based on hard experience, is that the electronic equipment at airports in Australia is of world standard and that the Department concerned and the officers who service it maintain exceptionally high standards. Indeed, it is fair to say that the safety rate of travel and the efficiency of operation bear that out. It may well be that certain matters need scrutiny. I shall ask the Minister for Transport to look at the media article, put it under study and make a response. </para>

            <para>- The honourable senator may be right, but he may be wrong. Naturally the inquiry upon which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Hope is about to embark will affect some aspects of the Mark report. Whilst the terms of reference of the two inquiries have some inter-relationship there are some matters which are not totally inter-related. I hope to receive shortly responses from various other arms of government throughout Australia in respect of some specific examples of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Mark &#39;s report after they have had time to study it. Whilst it may be true that some aspects cannot be resolved until <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Hope&#39;s report is before the Government, it may well be that some areas can be resolved before then. </para>

The Minister may remember that on 22 February I asked him a question relating to the status of the so-called Arab Information Bureau and the consequence of individuals being placed on what is described as the black-list of that bureau. On 4 April I asked him whether the Government had considered making a plea for clemency on behalf of the former Prime Minister of Pakistan who is at present under sentence of death. Since well over two months have passed since the first question was asked and nearly one month has passed since the second question was asked, I wonder whether the Minister could ask whoever writes the answers to these questions whether we are likely to receive an answer to the first question before the end of this sessional period and whether we are likely to receive an answer to the second question before the proposed date of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bhutto</inline> &#39;s execution. </para>

Whether it was black, white, red or green, I do not know. Evidently it is quite angry at being exposed for what it is. I will chase up that matter. As to the second question, I will have to check with my office. I have it in the back of my mind that I did attempt to give some information on this matter and that the situation was, basically, that the Government had decided not to do anything at this stage because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bhutto&#39;s</inline> sentence was under appeal to a higher judicial authority. </para>

I refer to an article in today&#39;s Adelaide <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser</inline> stating that 53 Noarlunga meat workers have been retrenched at the request of their union, the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union. Is the Minister aware of this action and the statement by the managing director of the company that the Federal Secretary of the AMIEU had told him in Canberra on 19 April this year that the men would be better off receiving unemployment benefits than working a 2-day or 3-day week? I understand that the union contends that the daily hired workers were earning less than the unemployment benefits for which they were ineligible because they were employed. Is the Minister aware that last year the meat workers were prepared to work on a short week basis? I ask the Minister: What is the Government&#39;s attitude to this move and to the precedent that this action may set? </para>

Their entitlement to benefits would have been dependent upon what the Minister for Social Security decided in that matter. I now ask the Minister: Is it a fact that those applications were sent to her and her Department for consideration? Was consideration of the applications held up pending the settlement of the dispute to which I referred? Does the Minister agree that as a settlement has been reached between all parties concerned in that matter, including the Australian Government, it should now be possible to determine whether the applications of these meat workers should be considered favourably? Collusion could not be suggested in the case of applications which, as I understand it, have been outstanding for five weeks. Can the Minister inform the Senate of the position in respect of those applications? </para>

Last week there was a report in the media that Aboriginal child mortality had increased in the Northern Territory in the last calendar year from 50 deaths to 75 deaths per 1,000 children. This has brought a spate of opinions from many experts. In view of this report regarding child mortality, can the Minister give further information as to what the authorities recognise as the problems and what action has been taken in an effort to reduce the number of deaths each year? Will the Minister advise the Senate of the cause of these deaths and whether the deaths are more pronounced in certain areas? If so, will the Minister give full information covering, say, the last 10 years? </para>

            <para>- My question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry, refers to a statement on merino ram exports made by the Minister for Primary Industry at Deniliquin some weeks ago. I ask: Does the Government propose to remove the embargo on ram exports notwithstanding the decision of the 1973 wool growers referendum? If so, is the Government re- endorsing the export policy put forward in the 1967 White Paper of the Australian Wool Board, including the motion that increased wool production would lead to higher wool prices? If not, what is the Government&#39;s rationale for allowing exports? </para>

            <para>-The Government is well aware of the situation relating to the export of sheep generally and is particularly aware of the existence of merino export bans. The Government has been looking at this matter over the last month or two. Generally, the Government wishes to see the free export of a product owned by a producer. However, there are considerations to be taken into account. So far as I am aware the matter is still before Cabinet for decision. I do not think I can add valuably to the query of the honourable senator about particular reports. I will seek an answer from the Minister whom I represent in this chamber and give it to the honourable senator. </para>

            <para>- I do not know whether I have the full details of the settlement as requested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> but I have some information about it which I think will be of interest to him and the Senate. The dispute finally boiled down to three main issues. The first was concerned with equipment assignments and commuting, the second with alterations to the work bid system, and the third with pay and associated matters. It was agreed that the proposed changes to the bid system would be put to a task force to study over six months and that it would be implemented provided the study showed TAA&#39;s flexibility of operation was not affected and there was no significant additional cost. The question of commuting was withdrawn. Throughout the discussions TAA was adamant, as it stated publicly, that there was room for negotiations on the third issue, namely, pay and associated matters, provided it came within wage indexation guidelines. In the process of reaching agreement these limitations were observed. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In the final settlement there were some changes in the incremental structure of the pay system, but I do not have the details, and to the bid system. It is believed that most, pilots will gain a little extra pay but just how the result will wash up when changes in other areas are considered is not clear. However, the important thing to emphasise is that any increases in pay must be within indexation guidelines- the guidelines have been accepted- and that TAA has announced that it will not increase fares as a result of the settlement. </para>

The Cabinet has been considering this matter over the past few months. I am unable to say exactly what is the present state of that consideration. I indicated that I was aware that generally the Government felt that the free export of goods produced in Australia should be allowed and that this situation was being reviewed because of the fact that there had been some union intervention in the matter previously and because of certain reports that have been brought forward. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> asked whether the fact that the Cabinet is considering this matter means that it may reach a decision on the matter without holding a referendum, as was done originally. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> described what took place under the Labor Government as a referendum. Some people may challenge whether it was a true referendum. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister for Education. The Minister may recall that on 2 March last I asked him a question relating to graduate employment and whether the Department of Education kept statistics on the number of university graduates who were unable to obtain employment in their chosen profession immediately after graduation. I asked further whether, if there were statistics, the Minister could in general terms indicate the faculties with high rates of graduates unable to find employment in their particular profession. I also asked the Minister whether, if there were no such statistics, he would have inquiries made at the various universities with a view to reviewing the intake in faculties where a significant number of graduates were unable to be employed in their profession after graduation. In his reply the Minister stated that he would obtain these figures. I now ask the Minister whether he is in a position to give the figures to the Senate. </para>

            <para>- I understand the interest that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tehan</inline> and, I think, all Australians have in this matter and I do have some information on it. The Tertiary Education Commission has provided me with the following information: Statistics on the number of university graduates who are unable to obtain employment are published in the publication of the Graduate Careers Council entitled &#39;First Destinations of 1976 University and College Graduates&#39;. That publication sets out the results of the most recent annual survey conducted by the Graduate Careers Council of Australia in respect of university and college graduates seeking, but unable to obtain, full time employment in their first year following graduation. Tables in it show the percentages of 1976 first degree university and first degree-diploma college graduates who, at 30 April 1977, were still seeking full time employment. These percentages are broken down into the major subjects studied. The survey is based on all university graduates and 40 per cent of the college graduates who qualified for awards in 1 976. The results are based on a response rate of 79 percent of university graduates and 58.5 per cent of the sampled college graduates. I seek leave to incorporate in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> two tables setting out the Tertiary Education Commission&#39;s information on graduate unemployment. </para>

              <para>- In summary, 1.9 per cent of the sample of first degree university graduates were casually employed and seeking full time employment. In addition, 4.4 per cent were unemployed and seeking full time employment. Therefore, the total of first degree university graduates seeking full time employment one year after graduation was 6.3 per cent. For first degree-diploma college graduates the comparable figures were 2. 1 per cent and 3.5 per cent respectively, giving a total of 5.6 per cent seeking full time employment a year after graduation. However, it appears that employment prospects for graduates still remain better than for the population as a whole. A survey carried out by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in May 1977 estimated that approximately 6,500 graduates were seeking work at that time. The Tertiary Education Commission estimates that there were approximately a quarter of a million people with university or college degrees in the labour force in 1977. The number of unemployed graduates was thus approximately 2.6 per cent of the total number with graduate qualifications. The level of unemployment for the labour force generally at that time was 5.1 per cent. Unemployment among persons aged 20 years and over was about 3.6 per cent. Therefore, unemployment among degree holders is about three-quarters of the rate for the adult population generally. Unemployment among school leavers in May 1977 was estimated to be 16.3 percent. </para>

Will the Government give further consideration to the question of tenured appointments in the post-secondary institutions that come under its control, and introduce guidelines in this matter? </para>

            <para>- One of the results of a country such as Australia having an extraordinarily rapid population growth, both for natural reasons and from immigration, which then slows down, is a sudden burgeoning for a number of years of academic staff appointments. When the population becomes stable, a state of staff stagnation, as it were, is reached in particular institutions, largely because of the absence of opportunity to transfer, or for new staff to be appointed. That is a fundamental happening at the moment in Australia. One hopes that our population will not remain stagnant and that we are passing through a period during which this Borrie-type phenomenon will change. It nevertheless is the fact that we have taken in an enormous number of academic staff and that quite a degree of inertia in that respect can now be expected. </para>

          <para>It is true that over the years tenure, or the employment of an academic in an institution virtually for life, has become a characteristic of such institutions, but in recent years more and more universities have been initially taking staff in on a short-term or probationary basis. There is emerging also a contract system under which, for a certain number of years, academics must prove themselves. Thus, there is a series of stages involving probation, contract and tenure. The subject of tenure is under study throughout the world. In Australia we are examining it, but not in relation to the immediate future, except to note the emergence of probation and contracts as such. The Government has many other matters in this field under study at the moment but it would be happy to take a harder look at the matter raised by the honourable senator to see whether any further information can be supplied to him. </para>

            <para>- I should imagine that all Australians were particularly pleased with the announcement about a week ago that InterScan had been selected as the future worldwide landing system for civil aviation. That decision reflected enormous credit on the quality of scientific research in Australia, particularly that conducted by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation in conjunction with the Department of Transport and the Department of Productivity. We feel that our research has reached a very high standard and this is reflected in world scientific circles. The honourable senator has asked two difficult questions. He has asked whether I can assure him that Australian industry will reap a very significant benefit from the production of this system. Some time ago the Government made a very definite decision- and did so greatly to its credit in a time of financial restraint- to allocate money to industry to pursue research into the refinement of certain of the hardware associated with the Interscan development. It was a difficult decision to make but the Government took it. Undoubtedly, it has lifted the electronic capability of industry in Australia. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>It is very difficult to say at present how much competition manufacturing industry in this country will face from countries such as the United States, Japan, Russia and perhaps the United Kingdom when the production of the software and hardware for this instrument commences. The Department of Productivity has some responsibility in this area in Australia. I understand that a very high level group from the United States of America is in Australia at present discussing the development, perhaps on a joint basis with Australia, of features of this system. </para>
          <para>I am unable to suggest what the income to Australia may be from production in this field. It has been suggested to me that thousands of millions of dollars worth of equipment may need to be installed. Of course, when we convert to the system within Australia we should have prime responsibility for the installation of our own type of manufacture. I hope that we will also be able to achieve much of the work for overseas. </para>

            <para>- My question to the Minister for Science follows the one which has just been asked. In view of the waffling answer just given which indicates that the Government has no plans to protect Australia&#39;s interest in the development of this new equipment, is it a fact that it was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> who said in this chamber some months ago- I cannot recall the exact date- that Australian scientists were the first to investigate and undertake years of development on the InterScan system? Is it not plain from that that InterScan would not have been developed without the Australian initiative and research, for which we all commend the people involved? Is that not sufficient ground for the Minister to deny reports that the present deputation from the United States is here virtually to tell us how InterScan will be developed and that Australian industry might receive 10 per cent of the total production of the InterScan system? As the Minister has had so much to say about InterScan in the past 12 months, can he now say on behalf of the Government that what has been developed in this country will receive proper recognition and that the Australian Government will stand by it irrespective of the pressures from United States companies? </para>

            <para>- I apologise to the honourable senator if my last answer appeared to be waffling. I have noted that the honourable senator&#39;s memory appears to leave him when he tries to recall some of the things which have been said in the Senate previously. However, we have to put up with that situation and acknowledge the ability that some senators have. The honourable senator will be aware that this matter has been progressing over a number of years. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation first developed the idea of the Time Reference Scanning Beam, the TRSB system, which is being pursued. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> may recall that in March 1977 the all weather operations panel of the International Civil Aviation Organisation recommended that the next international standard approach and landing guidance system for aircraft should be of this type. At that time both Australia and the United States of America had proposed a time reference scanning beam system to ICAO. The Australian proposal featured an  InterScan  system which had been designed by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and developed jointly by the Department of Transport and the CSIRO over at least a 5-year period. The particular recommendation to which I referred was placed before a world-wide meeting of ICAO for endorsement in April of this year. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Questions have been asked in this place over the past year about the progress of  InterScan,  but it was not until that meeting came about that we were able to claim cautiously that we might have some success. Indeed, we faced notable opposition to the proposal from the United Kingdom and other countries which had developed the Doppler system and which I understand had invested millions of dollars in that system. Once the world-wide meeting had taken place and had accepted the proposed system, the next step was the development of the system and the refinement of the electronics which would be used. The point is that for some time it has been a joint development by the United States of America and Australia. </para>

              <para>-That is a comment I think we could well take up. We will see when the negotiations were started on this matter. However, it would be wise at the present time  for  joint operations to take place. For instance, as I understand it, more than 50 per cent of the whole of the installations in the United States will be of this type of system. I think it would be very foolish for this country to believe that it would be able to deliver its system to the United States in that volume. It is a very wise proposition to be involved in joint operations with the United States and I am pleased that we are so involved. </para>

              <para>-The Leader of the Opposition has asked me whether the Australian Government will protect Australian interests and Australian industry in this regard. I think the Australian Government has adopted a very sensible attitude in relation to this matter, one which any deep thinking person would support. The fact is that it is wise for us to be associated with the United States of America. The honourable senator may know that the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics came in behind the United States of America and Australia in regard to this matter. Quite recently West Germany came into the formation of a group whereby this system could be adopted. </para>

          <para>It is acknowledged that the original system was a CSIRO research finding. As far as development and Australian industry are concerned, the Government has supplied funds for the development of the system. I think we will stand in a very good situation in relation to it. The very fact that representatives of the United States are in Australia to discuss with us some of the developments indicates that a very major user is going to seek Australia&#39;s assistance and that we will mutually benefit from it. </para>

However, I can answer the former pan as follows: The Foreign Minister conferred with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Olewale,</inline> the Papua New Guinea Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, from 26 to 29 April to resume negotiations on maritime boundaries between the two countries and on other issues relating to the Torres Strait. The discussions were useful and constructive. Considerable progress was made towards the objective of achieving an equitable and permanent settlement. At the end of the meeting it was agreed that it would now be appropriate to report to the respective governments on the discussions and that the Ministers should meet again in the near future to carry their negotiations forward. Beyond that, I cannot help the honourable senator. </para>

I am now advised that the person reported, a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Schofield,</inline> had been giving evidence before the Public Works Committee, and the purpose of the evidence was to obtain approval for expenditure amounting to $5. 8m for new buildings and equipment. The expenditure of that money is to include a new air traffic control tower, a new area approach centre and a new flight service centre at Adelaide Airport. This is evidence, of course, of the Government&#39;s intention to modernise those facilities to the extent possible. I am also advised, as I have stated, that the existing equipment is completely safe and trustworthy. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">- Senator Ryan</inline>asked me about an interpreters and translators course at the Canberra College of Advanced Education. The Principal of that College, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Richardson,</inline> has informed me that the College Council at its meeting on 26 April resolved that the course should be suspended on the completion of the present course. The Council&#39;s decision was made in the context that enrolments had declined steadily during the four years in which the course had been offered and that this year it attracted only three students. The reasons for the decline in enrolment probably lie in the fact that tertiary institutions in Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide are now offering courses in Italian and, since these cities have major concentrations of Italian migrants and since the Government has been assisting people to enrol in these courses by offering them the facilities of the National Employment and Training scheme, prospective students have naturally tended to enrol in their own capital cities. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>It is interesting to note that the Spanish course in interpreting at the CAE has continued to attract a good enrolment, presumably because a similar course has not been offered elsewhere in Australia. I am advised that it may turn out that the Council on Interpreting and Translating, established by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, will recommend that the College should move into some other field of interpreting and translating where there is scope for a single national course rather than provide facilities in the States. If this happens, the College Council is prepared to give very careful consideration to the possibilities of reintroducing a second stream in interpreting in some language other than Italian or Greek. The College has advised me that it considers an assured enrolment of about 10 students annually to be a viable proposition and it does not feel that it can secure such an enrolment in Italian now that courses are readily available in Melbourne, Sydney and Adelaide. Finally, it does not believe that it should maintain two academics for three students. </para>

I am advised that the number of people who have been charged totals 176. Of this number, there are 125 sickness beneficiaries, 32 invalid pensioners, nine agents and six doctors, and four persons in a category which I am not sure of because the latest arrests were made this morning. A number of people have been requested to attend the Department of Social Security for interview to determine their continuing eligibility for pension or benefit. This number includes those who have been charged, which is a total of 741. This number is broken up into 448 sickness beneficiaries and 293 invalid pensioners. Included in that figure of 293 are 138 persons who are living in Greece. Other cases which are still under investigation total 264.I understand they are all sickness beneficiaries.

Traffic growth on the domestic network has revived over the last 12 months and an additional B727-200 aircraft is required by both Trans-Australia Airlines and Ansett Airlines of Australia to meet the anticipated increase in demand. The proposed Government guarantee will be limited to an amount of $US10.3m or its equivalent. This amount represents 80 per cent of the total cost of the aircraft and associated equipment. </para>
          <para>It has been long standing practice for the Commonwealth to grant such guarantees and it is proposed that this practice be continued. The Company will be required to consult with the Treasurer on the form of documentation for any loans negotiated and on the terms and conditions on which monies are borrowed. Also, the Company will be required to satisfy the Treasurer that adequate and proper security is given to the Commonwealth over the aircraft. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>
          <para>Qantas Airways Limited (Loan Guarantee) Bill  1978 </para>
          <para class="block">The purpose of this Bill is to authorise the Treasurer, on behalf of the Commonwealth, to guarantee loans raised by Qantas Airways Ltd to finance the purchase of two Boeing 747 series aircraft, the sixteenth and seventeenth in its fleet. The Qantas Airways Limited (Loan Guarantee) Bill 1976 enabled Qantas to negotiate loans in its own name, with the backing of a government guarantee, for the first time. It is proposed that this practice be continued. The airline will be required to consult with the Treasurer on the form of documentation for any loans negotiated and on the terms and conditions on which the monies are borrowed. Also, the airline will be required to satisfy the Treasurer that adequate and proper security is given to the Commonwealth over the two aircraft. </para>
          <para>The proposed Government guarantee will be limited to an amount of $US80m, or its equivalent. This represents 80 per cent of the total cost of the two aircraft and associated equipment.

          </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline>it is with great pleasure that I introduce the States Grants (Urban Public Transport) Bill 1978. The Bill, which honours our election policy commitment, will provide $300m to the States over the five years commencing 1 July 1978, by way of non-repayable grants to upgrade urban public transport. </para>
          <para>As honourable senators will be aware, the current Urban Public Transport Agreement, under which the Commonwealth assists the States with urban transport capital works projects, comes to an end on 30 June 1978. Under that program, which has covered the five years since July 1973, we expect Commonwealth payments to total above $190m. As indicated, this legislation now before the Senate is to appropriate $300m. In other words we propose to increase our assistance for urban transport by more than 50 per cent as compared with the current program. I think this is a very clear demonstration of the concern of this Government to do all it can to improve public transport in Australia&#39;s major urban centres. It is a particularly significant increase when viewed against the difficult budgetary situation. </para>
          <para>Before turning to details of the legislation, there are a number of general comments which I should make. First of all, with regard to the general arrangements under which the program will operate, I should point out that these have been the subject of extensive discussions between my colleague, the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon)</inline> and his State Government counterparts, as well as between officials. In fact, these discussions were first begun in early 1976 and it would be difficult to find more comprehensive and frank discussions. </para>
          <para>The legislation before the Senate reflects the give and take of those consultations. Many of the arrangements provided for under the proposed legislation will in fact continue procedures which exist under the current legislation. However, a number of important changes have been made and new features introduced to meet States&#39; wishes. </para>
          <para>One particularly important change which the States have repeatedly emphasised is the decision to commit the Commonwealth Government to a five-year funding program. Funds guaranteed in this way will greatly assist the States. It will enable them to enter into long-term contracts, secure in the knowledge of a guaranteed level of assistance from the Commonwealth. Under current arrangements the level of Commonwealth assistance was determined in the annual Budget context. To take one example, contracts for the supply of buses were guaranteed assistance from Commonwealth sources only in respect of work carried out on units delivered within the one year. Under the new arrangements, any State will be able to secure a guarantee of assistance for contracts covering a five-year program. </para>
          <para>It is in recognition of the wishes of the States in this regard that we are proposing in the legislation to give each State a basic guaranteed allocation. Over the five years of the program this guaranteed amount will total $200m, allocated between States as follows: </para>
          <para>New South Wales- $70m over the 5 years of the program </para>
          <para>Victoria- $60m over the 5 years of the program </para>
          <para>Queensland- $35m over the 5 years of the program </para>
          <para>South Australia- $20m over the 5 years of the program </para>
          <para>Western Australia- $ 10m over the 5 years of the program </para>
          <para>Tasmania- $5m over the 5 years of the program </para>
          <para>I should inform the Senate of the appreciation which the States expressed when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nixon</inline> announced details of this new program at the recent meeting of the Australian Transport Advisory Council. </para>
          <para>The remaining $100m of the Commonwealth &#39;s contribution to this program has not at this stage been allocated between the States. This amount is available for allocation to the States at the rate of about $20m per annum. Each State&#39;s share of this unallocated amount will be decided annually on the basis of needs and priorities assessed in the light of proposals put forward by the States. I must stress however that funds under this program- all of the funds to be appropriated by the Bill- can be made available only to support projects proposed by the States. It will not be an option for the Commonwealth to determine projects of its own accord. Such an approach will allow us to respond to changing needs and priorities throughout the five years of the program. It provides an essential element of flexibility for both the Commonwealth and the States. I should also comment that Commonwealth assistance will continue to be made available towards these State projects on a two/thirds one/third- basis. Therefore the total urban transport program under this Bill will amount to $450m. </para>
          <para>I should also make another important point here. The new program departs from existing arrangements in that there is no automatic provision for the Commonwealth to support cost escalation as an additional contribution to each project. The provision in the 1973-78 program has proved difficult to administer, and places considerable demands on both the Commonwealth and each State. It introduced an element of open-endedness which created uncertainties. Consequently, under the 1978-83 program the extent of the Commonwealth&#39;s liability to each project will be specifically determined at the time the project is approved. </para>
          <para>Turning now to questions of administrative arrangements, the States will be required to submit proposals of projects to be assisted. All projects, including those which are to use a State&#39;s guaranteed funds, will be subject to Commonwealth approval. This was, of course, the practice under the 1973-78 program. The requirement for approval of projects has been the subject of some comment. It is, as honourable senators will be aware, a feature common to many such assistance programs. One obvious example is the Roads Assistance Scheme. As with the roads legislation, this process of approving the use of Commonwealth funds in respect of particular projects is the best way of ensuring that this Parliament knows what use is being made of funds it has appropriated. There is no mystery in this - there is no unwarranted interference in State processes. Honourable senators will observe that the Bill provides for a process of consultation between the Commonwealth and the States after submission of proposals and before decisions are made on the projects the Commonwealth will support. As I stated earlier, the provisions of this Bill allow approval of a project to extend up to the full period of the program, that is, five years. States will, however, at the very least be required to submit proposals on an annual basis for a share of the annually allocated $20m. </para>
          <para>It would be appropriate now to summarise briefly the main provisions of this legislation. I have, as the Senate will be aware, circulated an explanatory memorandum outlining the principles on which this legislation is based. I hope this additional material will prove helpful to senators. Turning now to details, clause 3 sets out the definition of terms used in this legislation. The coverage of this program has been extended to bring it into line with our roads and decentralisation programs. The six State capital cities, plus Newcastle, Wollongong and Geelong, will again be eligible. In the case of Sydney, the statistical division has been extended to include the Blue Mountains and Gosford- Wyong. We have also extended coverage of this scheme to urban areas with populations in excess of 40,000 and through the operation of clause 4 the Minister will, after appropriate consultation with the States, be able to include the urban areas of Ballarat, Bendigo, Toowoomba, Gold Coast, Townsville, Rockhampton, Cairns and Launceston as eligible under this program. Clause 4 will also allow the inclusion of areas to permit assistance to be provided for improvements in the three inter-urban corridors linking Newcastle, Wollongong and <inline font-style="italic">Geelong to</inline> Sydney and Melbourne respectively, as under the current scheme. </para>
          <para>Clause 5 contains the project proposal, evaluation and consultation and approval arrangements which I have described previously. Clause 6 prescribes the two /thirds-one /third Commonwealth and State contributions. This clause also gives the States autonomy to implement approved projects. They will be restricted only by two financial ceilings: Firstly, by the amount of the maximum grant to the State for a year and, secondly, by the total approved cost of each project. Within those ceilings the State will have complete flexibility to adjust the rate at which projects are implemented. This will enable a </para>
          <para class="block">State to, say, accelerate expenditure on one or more projects in the light of circumstances, for example, unavoidable delays in other projects. Most importantly, it will no longer be a requirement for the States to seek <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nixon&#39;s</inline> concurrence before awarding contracts or deciding how approved works are to be implemented. </para>
          <para>Under clause 7 provision is made to enable any moneys not spent in a year to be transferred to subsequent years of the program. However, I must emphasise the States should not regard this provision as an easy way out if their expenditure performance does not meet the States&#39; expectation. The States must get on with the job. That has not always been the case. Under the existing Urban Public Transport Agreement, the States have had a history of not being able to live up to their expenditure expectations. For instance, in 1974-75 an amount of $67.01 m was budgeted on the basis of State&#39;s forecasts, but only $45.03m was spent. In 1975-76, because States&#39; expenditure was so low the previous year, an amount of $40. 3m was made available in the Budget; but the States were only able to spend $33. 8m. </para>
          <para>Last year, 1976-77, was the States&#39; best year; they were able to spend $58.4m but this was still short of the Budget figure of $64.6m. It is expected that this year&#39;s allocation of $5 lm will be fully taken up. </para>
          <para>Provision exists under clause 7 to transfer unspent funds from one State to one or more other States if circumstances warrant. Thus if a State fails to expend its additional allocations made under clause 8 those unexpended funds could be reallocated to another State or States if they have demonstrated needs. I should emphasise that the States &#39; guaranteed allocations as set out in the Schedule to the Bill cannot be transferred to another State. </para>
          <para>The remaining clauses cover the normal financial and administrative requirements relating to the provisions of advances, justification of expenditure and appropriation of funds for this program. Clause 1 1 provides for the States to meet normal requirements relating to inspection of works and documents and also provides for regular progress reports. As with the current arrangements clause 1 1 provides for the Commonwealth to be represented on an appropriate State body concerned with forward planning of urban transport improvements. This arrangement has provided an important forum for exchange of Commonwealth and State views and has worked to the benefit of both parties under the current arrangements. </para>
          <para>The current Agreement has seen undoubted benefits flow to urban public transport. We have seen new rolling stock- trains, trams and busesadded to the fleets of public transport operators. Railway track extensions and additional tracks have been constructed to increase the capacity of systems. We have seen major work undertaken towards electrification of the Brisbane suburban rail system as well as work towards linking the southern and northern sections of the Brisbane suburban network by construction of the crossriver rail link. Overall the current program has had a significant effect. It is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nixon&#39;s</inline> intention to have prepared a comprehensive report on the impact of the current program which will be presented to the Parliament in due course. However, some of the projects commenced under the current program are not yet completed. We, therefore, see one of the first priorities of the new program as being the rapid completion of such projects. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President</inline>the requirements for adequate urban public transport are beyond dispute. Road congestion, car parking and pollution problems reinforce the need for a transport system which provides alternative means of urban mobility. We must never neglect those members of our society who depend upon public transport services. This Bill represents a substantial advance in our methods of assisting the States in urban transport improvement both in terms of fund and administrative arrangements. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

            <inline font-style="italic">The speech read as follows-</inline>
          </para>
          <para>The Bill proposes several amendments to the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Act 1 976, which is an Act the Government introduced to give effect to its policy of assisting Aboriginal communities and groups to incorporate themselves for various purposes and in a manner more acceptable to them. The amendments seek to resolve issues of concern to State and Territory governments, to remedy certain deficiencies found in the existing Act, and to provide for certain procedural matters. </para>
          <para>The Act has been the subject of exhaustive discussion between the Commonwealth Government and State and Territory governments through the Australian Aboriginal Affairs Council. The main issue which concerned State and Territory Ministers was that Aboriginal Councils established under the Act might intrude into State responsibilites for local government, existing or proposed. When the Act was first introduced it was intended to provide a suitable vehicle for the incorporation of Aboriginal communities, particularly the remote and traditionoriented communities who might find difficulty with western European legal concepts as embodied in State and Territory legislation. In opening to Aboriginal communities the possibility of carrying out, through Councils, certain municipal-type functions, the Act was not intended to lead to a separate local government system. For example, by-laws made by an Aboriginal Council will not, under the Act, apply to a person who is not an Aboriginal and, under the amendments being introduced, consultation will have to take place with State and Territory Ministers before an Aboriginal Council is established in an area in which municipal services already exist or are proposed. </para>
          <para>The anxiety that the establishment of separate local Government bodies might be in the Government&#39;s mind and that it might lead to what has variously been described as separate development, the creation of semi-autonomous Aboriginal entities, and/or an encroachment on State rights under the federal system has occasionally been expressed. Perhaps I can set this anxiety to rest by emphasising that the self management objectives of the Government do not involve separate laws for Aboriginals whereby they are able to cut themselves off from the federal or State institutions of Government which are part of our nation&#39;s fabric. Where the establishment under this legislation of Aboriginal Councils with municipal type functions is contemplated, the Minister is already required to take into account any proposed extension of local government into the area. The amendments to sections 16 and 17 of the Act now proposed go further than this. They require account to be taken of both existing and proposed local government responsibilities in areas where Aboriginal Councils are to be established, and for the Minister to consult with State or Territory Ministers before he decides on the establishment of a Council. It is to be hoped that these provisions will satisfy the States as to the Commonwealth&#39;s good faith and intentions. </para>
          <para>It is not intended that any organisation of Aboriginals or Islanders should be compelled to incorporate under Commonwealth legislation unless it wishes to acquire land from the Commonwealth or with the use of Commonwealth funds. From the latter point of view the Act will merely serve to ensure that land which the Commonwealth makes available for Aboriginal communities is not disposable without the consent of the Minister and is retained in perpetuity for the benefit of future generations of Aboriginal Australians. There is no State or Territory legislation which will achieve this. Another, and less controversial, objection raised by the States was to the effect of section 78 of the Act on the security of State interests in land acquired by Aboriginal corporations from State governments and the need for States to retain ownership and control of such lands transferred to an Aboriginal Lands Trust and subsequently leased to an Aboriginal corporation. To meet the States&#39; objection, which was valid, section 78 (2) is being amended by the deletion of the words or a State&#39;. A further amendment is proposed in section 78 dealing with the disposability of land which would prevent an Aboriginal corporation from disposing of an estate or interest in land without seeking an order from the Minister declaring such land disposable. The former National Aboriginal Consultative Committee drew my attention some time ago to the fact that there was no provision in the Act for appeals against discretionary decisions by the Registrar in respect of various administrative functions vested in the Registrar by the Act. I agreed that this was an omission in the original Act, and various amendments are now being introduced to provide for Ministerial intervention in, or review of, decisions taken by the Registrar under the Act, where such intervention or review is appropriate. </para>
          <para>The remaining amendments in section 3, in section 27, and in sections 38 and 59 are procedural and do not involve any matters of substance. One matter I might mention is the amendment proposed in section 3 to enable an Aboriginal association which is already incorporated under State or Territory law, to incorporate under this Act. The amendment proposed in section 46 ( 1 ) will prevent dual incorporation, and provision will be made in the Regulations to be made under this Act for the State or Territory authority concerned to be duly notified when such an association is incorporated under the Act. Honourable members will be aware that although the original Act was assented to on 15 December 1976, its proclamation has been delayed pending the resolution of the various issues which were raised concerning difficulties which were likely to arise in the implementation of the Act in the form in which it was enacted. The amendments now proposed should overcome these difficulties and allow for the proclamation of the Act. I commend the Bill to honourable members for their support. </para>

          </para>
          <para>The purpose of this amending Bill is to permit increased assistance to Tasmania in respect of the continued operation of the Mt Lyell mine at Queenstown. </para>
          <para>Honourable senators will recall that Parliament legislated last year to allow payment to Tasmania of up to half the amount paid by the Tasmanian State Government to the Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Company Limited. The Government provided this assistance to Tasmania pending consideration of the Industries Assistance Commission&#39;s interim report on copper. In case further assistance might be warranted pending the Commission&#39;s final report, the legislation provides for assistance up to 30 June 1978. </para>
          <para>The Commission&#39;s interim report was considered late in 1977 and the Government announced on 8 November that it accepted the Commission&#39;s recommendation to extend the period of assistance pending consideration of the Commission&#39;s final report. The Government announced that its offer of extended assistance was based on previous arrangements between the Commonwealth and Tasmania, under which the Commonwealth had assisted Tasmania on a dollar for dollar basis. </para>
          <para>The Tasmanian Government subsequently indicated that it was unwilling to continue those arrangements. In conformity with its announced intention that the mine should continue pending consideration of the Industries Assistance Commission&#39;s report, the Commonwealth Government then announced it was willing to provide all the necessary assistance, apart from an amount equal to the State&#39;s receipts from payroll tax on the mine&#39;s employment. This Bill accordingly seeks removal of the provision which limits Commonwealth assistance to half of the amounts paid to the company by Tasmania. </para>
          <para>The uncertainty of the future world copper price makes it difficult to estimate accurately the cost to the Commonwealth of the increased assistance to Tasmania. However, a recent estimate is that the total cost of Commonwealth assistance for the period from November 1977 to June 1978 would be between $3m and $4m. </para>
          <para>Following the termination on 8 November 1977 of the first Commonwealth-Tasmania agreement, and pending the introduction of this legislation, Tasmania has been paying to Mount Lyell the whole of the assistance necessary for the mine&#39;s continued operation. However, Tasmania has done this in the expectation that the bulk of this assistance would be reimbursed by the Commonwealth. This legislation authorises reimbursement on the more generous basis we now envisage, and should ensure that Tasmania continues to provide assistance to the Mount Lyell operations at Queenstown on the agreed basis. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </para>

            <inline font-style="italic">The document read as follows-</inline>
          </para>
          <para>I am compelled to make this statement to the House because of charges laid by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr R.</inline> R. Cavill, Managing Director of SAATAS, (South Australian and Territorial Air Services) and the member for Shortland, <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Peter Morris, M.P.).</inline> I am making a statement so that the Parliament itself can consider the charges and impose its own judgment on those involved. </para>
          <para>The charges question the integrity not only of myself as Minister for Transport, but of officers of my Department, of the former Ministers responsible ibr Civil Aviation in previous Governments, of the Directors of Connair, of the owners and operators of several charters air services in Central Australia, of certain members of the National Party in the Northern Territory and of the Government. </para>
          <para>I want to say at the start: The charges are totally false and malicious and clearly demonstrably so. That the Labor Opposition, through the member for Shortland, has become actively involved in what I will call the Cavill Affair is regrettable. </para>
          <para>This matter was first raised on 13 April by the member for Shortland in this House, during the debate on the Airline Equipment Loan Guarantee Bills. He made certain charges concerning air service operations in the Northern Territory. He quoted from a statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> of SAATAS not then available in Canberra, which had been given to him prematurely by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill.</inline> I have not received nor seen a copy of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> &#39;s purported press statement of 13 April. I understand, however, that it is similar to a telex sent to me on 3 1 March. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline>repeated his charges on at least two occasions- on <inline font-style="italic">A.M.</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">This Day Tonight on</inline> 14 April. The member for Shortland supported <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> with a statement on 20 April and an interview on <inline font-style="italic">A.M.</inline> on 2 1 April. </para>
          <para>To the best of my belief, the charges by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> and the member for Shortland are contained in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of 13 April, their press statement of 20 April, interviews with <inline font-style="italic">This Day Tonight</inline> on 14 April, and <inline font-style="italic">A.M.</inline> of the same date and <inline font-style="italic">A.M.</inline> on 2 1 April. </para>
          <para>The major charge is that Connair, as the so-called opposition airline to SAATAS, has been given unfair Government assistance and that I and the National Country Party stand accused of pork-barrel politics and discrimination. The charge is quite mischievous and clearly cannot be sustained on the facts. </para>
          <para>For the information of honourable members, I table a report prepared by my Department following the charges made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> and the member for Shortland. I draw honourable member&#39;s attention to the first part of my Department&#39;s report headed &#39;Types of Service&#39;, which shows the sharp distinction between the two operators. </para>
          <para>Quite clearly SAATAS is not, and has never been, an opposition airline to Connair. Connair is the airline providing scheduled services in the Northern Territory. There are only five airlines in Australia of this type, namely, Ansett, T.A.A., Qantas, East-West and Connair. SAATAS, on the other hand, is a charter operator in competition with other charter operators, of which there are more than 480 in Australia. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline>has known since at least October 1972 the position of the Commonwealth, when the then Minister for Civil Aviation, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton,</inline> wrote to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> stating, and I quote: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The position of the Commonwealth in these matters is as follows: </para>
            <para>It has restricted the issue of air service licences in the Territory in an effort to ensure orderly, economic and efficient development of the industry there; </para>
            <para>Your company is one of the favoured few who have been fortunate to gain an operating licence for the Territory; </para>
            <para>In granting this licence to you originally, it was made perfectly clear what the relationship between Connair and the Commonwealth was; </para>
            <para>The Commonwealth&#39;s contract with Connair is a perfectly normal subsidy contract of a type which has been entered into with subsidised operators for many years; </para>
            <para>This contract enables the Commonwealth to carry out all necessary investigations into the company&#39;s affairs and to control its operations so as to ensure that subsidy costs are kept to a minimum; </para>
            <para>The fundamental role of Connair, and the basis of its original foundation and development, is the provision of regular air services to remote localities in circumstances where uneconomic services are unavoidable; nevertheless, the company should be encouraged to develop other operations likely to reduce its subsidy requirement; </para>
            <para>There is no evidence to suggest that SAATAS, for example, could perform the task allotted to Connair at a significantly different order of cost to the Commonwealth; </para>

          <quote>
            <para>I find it somewhat puzzling to note your apparent belief that this Department, or the Government, has acted to the disadvantage of SAATAS. Let me recapitulate some of the benefits which have accrued to the company as a result of Commonwealth policy or action: </para>
            <para>SAATAS has been permitted to commence and expand operations in the Northern Territory even though this might have resulted in some increase in the subsidy requirements of Connair; </para>
            <para>In the interests of SAATAS (and other existing operators) additional licences for services in the Northern Territory have been refused or severely restricted; </para>
            <para>The limitations on charter flights over airline routes in the Territory provided under ANR 197(2) have been administered liberally in the case of SAATAS; </para>
            <para>SAATAS operations to Ayers Rock have been facilitated, and recently, at the request of the company, a higher fare was approved for this route; </para>
            <para>The Department did all it could to promote the commencement of services to and within Indonesia by SAATAS; </para>
            <para>It has been insisted that charter services by the subsidised operator, Connair Pty Ltd, which would be competitive with SAATAS services, should be quoted for at charter rates based on full costs plus profit allowance so that no unfair advantage would be gained by Connair as a result of the Commonwealth subsidy; </para>
            <para>The Department has assisted SAATAS considerably in making available hangar accommodation at Darwin Airport. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That letter puts the matter into the correct perspective. Our policy has never deviated from that described in October 1972. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> and his colleagues have always been aware of it. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill&#39;s</inline>claim that Connair has been given unfair Government assistance is, therefore, ludicrous. The overall operations of the two companies are clearly not comparable nor are the services they provide. </para>
          <para>My Department&#39;s report sets out the history of the Government&#39;s financial arrangements with Connair. </para>
          <para>The report shows that since its inception in 1939, successive Commonwealth Governments have supported, with financial assistance, the operation of the only regular scheduled regional airline for Central Australia. </para>
          <para>Attachment 1 to the report sets out the payments made to Connair since the new agreement was entered into in 1965. The table shows that subsidy was continued during the three years of the Labor Government even though that Government made a decision to phase out the subsidy. </para>
          <para>To suggest that the National Party is in some way responsible for the agreement is ludicrous. </para>
          <para>In the first place, until December 1975 when I became Minister for the Department of Transport, no member of my Party had held Ministerial responsibility for aviation matters since before the current agreement was negotiated in 1965. </para>
          <para>In addition, as my Department&#39;s report demonstrates, all decisions relating to payments of financial assistance to Connair have been made on the basis of decisions by the Government, that is the Cabinet. No individual Minister has been in a position to act without Cabinet&#39;s direction and approval. </para>
          <para>It should be clearly understood that the basis of the financial assistance to Connair was an agreement negotiated in 1965 and approved by the then Government. </para>
          <para>I point out that the 1977 Interdepartmental Committee referred to in the Department&#39;s report recommended the following, and I quote: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Committee recommends that the basis of Connair Pty Ltd, be confirmed as that of a regional airline&#39;. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Committee further recommended, and I quote: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>That the Government does not accept the option of doing nothing for Connair Pty Ltd, and thereby bringing about its immediate demise&#39;. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">As I have said, Connair is Central Australia&#39;s regional airline. It is quite distinct and separate from charter operators such as SAATAS. The airline was the brainchild of those living at the time in Central Australia who saw a need for such a service. </para>
          <para>Since its inception it has served the people in the Northern Territory and Central Australia well. It has been necessary for the Government to provide financial assistance to Connair to ensure that regular air transport services were provided for people requiring them in the remote areas of the region. But, as I have said, the details of that assistance have always been publicly available and approved by Governments, not individual Ministers. </para>
          <para>The second charge is that I, as Minister, have consistently refused <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> the opportunity to meet me. </para>
          <para>I was curious that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> could take this view. All he had to do was ask. In fact, I held a meeting with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> on 6 October 1977 and have had regular correspondence with him. In addition my records show <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> has not sought a meeting with me since 6 October. </para>
          <para>All <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> has done is to say he is prepared to meet me if I formally call a meeting. </para>
          <para>On 23 March this year, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> sent me a telex saying the Directors of SAATAS were considering closing their Australian flying operations the following week. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> did not seek a meeting. What he said was, and I quote: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Directors are prepared to discuss the proposed close down and any other matters if you wish &#39;. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>On 30 March I sent a telex to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> saying that his company must, of course, make its own commercial decisions but that if he felt a meeting could be of benefit I was happy to meet with him. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline>sent a reply on 31 March 1978 which said, and I quote: </para>
          <quote>
            <para class="block"> I remain happy to meet with you ... I would however suggest that such a meeting would need to be called by you and a specific agenda be set by you . . . &#39; </para>
          </quote>
          <para>My reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> on 1 3 April said that because SAATAS was responsible for their own commercial decisions it was not proper for me to call for a meeting or specify the agenda. I then repeated my earlier offer to meet with the Company if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> saw advantage in such a meeting. </para>
          <para>I have not heard since from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill.</inline></para>
          <para>Clearly, I have never refused to meet with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill.</inline> What I have done is to refuse to allow <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> to use my ministerial office to assist his commercial activities. </para>
          <para>The third charge is that the Commonwealth, in granting air service licences to Chartair and Tillair, had acted in a discriminatory manner actionable in the High Court. </para>
          <para>The Department&#39;s report sets out the details followed in granting or extending air service licences to Chartair and Tillair late last year. I am not sure what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill&#39;s</inline> own legal advisers are telling him. What I am sure of, however, is that my Department&#39;s actions have been quite correct and in accordance with Government policy and established procedures. </para>
          <para>On 20 October 1977 I approved the issue or extension of charter licences to Rossair (trading as Chartair) to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr John</inline> Tilley of Katherine, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Frank</inline> Ashton of Tennant Creek, the Port Keats Mission in the Northern Territory and the Balgo Hills Mission in Western Australia. </para>
          <para>The decision to issue the licences was not an arbitrary one. It was made in consultation with the responsible Member in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly and the licences were expressly recommended by the interdepartmental committee set up to examine air links in the area currently serviced by Connair. </para>
          <para>Charter operators, by their very nature, cannot expect to be given a guaranteed monopoly by </para>
          <para>Governments. As I have said, there are more than 480 operators like SAATAS in Australia. There was, therefore, nothing discriminatory in issuing the charter licences on 20 October 1 977. </para>
          <para>The Department&#39;s report deals at length with the granting of financial assistance to undertake Connair&#39;s mail services out of Alice Springs and new services of a similar type out of Katherine and Tennant Creek. The report speaks for itself. SAATAS was given an equal opportunity with the other operators in the region to bid for two routes. In both instances their bid was higher and, therefore, more expensive for the Government than the successful bidders, Chartair and Tillair. </para>
          <para>Again the Report speaks for itself. In Alice Springs, Chartair indicated they required $20,514 per annum from the Government to undertake the mail service whereas SAATAS said they would require $22,350 per annum. At Katherine, Tillair undertook to run the service for a payment of $20,280 whereas SAATAS said they would require $26, 1 80. </para>
          <para>Clearly there was nothing discriminatory in awarding the services to the most economical and, therefore, efficient operators. After all taxpayers funds were involved. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline>appears to be confused about the timing of the approval to the two operators to run these services. The Department&#39;s report states the position quite clearly, however. </para>
          <para>I repeat, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> and his company were provided with an equal opportunity to bid for the services, and the Government &#39;s duty is to do no more than this. The operators decision to commence the services without waiting for Government approval on the levels of subsidy required was theirs to make as charter operators - SAATAS could have done the same. </para>
          <para>After being given an equal opportunity to bid for the mail routes and after being unsuccessful because their bid was too high, SAATAS complained to my Department. They believed the method of seeking offers was unconventional and could give rise to legal challenge. At that time my Department sought legal confirmation that their approach had been correct. Such confirmation was given by the Assistant Crown Solicitor. </para>
          <para>Again I point out that the proposed arrangements were developed by my Department, the Postal Commission and the Department of Finance in consultation. </para>
          <para>The decisions on maximum levels of financial assistance were recently finalised by the Minister for Finance and myself in consultation. </para>
          <para>There was clearly no discrimination, nor could there have been under the procedures followed in the matter. All procedures followed by the Government, myself as Minister, my Department, Australia Post, the Department of Finance and its Minister, have been proper, responsible and totally fair. </para>
          <para>The Department&#39;s report shows clearly that all the charges by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> and the member for Shortland are totally false. </para>
          <para>There has been no discrimination against SAATAS or any other operator. There has been no pork-barrelling by the National Party or any other Party. No individual or single company has been given unfair advantage. </para>
          <para>This brings me to the next point. What were <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> &#39;s and the member for Shortland &#39;s true intentions in this matter? </para>
          <para>An examination of all the relevant papers has led me to only one clear conclusion- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> has consistently sought a position of monopoly and unfair advantage over other operators in the Northern Territory. </para>
          <para>The member for Shortland claims he has evidence proving the charges that he and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> have made. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> says that he has evidence with respect to malpractice by the Government and personally by the Country Party in the Northern Territory. </para>
          <para>I have already invited the member for Shortland to publish such papers, but to no avail. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> would like to have the Member for Shortland table all the correspondence he has had with me and my Department in the last ten years or so I will accommodate him. </para>
          <para>I would be surprised, however, if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> would want to table his correspondence- correspondence aimed at securing for himself and his Company a privileged position in the Northern Territory. </para>
          <para>As far back as February 1968, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> wrote to the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Donald</inline> Anderson and I quote from that letter: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>What my company seeks is a fair distribution of work given by Government Departments. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>Again, on 29 November 1976, the Managing Director of SAATAS, wrote to a senior officer of my Department stating and I quote: </para>
          <list type="lowerroman-dotted">
            <item label=".">
              <para>. we ask that your Department does these things: assists and encourages Connair to scale down. scales down the Connair subsidy in accordance with a logical formula. processes favourably <inline font-style="italic">all</inline> our applications under ANR 203. rejects all applications by Connair to subcontract its routes under AN R 20 1 . refrains from introducing any new operators to the Northern Territory, at least until the IDC has done its work. allows SAATAS to be the sole operator on the Alice Springs- Ayers Rock route. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>In another letter of the same day to my Department&#39;s South Australian/Northern Territory regional Director, the Managing Director of SAATAS stated, and I quote: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>We demand, therefore, when Connair phases out, that we are permitted to run Alice Springs/Ayers Rock as a monopoly . . . </para>
          </quote>
          <para>That letter of 29 November really gave SAATAS&#39; game away when it said, and I quote: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Now, then more than ever, we need the economies of scale and we really believe that the service we have given has earned us the right to become the scheduled operator for the Northern Territory. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>It is clear from the documents available that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> and SAATAS have run a deliberate campaign aimed at causing the demise of Connair and the imposition of SAATAS in its place as the scheduled airline in Central Australia. </para>
          <para>To give the House an indication of the lengths to which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> has gone in his campaign. In December 1971, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> on his own initiative provided the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Donald</inline> Anderson with what he described as &#39;an assessment I have made of the financial operations of Connair&#39;, The assessment&#39; painted a picture of unrelieved gloom and showed Connair in a hopeless financial position. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Donald</inline>dismissed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> &#39;s &#39;assessment&#39; on 14 January 1972 in the following words- &#39;interesting but inaccurate in a number of respects&#39;. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Donald</inline> went on to say and I quote: </para>
          <quote>
            <para class="block">I see no particular point in continuing this exercise. If Connair is willing to make public its accounts, estimates such as you have made will be unnecessary. If the company does not wish to take this step, it would be improper for the Department to comment on your efforts, and discussion based on incorrect assumptions would be fruitless.&#39; </para>
          </quote>
          <para>That attempt to have a Commonwealth Department of State provide an opinion of a private company&#39;s operations and financial structure to another company demonstrates a complete lack of business ethics by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill.</inline></para>
          <para>A more sinister move occurred on 8 April 1 972 when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> wrote to the  Chairman  of Connair asking if the company would be prepared to negotiate a sale. To assist SAATAS, Connair made available copies of the loan agreement and subsidy agreement to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill.</inline></para>
          <para>Then, on 1 1 May 1972, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> sent a document titled &#39;Northern Territory Air Services: Proposals for Reconstruction&#39; to a senior officer of the Department of Civil Aviation. The document proposed the formation of a new company to run air services in the Northern Territory with SAATAS holding 5 1 per cent of the shares and the Commonwealth holding 49 per cent. </para>
          <para>In the document <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> proposed that his company should absorb, and I quote:  those elements of CONNAIR Pty Ltd and South Australian and Territorial Air Services Pty Ltd that were considered desirable . . .&#39; </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline>&#39;s document went on to state, and I quote: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Eventually CONNAIR Pty Ltd as it exists now could be liquidated thus avoiding continued tenure of embarrassing accoutrements&#39;. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>Because no takeover offer was ever received, the Connair Board formally rejected SAATAS&#39; takeover suggestion on 20 December 1972. The letter from Connair to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> said in part, and I quote: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Board . . . wishes to emphasise, once again, and finally, that our correspondence, and our release of information to you have been entirely in response to your declared intention to make a cash offer for all the shares in our company. This has not eventuated, and we regard the matter as closed. &#39; </para>
          </quote>
          <para>I do not wish to take up the time of the House in disclosing any further <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> &#39;s activities in seeking the demise of CONNAIR and its replacement with his own company or with a company or organisation of his own choosing. </para>
          <para>On 1 9 August last year <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> wrote to me saying his company, and I quote:  could, with notice of a few days only, provide all those services needed in the Northern Territory, as mentionedmy previous correspondence with your Department -without subsidy and with efficiency&#39;. </para>
          <para>In the light of this claim by SAATAS, the capacity of the company to undertake the services should be examined. </para>
          <para>Just 9 days before <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> wrote to me on 1 9 August, the Department of Construction had complained bitterly to SAATAS describing the service the company provided as most unsatisfactory. The Department&#39;s complaints ranged from SAATAS being late for scheduled take-off times and the inability of the company to have a light single aircraft on site, to the fact that they had to pay the hiring cost of a 9-seater aircraft to carry just one person. Unfortunately, the internal operations of SAATAS do nothing for the company&#39;s image. </para>
          <para>From the brief outline I have given of the actions of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> and his company during recent years, and its aviation performance, the House will see what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> has been up to. </para>
          <para>It now appears that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> has made some unwise commercial decisions in the past and is trying to blame everyone but himself for those mistakes. I am not sure what the company&#39;s financial position is and what mistakes have been made with its management. On 29 November 1976, however, the managing director of SAATAS, in a letter to a senior officer of my Department said, and I quote: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Today our ability to survive is being eroded in two ways. Firstly the Australian Government&#39;s cost-cutting program has caused a serious decline in the demand for air charter in the Northern Territory. Secondly, our Indonesian operation has gone sour with our large foreign customers pulling out of the country. No longer can the profits from Indonesia prop up the struggling charter business in the Northern Territory. &#39; </para>
          </quote>
          <para>As I have said, SAATAS is a charter operator, one of more than 480 in Australia. It is a private operator and, therefore, free to make its own commercial decisions. Its mistakes are of its own making and its future of its own choosing. </para>
          <para>The role of the member for Shortland in this unsavoury matter is curious and sad. On 8 December 1972, six days after the change of Government, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> wrote to the then Director-General of Civil Aviation and said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>A change of Government sets the stage for essential civil aviation reforms particularly in that section involving my company. &#39; </para>
          </quote>
          <para>He effectively repeated that comment in a letter to me on 4 February 1 976 when he said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I feel that a practical and positive solution to this problem can now be achieved particularly having regard to the changed political environment. &#39; </para>
          </quote>
          <para>That statement may come as a surprise to the member for Shortland and those of his colleagues who were under the impression <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> was one of theirs.  His  actions clearly show a devious duplicity. In 1972 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> was meeting with the Member for Adelaide to press his case. During 1973 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> was negotiating with the Labor Government using pressure from the Dunstan Government. In 1975 he was seeking me, in Opposition, to press his case again. I am quite sure that my predecessor, the honourable member for Newcastle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Charles Jones),</inline> could have warned the honourable member for Shortland about <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill&#39;s</inline> methods. I am pleased to say he did not get anywhere with the honourable member for Newcastle and I am pleased to be able to show the House he has not got anywhere with me and will not. </para>
          <para>I regret that the member for Shortland has not shown the perception and understanding of his colleague, the former Minister. The member for Shortland, of course, has not had the sobering experience of ministerial office. Perhaps after his performance in this matter he never will. The charges brought by the member for Shortland at the instigation of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cavill</inline> were indeed serious. They were given public airing on at least two national media programmes. It is never my wish to disclose damaging information or evidence against any member of the public or member of this House. However, if the media is used to bring charges which are totally false and mischievous- charges which if unrebutted are personally damaging to the integrity and character of those they have been brought against- the persons bringing them must be exposed. </para>
          <para>It is my sincere wish that the member for Shortland has learnt his lesson. It is my sincere wish that on future occasions the member will make sure of his facts before making such outrageous statements and allowing himself to be used by devious operators for commercial reasons. I thank the House. </para>

                <inline font-weight="bold">Dr John</inline>Deeble, in the report of an interview on Sydney radio station, 2UE, in The Medical Letter of 2 February 1978, was mainly concerned with what had happened since the introduction of Medibank, the effect of the changes made from 1 October 1976, and the experience of the private health funds since then. Preliminary departmental figures show a small decline in utilisation in the number of private medical services per head of population for 1 976-77, as compared with 1975-76, which is a very encouraging fact. The extent utilisation increased between 1974-75 (preMedibank) and 1976-77 (the second year of Medibank) depends on the base used. In Part 2 of my article &#39;Health Financing in the 1980s- The Future Challenge&#39; (published in the AMA Gazette of 2 February 1978), I showed figures of the number of private medical services per head of population. The figure for 1974-75 was 4.70 and for 1976-77 approximately 5.6- a rise of 19 per cent over the two year period. Another way of looking at the pre-Medibank figures is to exclude persons who were not shown in insurance statistics as being covered for private medical benefits services. On the basis of services for which benefits were paid during the year, the figure for 1974-75 is 5.35 per insured person covered, and for 1976-77 the current preliminary figure is 5.61 (total population covered), an increase of 5 per cent. Whatever way figures of utilisation per head are calculated, the facts are that private medical services for which benefits were paid number 66 million in 1974-75 and 79 million in 1976-77, an increase of 20 per cent. In my article I was concerned to show the huge increases in health care costs in recent years and the factors that influenced these costs. The prices of health services had been increasing faster than the rate of inflation, and that compounded with the increase in health services are part and parcel of the increase in Total Health Expenditure, which were shown in Table 1 in my article. Further figures of total health expenditure including 1 976-77 were shown in the tables in my Press Statement of 7 March 1978. These further figures show a significant drop in the rate of increase in health costs, which is a direct result of the Government&#39;s modification to the Health Insurance system from 1 October 1976. </para>

The Department normally publicly notifies other interested parties that it has been approached for a review of protection and invites general comments. If after this information has been compiled, it appears that a prima facie case has been established, warranting a review of the assistance being accorded the industry concerned, a reference is sent to either the Temporary Assistance Authority where emergency protection is sought or to the Industries Assistance Commission whichever is appropriate. Specific details submitted in the course of these investigations relating to individual company&#39;s operations and employment are naturally treated in confidence.

              <para>and (2) During the period 1 January 1976 to 28 February 1978 the Department of Defence placed 17,561 Procurement Demands on the Department of Administrative Services at a total estimated value of $629m. In the same period 22,438 contracts i.e. Contract Acceptance Purchase Orders (CAPO) or Period Contract Acceptance (PCA), were issued at a total value of $524m. The numbers and values of Procurement Demands issued do not directly relate to the numbers and values of contracts placed. This is due in part to the fact that single Procurement Demands often necessitate the placement of a number of contracts. In addition, there are unavoidable time intervals between the issue of Procurement Demands, the issue and evaluation of tenders, and negotiation and arrangement of contracts. The above figures do not embrace orders placed on foreign governments or by Australian Overseas Procurement Agencies e.g. Chief Purchasing Officer, London. </para>

            <para>- The answer to the honourable senator&#39;s question is as follows: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>Statistical information relating to the categories of handicapped people nominated in the question is not readily available. The Australian Bureau of Statistics conducted a survey in 1974 of &#39;Chronic Illnesses, Injuries and Impairments&#39; which identified 3.7 million persons or, 28 per cent of the civilian population covered by the survey, as suffering from one or more chronic illnesses, injuries or impairments. Of this group almost 1 . 2 million or 32 per cent reported that the con  ditions)  limited their activities in some way. </para>
            <para>Each chronic condition reported in the survey was classified according to the most appropriate category of the 1 965 revision of the International Classification of Diseases. However, because a number of individuals reported more than one chronic illness this information does not reveal the number of persons in each category of disability, but rather the total number of chronic illnesses reported. Where a person had more than four chronic illnesses only the four most serious were recorded. </para>
            <para>A further indication of &#39;severe disablement&#39; in the community, is available through certain statistics maintained by my Department, particularly those in relation to its pensioners and beneficiaries, and recipients of various allowances. For example, as at December 1977 there were 197,025 persons in receipt of an invalid pension (being persons who are at least 85 per cent incapacitated for work). Further statistical information is available from the annual report and other departmental publications. The same sources would also provide information relating to Commonwealth rehabilitees. In this latter respect, for example, the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service (CRS) was able to assist some 3,000 severely handicapped persons of working age last year including approximately 1 , 600 who were able to return to various forms of gainful employment following rehabilitation. </para>
            <para>It should also be noted that recent Departmental surveys of sheltered workshops and activity therapy centres obtained information on the major disabilities of persons attending these facilities. Copies of reports on these surveys are available from my Department and I have arranged for the honourable senator to be provided with a copy of each report. </para>
            <para>The honourable senator will recall that lengthy question (No. 1 5 ) relating to disability was included in the 1976 Census. I understand it is expected that data in respect of this question will become available later this year. This will provide some further information concerning the numbers of disabled people in Australia and their needs. However, the question is of a broad nature and detailed follow-up surveys would be necessary to produce sufficiently accurate analyses for specific planning purposes. </para>

              <para>No specific school or tertiary qualifications are required for external interviewers employed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The majority of interviewers, however, have at least the School Certificate or its equivalent. Before starting employment, successful applicants have to pass a written selection test (on general clerical ability, English comprehension and map reading ability) and successfully undertake a five day training course which includes supervised field practice. </para>

            <item label="(2)">
              <para>The main duties of external interviewers are: to call at selected dwellings to obtain interviews; to explain the purpose of the particular survey concerned and answer any queries; to obtain the information required in the survey; to check that the sample of dwellings is correct and up to date; and to check and edit the completed questionnaires. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(3)">
              <para>Payments to interviewers are made according to a system of assessed, rather than actual, hours which a particular workload is estimated to require. This assessment is based on the complexity of the survey, the geographic area and the number of dwellings selected for the survey. Interviewers are also paid mileage allowances for travel during interviewing duties. Population survey interviewers are paid a starting rate of $4.67 per hour, which increases to $4.89 per hour for interviewers who have reached higher standards. Remuneration rates have been linked to the Clerical Assistant grades of the Public Service since August 1973 after a work value study done in conjunction with the Department of the Treasury. For example, $4.89 is the hourly rate of the maximum of the Clerical Assistant Grade 2 range plus a 15 per cent loading for casual work. </para>

            <para>When it became known that the Ancient Order of Foresters Friendly Society in Queensland was in financial difficulties and was about to cease operations (including its medical and hospital insurance operations) action was taken under Section 75 of the National Health Act to secure all relevant documents relating to the organisation&#39;s registered medical and hospital funds. These records are now in the custody of my Department. Further, under Section 82R of the National Health Act, I have requested the organisation to show cause why I should not appoint an Inspector under the terms of the National Health Act. The AOF have 14 days to respond to this order. </para>

            <item label="(">
              <para>1 ) In the 1977-78 Budget context, I announced that up to $1m of Community Health Program funds would be made available for the funding of additional women&#39;s refuges throughout Australia. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>Since that time, the necessary negotiations with State authorities have been completed in all States except Queensland and I have approved Community Health Program funding for 40 additional refuges as well as for the expansion of two refuges previously approved. The Commonwealth Government had every intention of allocating a proportion of the $lm to Queensland to fund additional women&#39;s refuges in 1977-78. To that end, it initiated negotiations with Queensland and other State authorities on 1 8 August 1977- only two days after the 1977-78 Commonwealth Budget was announced. Those negotiations are still continuing in the case of Queensland, and it is hoped that they will be completed before the end of this financial year, so that additional refuges in that State can be funded. Until these negotiations have been completed, I will not be in a position to consider specific recommendations for the funding of additional refuges in Queensland. It follows that I am not yet able to provide details concerning the total amount of funding involved, which women&#39;s refuges are to receive funding or how much each will receive. </para>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(2)">
              <para>Commencing in 1976-77, Commonwealth assistance under the Community Health Program has taken the form of annual block grants to each State for the State&#39;s total program of approved projects including women&#39;s refuges. There are no specific allocations of funds to individual projects by the Commonwealth. When the 1976-77 Community Health Program block grant to Queensland was approved, two on-going women refuges in Queensland- one at Brisbane and one at Townsville- were included in the approved program. However, the Queensland Government decided not to allocate any funds from the block grant to these two refuges and the block grant was used to fund the other community health projects in the approved program for Queensland. Because of the Queensland Government&#39;s stand on this matter, the Commonwealth has departed from the block grant system in relation to the two women&#39;s refuges mentioned above and direct Commonwealth funding of these two refuges was commenced during this financial year. One of the basic issues encompassed by the current negotiations referred to above is that Commonwealth funds will be passed on to any additional women&#39;s refuges which may be approved under the Community Health Program. </para>

              <para>1 ) Yes. The United States of America is spending$US72 million in 1978 on magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) generation. It plans to increase further its expenditure on this research and development next year. I believe that the $US 10 million referred to by the honourable senator concerns a joint project between the United States and the Soviet Union. The United States has loaned to the Soviet Union a magnet weighing 45 tonnes and valued at approximately $US10 million. The magnet has been incorporated in an experimental MHD plant. </para>

Pan of the White Bay Power Station in Sydney has been made available by the New South Wales Government for this project. The project, led by Professor Messerle, has placed Australia in a good position to participate in this form of power generation should developments overseas make it economically feasible. </para>

            <para>Has the Government&#39;s formula for bringing the prices for Australian crude oil to the level of import parity prices resulted in the Esso-BHP organisation receiving for its crude oil $3.40 a barrel instead of $3.20 a barrel, as is indicated in the Budget Papers? Does that constitute a financial windfall to Esso-BHP of some $14.8m in excess of the $109m increase in profit it would make over and above the normal operating profit as a result of the phasing in of the import parity prices policy? If so, is that appropriate at a time when motorists are paying higher prices for petrol, small business is struggling to survive and the worker is continually being asked to tighten his belt? </para>

The average price actually received for the period to 3 1 December 1977 was $3.28 per barrel. These prices relate only to crude oil and do not include condensate, for which the producers have been receiving import parity (less the levy). </para>

            <para>As I indicated in my letter of 20 March, the State Electricity Commission of Victoria has agreed to meet all the costs associated with the construction and operation of hydro-electric power installations at Dartmouth Dam. These works include the construction of a re-regulating dam on the Mitta Mitta River downstream of Dartmouth Dam to smooth out fluctuations in river flow resulting from power station releases. In addition, the Victorian Government has undertaken to be responsible for any river bank erosion directly attributable to the power station operations. </para>

            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">In my reply I indicated that statistics were maintained and that I would provide the Senate with the most up-to-date figures. The Tertiary Education Commission has now provided me with the following information in response to the honourable senator&#39;s question: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Statistics on the number of university graduates who are unable to obtain employment are published in the Graduate Careers Council Publication &#39;First Destinations of 1976 University and College Graduates&#39;. </para>
            <para>Tables 1 and 2 set out the results from the most recent annual survey conducted by the Graduate Careers Council of Australia in respect of university and college graduates seeking, but unable to obtain, full-time employment in the first year following graduation. The tables show the percentages of 1 976 first degree university, and first degree/diploma college graduates, who at 30 April 1977 were still seeking full-time employment, broken down by major subject studied. The survey is based on all university graduates and 40 per cent of college graduates who qualified for awards in 1976. The results are based on a response rate of 79 per cent of university graduates and 58. 5 per cent of the sampled college graduates. </para>
            <para>It should be noted that employment prospects for graduates still remain better than for the population as a whole. Although routine unemployment statistics do not distinguish persons with particular levels of qualifications, a survey carried out by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) in May 1977 estimated that approximately 6,500 graduates were seeking work at that time. The Commission estimates that there were approximately 250,000 persons with university or college degrees in the labour force in 1977. The number of unemployed graduates was thus approximately 2.6 per cent of the total number with graduate qualifications. The level of unemployment for the labour force generally in May 1977 was 5.1 per cent while unemployment among persons aged 20 years and over was about 3.6 per cent. Unemployment among degree holders is thus about three-quarters of the rate for the adult population generally. Unemployment among school leavers in May 1977 was estimated to be 16.3 per cent. </para>
            <para>There are two points to make about these estimates. First, the figure for unemployed graduates is an estimate of the number of persons looking for work; it includes some who even though they would have no difficulty finding a job, remain unemployed in the hope of finding a job more suited to their qualifications and interests. This tendency is more likely to occur among unemployed graduates than the unemployed population generally. Secondly, because most new graduates, like school leavers, go into the labour market in the early part of the year, there are seasonal influences. A survey taken towards the end of the year would certainly show a lower level of unemployment among graduates. Taken together, these figures suggest that the estimates overstate the number of graduates unable to find any employment within a reasonable period following graduation. </para>
