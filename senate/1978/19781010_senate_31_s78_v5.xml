          <para>- by leave- Honourable senators will recall that near the end of the last sittings I outlined the intended plan for Government Business. I think that honourable senators found this helpful in arranging their commitments. Accordingly, it may be equally helpful for honourable senators to be aware of the legislation associated with the Budget planned for the next few weeks. Budgetary measures were outlined in the speech of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard)</inline> on 15 August. Consideration of the necessary legislation in the House of Representatives is being geared towards provision of the Appropriation Bills to the Senate by late October, before the Senate Estimates Committees are expected to report. Other legislation associated with the Budget will be available for debate in the Senate during this week and the next two weeks. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>In particular, the Government considers it essential for the package of income tax Bills to be passed this week, with the social services Bills and health Bills being available for passage next week and the week after. Honourable senators will be aware that these measures are to come into effect on 1 November and there are necessary administrative matters to be settled before then. It is not our desire to restrict reasonable debate on these Bills as, indeed, no restrictions have been suggested on the various first reading debates or the debate on the Budget Papers which already have taken place in the Senate. Nevertheless, the program will be tight and will require the co-operation of all honourable senators. </para>
        <para>Therefore, we are looking particularly to the passage of the five income tax Bills this week. </para>
        <para class="block">These Bills are the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 2), the Income Tax (Rates) Amendment Bill, the Income Tax (Individuals) Bill, the Income Tax (Companies and Superannuation Funds) Bill and the Health Insurance Levy Bill. If additional time is required for debate I suggest that we consider delaying the meeting times for Estimates Committees D, E and F until after 4 p.m. on Thursday. This would allow, in effect, the whole of Wednesday and part of Thursday for the debate on the Bills. This would seem to be the best way of gaining extra time if it should become necessary. I seek the co-operation of honourable senators in that endeavour. </para>

          <para>- by leave- The proposition put forward by the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick)</inline> is not an unreasonable one. The Opposition appreciates the need for the Government to get the income tax Bills through tomorrow, although if need be we can extend the debate into Thursday and delay the sitting of the Estimates Committees until Thursday afternoon. I dare say that we will need to do that. I am concerned that the Minister has said that there is no intention to restrict debate on the income tax Bills especially, not that I imagine for one moment that those Bills will have the slightest impact on getting the Government out of the mess in which it finds itself in regard to the economy. Nevertheless, by the time the Victorian State election comes around some impact might have been made. </para>

        </motion>
        <para class="block">It was with deep shock that we heard last month of the death of Pope John Paul. Elected to the papacy on 26 August, his reign was tragically brief. No pontiff in modern times had so short a tenure. In that lies a very human tragedy, that of a man chosen for his Church&#39;s highest office but who almost in the same hour was taken from it. Yet, even in such a short time, Pope John Paul had been able to make a strong impression, winning widespread affection with his simple, selfeffacing style. </para>
        <para>Pope John Paul was a humble man who came from a poor family. In the years that followed his ordination in 1935, he rose to bishop, archbishop, cardinal and finally Pope. During this period he displayed a capacity for reasonableness and moderation. He also eschewed ostentation and much of the pomp and ceremony of ecclesiastical office. On being elected Pope, he chose to have a simple ceremony for his investiture in St Peters Square. Pope John Paul&#39;s entire ecclesiastical life was spent in northern Italy. But his was no narrow experience. As Archbishop of Venice his diocese included not only this historic and beautiful city, but also the highly industrialised area of Mestre. One of his strengths, which was undoubtedly a factor in his being chosen to succeed Pope Paul, was his involvement in pastoral work including the daily round of visits to the sick, to schools, factories and seminaries. Another factor may have been his outgoing, warm-heartedness. Pope John Paul combined an unassuming manner with infectious good humour. </para>
        <para>Although Pope John Paul had displayed an attachment to orthodoxy, he was prepared to travel down the road of moderate reform opened by the second Vatican Council. He showed deep concern for the poor and the under-privileged. He saw the need for social change and symbolised this by his own personal actions. He was a man of decision tempered by good-humoured tolerance, a man of austerity but with considerable personal charm, a literate man but one able to communicate simply and directly with all peoples. His untimely death will be a loss to both his church and to mankind. </para>

          <para>- On behalf of the Opposition I indicate that we wish to associate ourselves with the condolence motion moved by the Leader of the Government <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick).</inline> The Pope&#39;s death after only 34 days in office came as a great shock to the world, not only to the vast multitude of Catholics around the world but also to those who followed with interest his recent election at the Conclave of Cardinals. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>All the portents were that Cardinal Luciani would become a great spiritual man whose dedication and insights would enable him to lead the Catholic Church in an extremely difficult time in world affairs. His open and amiable personality led to an immediate and positive response from the world community. I think I am correct in saying that his informality- indeed his smiling face on the balcony of St. Peters in Rome after his election- elicited an extremely favourable response around the world. </para>
        <para>There may be those who believed that he would be a great pastoral figure and the fact that he chose a combination of the names of his two predecessors was an indication of his depth of feeling and hope for his flock. The time has been so short that judgment by non-Catholics, and probably most Catholics, is impossible. I am sure that we all hope that a man of the same qualities and with the same commitment will replace this great man. </para>

          <para>-It is only a short time ago that I spoke here on behalf of the group within the Parliament known as the Parliamentary Christian Fellowship to express regret at the death of Pope Paul VI. It is with an equal sense of regret that, in the same capacity, I refer to the death of Pope John Paul and convey our sympathy and remembrance to those who looked to him for their denominational leadership. Although he had been Pope for a mere 33 or 34 days, he had brought to that office a warmth and renewed vitality that was a great hope for the future of his widespread branch of the Christian Church in all its different denominations and affilitations. It will now be a difficult task for the leaders of that Church to consider and elect a successor who might be able to continue in that renewed hope and vitality which Pope John Paul had fostered. The task is enormous and we wish the leaders of the Church well as they meet to elect a successor. The role of the head of the Roman Catholic Church not only carries a responsibility to the Church but also has widespread ramifications for all that is involved in international affairs. As President of the group within the Parliament I express my condolence and remembrance to those people affected and wish the denomination well as it meets to elect a successor. </para>

In relation to the first two matters, the Committee has received correspondence from the responsible Minister but has not had time to consider the latest correspondence. As today is the last day for giving notice of motion, I  have given such notice to allow the Committee time to pursue its inquiries. The third matter is one about which the Committee wrote to the responsible Minister on 14 September 1978 but a reply has not yet been received. Tomorrow is the last sitting day for giving notice in relation to this matter. I have given notice today, as a matter of convenience, to allow the Committee time to consider any reply from the Minister. </para>

            <para>-The Minister representing the Treasurer will recall that the week before last <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McAuliffe</inline> and I asked questions concerning Australia&#39;s current overseas borrowings program. The Minister indicated that he would obtain detailed information concerning that. I assume that that information is still forthcoming- unless, of course, he has it here today. I ask him: Is it a fact that the Australian Government proposes to borrow overseas an additional $600m to the $2, 700m to which we referred two weeks ago? Will the additional borrowings be in Japanese yen? If this is the case, does the Australian Government expect the Japanese yen to depreciate against the Australian dollar or to hold a steady value; or is the Government prepared to accept possible exchange losses on loans borrowed in Japanese yen? </para>

My instinct is that I was advised that it was an informal visit; that it was not an official visit; but that, nevertheless, it could have a status related to discussions. As to the question of whether a similar situation might occur in Australia, I shall refer that question to my colleague in another place. </para>

            <para>- My question is addressed to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> as Minister for Education and also as Minister representing the Minister for Defence. I ask: In view of a recent answer to me that it was the intention of the Government to proceed with the establishment of Casey University, will the establishment of the university be solely a matter for the Minister for Defence and the Department of Defence? Has the Minister for Education some views about the desirability of establishing an isolated educational institution? I further ask: Has the attention of the Minister been drawn to an article in the journal of the Australian Naval Institute of August 1978 in which there is very strong criticism of the proposal to isolate defence personnel in a single purpose institution and strong applause for the Navy&#39;s present policy of sending its young undergraduates to existing universities? This policy was regarded as highly successful because of the exchange the undergraduates can have with civilian students. </para>

            <para>- I have responded in this place on that matter to the effect that the Fraser Government has made a decision in principle to establish a tertiary institution for the combined forces in Australia and that it is to be built and developed in Canberra. That is a factual statement. I am asked whether this is solely the responsibility of the Department of Defence. To the extent that the Australian Defence Force Academy will come directly under the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Defence in another place, the answer is yes. Nevertheless, because it has tertiary institution qualities and because the role of the Tertiary Education Commission is important there will be some liaison and some flow of dialogue between the Tertiary Education Commission and the institution and also those who, in seeking to found the institution, want such information. The aim is to establish the Academy as a fully established and accredited tertiary institution. </para>

          <para>I have not seen the article in the journal of the Australian Naval Institute of August 1978 to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> alludes. I shall seek it and read it. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> will know that over the years the argument as to whether there ought to be a combined defence force academy or other separate institutions has waxed and waned. There are very strong advocates on all sides. For every article such as the one referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> there would be one or two others taking the opposite view. I will seek out the article and study it. </para>

Does the Australian Government continue to support the call to the Indonesian Government to facilitate the entry into East Timor of the International Committee of the Red Cross and other relief organisations in order to assist the people of the territory? Does the Australian Government continue to support the sending of a United Nations special representative to East Timor for the purpose of making a thorough on-the-spot assessment of the existing situation in the territory? Will the Australian Government at the present session put forward specific and positive proposals that are consistent with its publicly stated policies on East Timor in an attempt to overcome the conflict and suffering in the territory and to secure early reunion of Timorese families? Has the Australian delegation received instructions to take constructive steps when this item is considered by the General Assembly? </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">- Senator Missen</inline>asked a series of four questions. My understanding with respect to the role of the International Committee of the Red Cross in East Timor is that Australia channelled funds totalling $167,000 for relief operations in West and East Timor, through the ICRC, as long as the organisation was allowed to operate on the island. When the ICRC&#39;s activities ceased in December 1975 the Government made representations to the Indonesian authorities asking that the ICRC be allowed to return to East Timor. After it became clear that it would not be permitted to return to East Timor, the Government, wishing to continue its humanitarian assistance to the area, agreed that its aid should be channelled through the Indonesian Red Cross. It has continued to do so. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The last three parts of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> &#39;s question raise issues which are likely to come up for consideration by the United Nations General Assembly when the Timor item is debated, probably next month. The Government is not aware of any definitive draft resolution having yet been circulated on this matter. It will carefully consider and come to a position on this and on other matters when definite proposals are available. As to the last part of the question, I can offer an assurance that the Government&#39;s approach to this matter as on other aspects of its contribution to the work of the United Nations will be entirely constructive. </para>
          <para>The question raised two matters on which I would comment further. With regard to the human suffering in Timor, the Government has already acted promptly and positively. On 14 September the Government announced an accountable cash grant of $250,000 for humanitarian relief in East Timor. On the matter of reunion of Timorese families, Australia and Indonesia reached agreement last July for an exchange of immigration teams to facilitate reunions both in Australia and in Timor. It is hoped that this process will be well under way before the end of the year and that the reunions will take place before Christmas. </para>

I preface it by saying that no doubt the Minister is aware that at times many people feel that their telephone accounts are too high. In many cases it appears that they have no effective or satisfactory recourse against the autocratic and, I feel, inefficient accounting system presently used by the Australian Telecommunications Commission. Whilst I agree that some cases of complaint are explainable, in cases when customers know that they are being robbed by Telecom what action can they take to avoid having to pay the account or having their telephone cut off? Secondly, when will Telecom install a subscriber trunk dialling accounting system that details all STD calls on the account so that Telecom cannot blame STD calls when a valid query is made as has been put to me in Tasmania recently? Finally, does he agree that the present accounting system used by Telecom is not healthy and is biased against the customer? </para>

I cannot agree with him that the complaints have been dealt with in an autocratic and inefficient manner. My own experience has been that the Australian Telecommunications Commission has been extremely courteous and helpful in trying to clear up complaints of subscribers. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Townley</inline> raised a matter which is of difficulty for some subscribers because, as far as I know there is no way of running a separate check on the automatic equipment which is used to record telephone accounts and, subject to checking the equipment for accuracy subsequently, there is really no way of dealing with complaints of this sort. </para>

          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Townley</inline>is correct, however, in stating that a method is available which would permit the separate accounting of STD calls. Unfortunately, that system is not in operation. In fact, its installation would be very expensive. I understand from the Minister for Post and Telecommunications that Telecom has made some report on the possibility of introducing this sort of system. It has raised the matter initially on the basis of such a system being available as an optional service, which would probably involve an additional charge to the subscriber to meet the quite considerable capital costs involved. I am informed that the capital expenditure required for an optional service of the sort mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Townley</inline> would be about $56m. So, that is a matter which is still under consideration. There are financial difficulties in the way of introducing it. </para>

If that is the situation, I ask the Minister: Can he give the Senate an assurance that no such transfer of the deposit will be made, having regard to the Government&#39;s indication to the Senate that in the future Woomera will be reserved for a number of Service trials?

It is a fact that the Government, through the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, has communicated with the British Government and, indeed, has sent a telegram to the British Foreign Secretary, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Owen,</inline> requesting urgent consultations about the plutonium buried at Maralinga following the British nuclear testing program there in the 1950s and 1960s. <inline font-style="italic">i</inline> am able to advise <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> that the </para>

Successive British governments have expressed willingness to consult with the Australian authorities in determining whether any further action is necessary on health, safety or other grounds at Maralinga. That answers the immediate question raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop.</inline></para>
          <para>Information on this matter has been available to all governments since the tests were undertaken and a variety of reports have been prepared. I have not heard any suggestion that anybody is contemplating an alternative disposal point in Australia- certainly not Woomera- for the plutonium. I cannot comment on that matter because I have never heard any such suggestions. I certainly will seek assurances on it. I am able to assure the Senate that the Government, facing a number of questions that have been raisedincluding the important one that has emerged of our responsibilities, if any, to the International Atomic Energy Agency- in fact will get the best scientific advice possible on whether there is a problem. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> will know, under the nuclear non-proliferation agreements governments have a duty to report the presence of discrete masses of plutonium. There is a difference of opinion amongst scientists as to whether the plutonium in question falls into that category. That is one problem. The other problem is whether it is recoverable, by friend or foe, and whether in its present or future state it would constitute a hazard. I Will refer all those questions to those who are better placed than I am to answer them. </para>

            <para>-The Department of Employment and Industrial Relations is conscious of the need to display all vacancies and in August 1 978 distributed a policy statement on the matter to offices of the Commonwealth Employment Service. The statement specified that all vacancies were to be placed on public display, the only limitation being the availability of display space. The Department has developed a particular grouping and order of occupations specifically for use on display boards. </para>

            <para>- I preface my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs by reminding the Minister of a statement that I made in this place on 26 September 1978 regarding pressure being applied to members of the Northern Land Council by the Prime Minister, the  Deputy  Prime Minister and the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs in order to get uranium mining under way. I also remind the Minister that the Government made a promise that the Land Council would be allowed to meet without any outsiders being present, and that there would be no coercion by it. I further remind the Minister that a Government senator sat in on a meeting of the Land Council a few days ago. I now ask the Minister: Was the Government representative <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> of Queensland? Were all proceedings of the meeting taped, except when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> was speaking, when the recording equipment was switched off? Which Minister directed <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> to attend the meeting? What instructions were given to the Government senator to pass on to the Land Council, and were instructions given to him to apply pressure for mining to commence? Finally, why did the Government break its promise to the Northern Land Council by instructing a Government senator to attend that meeting, although a Government spokesman had made a public statement that no pressure or coercion would be applied to the Northern Land Council? </para>

It was arranged by the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs in conjunction with my Department. I am not aware who attended the meeting. It was probably arranged by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs; I would think the calling of the meeting was in his hands. As far as my Department was concerned, the ethnic liaison officer was one of the people who was expected to attend that meeting. I believe that the meeting was arranged by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs because of some concern that had been expressed to him by members of the Greek community.

            <para>- I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Transport. It has been reported that the Bureau of Transport Economics, following a survey of some 30 international airlines, believes that the two Australian national airlines- Ansett Airlines of Australia and Trans-Australia Airlinesshould be listed 27th and 28th respectively in order of efficiency and other cost factors. A similar report from Hocking and Forsyth indicates that because of the two-airline agreement there is little encouragement to bring about improved managerial and technical efficiency. In view of the rapid increase in Australia&#39;s air fares and their effect on so many people of the outback and its industries, is consideration being given to a review of the two-airline agreement to bring about a paring of costs to ease the burden on the now somewhat reluctant user? </para>

            <para>-Senator Kilgariff&#39;s question reminds me that it is far better to give than to receive. I remember giving <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Cotton a serve about the two-airline policy and the lack of competition between the two airlines with respect to catering which got me a lot of unfortunate publicity. However, that was easier than receiving the question. I must say to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> that my own experience is that competition between the airlines in the food area has improved. I suspect that the fact that I am representing the Minister for Transport has inculcated a new competitive feeling between the two airlines. I noted newspaper reports on the matters to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> referred. I understand that the Department of Transport suggests that there are matters which make the comparison which has been made by the Bureau of Transport Economics a little difficult to use because there are circumstances peculiar to the Australian airline system. The BTE has also examined economy class air fares and I am advised by the Department that in those comparisons Australia is in the lower half of the scale for all distances considered. </para>

          <para>Some years ago I had prepared for me by the Parliamentary Library some figures on this matter which certainly showed that compared to </para>
          <para class="block">European and American airlines Australia&#39;s airlines compared favourably on flights for many distances. The Government is anxious to encourage lower fares. A matter which will be of particular relevance to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> is what is known as the APEX system. Since last October there has been an experiment in providing lower fares to people who book 30 days in advance. That has been available between capital cities but not with respect to Canberra and Darwin. Both airlines currently have applied for an extension of that experiment- also an extension to cover Darwin- that would enable people to pay a 25 per cent lower fare provided they are prepared to book in advance. </para>

            <para>- How does the Leader of the Government in the Senate accept the fact that this Government has become the biggest borrower in the nation&#39;s history? Is the Minister aware that although these record borrowings were undertaken to stave off devaluation and to encourage an inflow of cash, in the past few weeks official reserves have dropped by $ 1 50m and there could be some outflow? As these matters are of major concern for the nation I ask the Minister: Is the Government hoping that the record borrowing of $700m from Japan will tide it through until inflow picks up? Further, how long is the Government prepared to keep borrowing overseas for these purposes, knowing the position of our asset backing? Finally, is the Minister prepared to defend the Government&#39;s position in the light of his strong views expressed during the period 1972 to 1975 regarding overseas borrowings and the risk of putting the nation in hock? </para>

            <para>- It is a good question because it invites an even better answer. The question is founded on a fallacy. The record borrowing by government is not with the Fraser Government. The Khemlani loans amounted to some $US4,000m with interest rates of between 7.7 per cent and 8.35 per cent compound and with charges and commissions of 2.5 per cent. </para>

              <para>- Since we are talking about being in hock, repayments were for 20 years from the date of receipt of funds and involved total repayments of $17.6 billion on the initial borrowing of $4,000m. One member of the Opposition says that it never happened. Opposition members are talking about record borrowings and about Australia being in hock. Let me indicate the yearly maturities of overseas debt for the next decade. This will show emphatically the repayments to be made and reflect the borrowings made in the Whitlam Government &#39;s era.

              <para>- I can understand the difficulty that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> has.  His  dealings in borrowing were in the foreign tongue, as some may remember. The question related to whether the programs of the Fraser Government would put Australia in hock. I have pointed out what would have happened had the ballot box not given the right answer. In 1979-80, maturing loans in Australian currency will total $259m; in 1980-81, $253m; in 1981-82, $539m; in 1982-83, $488m; in 1983-84, $483m; in 1984-85, $465m; in 1985-86, $267m; in 1986-87, $445m; in 1987-88, $113m; and, in 1988-89, $194m. Those figures do not paint the picture of a country which has been put in hock. </para>

          <para>I do not quite understand the significance of the question. On the one hand the attention of the Government is drawn to the fact that chronic difficulties have occurred in the balance of payments situation. That, of course, has occurred be- &#39; cause of two factors- the huge inflation of the Whitlam era and the 25 per cent tariff cut which caused a flood of imports and a restriction of exports. If anybody should not raise the question of the balance of payments, it is those who belonged to the ill-fated Whitlam Government. </para>

              <para>- What it has to do with the Whitlam Government is that the Whitlam Government knew the sites and knew what was there, and if it thought there was a need for security no doubt it should have reacted accordingly. I merely reported that I would find out the information with regard to the security guards at Maralinga. I pointed out that the material that was being guarded was known about both by our Government and by its predecessors. </para>

            <para>- I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations. The Secretary of the Vehicle Builders Employees Federation, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Joe</inline> Thompson, has been reported as saying that, where a union comes close to covering all the workers in an industry, like the waterside workers or the vehicle builders, it should be able to ask the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to give complete and exhaustive coverage. Is this view shared by other similarly placed unions? Has the Government considered amending the Conciliation and Arbitration Act to make such a practice possible in cases where demarcation issues are likely to cause problems? </para>

            <para>-Section 142a of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act has a provision in relation to the question that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Archer</inline> has asked. It gives power to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to make an order providing that a registered employee organisation shall have the right to represent in respect of all or some industrial interests a class or group of employees who are eligible for membership of the organisation either generally or subject to limitations it may specify. Of course, the Commission has ancillary powers to direct organisations to alter their rules, regarding eligibility. As I have said, this meets some of the objectives to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Archer</inline> refers. It is, of course, open to any organisation to make an application under the provision. I understand that the first case under the section since it was introduced is currently before the Commission. Whether the views expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Thompson</inline> of the Vehicle Builders Employees Federation are shared by others, I am unable to say. </para>

            <para>-Senator Mulvihill has asked me a number of questions in relation to this matter. I undertook to obtain information. I apologise for the delay which has occurred. I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> was principally concerned about the procedures which existed between the Department of Foreign Affairs and my Department. I advise that the Attorney-General&#39;s Department provides legal advice to the Department of Foreign Affairs from time to time on whether there is a legal basis for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to cancel or to refuse to issue a passport. Of course, the passport legislation falls within the administrative responsibility of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. If an offence under the Crimes Act- for example, forgery or bribery- is committed in connection with a passport application, the matter would be referred to my Department. I am also informed that there is no backlog of cases concerning prosecution or possible prosecution of persons for offences under the passport legislation. Arrangements for co-operation between the two departments are operating satisfactorily. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> has any particular question in relation to white collar crime to which he has referred today, and if he gives me more particulars about the matter he has in mind, I shall follow it up. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Transport. I refer to cheaper international air fares for Australian travellers. Is the Minister aware that in the past week there has been considerable public speculation concerning the introduction of a new Australian air policy? Is it true that Australia, to protect Qantas Airways Ltd, will create a number of monopolies and that this will result in cheap air fares being available from Australia to another country only on Qantas and on the national carrier of the other country? Is it true that one aspect of this new policy will be that Qantas will withdraw from Amsterdam, Paris and Belgrade and that, as a result, KLM and UTA will not be permitted to fly to Australia? Finally, does the Minister agree that a most important consideration in this matter is the best interests of the Australian public, that is, Australian travellers being able to enjoy large reductions in air fares and full freedom of choice in relation to air carrier? </para>

            <para>- The honourable senator has asked four questions. The answer to the first is yes. I am aware that there has been a lot of speculation. The answer to the next two questions is that the Government has its airline policy under review. When decisions are made as a result of that review, no doubt they will be announced by the Minister for Transport. I agree that in this area, as in any area of Government policy, the Government must be guided by what is in the best interests of the Australian people. With respect to the particular matter mentioned by the honourable senator, that is the Australian people being able to enjoy a reduction in fares and full freedom of choice of air carrier, I agree that they are important considerations. I add that it is also important to consider the regular availability of flights and so on. No doubt there are other factors which will need to be taken into account by the Government. </para>

I also take it from the nod of his head that his attitude is that if the Labor Party uses them they are good and if the Liberal Party uses them they are bad. I am not aware that the Treasury has any information as to what loss to revenue is incurred from family trusts. </para>

            <para>- I have had a number of representations on this matter. I wish to clarify the position with regard to the eligibility for unemployment benefit of employees at Thomas Borthwick and Sons (Australasia) Ltd at Brooklyn in Victoria. It will be understood that my Department uses the advice of the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations with regard to whether persons who are claiming benefit are actually on strike. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>My advice is that members of the Federated Cold Storage and Meat Preserving Employees Union of Australasia went on strike on 3 1 August over a log of claims and that as a result members of the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union were stood down. It is understood that the men who were members of the AMIEU went on strike from 25 September. The Department of Employment and Industrial Relations has experienced some difficulty in obtaining details of the strike. It has advised that the dispute was a complex one involving two unions, with the employer wishing to deal with only one union while refusing employment to members of the other. </para>
          <para>There have been claims that members of the Federated Cold Storage and Meat Preserving Union have voted to return to work and are being denied employment but it has not been possible to ascertain the facts. Some employees have been employed for short periods during the period in which they were stood down. Earnings received during that time are being treated as income in the normal manner where entitlement to unemployment benefit exists. At this stage the members of the Federated Cold Storage and Meat Preserving Union on strike are considered to be direct participants of a strike and ineligible for unemployment benefit. This view will be reconsidered if further information about the employment status of this group becomes available. </para>
          <para>Members of the AMIEU stood down are eligible for unemployment benefit, subject to normal conditions, for the period in which they are stood down. They are ineligible for unemployment benefit for any period in which they are on strike. My Department is in close contact with the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations. As I said, the matter could be reconsidered if further information were available. I will see that if any further information becomes available <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hamer</inline> is advised. </para>

          <para class="block">This is particularly true while resource levels in the Territory are so clearly superior to other States. Some reallocation of resources within the secondary years and within the system would be advantageous. The same statement about secondary colleges is made in the Neal Hird report. I can only call upon the teachers to go back to work, to cease the rolling strikes. They are totally unnecessary, particularly as the quality of education in the Australian Capital Territory, on the say so of the Schools Commission, is the highest in Australia and is not in any way being challenged. </para>

            <para>- What a pity that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ryan</inline> has not either listened to or read the answers I have given to questions asked in recent weeks. Those answers showed that not only have we maintained the gap of superiority for schools in the Australian Capital Territory compared with schools in the States, but also that in fact that gap has widened. The figures, of course, are Schools Commission figures. I take it that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ryan</inline> is saying that the Schools Commission is wrong and that the figures are wrong. I will present the figures to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ryan;</inline> she will find them in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> I stress that what has happened is that over that period the gap has not only been maintained but also been widened. Where the quality of education is the best in Australia, it can only be jeopardised by industrial action. I regret that fact. I regret that children are being used as the pawns of industrial action. There was never any need for that action. I call upon the good sense of the teachers to stop the rolling strike. </para>

I am mindful of the fact that the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence set up a sub-committee on territorial boundaries which did have a brief look at the fishing industry in terms of foreign vessels fishing in Australian waters, but I am informed by some members of that Committee that they did not go into the Australian fishing industry in any great depth.

          <para>Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1978 </para>
          <para>The major purpose of this and associated Bills I shall shortly introduce is to give effect to the Government&#39;s income tax proposals announced in the Budget Speech of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard).</inline> Before proceeding to the matters dealt with in this Bill, I mention one of the Budget proposals to which effect will be given by the Income Tax (Rates) Amendment Bill which I will be introducing shortly. This is the proposal to increase, for this year only, the standard rate of personal income tax by 1V4 percentage points from 32 to 33 V4 per cent, with corresponding increases to 47 Vi per cent and 6114 per cent at higher income levels. I mention it now because of its importance and because it has technical and other implications for items in this Bill. As the Treasurer indicated in his Budget Speech, it is necessary to raise substantial additional revenue for 1978-79 and this is one of the measures chosen to do this in the most equitable and economically responsible manner. </para>
		  <para>LUMP SUM RETIREMENT PAYMENTS FOR UNUSED LEAVE</para>
		<para>One of the Budget proposals dealt with in the Bill is the changed basis of assessing lump sums received on retirement for unused annual and long service leave. At present, only 5 per cent of such a lump sum is subject to tax and this can act as something of an encouragement not to take the leave during a taxpayer&#39;s working life. The Government considers that the tax system should not have this effect. Accordingly, the Bill provides that the full amount of any lump sum payment for annual leave that is made on retirement after 15 August 1978- Budget day- is to be taxed. The payments to be taxed in this way will include any bonus or loading relating to the unused leave. </para>
		<para>In the Budget Speech the Treasurer said: </para>
		<quote>
        <para>After tonight, the whole of lump sum payments for unused annual leave will be taxed in full as ordinary income. </para>
      </quote>
		<para class="block">In certain cases the accrued annual leave pay if combined with ordinary income would have pushed the taxpayer into a different tax bracket. To prevent this occurring the Government has decided that unused annual leave payments should be taxed at no more than the standard rate, namely, 33.5 per cent in 1978-79. Whilst the Government&#39;s decision on annual leave will have altered the expectations of some who had accumulated annual leave entitlements at Budget time, it is incorrect to claim- as some have- that the Budget decision is a retrospective change to the law. </para>
		<para>Such a change is one which backdates a change to the law and retrospectively alters a previously enjoyed right. The right in question is that of an employee to accumulate annual leave entitlements and to take those entitlements in a lump sum at the rate of tax applicable when the lump sum is paid. This right is maintained. In no case will the decision affect a lump sum payment made before 15 August 1978 although as the Treasurer has acknowledged it will result in persons who had accumulated annual leave prior to the Budget paying a higher rate of tax when the lump sum is received than they might have anticipated at the time the accumulation took place. </para>
		<para>The law regarding the taxation of lump sum payments due to long service leave has been altered. The Bill treats separately entitlements earned before the Budget and since the Budget. These changes apply in cases where payment is made and retirement, or termination, takes effect after 15 August 1978. In the case of entitlements earned up to Budget day, the situation remains the same. Only 5 per cent of the part of the lump sum attributable to the period up to 15 August 1978 is counted as assessable income. On the other hand, the part of a lump sum that is attributable to the period between 15 August 1978 and the date of retirement is to be fully assessable, but the rate is not to exceed the standard rate, namely 33.5 percent for 1978-79. The limitation on the rate for both annual and long service leave lump sums will overcome any bunching effect that might otherwise have arisen from the inclusion of these amounts in the taxable income of a single year. </para>
		<para>The changes will not apply to payments made to a dependant or legal personal representative of a deceased employee. These are to remain free of tax. Pay-as-you-earn deductions at the standard rate of tax will be made from assessable lump sum payments made on or after 1 November 1978. </para>
		<para>AVERAGING FOR PRIMARY PRODUCERS</para>
		<para>In continuation of the Government&#39;s measures to achieve a fairer tax system, the Bill will adjust the averaging system for primary producers so as to confine its benefits more directly to income from primary production. Under the new system, average income will continue to be calculated on the basis of the taxable incomes of the relevant years. It will not be calculated only on the basis of primary production income. Income derived from primary production will continue to qualify for averaging benefits no matter how much other income is derived. Only a limited amount of nonprimary production income may, however, qualify for the benefits for 1978-79 and later years. Non-primary production income up to $5,000 net will continue to qualify, but this amount is to be shaded out by one dollar for each dollar over $5,000 so that non-primary production income of $10,000 or more will not be subject to any averaging benefit. </para>
		<para>To achieve this result the Bill adopts the technique of providing a tax rebate for a primary producer whose average income is less than his or her taxable income. Where non-primary production income is $5,000 or less, allowance of the rebate will attain the same result as the present averaging system. In other cases, non-primary production income up to $5,000 will be treated as primary production income and the new averaging benefit will be the part of the amount of the benefit calculated under the present system as bears to that amount the same proportion as primary production income- including the up-to-$5,000 allowance- included in taxable income bears to the whole taxable income. </para>
		<para>These changes will reduce the use of tax avoidance schemes based on primary producer status, but retain for genuine primary producers the averaging benefit needed by them to compensate for fluctuating primary production income. </para>
		<para>SELF-ASSESSMENT OF PROVISIONAL TAX</para>
		<para>Some changes to the system of self-assessment of provisional tax are to be effected by this Bill. They are designed to overcome losses of revenue due to the practice of some taxpayers of knowingly under-estimating current year income so as to reduce provisional tax payments. Existing self-assessment provisions may be exploited in this way in the knowledge that the additional tax for which the law makes provision in cases of underestimation will not be payable if the estimate is not less than 80 per cent of the taxable income of either the current year or the previous year. </para>
		<para>This will be changed for 1978-79 and later years so that additional tax will be payable where the estimated income in respect of which provisional tax is payable, that is, income other than salary or wages, turns out to be more than 10 per cent below the actual income, other than salary or wages, for the year. The Commissioner of Taxation will, as at present, be able to remit the additional tax where an under-estimate is due to circumstances which were not apparent when it was made. </para>
		<para>REBATE ON CONCESSIONAL EXPENDITURES EXCEEDING $1,590</para>
		<para>At present, the rate of rebate for certain concessional expenditure in excess of $1,590 on items such as medical and education expenses, life assurance and superannuation, municipal rates, et cetera, is equal to the standard rate of tax of 32 per cent. As a consequence of the temporary increase in the standard rate for 1978-79 this rebate rate is to be increased to <inline font-style="italic">33Vi</inline> per cent for that year. </para>
		<para>HOME LOAN INTEREST</para>
		<para>Provisions in the BDI will terminate the housing loan interest deduction with effect from 1 November 1978. Accordingly, the deduction in respect of housing loan interest for the 1978-79 income year will be based on interest accrued up to 3 1 October 1978 that is paid by 30 June 1979. Employers are being instructed not to give effect to housing loan interest claims in pay as you earn deductions after 1 November. </para>
		<para>COMMONWEALTH POST-GRADUATE AWARDS</para>
		<para>The Bill provides for the withdrawal of the exemption of income derived after 3 1 October 1978 under the Commonwealth post-graduate awards scheme. An associated amendment will provide for living allowances paid under this scheme to be included in the PA YE system as from 1 November 1978. </para>
		<para>REBATES FOR DEPENDANTS RESIDING OVERSEAS</para>
		<para>The Bill also provides for the withdrawal- as from 1 November 1978- of rebates for the maintenance of dependants resident overseas. This measure, which is in line with the views expressed in the report of the review of post-arrival programs and services to migrants, was made necessary by the mounting abuse of the existing provisions with substantial costs to revenue. The amendment will not affect rebates for dependants temporarily overseas who continue to be residents of Australia for taxation purposes, nor will it affect rebates for wives and children awaiting migration to Australia. As the rebate is being discontinued as from 1 November 1978, a partial rebate, equal to one-third of the rebate otherwise allowable on a full year basis, will be allowed for qualifying dependants who were non-residents in the period up to 31 October 1978. </para>
		<para>GIFTS TO WORLD WILDLIFE FUND AUSTRALIA</para>
		<para>The World Wildlife Fund Australia is to be brought within the gift provisions of the income tax law so that donations of $2 or more to the Fund will be tax deductible. </para>
		<para>HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY</para>
		<para>As part of the major changes to health care arrangements announced in the Treasurer&#39;s Budget Speech the health insurance levy is to be terminated with effect from 1 November 1978. Measures to give effect to this proposal are included in this Bill and in the associated Health Insurance Levy Bill 1978. People who are fully covered by private health insurance or other arrangements during the period 1 July 1978 to 31 October 1978 will be exempt from the levy for 1978-79. Those who are not so exempt will pay levy on their taxable incomes for the whole of 1978-79, but at a rate equal to one-third of the full year rate of 2.5 per cent and subject to levy ceilings equal to one-third of those that have applied for a full year. </para>
		<para>CALCULATION OF 1978-79 PROVISIONAL TAX</para>
		<para>Provision is made in the Bill for the amount of the temporary increase of <inline font-style="italic">Vh</inline> per cent in the standard rate for 1978-79 to be taken into account in calculating provisional tax for that period. The health insurance levy component of provisional tax is to be reduced by two-thirds of the amount payable for 1977-78 so as to reflect the abolition of the levy as from 1 November 1978. </para>
		<para>TAX AVOIDANCE</para>
		<para>A feature of this Government&#39;s tax policy has been a vigorous assault on tax avoidance practices. As the Treasurer said in his Budget Speech the time is long since past when governments or the community should tolerate the blatant, artificial and contrived means whereby certain sections of the community seek to pay little or no tax to the detriment of the general body of taxpayers and the equity of the tax system&#39;. The pressure against tax avoidance will be resolutely maintained this financial year. As new forms of tax avoidance are identified, announcements indicating that appropriate legislation is to be introduced will be made and that legislation will be effective from the date of such announcements. </para>
		<para>It is impossible to quantify precisely the cost to revenue of tax avoidance schemes and practices. There can, however, be little doubt that the actions of this Government in recent months have prevented a loss to revenue of hundreds of millions of dollars. During the past 12 months alone, the Government has introduced or foreshadowed legislation dealing with many tax avoidance practices including the following: The so-called Curran scheme, current year losses, abuse of averaging provisions, dividend stripping, trust stripping, pre-paid rent and interest, abuse of gift provisions, share trading loss schemes, sales tax avoidance practices and schemes involving the abuse of deductions for mortgage payments, trading stock and interest and rent. </para>
		<para>The Government believes there is widespread community support for action to curb tax avoidance. Tax avoidance on the scale practised in recent years has been an affront not only to the average wage earner who has little capacity to participate in such schemes but also to numerous high income earners who, having both the capacity and the incentive to participate in such schemes, have consciously chosen not to do so. The warning to those who promote tax avoidance schemes should be clear enough. This Government is determined to clamp down on those schemes as vigorously as possible. </para>
		<para>CONCLUSION</para>
		<para>Details of the various measures in the Bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum that is being circulated. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>
		<para>Income Tax (Rates) Amendment Bill 1978</para>
        <para>This Bill will amend the Income Tax (Rates) Act 1976 which declares the rates of tax payable by individuals and trustees and includes provision for the automatic indexation of these rates in consequence of movements of the Consumer Price Index. The main feature of the Bill is the increase in the standard rate of personal income tax for the  1978-79  financial year from  32  per cent to  33V4  per cent. The general rate of tax applicable to the amount of taxable income from  $ 16,609  to  $33,2 1 6  will also increase from  46  per cent to  47 <inline font-style="italic">Vi</inline> per cent, while that applicable to taxable income in excess of  $33,216  will increase from  60  per cent to  6 1  per cent. The increase is a temporary measure and the Bill provides that it will not continue beyond the end of this financial year. </para>
        <para>The increase will be reflected in higher pay as you earn deductions as from  1  November  1978.  These are to be raised by the amount necessary to collect the full year&#39;s increase in tax in the period between  1  November  1978  and  30  June  1979.  Provisional tax for  1978-79  will also be adjusted to include the <inline font-style="italic">\Vi</inline> per cent rate increase. Other amendments to be effected by the Bill are consequential upon the changes to the averaging provisions proposed in the Bill that I have just introduced. Under the existing averaging provisions, an average rate of tax is declared for application to the taxpayer&#39;s taxable income. Under the new arrangements a taxpayer to whom the averaging provisions apply will be taxed at the ordinary rates of tax. This tax will then be reduced by a rebate equal to the tax saving that would result if the average tax rate were applied to primary production income or income treated as primary production income. Details of the changes proposed by the Bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum that is being circulated and I do not think it is necessary for me to elaborate further at this stage. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>
		<para>Income Tax (Individuals) Bill 1978</para>
        <para>This Bill is an annual measure. Its purpose is to formally impose tax for  1978-79  at the rates declared in the Income Tax (Rates) Act  1976,  as proposed to be amended by the Bill I have just introduced. .This year the Bill contains a special measure to provide a rebate of tax for  1978-79  for a limited number of taxpayers who would otherwise have suffered a small detriment arising from the substitution of the standard rate system from  1  February  1978,  with half indexation for  1978-79,  for the previous personal income tax system, fully indexed. </para>
        <para>The great majority of taxpayers are better off under the standard rate system than they would have been under the previous system. However, it was appreciated when the new system was introduced that some taxpayers in a limited income range could suffer a very small disadvantage in  1978-79  and it was announced then, and again by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard)</inline> in June this year, that a rebate would be provided to avoid this detriment. The rebate will apply in the range of taxable income from  $6,601  to  $6,978,  the maximum being  $7.10  for an income of  $6,742.  Details of the provisions of the Bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum which has been made available to honourable senators. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>
		<para>Income Tax (Companies and Superannuation Funds) Bill 1978</para>
        <para>This Bill will impose income tax for  1978-79  on the  1977-78  incomes of companies, and the  1978-79  incomes of superannuation funds, at the rates declared by the Bill. With one exception, the rates declared by the Bill are the same as those declared for  1977-78  and the provisions of the Bill follow the same lines as in earlier years. The only rate change proposed is for superannuation funds which are taxed in accordance with section  12 Ida  of the Income Tax Assessment Act. These funds, which are broadly in the nature of accumulation trusts, are taxed at a rate equal to the maximum rate of personal tax and, in consequence of the proposed temporary increase of  1 <inline font-style="italic">Vi</inline> per cent in the rates of personal income tax for  1978-79,  the rate of tax applicable to the income of these funds is to be increased from  60  per cent to  6 1  per cent for the  1 978-79  financial year. Details of provisions of the Bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum that has been circulated. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>
		<para>Health Insurance Levy Bill 1978</para>
        <para>This Bill imposes health insurance levy, at the rate declared in the Bill, on taxable incomes for  1978-79  of individual taxpayers liable to the levy. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard)</inline> announced in his Budget Speech that, under new health care arrangements, the health insurance levy is to cease to apply as from  1  November  1978.  Reflecting the fact that the levy is to apply for only one-third of the year, the rate of levy, to apply to taxable income for the whole of the year, is to be  0.833  per cent, that is, one-third of the  2.5  per cent rate which applied for the full  1977-78  year. Consistently with that, the proposed levy ceilings, which limit the amount of levy payable, will be  $50  for a single person and  $100  for a person with dependants, that is, one-third of the ceilings of  $150  and  $300  respectively which applied in  1977-78. </para>
        <para>Under provisions applying in 1977-78, people who were adequately covered by private health insurance or other arrangements for the whole of the year were exempt from the levy. For 1978-79 people will be exempt from the levy if they have adequate private cover for the whole of the period from 1 July 1978 to 31 October 1978. Details of the features of the Bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum that has been circulated. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

I have given certain undertakings to the Court, in interlocutory proceedings for an interim injunction, not to release the report. I am not, therefore, in a position to make this report available. I have decided that the three accident reports may now be made available subject to the deletion of certain matter identifying persons from whom statements were taken, the release of which I consider would have a substantial adverse effect on staff management interests of the Australian National Railways within the meaning of clause 29 of the Freedom of Information Bill. </para>

In that reply he referred in general terms to the mail he received concerning some programs on the ABC and made comment about the volume and nature of the mail. I should mention that the Australian Broadcasting Commission does not maintain &#39;complaint files&#39; as such. Correspondence from listeners and viewers directed to the Minister and the Commission concerning programs is maintained on various correspondence files depending on the subject concerned. It would be impracticable to attempt to extract from the Commission&#39;s files the broadly defined correspondence sought by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McMillan.</inline></para>

The retrieval and release of the correspondence sought would require an unreasonably extensive use of the Commission&#39;s limited administrative resources, which I am not prepared to authorise. My decision is in accordance with clause 13 of the Bill which provides, among other things, for the refusal of a request for access that is expressed to relate to all documents of a specified class if compliance with the request would interfere unreasonably with the operations of an agency, having regard to any difficulty in identifying, locating or collating the documents within the filing system of the agency. </para>

I should also say that in my view it would be proper for the Commission, if it made documents relating to complaints available, to do so on the basis that identifying personal details would be omitted in cases where this was necessary to preserve the privacy of those making complaints. I will also ask the Commission to review its administrative procedures in the light of the provisions of the Bill. Such a review would, of course, take some time to complete. </para>

            <item label="(">
              <para>1 ) Yes. The Australian Government Engine Works is the only facility in Australia capable of building and testing large diesel engines (up to 26,000 bhp) for both marine and land based applications. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>In 1949 the Works began to build large slow speed marine diesel engines for installation in Australian coastal ships, first under licence to William Doxford and Sons UK, and then from 1961 also under licence to Sulzer Bros Switzerland. </para>
          <para>The Works has built and tested 16 slow speed Doxford engines totalling 58,000 bhp (43,500 kW) and 13 slow speed Sulzer engines totalling 125,000 bhp (90,300 kW). </para>
          <para>The land based market for medium speed engines of the type used in mining, oil exploration, pipeline and other fields is served by several private firms who import the smaller (sometimes pre-tested) engines in partly assembled or knock-down set form then assemble, install and test on site. In this situation it has not been as necessary to have a separate test facility. </para>
          <para>The question refers to &#39;producing&#39; engines. It should be understood that, depending on the size of the engine and the delivery time specified, the Works has always imported 70 to 80 per cent of each engine in the form of major components. Local Australian manufactured content has been generally in the area of 20 per cent. </para>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(2)">
              <para>The importance of the Works is closely related to the building of large ships in Australia. In terms of defence significance, the Department of Defence has indicated that a major program involving building of large ships is only envisaged as arising during a large-scale and protracted conflict. Diesel engines produced by the Works have never been incorporated in an Australian Naval vessel, although two Sulzer slow speed engines of overseas manufacture were fitted in HMAS Stalwart. It is relevant to note that two major inquiries into Shipbuilding, namely those by the Tariff Board in 1971 and the Industries Assistance Commissin in 1976, have found the construction of large merchant ships is not of primary defence importance. Present Government policy regarding assistance to construction of large merchant ships continues the policy announced by the previous Government in 1973. Since then, the competitive position of the local shipbuilding industry has continued to erode. This Government early in its life, after considering many representations and after searching inquiry, decided not to vary the existing assistance arrangements. Considerations of defence, including those also put forward by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence in its October 1 977 report, were weighed most carefully before the Government arrived at the conclusion that the cost to the community of the assistance needed to protect the industry&#39;s future in Australia was well beyond that justified on economic, social and defence grounds. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(3)">
              <para>The Government&#39;s preferred objective is to dispose of the Works as a going concern and ideally we would wish to see it continuing to operate in a repair and servicing role associated with diesel engines, much as it does now. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>The possibility of combining the Works with Williamstown Naval Dockyard has been examined by the Government and its views were communicated to the Unions in July 1978. Briefly, the conclusion was that no way could be seen to integrate the AGEW facilities into the planned development of the dockyard without detriment to the operating efficiency of the dockyard. </para>

For most of them this consciousness of certain shared interests and problems despite great differences is indicated by their co-operation in the so-called &#39;Group of Seventy-Seven&#39; and the NonAligned Movement. </para>

            <para>The Tertiary Education Commission has advised that there is no academic body other than the Australasian College of Dermatologists which co-ordinates research in the field of dermatology. Although I am concerned by the high incidence of dermatological complaints incurred by Australians, in my view, it is not the Government&#39;s role to establish professional academic bodies, particularly where a similar body is already in existence. </para>
            <para>The decision to establish Chairs of Dermatology rests with universities, as do all matters relating to their academic affairs. The Tertiary Education Commission has advised that it has received no proposals from any university for the establishment of a Chair of Dermatology. However, aspects of dermatology are taught in most medical courses offered by Australian universities. </para>

            <para>I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Post and Telecommunications whether his attention has been drawn to a High Court judgment handed down recently by  His  Honour <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Keith</inline> Aickin, in which judgment  His  Honour declared null and void the granting of licences for two commercial radio relay stations in Queensland on the ground that the former Australian Broadcasting Control Board in its hearing had denied natural justice to the parties concerned? Has the Minister&#39;s attention been directed particularly to the Judge&#39;s comments that &#39;it would be an unauthorised exercise of discretion to deny to all parties a right of cross-examination&#39;. Because the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal in its hearing to date has been allowing- in my opinion, properly allowing- an air of informality in its public hearings on applications for renewal of licences and because there is so much public interest in the matter, can the Minister saywhether the Tribunal intends adopting its existing practicesorwhether the High Court judgment now means thatture hearings conducted by the Tribunal the right c. cross-examination must be allowed? If the Minister is not in a position to provide an answer immediately to the question because of the great interest in the matter, particularly in the broadcasting and television industries, will he ascertain what is the position and provide me with an answer as early as possible? </para>

            <para>The general point I sought to make is that the world is over-armed. In seeking to identify some of the causes of this I indicated that there is a vicious spiral fed by a process whereby the acquisition of armaments by some leads to reactions to such acquisition by others, and so on. In these circumstances there is no simple yardstick by which blame can be apportioned to individual countries. The defence of one &#39;s country is not of course a matter that can be taken lightly. However, it is a sad reflection that some countries which have the military capacity to influence and intervene well beyond their zones of direct security interests, are quite pointedly demonstrating their will and capacity to so intervene. By way of comparison the Soviet Union spends of the order of 11-13 per cent of GNP on defence against 6 per cent by the United States. </para>
            <para>The horrifying position the world has got itself into may be indicated by a few figures published by the internationally respected Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. In 1976 the world spent on the military something of the order of $325-5400 billion, at least as much as it spent on health and more than it spent on education. Over the past decade military expenditure has risen by some 13 per cent world wide. World military expenditure is now roughly twice the size of the total GDP of all the countries in Africa. Surely this level of expenditure cannot be justified as a response to legitimate defence requirements? </para>

          <para>Australia&#39;s nuclear safeguards policy remains as announced by the Prime Minister on 24 May 1 977 and has not changed in any way. I commend to the attention of honourable senators the statement in the House of Representatives by the Minister for Foreign Affairs when he presented the two recently concluded safeguards agreements with Finland and the Philippines. The statement was tabled in the Senate on 24 August 1978 <inline font-style="italic">(Hansard,</inline> page 394); it confirms that the agreements incorporate all the safeguards requirements announced i n the policy statement of 24 May 1977. When the Government concludes agreements with other countries such agreements will also be in full conformity with the policy statement. </para>
