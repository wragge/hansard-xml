            <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr President,</inline>on behalf of the Australian Democrats I extend to you our very sincere congratulations and my personal congratulations, if I may. You and I have enjoyed a personal friendship since the halcyon days of 1 966 when we went to a wine festival in South Australia together. That friendship has been maintained, and I have admired the way in which you have conducted this chamber. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mason</inline> and I will be giving you every form of assistance to uphold and maintain the decorum and dignity of which this chamber is justly proud. We will make mistakes because one of us is an enthusiastic amateur and the other is a hardened professional who is still ignorant in the rather mysterious ways of the Senate. We give you our congratulations and good wishes. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">-Mr President,</inline>I join with other senators in congratulating you on being elected to the office of  President  of the Senate. Your office is not made easy by two factors. One is the presence of a new party, the Australian Democrats, and the other is that you still have an Independent senator. Your task is not made easy by virtue of those factors. Certainly our task is not made easy by the fact that the business of the Senate is sorted out between the Leader of the Government, the Leader of the Opposition and the various Whips, often without any reference to us. The right of an independent senator in this place, and indeed the right of any senator in this place, to voice the opinions of his or her electors does not depend on the Leader of the Government, the Leader of the Opposition or the Whips. It depends on you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President.</inline> I am sure that you will continue to act in the way that you have acted over the past three years, to my knowledge, in providing the opportunity as required for independent senators and other senators who are not members of the major parties to express the viewpoints for which they were elected by the people of their particular State. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline>Pope Paul was the spiritual leader for the last 15 years of the world&#39;s 700 million Roman Catholics.  His  term of office coincided with an upsurge of the ecumenical movement and far reaching changes in society throughout the world, arising from new points of view on human relationships, ethical values, political motivations and technological advance. Pope Paul handled these challenges calmly and wisely, with moderation, tenacity and courage. He emphasised peace as the most essential need of our time, and this was reflected in his innovation of the observance of 1 January as the World Day of Peace </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">His</inline>Holiness, having inherited a Church minded to pursue changes and reforms in its organisation, liturgy and social attitudes, saw to it that the changes were realistic and humane. There were also changes in Vatican policy brought about by Pope Paul in the field of international affairs. Under him, the Vatican took a much more active part in the world. Foreign policy concerns of the Holy See under Pope Paul included: The problems of the proliferation of nuclear weapons; the improvement of social welfare; assisting the development of the poorer countries; a rapprochement with China; the evolution of relations with Marxist regimes; and a desire to expand official communications with the Communist, Islamic and Asian world in order to ensure the maintenance and continuity of the freedom of Christian observance. </para>
        <para>Pope Paul travelled widely, disregarding risks to his person, and became the first reigning Pontiff to visit all continents. We remember the warmth generated by his visit to Australia in 1970. It was during his reign that Australia opened diplomatic relations with the Holy See. These have proved of great value in the conduct of Australia&#39;s foreign affairs. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> Pope Paul was a man whose strengths and personality became clearer the longer he remained as Pope.

          <para>- The Opposition wishes to associate itself with the motion of condolence on the death of Pope Paul VI. A great many things have been said already about this great and gentle man&#39;s contribution to the work of the Catholic Church and the world at large. As head of the Catholic Church, Pope Paul stood in a unique position of being able to influence the minds of men beyond the territorial borders and national allegiances which constrain moves for peace in a troubled world. In that position he was able to speak to and have influence over people who, in their own countries or as between neighbours, may be terribly divided. There were times when he used his influence to try to make the world a better place in which to live. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Amongst the many events in his life there are two which were of major importance and which conveyed the real nature of the man. In 1 964 he visited Jerusalem. At that time the old walled city was still occupied by Jordanian forces, and to Jews and Christians access was extremely limited. It was at considerable risk to his life that he made the visit. He appealed constantly for a just settlement in the Arab-Israeli conflict. In 1965, when the United States of America was becoming more and more involved in the disastrous war in Vietnam, the Pope became publicly involved in the international moves for peace. Time and time again he pleaded for a Christmas truce, for negotiations for a settlement and for the humane treatment of prisoners. In December 1967 he met  President  Johnson and made a special plea that the United States should stop bombing Vietnam as a prelude to peace negotiations. Unfortunately the war continued, but with an admirable persistence Pope Paul, in 1968 and 1969, offered the Vatican as the site for the Vietnam peace negotiations. The concern for peace in the world extended beyond these two major conflicts. He made peace overtures to the leaders in the warring factions of Nigeria and raised over $7m for the relief of famine in India and Pakistan. </para>
        <para>In efforts to consolidate the work of the Church, in 1966 Pope Paul met the Soviet Foreign Minister, Gromyko and later, in 1967, the Soviet President, Podgorny. The mellowing of old conflicts resulted in closer relations between the Vatican and the eastern European countries and the United Soviet Socialist Republic. Nothing can disguise the fact that Pope Paul believed in and worked towards international disarmament and a concern for the people of the world who live in constant poverty. He used his own office and wrought changes to the structure of the Catholic Church to implement those beliefs. It is sad when the world loses a man who is not tied by national sovereignty and who has shown a lifelong commitment to the ideal of peace in our time. </para>

          <para>Whatever may be said, or in time done, about Pope Paul &#39;s guidance to the Church on matters of morality, history will probably record him as a Pope who bound the wounds of a fragmented Christianity and who travelled ceaselessly and painfully in the search for peace.

          <para>- I wish to associate the Australian Democrats with this motion of condolence on the death of Pope Paul VI. We express our sympathy to Catholics both in Australia and throughout the world. As spiritual leader of 700 million Catholics during a most turbulent period Pope Paul&#39;s burden was a heavy one, but he never tried to conceal the mental anguish which his responsibilities brought him. The Pope reacted with personal grief to wars and conflicts such as those in Vietnam, the Middle East and Northern Ireland. He was always ready to use his considerable moral influence in the cause of peace, both in public statements and in private diplomacy.  His  major pronouncement on the development of peoples gave strong leadership on development and social justice in the Third World. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>This gave a new emphasis to the Christian duty of concern for the poor and suffering. It firmly committed Catholics to work for social justice. In Pope Paul&#39;s last years he often spoke movingly of old age and death. His personal empathy with the aged and handicapped became more marked. Our best wishes go to the College of Cardinals when the Cardinals meet to choose his successor, who will inherit such an awesome and responsible task. </para>

I refer to the Parliamentary Christian Fellowship of which it is my privilege to be the  President.  That organisation is what its name says it is, and we number among our members in the Parliament those whose relationship to the late Pope Paul VI had a great denominational strength and personal significance. All of our members acknowledge with thanksgiving the Pope&#39;s contribution to the maintenance of high personal principles, worthy national standards and peaceful international relations. In the world of parliamentary and political affairs, Pope Paul guided international public opinion so that the many facets of community needs should receive the best possible attention.  His  Christian citizenship was a reminder to us all that we have a common responsibility to our fellows. The Parliamentary Christian Fellowship mourns his passing and assures those closest to him and to his office of our kind remembrance. </para>

          <para>- I find it difficult to make a reasoned comment on some of the remarks that have been made about the Holy Father in this condolence motion. I will therefore refer to some of the comments that have been made in the Press and which have sought to paint the late Holy Father as either a latter day Wolsey, a diplomat trying to tread the middle path between so-called conservatives and so-called progressives within the church, and or as some sort of modern Humpty-dumpty who was afraid to fall off the wall on one side or the other. Both of those descriptions are totally unworthy of a person who was a saintly religious man and who sought the truth fearlessly. I give only two examples to those in the media who are now painting that sort of picture. I refer first to the famous encyclical of almost 10 years ago, Humanae Vitae&#39;. That encyclical which the Holy Father wrote upheld the deeply human and divine significance of the act of procreation. Some of the people in the media who are painting the picture that I mentioned previously are the ones who, moved by vested interests, were the first to criticise the Holy Father for his encyclical, .U&#39;.---I- Vitae&#39; </para>

        <para>It has often been said that the Holy Father was seeking a peace which was not a true peace; that is, a peace with justice. At no stage did the Holy Father make any statement which called for unilateral disarmament. On each occasion he was careful to state that if disarmament were to be realistic it should be multilateral. The Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick)</inline> mentioned that the Holy Father instituted a world day of peace. I quote from his message of 1 January 1976. In respect of disarmament, he said: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Military disarmament, if it is not co constitute an unforgivable error of impossible optimism, of blind ingenuousness, of a tempting opportunity for others&#39; oppression, should bc common and general. Disarmament is either for everyone or it is a crime of neglect to defend oneself. Does not the sword, in the concert of historical and concrete life in society, have its own reason for being, for justice and for peace? </para>
        </quote>
        <para>He was alluding to Romans 13:4. He continued: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Yes, we must admit it. </para>
        </quote>
        <para>In that sense he gave the lie to those who would take unto themselves the complete misnomer of Christian pacifists. He gave the lie to those who would suggest that the biblical injunction of turning the other cheek, which is important for individuals, means that one is able to lift the head of the oppressed so that the oppressor can beat it again and again. No, the Holy Father was not that sort of person. </para>
        <para>I have noticed that some commentators have said that one of the capabilities of the next Pope should be that he can smile. Most of the Holy Father&#39;s writings up until about six months ago were full of Christian hope and the joy of Christian living. But certainly in the last few months the Holy Father became saddened. I am familiar with the two reasons for this. Firstly, the death of Aldo Moro was a very great personal tragedy for Pope Paul. All honourable senators will remember that the Holy Father went as far as offering his own life in exchange for that of Aldo Moro. The second matter that caused him great anguish was the passage by the Italian Parliament of laws which made for easier abortion procurement. The Holy Father was outspoken in respect of that matter. He said in his peace message this year: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Accordingly we cannot fail to disapprove of each and every offence against nascent life, and we must appeal to every Authority, and to everyone who has due competence, to work for the prohibition of procured abortion and for its remedy. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">Only two months before he died he warned that doctors who carry out operations under Italy&#39;s new abortion law would face excommunication. He was not a person treading the middle path between so-called conservatives and progressives. He was a man who realised that in life and death issues there is no middle path. Pope Paul was a saintly and learned man who was seeking religious and moral truth and who was attempting to gain unity. He has taken the world and the Christian and other churches a long way along that path. </para>

          </motion>
          <para>Tonight the Treasurer is delivering in another place his Budget Speech for 1978-79. </para>
          <para>It is my privilege to outline to the Senate the Budget proposals of the Government. </para>
          <para>Since the last Budget, the Australian people have overwhelmingly endorsed the Government&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">economic</inline> policies and objectives. </para>
          <para>Tonight I reaffirm those objectives. </para>
          <para>First, both for its own sake and as the only real basis for achieving our other objectives, we are determined that Australia will have still lower inflation. </para>
          <para>Secondly, and subject to the constraints still upon the economy, we shall pursue higher levels of economic activity and greater job opportunities. </para>
          <para>These objectives cannot be achieved without continued fiscal, monetary and wage restraint and an appropriate external policy. </para>
          <para>For this reason, the Budget delivered tonight further restrains expenditure and reduces the deficit. </para>
          <para>It also contains tax increases and announces significant policy decisions on health care financing arrangements and crude oil pricing. </para>
		  <para>THE ECONOMY IN OVERVIEW</para>
			<para>The Australian economy is now responding positively to policies directed to its basic problems. </para>
			<para>The economic scene is characterised by declining inflation, moderately expanding demand and activity and a more settled and predictable policy environment. </para>
			<para>The great success story of 1977-78 was on the inflation front. </para>
			<para>I simply record the facts. </para>
			<para>For the year ended June 1976, the rate of inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, was 12.3 per cent; for the year to June 1978, it had fallen to 7.9 per cent. </para>
			<para>Through 1977-78, inflation fell much faster than had been predicted in last year&#39;s Budget. </para>
			<para>Reduced inflation has relieved pressures and strains throughout the economy. </para>
			<para>A start has been made in reducing interest rates. </para>
			<para>Lower inflation has also boosted private sector confidence and spending. </para>
			<para>Despite these achievements, 1977-78 was not without its disappointments. </para>
			<para>The Budget deficit substantially exceeded the original estimate, largely as a result of an unexpected shortfall in revenue. </para>
			<para>However, there was no relaxation of expenditure restraint; in fact, actual outlays for 1977-78 exceeded the Budget estimate by only one-half of one per cent. </para>
			<para>Many problems still remain to be solved. </para>
			<para>High unemployment persists. </para>
			<para>Real wages are still too high and this remains a major cause of the unacceptable levels of unemployment. </para>
			<para>The inescapable truth which cannot be too heavily emphasised is that the real cost of labour continues to be out of line with its productivity. </para>
			<para>Until this is put right, growth in jobs will be held back and unemployment will be difficult to reduce. </para>
			<para>The company profit share is still too low, having changed little in 1977-78. </para>
			<para>Externally, world demand and activity are subdued and this has had consequences for our trade account and the overall balance of payments. </para>
			<para>None the less, the second half of 1 977-78 saw a modest resumption of private capital inflow reflecting in part improved overseas perceptions of the Australian economy and its management. </para>
			<para>The maintenance and improvement of these perceptions are crucial to the further recovery of our economy. </para>
			<para>In a world of subdued demand and fierce competition for markets, our comparative performance in domestic economic management is of acute and increasing significance. </para>
			<para>It will not be sufficient for us merely to hold our own with the average performance of our trading partners. </para>
			<para>We must do better. </para>
			<para>A tougher and more competitive Australian economy means more investment and more job opportunities. </para>
			<para>THE BUDGET TASK</para>
			<para>Against this background, the Government decided that adherence to our basic economic strategy called for a substantial reduction in the Budget deficit from last year&#39;s outcome. </para>
			<para>We realised this meant that difficult and unpopular decisions had to be taken. </para>
			<para>There was no other way of keeping faith with our commitment to responsible economic management. </para>
			<para>To explain the magnitude of this task, let me spell out the background. </para>
			<para>The forward estimates of expenditure implied, on the basis of existing tax rates, a deficit to the order of $6,000m. </para>
			<para>These estimates normally include new spending proposals, which can be more readily put aside. </para>
			<para>Nevertheless, it was a formidable task. </para>
			<para>A very significant element of this projection was that the Government faced, for the first time in 20 years, a reduction of revenue in real terms. </para>
			<para>We began the Budget process with a stringent and painstaking review of our outlays. </para>
			<para>In that process, the prospective growth in outlays was cut to less than one half of that suggested by the forward estimates. </para>
			<para>They are now expected to grow by only 7.7 per cent in 1978-79. </para>
			<para>This will represent the lowest increase in outlays for ten years. </para>
			<para>Some might argue that the Government could have achieved greater restraint in expenditures. </para>
			<para>Further savings could indeed have been achieved by an actual cut in the money level of benefits such as pensions and family allowances. </para>
			<para>But we were not prepared to place a disproportionately large burden upon the recipients of such benefits. </para>
			<para>Having completed its review of outlays, which embraced decisions on health care financing arrangements with both expenditure and revenue implications, the Government faced a deficit in the order of $4,500m. </para>
			<para>Such an outcome was utterly unacceptable to the Government; anything approaching it would have squandered the hard won gains against inflation and progress towards economic recovery. </para>
			<para>It would have reversed our anti-inflationary policy, delivered a sharp blow to business and consumer confidence and put in jeopardy our external account and exchange rate. </para>
			<para>The prospect of further interest rate reductions would have been replaced by the certainty of sharp interest rate increases. </para>
			<para>Therefore to achieve our deficit target, it was necessary to raise substantial additional revenue in 1978-79. </para>
			<para>Our task was further complicated by the need to avoid the imposition of taxes that would have significant effects on business activity and inflationary expectations. </para>
			<para>In the final analysis, the Government decided, as an element of this revenue raising effort, to increase the standard rate of personal income tax as a temporary measure. </para>
			<para>Let me be clear. This particular decision is a severe disappointment to a Government which has demonstrated its commitment to tax reduction and reform. I say now to those who might criticise this decision that the alternatives were far more inequitable and would have been detrimental to economic activity and inflation. </para>
			<para>Let those who question it demonstrate that a different mix of tax measures or a significantly higher deficit would have been more conducive to the attainment of our economic objectives. </para>
			<para>Alternatively, let them argue that a particular group such as pensioners or families should have borne a greater burden. </para>
			<para>I turn now to the details of the Government&#39;s expenditure and revenue decisions. </para>
			<para>OUTLAYS</para>
			<para>Total outlays are estimated at $28, 870m- an increase of only 7.7 per cent- in 1978-79. </para>
			<para>This follows increases of 1 1 .  1 per cent in 1977- 78, 10.4 per cent in 1976-77 and 22.5 per cent in 1975-76. </para>
			<para>Additional detail to what follows is provided in the Budget documents and in Ministerial statements. </para>
			<para>STATES AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES</para>
			<para>Net payments to States and local authorities are estimated at $10,5 12m, about 5 per cent more than in 1977-78. </para>
			<para>Payments to States and local authorities under the tax-sharing arrangements are estimated to increase by 10.7 per cent and 8.5 per cent, respectively; these funds can be used for whatever purposes the recipients choose. </para>
			<para>The Northern Territory will receive a block grant of $280m in 1978-79 following its attainment of self-government on 1 July 1 978. </para>
			<para class="block">The Government has decided that, from 1978- 79, the States&#39; base amounts under the natural disaster relief arrangements will be doubled and that each State will be required to meet one-quarter of any expenditure in excess of its increased base amount. </para>
			<para>GENERAL GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURES</para>
			<para>In our own spending, the size and cost of the public service will be trimmed back further. </para>
			<para>Over the past three years the number of public servants in areas covered by staff ceilings has fallen by 10,650. </para>
			<para>The current ceilings imply a further reduction in staff of 2,600, or about 0.8 per cent, during 1978-79; this is after allowing for significant increases in the Department of Social Security to improve services and tighten up existing procedures. </para>
			<para>In the public as well as the private sector excessive increases in wages are enforcing- and must continue to enforce- an intensified search for staffeconomies. </para>
			<para>Non-wage administrative expenditures also are being tightly controlled; departments and authorities will be required to exercise the utmost economy and, in some cases, to reduce their activities. </para>
			<para>SOCIAL SECURITY AND WELFARE</para>
			<para>This Budget provides over $8 billion for social security and welfare payments. </para>
			<para>We have sought to contain these expenditures while maintaining assistance to the most needy. </para>
			<para>Indexation of Pensions and Benefits</para>
			<para>Subject to two important modifications, all pensions and benefits subject to indexation will be increased from the first payday in November by 3.4 per cent, the increase in the Consumer Price Index in the first half of 1 978. </para>
			<para>The standard or single rate of social service pensions and benefits, for example, will rise by $1.75 to $53.20 a week while the combined married rate will rise by $2.90 to $88.70 a week. </para>
			<para>The two modifications are: </para>
			<para>First, in future pension increases for persons aged over 70 will be subject to an income test. This decision will apply to the November pension increase but will not apply to blind pensioners. I emphasize that present levels of pension for persons aged over 70 are not affected by this decision; they will continue in full and will not be subject to an income test. </para>
			<para>Secondly, in future unemployment benefits will be automatically indexed only for recipients with dependants. For recipients without dependants, benefits will be reviewed annually at Budget time. The Government does not propose to increase benefits for these recipients in this Budget. </para>
			<para>The Government has also decided that, after the November increase, indexation adjustments to pensions will be made annually each November. </para>
			<para>This decision has been taken in the light of the significant reduction in inflation which this Government has achieved since its return to office. </para>

            <para>- The Budget Speech continues: </para>
          </talk.start>
          </continue>
			<para>Family Allowances</para>
			<para>The Government will not subject family allowances for dependent children to a general means test or to taxation. </para>
			<para>We have, however, decided that family allowances will be income-tested on the basis of the child &#39;s income. </para>
			<para>From 1 January 1979, allowances will be paid as at present in respect of each child having an income of $312 or less in 1977-78 but will be reduced at the rate of 25 cents in the dollar on account of any income in excess of $3 12 received by the child. </para>
			<para>Parents of children with a separate income above $312 a year will therefore receive a reduced benefit in respect of such children. </para>
			<para>Children receiving certain student allowances will cease to be eligible for family allowances but adjustments will be made to the relevant student allowances. </para>
			<para>Family allowances, orphan&#39;s pension, handicapped child&#39;s allowance and additional pension or benefit for a child will generally no longer be payable in respect of children who are classed as living abroad on a permanent basis. </para>
			<para>Maternity Allowances</para>
			<para>The Government believes that maternity allowances have been superseded by health care and family allowance arrangements and has therefore decided to abolish this benefit for births occurring after 3 1 October 1 978. </para>
			<para>Other Programs</para>
			<para>To assist those most in need this Budget includes substantially increased provisions for voluntary organisations to provide and maintain facilities for handicapped people and accommodation for aged persons, and for programs of direct assistance to Aboriginals. </para>
			<para>Provision is also being made to extend the maximum age for payment of handicapped child&#39;s allowance to handicapped full-time students not in receipt of an invalid pension from 16 years to 25 years. </para>
			<para>HEALTH</para>
			<para>Although the changes made by this Government over the past 2!6 years have achieved significant economies and improvements in the health care arrangements we inherited, the Government believes these arrangements remain complicated and can be further simplified and improved. </para>
			<para>We have therefore decided upon several major changes to existing arrangements which, while producing an immediately adverse budgetary effect, are more consistent with our longer-term objectives in this area and remove much of the confusion and complexity from present arrangements. </para>
			<para>These changes keep intact our belief that the Government should provide a certain basic but universal health cover for all Australians. </para>
			<para>They preserve our existing commitment to a more generous system of cover for pensioners and socially disadvantaged people. </para>
			<para>The changes also reflect the Government&#39;s view that, having provided a basic cover, it should be left to the individual to decide whether he or she wishes to take out further insurance and, if so, the type and quality of that further insurance. </para>
			<para>The changes, to be effective from 1 November 1978, are: the abolition of the health insurance levy and associated with that the abolition of compulsory private health insurance for non-levy payers; the entitlement of all eligible residents to a basic medical benefit totally funded by the Commonwealth from general revenue which is the greater of 40 per cent of schedule medical fees or the amount of schedule medical fees less $20 per professional service; and the termination of the Medibank Standard functions of the Health Insurance Commission. </para>
			<para>These changes will not disturb existing arrangements whereby all eligible residents without hospital insurance cover are entitled to standard ward accommodation and treatment in public hospitals at no direct cost to them. </para>
			<para>The current arrangements between the Commonwealth and the States for hospital costsharing will continue. </para>
			<para>Those desiring shared or private ward accommodation with choice of doctor or private hospital accommodation will be free, as at present, to take out insurance with registered private health funds. Such insurance will be, of course, entirely optional. </para>
			<para>The Government is looking at the level of public hospital bed day charges for shared and private ward accommodation in the course of achieving its stated objective of greater rationalisation and efficiency in hospitals- extensive negotiations with the States are already under way. </para>
			<para>The 40 per cent/$20 medical benefit, which will be paid by registered private health insurance funds on behalf of the Commonwealth, will leave substantially unchanged the recently announced arrangements relating to Pensioner Health Benefit card-holders or to people identified by their doctors as socially disadvantaged. </para>
			<para>Doctors will continue to bulk bill the Commonwealth in respect of Pensioner Health Benefit card-holders on the basis of 85 per cent/$5. </para>
			<para>People identified by their doctors as socially disadvantaged will be bulk-billed on the basis of 75 per cent for all services, regardless of cost. </para>
			<para>Fuller details of these changes will be provided by the Minister for Health later this evening. </para>
			<para>The immediate significance for existing levy payers is that from 1 November 1 978 when they cease paying the levy they can choose, if they wish, to make arrangements either through Medibank Private- whose functions will be continued- or a private health insurance fund to secure cover for part or all of the schedule fee not covered by the Commonwealth&#39;s proposals. </para>
			<para>For persons with private health insurance the Government expects a significant reduction in health insurance premiums as a result of these measures. </para>
			<para>The new measures will add an estimated $138m to Budget outlays in 1978-79 and $305m in a full year; in addition, abolition of the levy will reduce receipts by an estimated $197m in 1 978-79 and $3 16m in a full year. </para>
			<para>Finally, these measures can be expected to subtract significantly from the Consumer Price Index for the December quarter. </para>
			<para>EDUCATION</para>
			<para>The Budget provides for Commonwealth expenditure of almost $2,500m on education, 6 per cent more than last year. </para>
			<para>Our decisions in this area will maintain current total intakes of students into universities and colleges of advanced education in 1 979 and reflect, in a major way, greater support for technical and further education. </para>
			<para>In April a Working Party of the Tertiary Education Commission issued a draft report recommending that present arrangements for study leave in universities and colleges of advanced education be tightened up; the Government proposes to take action, effective from 1 January 1979, to that end but will await the Commission&#39;s final report before announcing its decisions. </para>
			<para>HOUSING</para>
			<para>Advances to be provided under the new three year Commonwealth-State Housing Agreements, together with funds available from rents and sales, will make possible total State Government expenditure on welfare housing of the same order in 1978-79 as in 1977-78. </para>
			<para>Under a new three year scheme, grants of $ 14m- an increase of $4m- will be provided to the States for rental assistance to pensioners, including married couples. </para>
			<para>The Budget also includes a capital advance of $10m for Defence Service Homes and $20m for Home Savings Grants; these provisions will necessitate some increase in waiting periods for assistance. </para>
			<para>I shall say more later about the general availability of finance for housing. </para>
			<para>DEFENCE</para>
			<para>The maintenance of an adequate defence capability remains a high priority for this Government. </para>
			<para>Despite stringent budgetary constraints, an amount of $2,50 lm has been provided for defence purposes. </para>
			<para>This provision implies an increase in spending, in real terms, of about 1 per cent this year. </para>
			<para>Expenditure on defence capital equipment is estimated to increase by $40m- or almost 13 per cent-to$355m. </para>
			<para>OVERSEAS AID</para>
			<para>Expenditure on Australia&#39;s overseas aid program, virtually all of it under firm commitments made to developing countries and international aid organisations, is estimated to increase by 8.6 per cent to $455m. </para>
			<para>IMMIGRATION</para>
			<para>We are committed to contributing to the resettlement of Indo-Chinese refugees; some 10,000 refugees will be re-settled in Australia in 1978-79. </para>
			<para>In addition to the refugee program, the Government will fund assisted passages for persons already cleared for passage in 1978-79 and for approved applicants having skills and qualifications which are in short supply in Australia. </para>
			<para>In line with the Galbally Committee recommendations, $6. 5m is provided to increase the scope of post-arrival programs and services for migrants; this includes additional funds for adult and child migrant education, the extension of ethnic radio and Sim for pilot ethnic television transmission. </para>
			<para>TRAINING PROGRAMS</para>
			<para>Last year expenditure on training programs increased by 56 per cent to $120m; a further increase of 44 percent- to $ 173m- is provided for this year. </para>
			<para>In June 1978 more than 1 1 1,000 persons were being trained under Commonwealth assisted training programs. </para>
			<para>Experience suggests that the Special Youth Employment Training Program is unduly advantaging younger age groups to the detriment of older age groups. </para>
			<para>Against this background, the Government has decided to reduce the maximum training period under the Program from six months to four months, and to reduce the allowance paid to employers from $67 a week per trainee to $45 a week. </para>
			<para>TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS</para>
			<para>Transport</para>
			<para>Outlays on transport are estimated at $787m and include increased payments for roads, civil aviation services and facilities, and shipping subsidies to Tasmania. </para>
			<para>Provision is made also for initial advances under new five year programs to improve urban public transport and to upgrade the national railways network. $60m is provided to meet expected operating losses of the Australian National Railways Commission; we are concerned about these mounting losses and have initiated steps to identify possible solutions. </para>
			<para>Full recovery of the costs attributable to airline operations on domestic trunk routes will be achieved within the next two financial years; to this end, attributable revenues from these operations are to be increased by $7.7m this year. </para>
			<para>For general aviation, air navigation charges will be increased by 15 per cent from 1 December 1978. </para>
			<para>Light dues levied on shipping will not be increased this year. </para>
			<para>Communications</para>
			<para>In 1978-79, for the first time, the capital program of the Australian Telecommunications Commission is being financed wholly from internal sources and from non-budget borrowings. </para>
			<para>ASSISTANCE TO INDUSTRY</para>
			<para>Rural Industries</para>
			<para>Increased provisions are included in this Budget for rural reconstruction and adjustment, wool research and promotion, the control and eradication of cattle diseases, and the underwriting of dairy products. $40m is also included for the continuation of the superphosphate bounty. </para>
			<para>The nitrogenous fertilizer subsidy is to be extended for one year from 1 January 1979 but at a reduced rate of $40 a tonne during that period; the cost of this subsidy is estimated at $l0m in 1978-79. </para>
			<para>The scheme introduced earlier this year to reduce the price of certain petroleum products to consumers in country areas is estimated to cost $40m in 1978-79. </para>
			<para>Consideration has been given to levying producers to recover a greater share of the costs of providing export inspection services and cattle disease eradication campaigns. </para>
			<para>The Government has decided not to increase charges at this stage but will review the situation later in the year in the light of the economic situation of the cattle industry at that time. </para>
			<para>The Primary Industry Bank of Australia has now been incorporated and will commence operations shortly. </para>
			<para>The Government has decided to offer to assist the Bank by investing with it funds from the Income Equalisation Deposits Trust Account. </para>
			<para>Manufacturing and Other Industry Assistance</para>
			<para>The policies of this Government have been of major assistance to Australian manufacturing industry. </para>
			<para>We have reduced inflation substantially and started to reduce interest rates- developments critical to industry confidence and prospects. </para>
			<para>The benefits to industry of the investment allowance and the trading stock valuation adjustment continue. </para>
			<para>Our new export incentives scheme has been announced and this Budget provides a total of $58m by way of direct assistance to exporters, $27m more than last year. </para>
			<para>Despite the difficult budgetary position, $24m is being provided for industrial research and development grants in 1978-79; $10m more than last year. </para>
			<para>This increase will support important new initiatives and is designed to improve the efficiency and international competitiveness of Australian industry. </para>
			<para>In addition, over Sim will be provided to support productivity improvement programs in industry. </para>
			<para>A community-wide program- to be known as Project Australia&#39;- and designed to increase awareness of Australian industry&#39;s skills, achievements and potential, will be launched in 1978-79. $l.lm has been allocated for the program; further details will be provided by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. </para>
			<para>A further $4m will be provided in 1978-79 to expand energy research and development. </para>
			<para>The Commonwealth&#39;s share of the costs of developing the Ranger uranium deposits is estimated at $44m in 1978-79; $20m of this will be provided from the Budget, with the Australian Atomic Energy Commission raising the balance through borrowings. </para>
			<para>CULTURE AND RECREATION</para>
			<para>Provision is made for important cultural and recreational activities. </para>
			<para>In addition to increased allocations for the National Broadcasting and Television Service, the Australia Council, and the National Gallery, $2.5m is included as the first instalment of the $10m grant being provided to Queensland for staging the 1982 Commonwealth Games. </para>
			<para>MAINTENANCE OF EXPENDITURE RESTRAINT</para>
			<para>In each of the past three financial years the Government has aimed to hold Budget outlays within the original Budget estimates; we achieved that aim in 1975-76 and 1976-77 while the small over-run in 1977-78 was more than accounted for by decisions taken after the Budget to meet unforeseen needs. </para>
			<para>In line with our firm commitment to expenditure restraint, the Government again will be aiming to hold total outlays within the Budget estimates in 1978-79. </para>
			<para>RECEIPTS</para>
			<para>I turn now to receipts. </para>
			<para>As already indicated, the Government has found it necessary- despite the most thorough review of our expenditures- to raise substantial additional revenue in 1978-79. </para>
			<para>We have chosen to do this in the most equitable and economically responsible manner possible. </para>
			<para>I now detail the tax changes. </para>
			<para>INDIRECT TAXATION</para>
			<para>Some increases in this area were necessary. </para>
			<para>However, in framing our decisions, we were concerned to minimize their impact upon inflation and inflationary expectations as well as their effects on economic activity. </para>
			<para>Excises</para>
			<para>None of the excises, with the exception of those on petroleum products and crude oil, have been increased since 1975; the &#39;real&#39; rate of such duties during this inflationary period has therefore declined. </para>
			<para>For each of the proposed changes in excise, commensurate increases in the relevant customs duties will be made, and existing exemptions will continue to apply. </para>
			<para>The new rates will be effective as from tonight. </para>
			<para>The increase in excise on beer- only the third in twenty years- will be 12.6 cents per litre; this is equivalent to roughly 3% cents on the price of a glass of beer and is estimated to raise about $194m extra in 1978-79 and $222m in a full year. </para>
			<para>The rates of excise on potable spirits will be increased so as to raise the general rate to $ 18.75 per litre of alcohol, and bar prices by about 10 cents a nip; this is estimated to yield an additional $ 121m in 1978-79 and $139m in a full year. </para>
			<para>The rate of excise on cigarettes will be increased by $5.39 per kilogram, to $24.75 per kilogram, an increase equivalent to about 10 cents on a packet of 20; commensurate increases will be made in excises on other tobacco products, to yield in all an estimated $120m extra in 1 978-79 and $ 1 36m in a full year. </para>
			<para>Details are provided in Statement No. 4 attached to the Treasurer&#39;s Budget Speech. </para>
			<para>The Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs will introduce legislation later tonight to give effect to these proposals. </para>
			<para>Sales Tax</para>
			<para>We have made no increase in any of the rates of sales tax. </para>
			<para>Indeed, we have gone further and have decided to reduce the rate of tax on motor cars and station wagons from 27V&#163; per cent to the general rate of 1 5 per cent. </para>
			<para>This means that the price of a car now costing some $7,000 should be reduced by roughly $530. </para>
			<para>The cost to revenue of this change, after allowance for some likely gain in sales, is estimated to be about $155m in 1978-79 and $196m in a full year. </para>
			<para>Coal Export Duty</para>
			<para>The Government has decided to delay the phasing out of the remaining duty on coal exports. </para>
			<para>This duty will now not be abolished until midnight on 30 June 1979. </para>
			<para>DEPARTURE TAX ON OVERSEAS TRAVEL</para>
			<para>The Government has decided to introduce a general revenue tax of $10 on adults departing from Australia by sea or air; the tax, which will operate from about mid-September 1978, will be collected both from Australian residents and from overseas visitors when leaving Australia. </para>
			<para>The tax is estimated to raise $ 10m in 1978-79 and $ 1 3m in a full year. </para>
			<para>Further details will be given by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs at a later date. </para>
			<para>IMPORT QUOTAS</para>
			<para>Import quotas have a certain scarcity value and confer on importers who hold them a substantial advantage over those who do notgiving rise, in many cases, to a &#39; monopoly &#39; profit; by contrast, protection provided by the tariff gives rise to increased duty collections rather than increased profits for importers. </para>
			<para>The Government has therefore decided to impose, on certain goods subject to tariff quota and import licensing controls, a special additional customs duty of 12!&#163; per cent. </para>
			<para>My colleague, the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, will be introducing a Bill to amend the Customs Tariff Act later in the evening; this Bill will define the goods which are subject to the additional customs duty. </para>
			<para>I would like to point out that it is not intended that these arrangements should have any additional protective effect. </para>
			<para>This measure will produce additional revenue of about $65m in 1978-79 and about $75m in a full year. </para>
			<para>CRUDE OIL POLICY AND THE PRODUCTION LEVY</para>
			<para>Since the OPEC countries quadrupled the world price of crude oil in 1973-74, Australians have continued to enjoy artificially low prices for crude oil. </para>
			<para>While the rest of the world was facing up to the inescapable fact that the days of cheap energy were over, Australians- even after the imposition in the 1975-76 Budget of a $2 per barrel production levy- were continuing to pay less than half of the world price for Australianproduced crude oil. </para>
			<para>Subsidised indigenous oil prices encouraged a wasteful use of a key energy resource and inhibited the adoption of more energy-efficient processes and technologies; in recognition of this the Government moved last year towards a more realistic pricing policy for Australian-produced crude oil. </para>
			<para>The move towards world prices for producers of &#39;old&#39; oil announced at that time was a gradual one, with correspondingly gradual benefits to conservation and improved exploitation of known reserves. </para>
			<para>In 1 978-79 the proportion of local crude oil production sold to refiners at less than world prices would have been about 70 per cent, involving, in effect, a subsidy to petroleum product users of some $800m. </para>
			<para>In the light both of the budgetary situation and the desirability of improving energy use and the allocation of resources, the Government has decided that all Australian-produced crude oil should, from tomorrow, be priced to refineries at import parity levels; this will mean that consumers of petroleum products will in future pay prices based on world oil prices. </para>
			<para>However, the proceeds of the increased price paid by refineries as a result of this decision will accrue in the first instance to the Government; the price to producers will continue to reflect the arrangements announced last year. </para>
			<para>These results will be achieved by, in effect, increasing the present production levy on &#39;nonparity &#39; oil by an amount that will bring the price of such oil to refiners to import parity levels; this will bring the price to refiners of all domestic production to import parity. </para>
			<para>The Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs will introduce legislation later tonight to give effect to these proposals; in brief, however, the new arrangements involve the imposition of a production levy at the rate required to bring the price of &#39;non-parity&#39; oil in Bass Strait up to import parity, with variable rebates being allowed to reflect, on the one hand, the maintenance of a net levy of about $3 a barrel on &#39;import parity&#39; oil and, on the other hand, the slight differences between Bass Strait and elsewhere in both import parity prices and non-parity prices. </para>
			<para>The net effect of these arrangements will be to increase immediately the production levy on Bass Strait &#39;non-parity&#39; oil from the present rate of $18.90 per kilolitre (about $3 per barrel) to $64.53 per kilolitre (about $10.26 per barrel) for the period ending 31 December 1978; for Barrow Island the net levy paid on &#39;non-parity&#39; oil will be $61.39 per kilolitre (about $9.76 per barrel). </para>
			<para>It is anticipated that this decision will add about <inline font-style="italic">VA</inline> cents per litre to the price of petrol (roughly 16 cents per gallon). </para>
			<para>Retail prices for petrol in Australia vary considerably; however, the maximum allowable retail price for premium petrol in Sydney is now 2 1 cents per litre, and even with the increase expected, would remain much lower than the price paid by consumers in most countries comparable to Australia. </para>
			<para>For example, during the first quarter of 1978 consumers were paying 49 cents per litre in Italy, 44 cents in France and Japan, and 28 cents in the UK. </para>
			<para>New rates for the standard levy and rebates for the period 1 January to 30 June 1979 will be announced at the appropriate time following the determination of import parity prices for that period by the Minister for National Development. </para>
			<para>On the basis of existing import parity prices, this increase is estimated to raise additional revenue in 1 978-79 of $676m; there will be some offset in excise collections from petroleum products, reflecting the effects of the rise in the prices of such products on the demand for them. </para>
			<para>In other respects, the pricing arrangements announced in last year&#39;s Budget will be unchanged. </para>
			<para>As then indicated, producers of &#39;old&#39; oil will obtain import parity prices (less the existing levy of $ 1 8.90 per kilolitre) for increasing proportions of production from existing fields, with the proportions specified over the period to 1 980-8 1 and moving to 100 per cent as soon as possible thereafter; only for refiners (and hence consumers) is the inevitable move to world prices being accelerated. </para>
			<para>The levy will remain at $ 1 8.90 per kilolitre on import parity &#39; oil; as the proportion of that oil in total production increases, collections from the new rates of levy will fall. </para>
			<para>Those fields currently producing less than 6 million barrels per day, including Moonie, already attract full import parity, and the levy in respect of their total production will remain unchanged. </para>
			<para>As announced in last year&#39;s Budget Speech the Government will review, prior to the end of 1980-81, the further progression to be made towards import parity for producers from existing fields. </para>
			<para>INDIRECT TAXATION, THE CPI AND WAGES</para>
			<para>The increased cost of petroleum products flowing from the change in crude oil policy is estimated to have a direct impact on the December quarter Consumer Price Index of about 0.7 percentage points, with some further indirect effects in later quarters. </para>
			<para>As the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission recognised in its judgment arising out of the December quarter 1977 CPI increase, if the increase in the CPI resulting from these oil pricing policies were to flow through into wages, the Government&#39;s policy objective of more restrained energy use would be thwarted. </para>
			<para>Accordingly, at the appropriate time, the Government will be asking the Commission to again discount the CPI for the effects of the oil conservation policy before considering any wage adjustment. </para>
			<para>In the same way, the other indirect tax changes I announced earlier tonight have been introduced to maintain responsible fiscal and monetary management; the Government intends that their net effect should fall on purchasers of the goods involved and not, through the wage determination mechanism, upon employers. </para>
			<para>It would defeat that intention if the effect which these taxes will have on the CPI- about half a percentage point- were allowed to flow through into wages. </para>
			<para>Consequently, the Commonwealth will also be arguing in the appropriate National Wage Case that the CPI should be discounted, for wage adjustment purposes, for the effects of these taxation measures. </para>
			<para>INCOME TAX</para>
			<para>Standard Rate</para>
			<para>As foreshadowed earlier, the Government has decided that as a temporary measure for 1978-79 only, the standard rate of personal income tax will be increased by <inline font-style="italic">Vh</inline> per cent, from 32 to 33 <inline font-style="italic">lA</inline> per cent; there will be corresponding increases, to 4716 per cent and <inline font-style="italic">6\lA</inline> per cent, at higher levels of income. </para>
			<para>The relevant legislation will be expressed to terminate at the end of the current financial year. </para>
			<para>The full-year gain to revenue from this change is estimated to be $570m. </para>
			<para>It is intended to adjust pay-as-you-earn instalment deductions from 1 November 1978. </para>
			<para>The increase is effective from 1 July, and therefore the extra deduction to be made from a taxpayer&#39;s wages or salary after 1 November will be designed to meet his or her additional tax liability for the whole of 1978-79 and not just for the period after 1 November. </para>
			<para>The Ite per cent rate increase for 1978-79 will also be reflected in the calculation of provisional tax. </para>
			<para>Even after this change, gross PA YE collections in 1978-79 are estimated to increase by 7.1 per cent compared with 7.8 per cent in 1 977-78; total collections from individuals are estimated to increase by 6.7 per cent this year, compared with 9.7 per cent in 1977.78. </para>
			<para>This temporary increase should also be seen in the light of the cumulative benefits that individual taxpayers have derived from the tax reforms of this Government. </para>
			<para>To illustrate, the cost to revenue of full tax indexation in 1976-77 was $990m; in 1977-78 the cost of full indexation and the rate scale reform was $ 1370m; the cost in 1978-79 of half indexation and rate scale reform, after allowance for the temporary standard rate increase I have just mentioned, will be about $700m. </para>
			<para>Provisional Tax</para>
			<para>The Government has decided to amend the law relating to self-assessment of provisional tax so that additional tax will be payable where the estimated income for 1 978-79 or any subsequent year turns out to be more than 10 per cent (instead of 20 per cent at present) below the actual income for that year. </para>
			<para>This decision reflects the Government&#39;s concern at mounting evidence of deliberate underestimation of taxable income for provisional tax purposes. </para>
			<para>This change will not in any way disturb the discretion now available to the Commissioner of Taxation to remit in whole or in part additional tax otherwise payable in the event that reasonable grounds exist for the under-estimation having occurred. </para>
			<para>Taxation of Certain Lump Sum Payments</para>
			<para>There will be no change to the existing situation where superannuation and other retirement benefits are taxable as to only 5 per cent of the amount of the lump sum benefit. </para>
			<para>However, the Government has decided to alter the existing basis for taxing lump sum payments received on retirement or termination of employment for unused annual and long service leave. </para>
			<para>At present, with only 5 per cent of lump sum payments received for unused annual and long service leave subject to taxation on retirement, there is an encouragement not to take such leave during the taxpayer&#39;s working life; we believe that the tax system should not have that effect. </para>
			<para>After tonight, the whole of lump sum payments for unused annual leave will be taxed in full as ordinary income. </para>
			<para>Lump sum payments in respect of unused long service leave (including payments in the nature of long service leave) for qualifying service after tonight will be taxed at the standard rate of tax (33te per cent this year); however, such payments in respect of long service leave, for service prior to tonight will continue to be taxed under the present arrangements. </para>
			<para>The changes will not alter the existing rule that payments on death to a spouse or dependants or legal personal representative of a deceased employee in respect of accrued annual leave or accrued long service leave are not subject to taxation. </para>
			<para>The change to the taxation of payments for unused annual leave entitlements is estimated to produce a gain to revenue of $70m in 1978-79 and $110m in a full year; reflecting the long phasing-in arrangements that are proposed, the change in respect of the taxation of long service leave payments is estimated to result in a revenue gain of $6 min 1978-79. </para>
			<para>Home Loan Interest Deductibility</para>
			<para>The contribution of this scheme to home purchase has not been matched by its cost to revenue. </para>
			<para>Accordingly, interest on home loans that accrues on or after 1 November 1978 will no longer be allowable as an income tax deduction; there will be a saving to revenue of $3m in 1978-79 and $3 1 m in a full year. </para>
			<para class="block">Commonwealth Post-graduate Awards </para>
			<para>Commonwealth awards under the Postgraduate Awards Scheme, which are not means tested, are essentially of an income nature and it is appropriate that they should be taxed like other income. </para>
			<para>Accordingly, these awards are to be made assessable income in the hands of the recipient with effect from 1 November 1978 with an estimated gain to revenue of $0.6m in 1978-79 and $ 1 m in a full year. </para>
			<para>Social Welfare Payments</para>
			<para>The Government has also decided to extend the 1976 decision to subject to tax a wide range of social welfare payments; the other kinds of payments now to be subject to tax, as from 1 November 1978, are: </para>
			<para>Rehabilitation training allowance </para>
			<para>Rehabilitation living-away-from-home allowance </para>
			<para>Incentive allowance (rehabilitation) </para>
			<para>Invalid pension for persons under age pension age </para>
			<para>Sheltered employment allowance </para>
			<para>Repatriation service pension on account of unemployability or pulmonary tuberculosis for persons under age pension age </para>
			<para>Tuberculosis allowance for persons under age pension age, and </para>
			<para>Tuberculosis housekeeper allowance. </para>
			<para>People in receipt of these payments will not be disadvantaged by comparison with other income recipients; almost all of those solely dependent on the benefit will be below the tax threshold; others will become liable for tax only if they have other income above their social welfare payments sufficient to bring them above the tax threshold. </para>
			<para>The gain to revenue from this proposal is estimated at $3m in 1978-79 and $5m in a full year. </para>
			<para>Rebates for the Maintenance of Overseas Dependants </para>
			<para>The present law allows rebates for the maintenance of dependants overseas- a spouse, parents or parents-in-law and invalid relatives. </para>
			<para>In many cases, the dependant in question may have never been to, nor have any intention of coming to Australia; in other cases, the provision has led to flagrant abuse. </para>
			<para>In the light of this, the Government has decided to withdraw the rebates for overseasresident dependants as from 1 November 1978; for 1978-79, the maximum amount of rebate claimable for each eligible overseas dependant will thus be reduced to one-third of the present amount. </para>
			<para>Withdrawal of the rebates will not affect the rebate claimable for a dependent spouse overseas pending early migration to Australia. </para>
			<para>The gain to revenue in 1978-79 is estimated to be $8m and for a full year $20m. </para>
			<para>TAX AVOIDANCE</para>
			<para>In recent months the Government has made a vigorous assault on tax avoidance; this will continue in 1978-79. </para>
			<para>The time is long since past when Governments or the community should tolerate the blatant, artificial and contrived means whereby certain sections of the community seek to pay little or no tax to the detriment of the general body of taxpayers and the equity of the tax system. </para>
			<para>As a further initiative in this area, the Government has decided 	upon a number of measures designed to curb avoidance of tax liabilities in cases where cash is paid for various forms of services without deductions for tax. </para>
			<para>Full details are provided in a separate statement I have released tonight. </para>
			<para>The Government has also decided to make some adjustments to the averaging system for primary producers, so as to confine its benefits more strictly to income derived from primary production; under these new arrangements averaging will still apply to taxable income from primary production, and may also apply to a limited amount of income derived from other sources. </para>
			<para>If non-primary production income is $5,000 or less in the income year, averaging will apply to all of it; the allowance of $5,000 will shade out by one dollar for each dollar of non-primary production income in excess of $5,000, thus shading out entirely when non-primary production income reaches $ 10,000. </para>
			<para>This change will ensure that persons with minimal interests or activities in primary production are not able to abuse the system to reduce their tax on non-primary production income, and will thereby inhibit the use of tax avoidance schemes based on primary producer status. </para>
			<para>Further details are contained in Statement No. 4. </para>
			<para>The change, which will apply for 1978-79 and subsequent income years, is estimated to raise $lmin 1978-79 and $27m in a full year. </para>
			<para>BUDGET OVERVIEW</para>
			<para>Total outlays in 1978-79 are estimated to increase by 7.7 per cent to $28,870m. </para>
			<para>Total receipts, after the measures I have outlined, are estimated to increase by 11.0 per cent to $26,057m </para>
			<para>The overall deficit is therefore estimated at $2,8 1 3m, a reduction of $52 1 m on 1 977-78. </para>
			<para>After allowance for overseas transactions, the domestic deficit is estimated at $ 1,669m in 1 978-79, some $782m less than in 1 977-78. </para>
			<para>THE BUDGET, MONETARY POLICY AND WAGES POLICY</para>
			<para>In 1977-78 the broadly denned volume of money (M3) expanded by 8 per cent over the course of the year, which was at the lower end of the range projected in last year&#39;s Budget Speech. </para>
			<para>The firm control of the monetary aggregates which the Government has put in place since early in 1976 has contributed much to the subsequent wind-down in inflation. </para>
			<para>The 1978-79 Budget will again contribute to an appropriate monetary environment. </para>
			<para>With continuing success against inflation, the Government looks forward to further sustainable reductions in interest rates. </para>
			<para>The Government has been careful to ensure that its policy of monetary restraint does not unduly restrict the supply of finance to certain key sectors such as housing. </para>
			<para>The policy of monetary restraint will of course strengthen the demand for housing in the longer term through reduced inflation and lower interest rates. </para>
			<para>However, the Government has acted decisively with a view to the short term as well. </para>
			<para>The banks and building societies are being reminded of the Government&#39;s desire that they lend to homeseekers to the maximum extent. </para>
			<para>In addition, to facilitate the provision of housing finance, the regulations relating to savings banks subject to the Banking Act are under urgent review. </para>
			<para>To expand savings banks&#39; capacity to lend for housing in 1978-79, the proportion of savings bank deposits required to be held in public securities and liquid assets will be reduced from 45 to 40 per cent. </para>
			<para>As a longer term measure, the present method of controlling the investment of savings banks&#39; funds is being reviewed with the intention of giving them more flexibility in determining the composition of their assets. </para>
			<para>Lending levels will, of course, remain subject to lenders &#39; own commercial judgments. </para>
			<para>These actions should make it easier for homeseekers to obtain finance. </para>
			<para>These decisions have been taken within the framework of an overall monetary policy which remains directed at providing adequate funds for sustainable recovery in private sector activity and employment, while continuing to bear down steadily on inflation and inflationary expectations. </para>
			<para>In this regard- and despite the acknowledged uncertainties in such projections- I now state that this Budget is consistent with an outlook for financial conditions indicated by growth in the broadly defined volume of money (M3) in the range of 6 to 8 per cent over the course of 1978-79. </para>
			<para>Within this monetary projection, the outlook for employment will be affected by the outcome of the wage determination process both within the arbitral tribunals and outside them. </para>
			<para>But before I develop this point in more detail, let me say something about the link between jobs and money wage gains. </para>
			<para>The sharp increase in labour costs, relative both to the price of output and the costs of other factors of production, which occurred in 1973 and 1 974- and which has not so far been wound back- has encouraged firms to shed as much labour as they can. </para>
			<para>They have been replacing workers with machines; replacing full-time staff with part-time; replacing wage and salary earners with self employed contract labour; in short, making do with less labour all round. </para>
			<para>That is the major reason why employment, especially of wage and salary earners, has hardly been growing at all even while output has been expanding. </para>
			<para>This has been to the particular detriment of young people and the unskilled. </para>
			<para>For five years now, businesses have been coping as best they can with those excessive labour costs. </para>
			<para>Since the wages explosion of 1973 and 1974, there has, it is true, been some closing of the gap between real wages and productivity. </para>
			<para>But the partial closure of that gap has been a result of productivity increases, not of real wage reductions. </para>
			<para>In accepting this protracted means of closing the gap, we are, as a nation, condemning ourselves to a second-best solution. </para>
			<para>A considerably more rapid recovery would be possible- if a greater measure of wage restraint could be obtained. </para>
			<para>The Government has been fostering a moderate uplift in economic activity. </para>
			<para>However, excessive wages have pushed unemployment to levels that could otherwise have been avoided. </para>
			<para>At wage hearing after wage hearing, the Government has sought to demonstrate to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission the inescapable inter-dependence of economic recovery and wage restraint. </para>
			<para>It is regrettable that the Commission has not paid greater heed to the views the Government has put to it at these hearings. </para>
			<para>Its failure to do so has, in our view, been costly to the Australian community both in terms of inflation and unemployment. </para>
			<para>We cannot, as a Government, regard this situation as satisfactory. </para>
			<para>Within the monetary framework which I outlined earlier, there is a limit to wage increases that can be awarded without throwing even more people out of work. </para>
			<para>The Government has limited flexibility in monetary policy, which cannot be assumed to passively adjust so as to accommodate money wage decisions inconsistent with the Government&#39;s objective of continuing to bear down on inflation and encourage economic recovery and sustained growth in employment. </para>
			<para>Employers also should not assume that the finance to accommodate excessive wage rises will be readily available. </para>
			<para>If wages increase faster than responsible growth in the monetary aggregates permits, there will be inadequate scope for growth in real activity. </para>
			<para>If this occurs the result will be lower economic activity and therefore higher unemployment than would otherwise be attainable. </para>
			<para>Consistent also with this position, the Government will not allow excessive increases in money wages to undermine its own Budget. </para>
			<para>The Commonwealth will, as a major employer, act like any other employer. </para>
			<para>If wages rise faster than we have budgeted for, we will respond by effecting offsetting economies through a further critical examination of Budget expenditures. This critical examination will include the number of staff employed. </para>
			<para>In so doing, we will be seeking to bring the conduct of our own affairs more into line with conditions prevailing in the private sector. </para>
			<para>That will also demonstrate, in the most practical way, the vital need to ensure sensible outcomes in the area of wage determination that will permit employers both to preserve present jobs and to make more new jobs available. </para>
			<para>The Government will be advising the Commission along these lines at the next National Wage Case. </para>
			<para>ECONOMIC OUTLOOK</para>
			<para>As I have just indicated, the outlook for the economy depends heavily on the future course of award wages. </para>
			<para>Unfortunately it is not generally recognised that, despite partial indexation, the actual level of real wages has hardly fallen at all in recent years. </para>
			<para>Real household disposable incomes rose in both 1976-77 and 1977-78. </para>
			<para>Notwithstanding the temporary increase in the standard rate of personal income tax, real household disposable incomes are again expected to rise in 1978-79. </para>
			<para>The personal saving ratio is likely to continue to decline and private consumption expenditure can be expected to grow at a healthy pace. </para>
			<para>Forward indicators suggest that the buoyant performance of private business investment in 1977-78 will be sustained in the coming year. </para>
			<para>The Government draws considerable satisfaction from this evidence of increasing community confidence in its policies. </para>
			<para>While policy has, of course, been looking to the private sector as the source of sustainable growth, total public sector expenditure is again expected to show a real increase in 1978-79, although smaller than last year. </para>
			<para>The growth in production is also expected to be strengthened by a turn-around in the stock cycle as stocks begin to rise again during the coming year. </para>
			<para>Externally, our export growth will be constrained by the continuing moderate growth of the world economy in 1978-79. </para>
			<para>However, from the point of view of the current account balance and domestic incomes, the sluggishness in export volumes is likely to be offset by a significant improvement in our terms of trade. </para>
			<para>The expected build up in stocks domestically will no doubt be mirrored in stronger growth in imports. </para>
			<para>On balance, therefore, the external deficit on current account seems likely to continue running at about the rate recorded in the second half of  1977- 78,  producing some increase for the year as a whole. </para>
			<para>Offsetting that, the improvement in the investment climate generally in this country seems likely to lead to a gradual strengthening of the private capital account. </para>
			<para>Meanwhile, the Government remains committed to a program of official borrowing overseas to supplement the temporarily depleted levels of private capital inflow and, in the process, to maintain reserves. </para>
			<para>Overall, gross non-farm product is projected to grow by around  4  per cent in real terms in </para>
			<para>1978- 79. </para>
			<para>With a return to more normal seasonal conditions there should be a significant recovery in farm product and farm incomes this year. </para>
			<para>That would mean stronger growth in total GDP than in the non-farm component. </para>
			<para>However, while this growth should be sufficient to ensure an increase in employment, unemployment may well increase somewhat during the year as the labour force continues to grow, unless a better outcome can be achieved on the wages front. </para>
			<para>So far as prices are concerned, the indirect tax increases and the move to import parity for domestic crude oil may temporarily slow the deceleration in the broadly-based price deflators. </para>
			<para>In terms of the Consumer Price Index, those increases seem likely to be more than offset by the effects of the changes to the financing of health services. </para>
			<para>With even reasonably sensible outcomes for wage determination, inflation is expected to be running at an annual rate down towards  5  per cent by mid-  1979. </para>
			<para>CONCLUSION</para>
			<para>At no time since its election has this Government pretended that there were quick, easy solutions to Australia &#39;s economic problems. </para>
			<para>It has been necessary in this Budget to take difficult decisions to achieve our objectives. </para>
			<para>To have done otherwise would have put at risk all that we have achieved to date. </para>
			<para>There was no way that this Government would sacrifice economic temperance for short term political praise. </para>
			<para>In framing all our decisions, we have been guided by a desire to fairly share burdens throughout the Australian community. </para>
			<para>This Budget stands for the long term economic stability of Australia. </para>
			<para>It is a Budget of reality. </para>
			<para>It is a Budget of economic responsibility. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- I lay on the table the report of the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Matters in Relation to Electoral Redistribution, Queensland  1977,  dated August  1978,  and related papers. I seek leave to have the speech made in the House of Representatives this day by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline></para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Leave granted. </para>
          <para class="italic">
            <inline font-style="italic">The speech read as follows-</inline>
          </para>
          <para>It may be helpful to honourable members if I briefly set out the key events leading up to the setting up of this Royal Commission. Allegations were made by the present member for Fadden <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Donald Cameron)</inline> on  21  December  1977  that one of his parliamentary colleagues had had an undue influence on the redistribution in that State. It soon became apparent that the person to whom the honourable member was referring was the Minister for Finance <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Eric Robinson).</inline></para>
          <para>I discussed this matter on  1 7  January with the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Administrative Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Withers)</inline> and it was decided that a meeting should be held in my office on the following day attended by myself, those two Ministers, and the honourable member for Fadden, the honourable member for Lilley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Kevin Cairns)</inline> and the honourable member for Bowman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Jull).</inline> As a result of the meeting on  18  January, and with the agreement of the Minister for Administrative Services and the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Durack),</inline> I requested the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General to examine the complaints which had been put forward. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cameron</inline>had a lengthy document which he showed me briefly about his allegations. He did not leave a copy with me but agreed to discuss it with the Solicitor-General. I rang <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack</inline> to tell him what happened at the meeting, and at my request <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> as the responsible Minister reported further to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack</inline> on the matter. The Law Officers&#39; advice of 9 February and 15 February were referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> in the Senate on 28 February. In summary, that advice was that the matters complained of neither required nor warranted Government action. </para>
          <para>The issue was raised again on 7 April. On that day the Law Officers&#39; advice was tabled after <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cameron</inline> had again adverted to his allegations. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cameron</inline> referred to some statutory declarations, which were additional to the material the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General had previously considered. There were several discussions between Ministers on 10 April at which both Senators Withers and Durack were present, to decide what action should be taken and it was again decided that this additional material should be submitted to the Law Officers for further advice. On the same day, the original memoranda of advice of the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General were incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline></para>
          <para>On or about 11 April the Chief Electoral Officer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pearson,</inline> read the memoranda for the first time in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> After discussing the matter with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers,</inline> he spoke to the Solicitor-General. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pearson</inline> informed the Solicitor-General that in mid-September <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> had discussed with him the naming of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Robinson&#39;s</inline> electorate and that at <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers&#39;</inline> suggestion, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pearson</inline> had spoken to the  Chairman  of the Queensland Distribution Commissioners, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Coleman,</inline> on this matter. The Attorney-General was informed of this orally by the Solicitor-General on 14 April. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack</inline> approached <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> who confirmed what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pearson</inline> had said. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack</inline> then told me on 16 April of the telephone conversations between <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pearson,</inline> and between <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pearson</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Coleman.</inline></para>
          <para>Now let me make one point quite clear. This was the first occasion on which I became aware of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers&#39;</inline> intervention. While not reflecting in the slightest on the evidence of the Minister for Finance, I have absolutely no recollection of the matter being raised in any previous discussions. It is also fair to say that in his evidence to the Royal Commission, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> has no clear recollection of raising the matter with me on 17 January. Nor has there been any suggestion that the matter was raised in the very lengthy discussions <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> and I had with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cameron.</inline> If I had had any relevant information relating to the inquiries of the Law Officers, either on 18 January or 10 April, I would have referred it to them. I state that categorically and absolutely. Both the Attorney-General and I were concerned that this information which was clearly relevant to the allegations against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Robinson</inline> was not made available to the Law Officers in January and as a result their original advice was deficient. There were further discussions between Ministers on 1 7 April. On the following day I left for Japan. From there I requested that a report of the Attorney-General and Solicitor-General be ready for discussion upon my return. On 21 April, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> wrote to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack</inline> confirming details of the telephone conversations and his reason for making them. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pearson</inline> also wrote to the Attorney-General supporting <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers&#39;</inline> letter. Both these letters have been tabled. </para>
          <para>On 23 April, a meeting was held at the Lodge of a number of Ministers to consider the report from the Law Officers which I had sought to expedite while in Japan. This report resulted from the Government&#39;s reference to the Law Officers of additional material on 10 April. The report was incorporated in the letter dated 23 April which I have tabled and advised that further investigation was required and that a judicial inquiry would be preferable. The Ministers agreed that a Royal Commission should be appointed forthwith, so that the allegations could be examined fully and publicly. The Ministers discussed proposed terms of reference and the precise form was settled the following day and is set out in the Letters Patent of 24 April. The letters patent referred specifically to the change of name of the electorate and were quite wide enough to allow all the relevant evidence to be heard. </para>
          <para>It was not unnatural that as the only allegations which had been made concerned the Minister for Finance and the Queensland Distribution Commissioners, then, as to the Commission&#39;s findings, the terms of reference referred to those persons. For these were the matters in Ministers&#39; minds. These were the matters subject to examination. The telephone conversations of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pearson</inline> were raised at the meeting. </para>
          <para>The Attorney-General&#39;s advice on 23 April was that in his view these telephone conversations were not contrary to the Electoral Act- a view subsequently confirmed by the Royal Commission- but constituted evidence relevant to the charges against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Robinson</inline> and should come forward at the hearings of the Royal Commission. Ministers agreed with this advice. </para>
          <para>As soon as the Royal .Commission had been appointed, the Attorney-General arranged for papers to be made available to Counsel Assisting the Royal Commission including details of the telephone conversations between <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pearson,</inline> and between <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pearson</inline> and the  Chairman  of the Distribution Commissioners. In this way, the Attorney-General made absolutely sure that the details of the telephone conversations would be disclosed in public evidence before the Commission. All the Government&#39;s actions, it can be seen, were prompted by a desire to have all the facts brought out at the Royal Commission. Allegations were then made, supported by statutory declarations relating to alleged statements by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Robinson</inline> on the Government&#39;s decision on uranium mining. The Government decided that the terms of reference should be widened to cover the uranium allegations and revised terms of reference were drafted by the law officers. New letters patent incorporating the revised terms of reference were issued on 10 May. </para>
          <para>The following day and before any evidence was heard by the Commission, the Attorney-General wrote to the Royal Commissioner indicating that the Government was willing to extend his terms of reference further if any matters came to his notice indicating that in the course of the redistribution any person had acted improperly or in breach of a Commonwealth law. On the same day, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack</inline> wrote to the honourable member for Fadden urging him to place before the counsel assisting the Royal Commissioner any further material he had which supported his allegations. I have tabled these two letters from the Attorney-General, together with  His  Honour&#39;s reply on 12 May. On 15 May, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pearson,</inline> and on 22 May, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers,</inline> gave evidence before the Royal Commission about the telephone conversations. On 26 May, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> answered questions in the Senate directed to whether he had misled the Senate in statements he made on 4 November 1977 concerning the naming of the Mcpherson electorate. </para>
          <para class="block">On 28 May, a meeting of a group of Ministers and officials from my Department and the Attorney-General&#39;s Department met to consider the situation. </para>
          <para>In accordance with the Government&#39;s policy throughout this matter- as reflected in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack</inline> &#39;s letter to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> McGregor of 1 1 May- to have all allegations of illegality or impropriety in the course of the McPherson redistribution fully heard and determined, Cabinet decided on 30 May to have the terms of reference widened again so that the Royal Commission could make a finding on whether any breach of the law of the Commonwealth or any impropriety had occurred on the part of any person in the course of the McPherson redistribution.

The Commissioner exonerated the Chief Electoral Officer who was a party to the same act but who did not have, in the judgment of the Commissioner and was not aware of in the view of the Commissioner, the motive which the Commissioner found to be the real reason for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers&#39;</inline> phone calls. </para>
          <para>Senior Ministers considered carefully what should be done in the light of this finding and of the Judge&#39;s definitions of impropriety.

In coming to decisions on these particular matters, it was necessary to have in mind the answers given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> in the Senate on 4 November and 26 May in the light of the evidence which emerged at the Royal Commission and the findings of the Commission.

            <para>If these high standards were not upheld, the people &#39;s confidence in Government- a confidence which is fundamental to Australian democracy- would be undermined. </para>
            <para>The Government has an obligation to uphold them even though the cost can be and is in this instance, a high one. </para>

Twice, when new allegations and issues were raised, the Royal Commission&#39;s terms of reference were widened.

          </talk.start>
          <para>Leave granted. </para>
          <para class="italic">
            <inline font-style="italic">The statement read as follows-</inline>
          </para>
          <para class="block">In his Budget Speech, the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard)</inline> advised that changes will be made to the health insurance arrangements from 1 November this year. Before outlining the proposals in more detail, it would be appropriate if I commented briefly on the recent history leading to these changes. </para>
          <para class="block">Background to changes </para>
          <para>The House will recall that the Government in 1976 made certain modifications to Medibank and renegotiated the hospital cost-sharing agreements with the States. Although Medibank provided universal health insurance cover, it did so in a way which was open-ended and costly. Health costs were escalating at an alarming rate, and when the Government took office it was apparent that modifications to the scheme were necessary in order to reduce this rapid acceleration. </para>
          <para>As recently as May this year, I announced on behalf of the Government further modifications designed to reduce excessive use of medical services and to rationalise the use of hospital resources. The changes to Medibank which became effective on 1 October 1976 and the subsequent amendments have resulted in a significant decline in the rate of acceleration of health costs. This is confirmed by figures which were released earlier this year. The figures, announced in March, indicated that in relation to expenditure, including capital, on a financial year basis, the rise in health costs of 27. 1 per cent in 1975-76 had been slowed to 19.7 per cent in 1976-77. The figures also showed that the rate of increase in health expenditure as a percentage of gross domestic product has been slowed. </para>
          <para>Further statistical information on these matters will be available in due course. Nevertheless, the rate of increase of health costs has continued to be unacceptably high. In addition, although the existing arrangements have been achieving their original purpose, they are none-the-less complex and involve the imposition of a high degree of compulsion on the individual. Because of these factors, the Government has continued its review of the health insurance system. </para>
          <para>In October last year, I asked the Hospitals and Health Services Commission to review the financing of health services in Australia. The Commission&#39;s report, &#39;A Discussion Paper on Paying for Health Care&#39;, was tabled in this House on 15 March this year. That report was one important component of the very comprehensive reconsideration of the health insurance system undertaken by the Government in recent months. Our review has pointed to an obvious fact: That to maintain a balance between the numbers of Health Insurance Levy payers and those privately insured- an essential element in the existing scheme&#39;s strategy to contain costsclearly the Levy rate could not be held at its present level much longer. </para>
          <para>A further complexity has emerged because of the different health cost structures in different States, and the consequent variation in private insurance rates, which suggest a need to examine the imposition of different Levy rates in different States. This, of course, could not be countenanced in a Federal levy. Accordingly, we reached the conclusion that, rather than make any adjustments to the Health Insurance Levy, it was more practical and desirable to introduce a new and better Medibank system by abandoning the Levy and introducing a new Commonwealth medical benefit and other changes. </para>
		  <para>Summary of Changes</para>
			<para>Let me now summarise the major features of the changes: </para>
			<para>As announced by the Treasurer, the Health Insurance Levy will be abolished. </para>
			<para>The Commonwealth will pay a new universal medical benefit from consolidated revenue. </para>
			<para>This new Commonwealth benefit, to cover 40 per cent of Schedule medical fees with a maximum patient contribution of $20 for any one service where the Schedule fee is charged, will be paid through private health insurance funds (including Medibank Private). </para>
			<para>Medical insurance premiums should fall considerably for comparable levels of cover. </para>
			<para>The present compulsion on every Australian to pay for one type of health insurance or another will be removed (although those people currently covered by Medibank Standard will need to consider whether they wish to insure for their present level of benefits). </para>
			<para>Private health funds (including Medibank Private) will offer medical benefits in addition to the new Commonwealth benefit, and will continue to provide hospital benefits. </para>
			<para>The funds will be given considerable freedom and flexibility to devise attractive benefit packages. </para>
			<para>Accommodation in standard wards of public hospitals with treatment by doctors engaged by the hospital will continue to be available free of charge to those who are not privately insured for hospital care. </para>
			<para>Bulk-billing of PHB pensioners and their dependants who are not privately insured for medical benefits will continue as at present. </para>
			<para>As previously announced, the new concept of bulk-billing for socially disadvantaged patients will be introduced. </para>
			<para>Subsidies for hospital-only insurance will be discontinued. </para>
			<para>The subsidy of $16 per occupied bed day paid to private hospitals will remain. </para>
			<para>Further Details of Changes</para>
			<para>As honourable senators will have noticed, a number of the best features of existing and previous schemes are being brought together in the modifications. For example, Medibank introduced the concept of universal medical benefits and standard hospital coverage for all Australians, regardless of means. This principle is being retained. Those people who are not covered by hospital insurance will continue to be eligible for accommodation in standard wards of public hospitals, with treatment by doctors engaged by the hospital, at no cost, although in Queensland, of course, all citizens will continue to be eligible for free standard ward care irrespective of their insurance status. </para>
			<para>The Commonwealth and States will continue to share the approved net operating costs of recognised hospitals. Bulk, or direct, billing will continue to be available for pensioners with Health Benefits Cards and their dependants, (except for those who are privately insured for medical benefits) and will be introduced for socially disadvantaged people as I recently announced. </para>
			<para>The most important change, of course, is the abolition of the health insurance levy- a move which means that everyone in the community will be entitled to receive a basic level of protection against the costs of medical and hospital services without having to pay any direct contribution, either by way of Levy to the Government or by premium payments to private insurance funds. The health funds including Medibank Private, will continue to play an important role in the provision of insurance cover but people will no longer be liable to pay the Health Insurance Levy if they do not privately insure. </para>
			<para>Medical Benefits</para>
			<para>As I stated earlier, the new universal Commonwealth medical benefits will be payable through the registered funds. This arrangement will apply both to those who elect to take Commonwealth benefits only and to those who take private medical insurance in addition. The latter group will receive their Commonwealth benefit as an integral part of any refund claimed for a medical service. No one, of course, will be obliged to take out medical insurance with a private fund if he or she is satisfied to receive the Commonwealth benefit only. </para>
			<para>It should be emphasised that those people who are now receiving Standard Medibank benefits at 75 per cent of the Schedule fee for medical services, with a maximum patient payment of $10, and who wish to retain the same benefit level, will need to insure privately to do so. In fact, as from 1 November it will be a condition of registration of the private funds that they offer a basic medical benefits table. This table, together with the Commonwealth benefit, will cover 75 per cent of the Schedule fee, with a maximum patient payment of $ 10 for any one service where the Schedule fee is charged. In other words, people insured for basic medical fund benefits will receive combined Commonwealth and fund benefits at the rate of 75 per cent of the Schedule fees with a maximum patient contribution of $10. That is, the fund will increase the level of benefit from the universal Commonwealth benefit of 40 per cent with a $20 gap, to 75 per cent with a $10 gap. </para>
			<para>In addition, funds will be free to offer a variety of other medical benefits packages up to a maximum of the Schedule fee level, and other ancillary benefits. Under the scheme, therefore, the Commonwealth will meet all costs over and above $20 for any medical service, provided the doctor charges the Schedule fee. It must be emphasised that those people currently paying the health insurance levy will be eligible to receive only 40 per cent of the Schdeule medical fee with a maximum payment by the patient of $20 for any one service where the Schedule fee is charged, unless they take the necessary steps to insure for additional benefits. Those who wish to retain their present 75 per cent/$10 gap benefit will need to insure by 1 November. </para>
			<para>As I said earlier, no one will be obliged to privately insure. Undoubtedly there will be many who will wish to carry a higher risk themselves and will decide to accept a 40 per cent benefit as payment in full, especially in the light of the knowledge that they will have to pay no more than $20 for any one medical service where the schedule fee is charged. I will be meeting with representatives of the health funds within the next few days to discuss the most practical and simple method for people to obtain their universal Commonwealth medical benefits. I will also be advising them that they will be required to submit a proposal to my Department by 29 September concerning their basic medical benefits table. Such proposals will be considered by the </para>
			<para class="block">Registration Committee with a view to registration of the new tables by 1 November. Funds which do not offer this new basic medical benefits table will be unable to pay Commonwealth medical benefits. </para>
			<para>For the many people who are already enrolled with a fund for hospital and medical coversome 57 per cent of the population- the change will mean little apart from the fact that they should also have an opportunity to review the level of cover they require. They will also have the opportunity to make significant savings in the process. In turn, the funds will be in a position to offer a variety of innovative insurance tables, including &#39;deductibles&#39; in some form. Apart from the basic table, the funds will be able to devise competitive and innovative benefit schemes, subject to guidelines. </para>
			<para>Hospital Insurance</para>
			<para>Turning to the hospital side, insurance and benefit arrangements will remain largely unchanged. People who are not privately insured will continue to be eligible for standard accommodation and treatment in public hospitals at no charge to them. Those who are covered by private insurance will be expected to contribute towards the cost of any hospitalisation in public hospitals, except in Queensland as I have previously stated. The Commonwealth/State hospital cost-sharing arrangements will continue. The subsidy of $ 1 6 per occupied bed day paid to private hospitals will remain. The Commonwealth will continue to contribute the sum of $50m to the reinsurance pool. </para>
			<para>Hospital funds will continue to offer the basic standard table covering hospital accommodation at $40 a day, and will also be obliged to continue to cover their contributors against nursing home charges in all tables. Apart from this, they will be able to devise competitive benefits packages, and to introduce deductibles if they choose, subject to guidelines. The Government and the industry are already in the process of developing acceptable guidelines for deductible schemes. </para>
			<para class="block">Hospital-only Insurance </para>
			<para>With the removal of the health insurance levy, the present system of subsidised hospital-only insurance will be discontinued. From 1 November, former levy payers and those pensioners and others exempt from the levy who wish to continue coverage for shared ward accommodation with doctor of choice in hospital will need to take basic hospital insurance. However, the additional premium payable is not large. On present rates it should not exceed an extra 75 cents a week for family cover in New South Wales, South Australia and Western Australia, 35 cents in Victoria, 30 cents in Queensland and 25 cents in Tasmania. </para>
			<para>Bulk-Billing</para>
			<para>While there has been considerable debate over recent years about the merits and demerits of bulk billing, the system has administrative advantages in meeting the needs of pensioners and socially disadvantaged people. The arrangements recently announced for assisting the socially disadvantaged through the use of bulk billing will be implemented. Doctors who do so will receive from the Government 75 per cent of the Schedule fee as payment in full for the service rendered, provided the patient is not privately insured, and will not be permitted to recover a cash payment from such patients. Doctors will continue to be able to bulk bill the Commonwealth to the extent of 85 per cent of the Schedule fee for pensioners with pensioner health benefit entitlements, and their dependants, with a $5 gap. </para>
			<para>Commonwealth-State Hospital Cost-Sharing Arrangements</para>
			<para>As I said earlier, the Commonwealth-State hospital cost-sharing arrangements will continue. However, as previously mentioned, my announcement in May of this year emphasised the need to rationalise the use of hospital resources to improve efficiency and productivity, and to reconstruct the hospital charging pattern. My Government recognises that an important key to the containment of health costs rests in the hospital area. It is therefore vigorously pursuing the rationalisation initiatives with the aim of producing real results. These matters have been under discussion with the States during recent weeks. </para>
			<para>The question of the level of hospital charges is directly related to these considerations, especially the varying levels of hospital operating costs in and between the various States. Therefore my Government is not in a position to finalise its views on the levels of hospital charges until these negotiations and discussions are further advanced. </para>
			<para class="block">Effect on Private Fund Contribution Rates </para>
			<para>I do not wish to forecast the effect the November changes might have on the current contribution rates for private insurance. However, it should be stressed that the new basic medical benefits table, which all funds will be obliged to offer, will meet from fund resources only 35 per cent of the schedule fee and no more than $ 10 for any medical service, compared with the present 75 per cent $10 &#39;gap&#39; met entirely by the funds. The Commonwealth, of course, will meet the other 40 per cent. Indeed, as I said earlier, the Commonwealth will be meeting all costs above $20 for any medical service, provided the doctor charges the schedule fee. </para>
			<para>The Registration Committee will be taking into account these new subsidised medical benefits arrangements in relation to the basic table before considering the new premiums for such insurance as from 1 November. I will await with interest the packages and contribution rates the funds will be offering for hospital insurance in due course, once they have had a chance to assess the freedom and flexibility the new scheme offers. </para>
			<para>Future role of the Health Insurance Commission </para>
			<para>With the ending of the present Medibank Standard benefits system, the Health Insurance Commission&#39;s activities after 1 November will be confined to the operation of Medibank Private. The Government has decided that the Health Department will administer the new universal Commonwealth medical benefit. It would obviously be inappropriate for an organisation operating a private fund, that is, the Health Insurance Commission, to pay to other funds Commonwealth benefits for insured and uninsured persons; to be in a position where it had related information on the activities of the other funds; or to exercise supervisory or inspection functions. Similarly, in the new circumstances, bulk billing activities which represent the payment of medical benefits directly to doctors by the Commonwealth for pensioners and the disadvantaged, Commonwealth payments under the hospital cost-sharing agreements, per diem payments to private hospitals, and health program grant payments are more appropriately placed within the Health Department. </para>
			<para>At this stage I cannot be precise about the number of staff who will be required to handle Medibank Private or to deal with the additional functions within the Health Department. It does seem, however, that some of the present employees of the Health Insurance Commission will be surplus to requirements. We will make every effort to re-deploy any surplus staff to the Public Service, to other Commonwealth authorities, to the private health funds or elsewhere. I will be raising employment possibilities with the private funds, and have asked that the Public Service Board and the Commonwealth Employment Service give particular attention to the placement needs of Commission staff. Meetings will be arranged by the Government as soon as possible with relevant staff organisations to discuss these important matters. </para>
			<para class="block">Summary of effects on various groups </para>
			<para>Let me now summarise briefly the effects of the 1 November changes on various groups in the community: </para>
			<para>For the 57 per cent of the population who are currently insured with private health funds for both medical and hospital benefits, there will be little change, although their medical insurance premiums should be lower from 1 November. Individuals can, of course, elect to take the new Commonwealth medical benefit and standard hospital care if they choose. </para>
			<para>For pensioners with pensioner health benefit cards, and their dependants, there will be no change in respect of present levels of medical and hospital coverage. </para>
			<para>For pensioners and others who currently have hospital-only insurance, they will be required to pay a little extra if they wish to continue coverage for shared ward accommodation with doctor of choice in hospital. </para>
			<para>For low-income earners and others who are socially disadvantaged, doctors will be able to bulk-bill their medical accounts, as recently announced. </para>
			<para>For health insurance levy payers, a clear-cut choice will need to be made- whether to accept the new universal Commonwealth benefits, or whether to take out private insurance in order to retain their existing level of medical benefits. It is a choice they will need to make by 1 November. </para>
			<para class="block">Summary of advantages </para>
			<para>In summary, the revised Medibank arrangements will provide a better and simpler system of universal health insurance for all Australians. Under the existing arrangements, people have faced complex decisions- whether to pay the health insurance levy only, whether to add hospital-only&#39; insurance to the Levy, or whether to take out full private insurance. These complexities would have been increased by any future adjustments to the Levy rate in line with rises in health insurance premiums. </para>
			<para>The new scheme removes these difficulties. In future an individual will have to decide only one major question- do I wish to take out private health insurance over and above my universal Commonwealth medical benefit and standard hospital entitlement, and if so how much do I want? The whole income tax collection system will be simplified from 1 November. Paymasters will no longer have to concern themselves with levy collections. Self-employed people and others with unpredictable incomes will not have to cope with the uncertainties of deciding which options are most suitable to them. </para>
			<para>In spite of these simplifications, it is recognised that there are people who find any change unsettling, and who may feel immediate uncertainty about what they will be required to do. May I assure those people that the Government will be undertaking an extensive information program between now and 1 November to ensure that everyone in the community will be fully aware of the choice to be made and the steps necessary to implement that choice. In conclusion, the very real advantages of the modified arrangements are: </para>
			<para>Everyone will continue to be automatically entitled to coverage for health care at a uniform level. </para>
			<para>The present element of compulsion by which people have to pay for one form of health insurance or another will disappear, and a substantial monetary saving should be available for most people. </para>
			<para>Those who wish to insure for a higher level of benefits may do so on a completely voluntary basis. </para>
			<para>Pensioners and the socially disadvantaged will be covered for medical benefits and standard ward hospital care. </para>
			<para>The complexities of income tax returns in relation to the health insurance levy will disappear. </para>
			<para>Acquisition of statistical data on medical services will be simplified because of the payment of a uniform Commonwealth benefit for every medical service. </para>
			<para>The principle of greater patient contribution by way of lower levels of universal medical benefits, introduced in the May modifications to encourage users and providers to use services responsibly, is carried forward in the new arrangements. </para>
			<para>Although considerable subsidy is being provided to people for medical benefits, the </para>
			<para>Government is introducing a form of voluntary deductible system by leaving it to contributors to decide whether they will insure for a larger or lesser percentage of benefits. </para>
			<para>There have been many representations from people wanting the opportunity to carry a higher proportion of risk in return for lower health insurance premiums. The November changes to Medibank will provide that opportunity. </para>
			<para>The modifications will, in effect, allow people to enter into their own voluntary deductible systems, knowing that they are largely covered for high-cost, catastrophic illness. Put in another way, the system will enable people to accept higher risks in return for lower insurance premiums. This will provide an incentive to people to use medical services responsibly. </para>
			<para>While special arrangements have been made for pensioners and the socially disadvantaged, the Government will monitor the scheme carefully to ensure that it serves their needs satisfactorily. The Government is confident that these changes will not only ease some of the financial strain from individuals in paying for health care, but will also simplify the health insurance system while at the same time maintaining a constraining effect on health costs. I commend the changes to honourable members. </para>

            <para>Earlier this year I invited my colleagues, the Minister for Productivity and the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, to participate in an exchange of policy statements and other material to increase our awareness of what is happening in each of our Ministries and to facilitate coordination of effort. In extending this invitation I made particular reference to the impact of various measures upon small business. </para>
            <para>One of the main problems in dealing with small business is the inherent difficulty in communicating with a sector made up of some 350,000 individual businesses. Therefore, in April I announced the establishment of the Small Business Advisory Council. The Council will provide a permanent link between the Government and the small business sector and advise me on small business issues. Its membership represents a wide cross-section of experience and involvement in the problems and development of small businesses around Australia. </para>

            <para>The Bureau of Industry Economics is currently undertaking a survey of over 10,000 small firms throughout Australia. The survey which has been actively planned over the last five months, is designed to improve understanding and knowledge of the small business sector particularly in the area of finance. Questionnaires for the survey were issued during the week commencing 7 June 1 978. </para>
            <para>To obtain information on the ability of small firms to raise finance under different economic conditions and at different stages of growth, the BIE has commissioned the University of Newcastle to conduct a follow-up study of about 3,000 firms which responded to a survey conducted by the University in 1 973. The study will examine the business experiences of those firms during the past 5 years and will compare it with their experience during the 5 years prior to 1 973. </para>
            <para>In addition to the survey, the Bureau of Industry Economics has had discussions with the Australian Bureau of Statistics on possible improvements to the data already available from existing statistical collections. </para>
            <para>In the short term, arrangements have been made by the Australian Bureau of Statistics for additional information about small businesses to be published from data collected in the annual economic censuses of establishments and enterprises in various industry sectors. It is expected that a review of the ABS integrated register of businesses, together with the introduction of new computer equipment and data base management systems will lead, in the long term, to a much improved facility for analysing trends in the structure of business and for drawing together statistics about businesses from various statistical collections. </para>

The report concerned is one dated 5 July 1977 prepared by the Superintendent of Police of Christmas Island. The Minister&#39;s refusal is consistent with the established practice of not publishing police reports on investigations concerning the commission of offences. In so far as the police report in question contains matter that, if disclosed, would be reasonably likely to prejudice the investigation of a breach of the law, the Minister&#39;s refusal is also consistent with the recommendations contained in Parliamentary Paper No. 400 &#39;Policy Proposals for Freedom of Information Legislation- Report of Interdepartmental Committee, November 1976&#39;, relating to law enforcement documents.

In addition, in my Press Statement of 6 November 1977 I announced that the Government had approved additional funding in the form of a grant of $60,000 over two years to finance a special nutritional program to help Redfern Aboriginals cope with child malnutrition. Further, I should mention that there was no Departmental report which, in the terms of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McMillan&#39;s</inline> letter, &#39;has discussed the future of the Service and which contains the recommendation against further funding&#39;. </para>

            <para>It is expected that the amalgamation of the existing services would reduce the need for a post office at Wamuran because residents would no longer be required to attend the post office to collect their mail.

          <para>While (c) above is directed towards specific ailments endemic to the Aboriginal people, it should be borne in mind that those people are also prone to all the other diseases which affect the general population.

          <para>The Commonwealth Department of Aboriginal Affairs has provided, for several years, financial support (approximating $100,000 per annum) for research projects relating to Aboriginal health.

              <para>One of the functions of NH and MRC is to advise the Government on the expenditure of money on medical research under the Medical Research Endowment Fund. The Council established for this purpose the Needs in Medical Research (Standing) Committee which is charged to investigate and report on the needs in medical research in Australia and the areas where support is specially needed. The Committee has recently held two seminars, one in Sydney and one in Melbourne, which were attended by a wide cross section of Australia&#39;s research community, to assist in determing areas of special need. In addition, the Council has established special working parties to look at identified areas of medical research needing special support. This has led to the establishment of special postgraduate training fellowships and to the establishment of specialised research units. </para>

          <para>Although the Council takes the abovementioned action to stimulate and support research in areas of special need, it is the research community which initiates such research.

          <para>While this may seem a lengthy procedure, it ensures that all applications for support are evaluated to the same standard and that only research considered to be of the highest scientific merit is recommended for Government support. </para>

            <para>The Offset program is an ongoing activity, and it is not possible to accurately detail the individual orders received in any one year. When work of a particular nature is accepted as an offset to a major overseas purchase this may be spread over a number of years and may involve orders by the overseas supplier on several Australian companies. While the value of such orders is advised to the Offsets Secretariat in my Department (and forms the basis of the text given in response to Part 1 above) any details of items and quantities are provided on an &#39;in-confidence&#39; basis to protect commercially sensitive issues. </para>

        <para>The value of offset orders recorded in any one year does not necessarily indicate the value of work performed in that year. An offset value in one year may be &#39;worked out&#39; over several years, but appears only once in the record, although contract variations may give rise to increases or reductions year by year. </para>
        <para>Offsets credits are allowed for training Australians  providing tooling or plant waiving or reducing licence fees assisting to establish a facility for support, repair or overhaul of approved equipment design and development assistance where resources are not available in Australia transfer of technology in certain instances and therefore do not always appear as separate orders. </para>

        <para>The Government&#39;s policy is that offsets are sought against purchases of equipment by Government Departments and instrumentalities where the value of the overseas order exceeds $0. 5 m. </para>
        <para>Because of this there is an involvement of many areas of Government in ensuring that Australian industry is given adequate opportunity and access to the overseas suppliers. With the ongoing nature of the program it is not possible to determine the number of persons or the total time employed on negotiating offsets. For instance, in the Defence area offsets are a requirement of all major purchases and as part of the normal procurement process impinge on a large number of persons for short periods as occasion demands. In most Defence procurements a Service project office is established to ensure that all necessary requirements of the equipment acquisition process are implemented. Local and overseas officers including Service personnel, members of overseas missions and Australian Government Representatives overseas can be involved. </para>
        <para>Likewise with civil purchases there is involvement in many different areas. </para>
