            <para>- My question is directed to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> in his capacity as Minister Assisting the Prime Minister in Federal Affairs and also as Minister representing the Treasurer in this place. I seek some clarification from the Minister as to the Government&#39;s understanding of what constitutes total payments to the States and local government authorities over the past few years. I refer the Minister to pages 7 and 12 1 of Budget Paper No. 7 and also to page 121 of Budget Paper No. 1, the Treasurer&#39;s Budget Speech. Do any of those tables represent what the Government considers to be total payments to the States? If either of those tables is correctand presumably the Minister will indicate that the figures appearing in Budget Paper No. 7 are the correct ones- would he agree that the total figures appearing on both tables are identical? Do they in fact represent total payments to the States over that time span? </para>

            <para>- I will endeavour to give an answer to the honourable senator. It may be that having studied his question I may need to add to my answer later. In the 1977-78 Budget Papers the tables on pages 6 and 7 of Budget Paper No. 7 deal with total funds available to the States and local government. Table 102 on page 121 of Budget Paper No. 7 also deals with total funds available to the States and local government. The table which appears on page 121 of Budget Paper No. 1 deals only with payments to or for the States and local government. It does not deal with any specific purpose payments from the Government. These are allocated as to function elsewhere in the Budget Papers. Therefore, the first two tables show the total funds available to the States and local government. The third table deals only with part of the funds provided with respect to the tax sharing entitlements of the States and local governments, Loan Council programs and special grants. I should like to study <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> &#39;s question in more detail to see whether there should be anything added to my answer. I will do that and let him know. </para>

            <para>-I thank the Minister for that answer. I realise that he may wish to study the question in more detail. But in view of the fact that he has indicated that the first two tables to which I referred do represent total payments, I ask him whether he agrees that the totals shown in both tables are the same? If he could give an answer to that point now, I would be appreciative. </para>

            <para>- Last year the Government reviewed the maternity and paternity leave provisions for Commonwealth employees and undertook to consult with staff organisations concerning that review. Discussions have been held with the Public Service Board and peak trade union councils. The Government will be proceeding with some amendments following those consultations. With the Government&#39;s heavy legislative program it has not been possible to introduce the amending Bill but it is the intention of the Government to introduce this legislation during the Budget session. I take this opportunity to mention also that the Government has before it extensive amendments to the Public Service Act on matters which also have been discussed with the peak councils and it is hoped that an amending Bill may be introduced this session with a view to consideration of it being stood over for public consideration in the winter recess. </para>

            <para>-I ask the Attorney-General: In the light of recent answers on legal aid matters, is it a fact that a large number of recipients of Commonwealth pensions and benefits is ineligible for legal aid? When was the means test last adjusted? Are there any automatic procedures for it to be adjusted according to a particular index? If so, what is the index? I add that this may be a matter which is partly within the bailiwick of the Minister for Social Security but nevertheless I direct the question to the Attorney-General. </para>

            <para>
              <inline font-weight="bold">- Senator Button</inline>asked firstly: Is a large number of pensioners ineligible to receive legal aid? All I can say is that the strict application of the present guidelines certainly does render and has rendered a number of pensioners ineligible. Until this year, it was possible to exercise some discretion and under the present guidelines it still is possible to exercise discretion to assist pensioners or any person who is just above the guidelines but because of the unavailability of funds the guidelines have had to be fairly strictly adhered to throughout the whole of this year and certainly since I have been Attorney-General. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The second question that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> asked was: When were the guidelines last adjusted? The present guidelines were brought in by my predecessor in, I think, March 1 976. It was in the early days of the present Government. Thirdly, he asked: Is there any provision in them for them to be indexed? The answer is no. As I have said, there is a discretion in them but that, of course, can be exercised only in relation to the availability of funds. </para>

              <para>- It can be exercised in favour of them. In the past some discretion has been exercised to assist somebody who has been in fact just outside the guidelines and who otherwise would be a proper case. But, as I have said, because the funds have been very tight and will continue to be tight- probably there will never be enough funds available for legal aid- at the present moment the guidelines have to be adhered to strictly. </para>

            <para>-Legislation relating to the manufacture of foodstuffs in Australia for domestic consumption is basically the responsibility of State governments. In all States manufacturers obtain approval from the authorities to use premises for the manufacture of foodstuffs. Conditions governing the manufacture vary from State to State. I do not have precise details of the variations regarding the products mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Archer,</inline> but I can say that in Tasmania the manufacture of an edible oilbutter spread is totally prohibited. In other States there is no legislation which would prevent manufacturers of butter from being granted approval to use their premises for the manufacture of this type of spread. I understand that manufacturers of margarine are not permitted to bring butter into their premises. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I understand that in New South Wales this spread must conform with the labelling requirements of margarine and that in Victoria, Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia special legislation covers the manufacture of a mixture of butter and edible vegetable oil, which may be marketed as a dairy blend. State food and drug laws do not permit the use of flavourings in butter. Accordingly, it would be considered an offence to purchase, to hold, to blend or to manufacture flavoured butter for consumption on the domestic market. That basically answers the honourable senator&#39;s question on the point of putting in some of those attractive flavourings. Flavouring of the dairy blend mentioned by the honourable senator is subject to the same restrictions as apply to butter. Flavouring of table margarine is permissible in most States under certain conditions. </para>
          <para>The manufacture of dairy produce for export is subject to the provisions of the Exports (Dairy Produce) Regulations. Under those regulations, permission may be granted for the manufacture of an edible oil-butter spread in either a butter or a margarine factory. There are no specific provisions in the Exports (Dairy Produce) Regulations governing the addition of flavourings to butter, edible oil or a mixture of edible oils and butter. Should a manufacturer desire to manufacture such a flavoured product he would be required to furnish details of the ingredients to the Department of Primary Industry. Provided that the flavourings were permissible food additives, approval would be granted for the export of that flavoured product. </para>

There was a reference in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of 19 May to &#39;Australian pilots in Salisbury&#39; presenting a pewter replica of a dust bin to members of the Rhodesian Air Force as a gesture of admiration. Can the Minister advise the Senate of the number of Australian pilots in Rhodesia? Are they members of the Royal Australian Air Force? What are their duties in Rhodesia? If they are not members of the RAAF, are these pilots in Rhodesia with the knowledge and approval of the Australian Government? </para>

            <para>-To the best of my knowledge no members of the Australian Defence Force are in Rhodesia. I am positive of that. However, if that is not correct I will have the answer corrected. I hope the Senate will understand that it may be difficult to answer the balance of the questions because the Australian Government has no direct or indirect contacts in Rhodesia. It is a country with which we do not have any diplomatic exchange. Therefore, the information requested by the honourable senator, being information contained within that country, may be very difficult to obtain because we do not have any contact with Rhodesia. </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">- Senator Lajovic</inline>has asked me two questions regarding motor vehicle registrations. I have here figures that were released recently. The lastest figures for April show that seasonally adjusted registrations of new motor vehicles increased by 8.8 per cent in April to a level of 48,800. This compares with levels of 44,800 in March, 48,000 in February, and an average monthly level of 46,000 in the first seven months of 1977-78. The seasonally adjusted increase in April comprised increases of 10.6 per cent in registrations of new motor vehicles and station wagons and 3.1 per cent in registrations of other vehicles. In answer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lajovic</inline> &#39;s second question, total registrations in April were at their highest monthly level since July last year. The figures for the three months to April 1 978 indicate a steady improvement in registrations since the low levels experienced in the three months to October 1 977.I have some additional details of registrations of new motor vehicles in recent years.

Has the Minister&#39;s attention been directed particularly to the Judge&#39;s comments that &#39;it would be an unauthorised exercise of discretion to deny to all parties a right of cross-examination &#39;. Because the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal in its hearings to date has been allowing- in my opinion, properly allowing- an air of informality in its public hearings on applications for renewal of licences and because there is so much public interest in the matter, can the Minister say whether the Tribunal intends adopting its existing practice or whether the High Court judgment now means that in all future hearings conducted by the </para>

The Government itself must be interested in such a judgment as described by the honourable senator. I personally, both in my representative capacity and as one who has taken an interest in this field, certainly would be interested in it. I believe that the Government would study such a judgment, as would the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, and of course reach decisions as to how the Tribunal should comport itself in the future so that its behaviour is in accordance with the High Court judgment. But since I talk not from first hand knowledge I will get in touch with the Minister. I will refer the question to him and seek a response from him. I also will invite the Minister to study the judgment in its relationship to the Tribunal and its present and future practices. </para>

Does the Government realise that tremendous economic and employment benefits would be provided by the establishment of a petrochemical industry at Redcliff in the northern Spencer Gulf area? Does the Minister recall that on numerous occasions I have pressed for this petrochemical industry to be established and that several months ago I asked the Government to give favourable consideration to approving a loan amounting to about $250m to the South Australian Government for the infrastructure associated with the project?

            <para>- It is true- and I think that all honourable senators will agree- that there has been a significant downturn in industrial activity in South Australia. It is equally true that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> has raised this matter in its various aspects in the Senate. For example, he has been very active in regard to Whyalla and the Gulf area itself. It is equally true that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> has raised in the Senate the matter of the possible development of a very significant petrochemical industry at Redcliff. I think from memory that Dow Chemical (Australia) Ltd was the main contender for this project. I do indeed recall it and it would be a very significant addition to the Australian component of industries both in a strengthening of those industries and of course in increasing employment opportunities. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The nub of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> &#39;s question is the matter of whether there will be approval for the raising of a loan of, I think he suggested, some $250m by way of infrastructure expenditure. I remind the honourable senator and the Senate that a major reform announced recently by the Federal Government has been that of infrastructure borrowing within the terms of the Australian Loan Council and the 1927 financial agreement and the gentlemen&#39;s agreement following it. As I understand it, the States now are looking towards their likely requirements in infrastructure borrowing and are looking towards making submissions to the Commonwealth Government and the Loan Council so that programs can be put forward and accepted. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Court has been very smartly off the mark in this regard. It does require initiative and imagination and certainly <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Court has been very active. I think the correct step for South Australia is properly to assess the nature of the infrastructure necessary and to put the priorities that it considers necessary into a form of submission to the Loan Council. I have no doubt at all that the matter would be considered. My understanding is that the Premiers Conference will be held in the latter part of June which is only a few weeks off. I have little doubt that the Premiers will be looking to infrastructure borrowing as one of the main means of future development in Australia. The Government sees it as one of the significant methods of re-employment as well as national development. </para>

          <para>I know, and certainly honourable senators would know, that over the past <inline font-style="italic">2lA</inline> years I have instanced from time to time the importance I see in the allocation of funds by this Government to the development of such a landing system. Indeed, there might have been one other airport in the world where a similar system was working. But we certainly have had it in operation at an international airport at Tullamarine when 1 have flown into that airport. So far as I am aware, we had this system in operation before any other country did. We approached the United States to join with us in this project. I think that recently Russia approached the consortium and sought to join it. Recently the Federal Republic of Germany requested that it be allowed to join. I think that Australia was delighted to have the weight of the influence of these countries. Without the influence of the United States, probably a scheme such as the one Australia has been able to put forward would not have got ofl&#34; the ground. </para>
          <para>Yesterday we were prompted to go back in history by a comment made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Robert</inline> Cotton.  His  knowledge of this matter went back to the very early 1970s when the concept of a new landing system was being considered by the Department of Civil Aviation, as it was in those days. Undoubtedly the concept of a new international landing system might have been considered by many nations. But the fact is that the time reference scanning beam system was an Australian concept. It was developed by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. I think that we can rest content that our country has been the leader in this field. I hope that industry, with the assistance now of the Federal Government, will be able to take advantage of this system to gain something for Australian industry and for the Australian community. An amount of $4 billion is said to be involved in the installation of this system throughout the world. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister for Science and follows the question asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Knight.</inline> I ask the Minister: Does not <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Knight&#39;s</inline> question indicate quite clearly the concern being felt by many people in the community about the manner in which Australia&#39;s contribution to the  InterScan  program is being submerged by very powerful overseas interests? Did not the Minister himself on 30 March last year make it quite clear that the system was conceived by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and that it was developed jointly with the Department of Transport here in Australia? If it had not been for that work would the Minister not agree that the United States of America, Russia or any other nation today would not have any chance of benefiting from such an innovative scheme as  InterScan?  Will the Minister, in conjunction with the Minister for Productivity, give the Parliament a detailed statement of the negotiations which took place here over the past two or three weeks when a United States delegation came here to negotiate certain arrangements for the development of  InterScan?  Would the Minister not agree that we in the Parliament have not been informed what those arrangements are and that the Parliament is entitled to know what measures have been taken to protect Australia&#39;s interests? As was quite properly pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Knight,</inline> at this stage there is no indication that Australia &#39;s interests are being properly protected? </para>

Really, I think I could stop there. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> asked me the most important question of whether I would be prepared to bring before the Parliament a statement relating to the negotiations with the United States&#39; company in relation to the development of the equipment that may be used in InterScan installations. I feel that that is not an unreasonable request. I think the public of Australia should be alerted, if it is not alert to it already, as to the basis upon which we are seeking to develop InterScan. I think a reasonable reading of the reports that have been released would reveal that a company in America has the main market in America for the installation of landing systems in that country. In fact, it has the ability to install 50 per cent of the equipment in the world. Australia should seek to negotiate with that company and attempt to get this comparatively small country involved in that work. </para>

          <para>Points were raised in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> &#39;s question in relation to the holding of the patents for this equipment. I could give an answer on that. That, perhaps, is an appropriate question. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> may be comforted if he knows where the patents are held. Surely he must realise that it was only recently that the International Civil Aviation Organisation decided that this type of equipment will be used as a world landing system and that it will not be until next year, at another meeting, before ICAO approves the type of development and hardware that is to be used in the installation. It is in that regard that Australia is endeavouring to contribute money towards the research and deveopment of this system, along with a similar contribution from overseas. We hope that we will be able to achieve something for Australian industry in this $4 billion market. </para>

It is true that the problems currently being experienced by some manufacturers relate, in part, to the effect on the local content rules of the appreciation of the Japanese yen. In addition, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Young</inline> asked me yesterday about the production of the Astron engine by Chrysler Australia Ltd and whether that would be of assistance to it in meeting the local content rules. With the introduction of a significant item, such as a new locally produced engine, it follows that increased sourcing of such an important item will assist plan entrants, such as Chrysler Australia Ltd, to meet their obligations. </para>

          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Committee. I am advised by the Minister th*&#34;. the Government, in determining the responses which should be made to particular refugee situations, has not attempted to decide income levels by comparison of situations, and certainly not considered intake levels in terms of ratios. This would be unrealistic. The Government&#39;s recently announced decision to adopt a program calling for 9,000 Indo-Chinese immigrants in 1978-79 reflects only its reaction to that particular problem. The number of refugees in Thailand is about 110,000 with 7,500 boat people in Malaysia. Refugees must outflow from Vietnam in the order of 3,000 a month. </para>
          <para>There is also a need to take urgent action to reduce boat travel direct to our shores. As the Minister has announced, last year Australia took in refugees from 40 different countries. If they were all made subject to a ratio system the position would become quite unmanageable. I am not suggesting that the honourable senator advocates that. I can assure him that we will continue, quite separately, to view the problems of Chilean refugees with the compassion and understanding which are already reflected in the ongoing program for refugees from South America. The other remarks that the honourable senator has made are consistent with what I have said about Chilean refugees and our ongoing program for South America. We certainly would not be looking at a ratio of refugees as between one country and another, but rather would continue to look at the intake of refugees with compassion and understanding. </para>

Does the Minister realise also that there is a twofold problem in that there are no locally produced diesel powered cars, but strict import quotas on the diesel Volkswagen, Peugeot and Mercedes Benz cars?

Is the Minister aware that many country areas in Queensland are one station areas as far as television is concerned and that in these areas there is widespread concern at the drastic cuts in the sporting programs of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, particularly regarding rugby league replays. Queensland country people believe they are now in a sporting desert and that they have been discriminated against as there do not appear to be similar reductions in sporting programs elsewhere. Will the Minister take the matter up with his colleague, the Minister for Post and Telecommunications, to see whether some improvement can be brought about? </para>

              <para>- I thought <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> was declaring his peculiar interest in Australian rules football. It is perfectly true that in areas of the vast State of Queensland, as in other vast States such as Western Australia and my own State of New South Wales, there are difficulties associated with single station television. It is equally true that particularly with the advent and extension of colour television, spectator interest in viewing sport on television has increased enormously. I do not venture into what particular kinds of sport are observed. I am not aware that the Australian Broadcasting Commission has specially narrowed its transmission of sporting programs- particularly of rugby league. I will certainly draw this problem to the attention to my colleague in another place. I will take up the substance of the question put by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McAuliffe</inline> and ask the Minister for Post and Telecommunications to give it consideration and to respond. I am sure that everybody in the Australian community is interested to see the maximum transmission of good sporting programs in this country. </para>

            <para>- I have in fact within my brief such figures because there is constant discussion here and elsewhere in the world about how one developed country compares with another. I am bound to say at the outset that there is some difficulty in making comparisons because some countries use gross domestic product and others gross national product. The GDP figure generally shows a lower percentage and therefore the comparison is not an accurate one. But it is possible to say that in Australia over a three-year period total outlays on education, represented as a percentage of GDP, were as follows: in 1973-74, 5 per cent; 1974-75, 6.2 per cent; and in 1976-77, as an estimated figure, 6.4 per cent. The figure is showing a very considerable movement and compared with the past it shows that in Australia a major and significant amount of the total budgets of Australia is being allocated at the State and Federal level to education. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>As to the second part of the honourable senator&#39;s question-that is, public expenditure on education as a percentage of either GDP or GNP- we have a variety of figures for Australia. On the basis of GDP, the figure for 1975-76 was 6.3 per cent and in the following year 6.4 per cent. The figure for Canada in 1 975-76 was 6 per cent. So Australia was yielding more. For the calendar year 1976, Japan, a country that has devoted itself intensively to education, spent 5.7 per cent of its gross domestic product on education. I must interpose here that we are dealing with the quantity of money and not necessarily the quality of outcome. For the year 1976-77, the United Kingdom spent 7.3 per cent of its gross national product on education which, expressed as a percentage of gross domestic product, shows that Australia&#39;s expenditure compares favourably with that of the United Kingdom. The United </para>
          <para class="block">States of America spent 7.9 per cent of its gross national product and again Australia&#39;s expenditure compares favourably. In the year 1976, France spent 4.7 per cent of its gross domestic product on education. Clearly on any quantitative measurement Australia in recent years has devoted to education a percentage of its gross domestic product which is comparable with or greater than that of any country.

He will be aware that I have repeatedly raised in the Senate the plight of wine grape growers in Australia and have requested Government assistance for the growers because of the huge surplus this year, particularly in the Riverland of South Australia. One method of assistance I have suggested to the Government is import restrictions on cheap wine from other countries. I ask the Minister whether his attention has been drawn to an advertisement in yesterday&#39;s Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Sun</inline> which referred to imported Japanese akadama plum wine. If so, will he inform the Senate of the name of the firm which has been granted the import licence for this product, the date of the granting of the licence and the quantity that has been imported. I can give the Minister a copy of the advertisement for this cheap plum wine so that he can have inquiries made. </para>

I obtained an answer basically from the Department in question, which informed me that it would need to look further into that matter and advise me later. One other report suggested that the honourable senator&#39;s question was inaccurate. It was suggested that this matter was going to be the basis of an article in a newspaper but the writer found it was incorrect and did not proceed to write it. Those are the two pieces of information that came to me yesterday. I do not know whether <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Garfield</inline> Barwick has made any comment on the security and noise standards. I shall put the question to the Minister for Construction today. </para>

I understand that the position has been vacant since the end of 1976 when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hay</inline> left it to take up another appointment. I ask: Does the Government intend to fill this vacancy and, if so, when? In the meantime, have servicemen had any opportunity to lodge grievances with anyone? How have those grievances been dealt with? Finally, has the Government been subjected to representations from senior officers to leave the position vacant permanently? </para>

I understand further that the function is at present being performed on an acting basis. I do not know whether representations have been received from senior officers. I do not know what are the latest figures but I recall that over a period of, I think, 18 months when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hay</inline> was Defence Ombudsman he dealt with five complaints. So one could hardly imagine that the defence forces are in a state of ferment. I shall see whether I can obtain the latest figures for the honourable senator so that he will have some indication of the work load which is being borne in this area by the person who is acting in this position. I understand also that my colleague is looking at the whole question of the redress of grievances for members of the armed forces. If I can get some further information on that I shall advise the honourable senator accordingly. </para>

I ask: Is it a fact that the Commissioner of Taxation has decided that the trading stock valuation allowance does not apply to motor dealers who, by necessity, finance their stock by bailment arrangements with finance companies? As I understand the situation, it tends to be the smaller motor dealers who are forced to operate in this way and who are not able to create a wholesaling company as an intermediary. I also ask: Is it a fact that the Australian Finance Conference has expressed the view that it is impracticable for it to claim and to pass on the benefits of the trading stock valuation allowance to the motor dealers? In view of the fact that the investment allowance provisions were amended by the Government to permit, according to certain rules, lessees to benefit from that allowance, will the Government as a matter of urgency- an urgency created by the fact that 30 June is the relevant date for the trading stock valuation allowance- and as a matter of equity, make amendments to the provisions to enable motor dealers who finance their trading stock by a bailment plan, commonly known as a floor plan, to claim the benefit of the allowance? </para>

            <para>- I am aware of an approach to the Treasurer, by the Australian Finance Conference on the trading stock valuation allowance- TSVA, as it is called- regarding motor vehicles. I am advised that it is the view of the Commissioner of Taxation that where floor plan arrangements prevail the legal owners of vehicles at the commencement of an income year- usually the wholesale finance companies and not the dealers themselves- are entitled to claim the deductions allowable by way of a trading stock valuation adjustment. I am further advised that the result of the Commissioner&#39;s decision is that the trading stock valuation adjustment deduction will be allowable in respect of stocks of cars in precisely the same way as it applies to trading stocks held in other industries. It will be the legal owner at the time who receives the deduction. It is a matter of negotiation between motor dealers and the finance companies whether all or part of the benefits obtained by the finance companies from this deduction are to be passed on to the dealers by way of a lowering of the interest charges or in some other way. Although the Finance Conference suggests that this course has practical difficulties, I understand that some companies have already indicated that they have made arrangements which will ensure that the benefits of the deduction will in future flow to the motor dealers with which they are associated. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The trading stock deduction is available to any dealers who do not operate a floor plan but finance their vehicle stocks from their own resources and who, as a result, have legal title to the stock at the beginning of the income year. This also is the situation where a finance company takes a floating charge over a dealer&#39;s stock or some other form of security, leaving the legal title in the stock with the dealer or with the dealer&#39;s own wholesale company. Representatives of the industry, I understand, have discussed this matter with the Treasurer who, after careful consideration, has advised them that he is not prepared to recommend an amendment to the relevant income tax provisions. </para>

            <para>- I note that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> says that the changes which were announced yesterday have been unfavourably received. I do not believe there has been sufficient time to explain or to interpret to the public at large the changes and to suggest that they have been unfavourably received on the basis of headlines in the newspapers overlooks, I think, what may be the reaction of the people when the changes are made known to them. The Government said that Medibank would be retained and that steps would be taken to improve the health care system in Australia. That is the reason for the changes which were announced yesterday and the reason for the previous changes which were made. It is believed that the health care system in this country is a first-class system but there are burdens of cost which need to be contained. Whilst we wish to see a health care system which makes health care available to all we need to look at the costs which are involved and when measures can be taken to improve the system or to contain costs action should responsibly be taken by government. This is what was done yesterday. </para>

The cost of the changes announced yesterday will be borne by the community in accordance with capacity to pay. In respect of the change in the insurance gap that may exist or the proportion of the benefit which is payable, the decision that has been taken will affect all Australians. There is a sharing of the burden of costs, as I mentioned earlier. </para>

            <para>-On 11 May <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> asked me a question concerning petrol prices in Tasmania. He referred to a conference that was held in Hobart on 3 April which was attended by representatives of the Commonwealth and State governments and six oil companies which market petroleum products in Tasmania. He referred to a statement which was allegedly made by one of the oil industry spokesmen at that conference which conflicted with an answer I had given to him in the Senate on 1 5 March. I said that there was a problem in Tasmania in that there was a past agreement between the oil industry and the State Government concerning the price of petrol in Hobart. It was alleged that the oil industry spokesman denied that such an agreement existed. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs has provided me with an answer in relation to this conflict. I am informed that the statement attributed to the oil industry spokesman was not made. I am also informed that in the early 1960s an understanding was reached between the Tasmanian Government and the oil companies for lower prices in rural Tasmania. Under this agreement the wholesale price of petrol in Hobart was increased by one halfpenny per gallon which is equivalent to 0. 1 1 cents per litre to compensate for the price reductions in country centres. Prior to that agreement the Melbourne and Hobart wholesale prices were the same. Subsequent price increases have been applied to these base prices. The difference between Melbourne and Hobart prices which stemmed from that understanding still exist although there is a very small differential between them. </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">- Senator Missen</inline>earlier today asked a question with regard to the use of diesel fuel for cars in Australia. I have now obtained the answer. It is a fact that diesel cars have been receiving increased publicity in recent days. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> referred to an article in relation to the matter. Consumer demand for diesel cars continues to expand in Europe and in America largely due to increasing industry and public awareness of the environmental and energy saving advantages of diesel engines and also the generally lower price of distillate compared with petrol. However, there is not a significant difference between the price of distillate and petrol in Australia. Accordingly, there seems to be less pressure for the increased use of diesel engines. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Although diesel cars currently available on the Australian market are imported there is no evidence at this stage that the apparent delay in market acceptance is attributable to the import quota system applying in Australia rather than to the price factors I have mentioned. However, it is expected that the market acceptance for diesel - powered cars will develop in Australia. Holders of import licences are free to use those import quotas to import diesel-powered cars such as </para>
          <para class="block">Volkswagen, Peugeot and Mercedes Benz. Presumably, as the demand increases they may choose to devote a larger proportion of their quotas to diesel cars. </para>

It will be noted that six of the annual reports listed were presented to the Parliament more than six months, and three were presented more than 12 months, after the end of the period reported on. We are concerned at such delays in the provision of information which is essential to effective parliamentary scrutiny of the operations of Commonwealth departments and instrumentalities, and the Committee will continue to keep watch on the situation. </para>
          <para>The Committee is concerned also at the lack of a comprehensive list of statutory bodies, especially those whose annual reports are required to be submitted to the Parliament. Such a list is expected to become available soon as a result of the work of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations. In order to ensure that full and up to date information will be available at all times in the future, the Committee recommends that the Senate institute and maintain a register of statutory bodies in which should be recorded particulars of the authorities whose annual reports are required to be submitted to the Parliament, together with the date of presentation of each report in the Senate, and also particulars of all other statutory bodies and the reporting requirements applying to them. </para>
          <para>The Committee also makes specific comment on two annual reports which were considered to require some follow-up. The Aboriginal Land </para>
          <para class="block">Commissioner, in his report for the year ended 30 June 1977, commented that a number of questions had arisen in regard to the operation of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1 976 and the carrying out of his functions. In response to the Committee&#39;s request for further information on this matter, the Commissioner has advised that he intends to elaborate his views in his next report. The Committee has therefore decided to await that report and to keep a watching brief on the matter. </para>
          <para>The Commissioner for Community Relations, in his annual report for 1976-77, referred to varying responses to complaints relating to public administration. On seeking further information, the Committee was informed that, with the exception of the Queensland Police, whose co-operation had been excellent, the Queensland Government had failed to respond to any matter of racial discrimination referred to it by the Commissioner.  His  letter, dated 14 April 1978, is attached as appendix 1 to the Committee&#39;s report. As we understand from further communication with the Commissioner&#39;s office that developments are expected in a number of these matters, close attention will be paid to the Commissioner&#39;s next annual report. The Committee is concerned, however, at the circumstances which have led to the Commissioner&#39;s comment, indicating an almost complete lack of response by the Queensland Government, and brings this matter to the attention of the Senate for the consideration of any action which the Senate may desire. </para>

              <para>- Honourable senators will be aware that when I use the first person personal pronoun, I am referring to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. In my statement to Parliament on 11 May 1978 I informed honourable members that in recent negotiations with the Papua New Guinea Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ebia</inline> Olewale, we agreed upon the principal basic elements which are to be included in the treaty to be concluded on maritime boundaries between our two countries and on other matters relating to Torres Strait. In that statement I indicated that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Olewale</inline> and I would be presenting to our respective parliaments a fuller outline of those elements and that I would make available to honourable senators illustrative maps which would indicate the results of these important negotiations. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> has written to the Premier of Queensland, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bjelke-Petersen,</inline> concerning the principal basic elements which are to be included in the treaty and my colleague the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Viner)</inline> also has conferred with the Torres Strait Islander chairmen. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>In this statement I wish to present to honourable senators an account of the principal basic elements which the Australian and Papua New Guinea Foreign Ministers have agreed will be included in the treaty. The Foreign Minister of Papua New Guinea is presenting a similar account to his Parliament. Before proceeding to speak about the treaty elements, I wish to recall that Australia and Papua New Guinea have been engaged in these negotiations over a period of years, beginning before Papua New Guinea moved to independence. Both our governments have been determined to arrive at a permanent and equitable settlement which will meet the need to delimit our territorial seas and the seabed and fishing zones between the two countries. The settlement must also take account of intricate historical, cultural, social and economic factors of great signifiance to our peoples, including notably the people of the Torres Strait area. Both our governments have accordingly approached the negotiations with great care and concern in order to arrive at a solution which is equitable in human terms and lasting and beneficial in its consequences. We have sought an agreement which will stand the test of time both legally and functionally. We have been determined to achieve a treaty settlement which would strengthen the fabric of the relationship between the two countries and their peoples, which we both regard as of high importance. </para>
          <para>It is against this background that I now present for the information of honourable senators a paper containing an outline of the principal basic elements which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Olewale</inline> and I have agreed will be included in the treaty, together with two illustrative maps which will indicate these elements graphically. At the conclusion of this statement I shall seek leave to have the text of the paper incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> I commend this paper and the supporting maps to the attention of honourable senators. It is of necessity a long and somewhat technical document. I should therefore like to state some general points and then to summarise the main treaty elements on which agreement has been reached. Firstly, it should be kept in mind that certain outstanding points of substance are to be the subject of further negotiations. These points arise mainly from the principal basic elements which now represent common ground. </para>
          <para>Secondly, the package of elements which is now emerging provides for a fair and equitable division of sea and seabed resources between Papua New Guinea and Australia across the whole area traversed by the proposed lines of delimitation. This is what both governments have been seeking to achieve. </para>
          <para>Thirdly, the basic elements provide for access from both sides to the sea and seabed resources of the Torres Strait area on terms which will foster the development of the economies of the immediate areas in and on both sides of the Strait. </para>
          <para>Fourthly, arrangements will be established in the Torres Strait area which are designed to meet fully the particular needs of the people of the area, including the people of the adjacent coastal area of Papua New Guinea, with regard to traditional movements and traditional fishing. In putting these arrangements into effect, the wishes of the people of the area will be taken into account by the two governments. There will be machinery to ensure that representatives of these people will be consulted about decisions that affect them. </para>
          <para>Fifthly, there will be appropriate guarantees for freedom of movement for ships and aircraft in the area. In particular, these will ensure that internal sea and air services of the two countries will take place without delay, interference or inconvenience. There will also be provision for the passage of vessels using the strait to go to other destinations along routes normally used for international navigation. </para>
          <para>The main treaty elements, briefly stated in non-technical and non-legal language, are as follows: </para>

The share in the territorial seas of the Australian uninhabited islands north of the seabed line other than Turnagain, however, will be on a 50/50 basis and Papua New Guinea will have 100 per cent of the commercial barramundi fishery near the Papua New Guinea coast, excluding the territorial seas of Saibai, Dauan and Boigu. Each country will have preference against third countries to take up any surplus of the other country&#39;s share of the commercial Protected Zone fisheries.

          <para>What I have set out in this statement, and in the paper I have tabled, is an outline of the principal basic elements which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Olewale</inline> and I have agreed are to be included in the treaty. This outline is in summary form and not in formal treaty language. Certain consequential points of substance remain for discussion between the two Foreign Ministers and considerably more work remains to be done on the development of detailed treaty articles. The technical descriptions of the various points and lines referred to in this statement, and in the accompanying paper and illustrative maps, require further careful checking and calculation before being finally agreed upon for inclusion in the treaty. It is planned that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Olewale</inline> and I will consult again in a few weeks&#39; time in order to maintain momentum towards the completion of full treaty documentation. Meanwhile, I am confident that honourable senators will agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Olewale</inline> and me that the agreement we have now reached upon the principal basic elements to be included in the treaty text is an historic one. We and our ministerial colleagues believe that a treaty incorporating these elements will represent a mutually acceptable and equitable settlement which will meet the genuine concerns and interests of the Governments and peoples of our two countries.

            <para>- The Opposition welcomes the statement which has just been put down by the Minister for Administrative Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Withers)</inline> on behalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Peacock)</inline> and which sets out the details of negotiations of new boundaries between Australia and Papua New Guinea. The statement follows an earlier statement a fortnight ago in which the Foreign Minister indicated the nature of the agreement which the two countries had reached. This statement provides the substantive details of that agreement. We on this side of the chamber welcome the fact that the two governments have been able to reach a satisfactory settlement of the difficult maritime boundaries question. We would agree that the arrangement must stand the test of time- both legally and functionally- and should it do so we accept it will strengthen the relationship between our two countries. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>It seems to us that it was unnecessary that there has been a considerable degree of secrecy in relation to the details of the negotiations. We know that the negotiations have been made more difficult because of the attitude of the Queensland Government. Nevertheless the arrangements have a substantial effect on Torres Strait Islanders and we feel that perhaps more time should have been taken to discuss the measures prior to any firm agreements being reached. That the issue is complex cannot be doubted by anyone reading the Minister&#39;s statement. The treaty, when it is concluded, will provide for a complex set of arrangements dealing with boundaries. In particular there will be a seabed resources delimitation line, another line limiting the swimming fisheries resources jurisdiction and a large area described as a protected zone. The overlap between these concepts, the physical territory of the two countries and the territorial seas of the two countries will create an arrangement which could be  extemely  difficult to administer and lead to rather unknown complications which as yet would be difficult for us to foresee. </para>
          <para>In particular, the protected zone provisions of the treaty will permit freedom of movement by the local people within the protected zone, but at the same time the treaty will provide for immigration, customs, health and quarantine arrangements. This will be an extremely difficult concept to translate into action and, unless the whole issue is handled very sensitively- not only at the treaty stage but also on an on-going basis- it could lead to friction between the people of the Torres Strait and ultimately between ourselves  and Papua New Guinea. I have no doubt that this is something which none of us would wish to see. I feel certain that the Government will be mindful of the inherent problems that may well arise in making this agreement functionally successful. </para>
          <para>The treaty also provides for a very strange concept- that is what is known as a swimming fisheries resources jurisdiction which involves the Talbot Islands, Saibai and Dauan. It is not clear what is being provided by this concept. Those islands have their separate territorial seas and presumably access to them will be guaranteed to them under other parts of the treaty. It seems clear we will not be able to make a detailed appraisal of these complex provisions until we see what is involved in the treaty. The arrangements for sharing fisheries resources within the protected zone are complex and will need to be administered with a high degree of sensitivity to avoid difficulties arising between the fishermen exploiting the areas. As these provisions will affect the livelihood of many people in the area, the Opposition will be interested in whether the people in the Torres Strait have been sufficiently consulted about the issues and whether they are satisfied that their interests have been adequately looked after. </para>
          <para>The Opposition welcomes a number of the matters to be included in the treaty, particularly the co-operation between the two governments on mining and oil drilling, the protection of the environment and the magement of the resources in the area. The co-operative licensing arrangements may provide difficulty but the joint administration of these issues could well lead, if handled properly, to a strengthening of the ties between the two countries. As the Minister for Administrative Services points out, much work needs to be done. It is clear in the time available that the Opposition has not had time to form a concluded view about many of the aspects of the treaty. In substance, the treaty appears to be a very satisfactory one from the Australian point of view and also from the Papua New Guinea point of view. But we still need to know a lot more about specific issues before it would be possible to make a final judgment on that question. </para>
          <para>In concluding my remarks I indicate that the Opposition generally would be sympathetic to the basic proposal that has been put down in the Parliament and we trust that the Government will exercise every discretion and precaution in the exercise of this treaty for the benefit of not only the Torres Strait Islanders but also for the people of Papua New Guinea and Australia. </para>

          <para>The Administrative Changes (Consequential Provisions) Bill and the Loan Consolidation and Investment Reserve Amendment Bill make necessary textual changes in legislation following the administrative changes of 20 December 1977, and write into the statute book the deemed&#39; changes made by the orders under section 19B and 19BA of the Acts Interpretation Act made on and after that date. The Administrative Changes (Consequential Provisions) Bill makes the principal changes and the Loan Consolidation and Investment Reserve Amendment Bill makes some associated provisions which were found necessary in consequence of the changes in the administration of the Audit Act. The Acts Interpretation Amendment Bill plugs a small gap found in the provisions inserted in the Acts Interpretation Act in 1976 to facilitate translation of references to Ministers following administrative changes. </para>
          <para>The schedules to the Administrative Changes (Consequential Provisions) Bill specify some 550 separate amendments of some 180 Acts which need to be made because of the ministerial and departmental changes made following the election last year. It is important that these changes be made so that the proper references will appear on the face of the respective Acts and will not be merely left to follow from a general &#39;translation&#39; provision in orders under the Acts Interpretation Act. </para>
          <para>With a few minor exceptions, the amendments made by the Bill and its schedules merely give effect to the orders that were made under the Acts Interpretation Act or make associated amendments which were not able to be made by such orders, for example, renaming the body corporate established by section 62B(2) of the Audit Act. In one or two cases other minor administrative changes that have been agreed as desirable have been made; for example, in the case of the Criminology Research Act, the reference to the Treasurer in one provision, section 28 (4), has been changed to a reference to the Attorney-General. </para>
          <para>The Bill provides for a number of saving provisions that are necessary because of the change from Treasurer to Minister for Finance, particularly in the Audit Act and in regulations and directions under that Act. Because of the extensive ramifications of the Audit Act and those regulations and directions throughout the whole fabric of the control of finances, it is vital that these saving provisions be made. Clause 7 of the Bill makes a necessary saving in relation to payments and other actions by the Treasurer before 20 December 1977 in respect of statutory corporations that need to be treated, after that date, as having been made by the Minister for Finance. </para>
          <para>The Bill makes provision in clause 8 for the various orders under the Acts Interpretation Act to which the changes made by the Bill relate to cease to apply except in relation to regulations or directions. The reason for this is that all the amendments of Acts that are necessary should have been identified and dealt with in the schedules of the Bill. All Departments have been consulted to ensure this. However, there could be some provisions of regulations or directions that have not yet been identified and these will need to be dealt with by amending regulations or directions when they are identified. </para>
          <para>The December order under section 19BA of the Acts Interpretation Act and the confirming changes now being made to section 62B of the Audit Act by the Administrative Changes (Consequential Provisions) Bill would, if no special provision were made, have the effect of transferring power of investment of moneys standing to the credit of the reserve from the Treasurer to the Minister for Finance. The Loan Consolidation and Investment Reserve Amendment Bill makes such special provision. It proposes to ensure that the Treasurer will continue to have full responsibility for the reserve, and to that end provides specific investment powers for the Treasurer and creates a separate corporation, consisting of the Treasurer and his successors. The Minister for Finance will, however, continue to be able to invest in treasury bills moneys of the reserve that are not required by the Treasurer for investment or other purposes. By virtue of the Bill, the reserve will cease to be a trust account under section 62A of the Audit Act, but will remain part of the trust fund. The Bill includes some necessary saving&#39; and machinery provisions, including a power of delegation by the Treasurer in respect of his powers under section 6- investment of the reserve- corresponding with the power to delegate already given to the Minister for Finance by section 70 A of the Audit Act. </para>
          <para>The provisions made by the several Bills I am sure will commend themselves to honourable senators. As I have indicated, they are of a machinery nature and will up-date the statute book. I commend the Bills to the Senate. </para>

          <para class="block">These three Bills constitute a &#39;set&#39; to deal with a situation that has arisen because there have been occasions when copies of regulations and other statutory rules and ordinances of the Australian Capital Territory have not been available for purchase at the place specified in the notice in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> of the making of the ordinances or statutory rules, at the time the notice was published. </para>
          <para>The validity of such notices in these circumstances has been raised in proceedings in the High Court in respect of alleged offences against the Banking (Foreign Exchange) Regulations and the purpose of the Ordinances and Regulations (Notification) Bill is to remove the possibility of invalidity flowing from the unavailability of copies. In the particular case, the offences in question occurred more than a year after copies were, in fact, available. The point in that case is, consequently, a technical one, and the Government is greatly concerned about the effect of its success. If successful a whole range of regulations and ordinances would be struck down. However, the Bill expressly provides that the validation it provides for is not to affect existing prosecutions under the Banking (Foreign Exchange) Regulations, thus excluding the High Court proceedings referred to from the scope of the Bill. Those regulations will nevertheless be validated for the future so that in any new proceedings the technical point will not be available as a possible defence. </para>

          <para>The combined effect of the two latter Bills will be to ensure for the future, so far as is practicable, that copies are available for purchase at the time of notification, whilst recognising that special cases will arise where subordinate legislation has to be made to have immediate operation, notwithstanding that copies are not immediately available for purchase. The Bills ensure that Parliament will be informed of cases where copies are not available on the date of notification and of the reason for this. </para>
          <para>Honourable senators will appreciate that the provisions made by the Bills in relation to the future position will be more satisfactory than the existing position. A positive direction to have copies available at the time of notification is provided for, supported by a requirement to explain any failure to do so to the Parliament. At the same time, the validity of subordinate legislation will not be in jeopardy on a technical ground. I believe the provisions now before the Senate will result in the best practical solution to the difficulties that have arisen. I commend the Bills to the Senate. </para>

          <para class="block">Excise  Tariff Amendment  Bill 1978 </para>
          <para>The purpose of the Bill now before the Senate is to enact the excise tariff alteration introduced into the Parliament on 22 February 1978 by Excise Tariff Proposal No. 1. The alteration, which has effect from 18 November 1977, restructures item 1 7b of the excise tariff to clarify the duty liability in relation to condensate included in the Government&#39;s crude oil absorption scheme. </para>
          <para>Prior to the alteration, some producers of condensate in remote locations had interpreted the excise tariff as excluding such condensate from duty under item 1 7b. This interpretation is contrary to the Government&#39;s policy in relation to the absorption of indigenous crude oil and condensate and the resultant liability for excise duty. </para>
          <para>The overall effect of the alteration, and of the crude oil absorption policy in relation to condensate, is beneficial to producers of the condensate and to small inland refineries which process the condensate. Producers receive import parity price for their product and refiners can obtain feedstock at the average Australian price for indigenous crude oil. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </para>

          <para class="block">I present Supply Bill (No. 1) 1978-79. This Bill, together with the companion Bill, Supply Bill (No. 2) 1978-79, seeks interim appropriations for the services of the Government for the period 1 July 1 978 to 30 November 1 978, by which date it is expected that the Appropriation Bills forming part of the 1978-79 Budget will have been enacted. </para>
          <para>Supply Bill (No. 1) seeks appropriations totalling approximately $3, 844m for the ordinary annual services of the Government. This is $332m or 9 per cent greater than the amounts provided in Supply Act (No. 1) 1977-78 and, taking both Bills together, the increase over the last year is $ 1 79m or approximately 4 per cent. I wish to emphasise that the Supply Bills are not to be interpreted as in any way anticipating what amounts might be included for any particular service in the 1978-79 Budget. The provisions in these Bills are based wholly on current expenditure levels and have no regard whatever to policy decisions to be taken in the context of next year&#39;s Budget. When the Budget is passed the appropriations in the Bill will be subsumed by the appropriations in the Appropriation Act (No. 1) 1978-79. The Bill includes $100m for the advance to the Minister for Finance, which is the same amount as the provision in the Supply Act (No. 1) 1977-78.I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </para>

            <para>- I should like to continue the remarks I was making last evening when the Senate was debating these Bills. These three Bills are a part of the package of Bills that the Government has brought before us to enable uranium mining in the Northern Territory to proceed. The Opposition is, of course, opposed to uranium mining. We have not been successful in our opposition to the Atomic Energy Amendment Bill which in fact permits uranium mining to proceed. However, we continue our opposition to the three Bills before us now because, although they pur.poit to provide machinery and measures whereby the environmental and hazardous effects of uranium mining can be controlled and regulated, we find that the provisions are not satisfactory. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In particular I will address my remarks to the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Amendment Bill 1978. The Opposition cannot support this Bill in its present form. We genuinely support the concept of the Kakadu National Park. We genuinely want this unique, exotic and highly significant region- part of which is to become Aboriginal land- to be protected from despoilation. But we strongly oppose any and all uranium mining within the catchment area of the Alligator Rivers Region within the Kakadu National Park. Of course, the Bill - </para>

              <para>
                <inline font-weight="bold">- Senator Baume</inline>seems to be confused about the nature of our opposition. The Opposition supports the declaration of the Kakadu National Park. It cannot accept the concept, as embodied in this legislation, of a national park which will have three uranium mines within it. In chapter 5 of the second Fox report, the known and unknown dangers of mining to the region are discussed. It is evident from that discussion that there can be no guarantees of containing the effects of mining within the region to the mining lease areas. The whole ecosystem of the Kakadu National Park will be vulnerable to destruction from the three mining leases which are permitted to proceed within the National Park area. The Bill excludes three mining sites from the declared park area, even though they are physically within the area. They are the Ranger, the Pancontinental and the Noranda leases. It is the view of the Oppositionindeed, it was the view of the Ranger inquirythat mining of this kind within the National Park area will detrimentally affect the entire parkland area. There will be pollution of the waterways. There will be contamination of the air. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I draw the attention of the Senate to one particular consequence of uranium mining in the area- the production of radon gas. My colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Melzer</inline> in an earlier debate on uranium spelt out in great detail the nature of radon gas and its disastrous consequences in all sorts of ways. In an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> on 9 May this year <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Mark</inline> Oliphant gave his expert view on the nature of radon gas, and said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Rich uranium ores contain a gram or more of the daughter substance of the slow radioactive decay of uranium, radium, together with all the subsequent radioactive substances it produces, including the gas radon. </para>
            <para>Radon is one of the rare gases, without chemical properties, and the only way to remove it from the environment is to freeze it out with a coolant like liquid air. The radon itself undergoes  sponstaneous  radioactive decay into a series of substances, themselves radioactive, ending up finally as ordinary lead. </para>
            <para>Radon will be released into the air from the ore as it is mined, crushed, and dissolved in acid, while the other radioactive products of the radium series, being solid, will bc present in any dust. All, in sufficient quantity, are potentially lethal. Oust masks should give reasonable protection against the solids, but cannot remove the radon . . . </para>
            <para>As with asbestosis, the effects of these low doses of radiation, which can be well below the officially prescribed limit, can be delayed for decades. There is now growing evidence in the United States, as told to the Congressional inquiry in February last, that those who have been in contact with uranium, for instance in mining, in reactor operation, and in the maintenance of nuclear reactors for submarine propulsion, may develop  leukemias  and other forms of cancer, 20-30 years after initial exposure. </para>

          <para>Radon is the gas that will be released into the environment of the Kakadu National Park when mining proceeds on these three leases. We have a further objection to the legislation that is before us with regard to the Kakadu National Park. We object to the existence of two privately owned leases- Gimbat and Goodparla- within the region. The existence of these pastoral leases poses a further threat to the environment of the National Park, for reasons which will be evident to the Senate and which have been discussed in detail in the Fox report. We urge the Government to follow the Fox report&#39;s recommendations on these leases, that is, that the Government should acquire the leases and add them to the proposed National Park. </para>
          <para>The Bill is further inadequate in the provisions for consulting with and recognising the wishes of the Aboriginals in this area. I remind the Senate that the declaration of the park became possible only after the Northern Territory Aboriginal Land Council let it be known to the Ranger inquiry that local Aboriginals would agree to Aboriginal land becoming part of the national park. I believe- and the Opposition believes- that the Aboriginals in that area are entitled to better protection of their interests than is provided for in this Bill. Certain provisions in this Bill override the provisions of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act and we believe that that is a breaking of faith with the Aboriginal communities in this area which have gone to so much trouble and have been so co-operative as to agree to have certain parts of Aboriginal land incorporated in the national park. </para>
          <para>In summary, the Opposition cannot support the Bill in its present form. We are very anxious to see the declaration of a national park; that is, one free of uranium mining. We do not oppose the Bill in its entirety. However, on behalf of the Opposition, to the motion that the Bill be now read a second time, I move: </para>

            </list>
          </motion>
          <para class="block">I proceed now to the third of this series of Bills which the Senate is now debating and that is the Bill relating to the enforcement by the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory of Australia of certain provisions for the protection of the environment in the Alligator Rivers region. The purpose of this Bill is to confer jurisdiction within the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory in relation to the enforcement of the requirements for the protection of the environment in this area. The Opposition cannot support this Bill. We do support the principle that a jurisdiction should be established in relation to the enforcement of certain legal requirements for the protection of the environment in the Alligator Rivers region, but we do not agree that this jurisdiction should be in the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory. It is the view of the Opposition that jurisdiction for this enforcement should be in the Federal Court of Australia. Similarly, it is our view that the Environment Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill should be in jurisdiction of the Federal Court of Australia, and one of my colleagues will explain our position on that at a later stage. Our reason for wishing the Federal Court and not the Northern Territory Supreme Court to have jurisdiction over these matters is that uranium is a national issue and the regulation and control of it should be a matter of national responsibility. It is not simply a territorial matter or a State matter. It is a national matter. The legislation enabling uranium mining to proceed is a matter for the national Parliament. So we believe that the matter of jurisdiction, of enforcement of regulatory procedures should also be a federal responsibility and a matter for the Federal Court. In our view the same laws and the same interpretation of those laws regarding the regulation and control of uranium mining should apply throughout Australia. Putting the jurisdiction, as this legislation does, in a territorial court is a failure on the part of the Federal Government to accept federal responsibility in this matter. </para>
          <para>A further specific objection to the Bill is this: Access to the court which will have jurisdiction in this matter is too restrictive. It is restrictive in fact to two people- the Director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the  Chairman  of the Northern Land Council. Of course, both of these people should have access. We do not query that, but all other people and groups are denied access and in the view of the Opposition this is wrong. The Land Council itself finds it wrong and has communicated this view to us. The Bill as it is currently worded provides that the  Chairman  of the Land Council and the Director of the Wildlife Service will have entire responsibility for taking action when there have been any breaches of the regulatory procedures. A whole new body of uranium law is being developed at this time. </para>
          <para>The Opposition of course is very unhappy about the nature of that law; nonetheless we recognise the reality that this law is being developed to control this highly hazardous industry. Yet individual members of the public or concerned groups will have no access to this law. In our view there should be a single federal court with access for all concerned citizens to deal with breaches of the law relating to uranium. The Bill does not provide this, so the Opposition will oppose the motion that the Bill be read a second time. </para>

            <para>- I support the Bill. I also support the amendments which I understand the Government will be putting forward at a later stage. We have a number of amendments. I certainly reject the amendment that has been moved by the Opposition. When the legislation was first drafted I certainly had my doubts about the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Amendment Bill because very little regard had been paid to the role of the Territory Parks and Wildlife Commission. In fact, there was no mention of this body in the Bill at all. I now notice that it is the intention of the Government to repair what I believe to be an oversight and that is that the Commission will be involved in the day-to-day management of the Kakadu National Park and that consultations will be carried out on a regular basis between the Director of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Northern Territory people. I think this is highly desirable. I also was very pleased when the Government appointed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bob</inline> Fry as the supervising scientist. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I have had the opportunity together with members of the Standing Committee on Science and the Environment to discuss his role as he sees it in the supervision of this very important national park area. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bob</inline> Fry, I believe, is well qualified to oversee environmental matters associated with the park and certainly with the mining that hopefully will be taking place in the near future. He was educated at the same school as I was- the Unley High School. I know the gentleman personally and I can vouch for his integrity and his capacity to be able to deal with environmental matters associated with the Bills under discussion. He has been very prominent in the Australian Atomic Energy Commission at Lucas Heights. He was a senior officer there. He has chaired many international committees involved with safety management and technology associated with the nuclear industry. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fry</inline>spent quite a long period of time in the United States of America where he worked in the radiological department of a prominent hospital. He is well informed on matters relating to possible hazards to human beings in this important area of energy development. I congratulate the Minister on choosing a man of the calibre of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fry. His</inline> department already has a laboratory in the Ranger area and the Bill itself provides for the establishment of an Office of Supervising Scientist and a Scientific Research Institute. From what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fry</inline> has told me they will be comprehensive and will comprise personnel who will be very capable of dealing with matters and safeguarding the environment in the Kakadu National Park region. </para>
          <para>I was very impressed when I visited the Lucas Heights establishment of the Atomic Energy Commission to learn that the Commission itself has been studying the environment of the Kakadu area over a period of years and certainly recognises the fragility of the environment, particularly in the wet season when the floods can occur. Certainly the Commission is very conscious of the need for proper management as far as the mining companies are concerned to ensure that pollution will not result from future mining operations that have been proposed. </para>
          <para>The previous <inline font-weight="bold">speaker, Senator Ryan,</inline> referred to the emission of radon resulting from the mining of uranium. It always amazes me that people tend to over-react in this situation because radon itself dissipates very rapidly in the environment and remains for only a very short period of time. The radon liberated during coal mining and superphosphate mining, for example, is far in excess of the quantity of radon that is liberated as a result of uranium mining. But we do not seem to worry too much about that. We seem to accept that as being OK. However, as soon as someone mentions nuclear energy the Opposition and the opponents of this bridging source of energy tend to become very emotional about it. They disregard other hazards associated with conventional mining. That ought to be borne in mind when we are discussing this subject. </para>
          <para>I said earlier that the Government was proposing amendments. These will largely satisfy my original objections to the Bill. However, in the future it may be necessary for the Government to re-examine the Bill itself. Should there be any problems associated with the joint management program in this area I am sure that the Government will recognise the need to introduce future amendments if necessary. I was reading a book the other day on the question of nuclear energy. </para>
          <para class="block">It was written by Petr Beckmann. It is entitled The Hazards of Not Going Nuclear&#39;. I found some of the points made quite interesting. </para>

            <para>Plutonium is often called the most toxic substance known to man. </para>
            <para>Plutonium is toxic, and must be handled with care, but the rest is just horror propaganda. It is primarily an alpha emitter, which means that its radiation is absorbed in the air after a few inches, and a sheet of paper is sufficient to shield oneself against its radiation at close quarters. It is far from being the most toxic substance known to man. When eaten or absorbed in the bloodstream, it is 10 times less toxic than lead arsenate and hundreds of thousands of times less toxic than some biological poisons such as diptheria of botulism toxin. Caffeine is only 10 times less toxic than plutonium. Relative toxicity is measured by comparing the weights of 50 <inline font-style="italic">per</inline> cent lethal doses given to the same type of mammal. The  50 per cent lethal dose &#39; is the amount that will kill half of the experimental animals. </para>
            <para>However, though ingestion of plutonium or its absorption through the skin is dangerous, the real danger of plutonium is breathing it in the form of fine dust particles. Plutonium is insoluble in water, and fine particles may stay long in the lung, eventually causing lung cancer. Even so, this danger, which undoubtedly is a serious one, has been exaggerated beyond all reasonable bounds. There are radioactive substances produced not by the Pentagon, but by Mother Nature, which are far more dangerous than plutonium. </para>

            <para>- I have a great deal of pleasure in supporting the amendment proposed by my colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ryan.</inline> I do so because I believe that this Bill is lacking in National Park and environment protection. I noticed that the Minister for Education <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick)</inline> in his second reading speech referred to the vision of the Kakadu National Park. In the past conservation always seemed to play second fiddle to so many other interests. In the second Fox Report <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Fox said that national park demands had equal rights with mining and pastoral needs. If the vision splendid envisaged in the second reading speech becomes a reality I shall be quite happy. However, in the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> of 17 May Paul Phillips, the Executive Director of the Australian Mining Council, said that national parks ought to be opened up to mining. I know that three areas of the Kakadu National Park have been excluded as potential uranium sites. Unless I am mistaken and unless the amendments to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> referred are specific, as a conservationist I cannot see that our national parks will be as well protected as those in the United States of America. </para>

            <para>Interior Committee: </para>
            <para>CONSERVATIONISTS WIN ALASKA WILDERNESS VOTE </para>
            <para>The House Interior Committee March 8 defeated a move to reduce by more than half the Alaska acreage proposed for protection as wilderness. </para>
            <para>The 20-24 vote was a key victory for conservationists. But it followed their tactical sacrifice of the 2.4 million acre Misty Fjords area in the Tongass National Forest from the proposed wilderness. Mining, exploration and development of oil and gas reserves and logging are barred in wilderness areas. </para>
            <para>Conservationists on the committee are expected to make another sacrifice when markup of the bill (HR 39) resumes March 14- evidence that development interests are continuing to chip away at the conservationist position. However, developers have been defeated on most major votes. <inline font-style="italic">(Background, Weekly Report</inline> page 377). </para>
            <para>The next confrontation will be over how much area to designate as wilderness in the existing Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, an 8.85 million acre tract in northeast Alaska. The refuge, called a range because it is vast and harbors diverse wildlife, has been pegged as the possible depository of from 6 to 20 billion barrels of oil and possibly 1 1 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. </para>
            <para class="block">Plan to Cut Wilderness </para>
            <para>The proposal to cut the Alaska acreage proposed for wilderness designation was offered by Lloyd Meeds, D-Wash. It would have put only 33 million acres from the entire state in the wilderness classification. The Interior Alaska Lands Subcommittee voted to place about 73 million acres in wilderness. </para>
            <para>Lobbyists for oil and gas interests, mining companies and labor groups had rallied behind the Meeds proposal, a lobbying combination conservationists and even the Carter administration found difficult to counter. </para>
            <para>At one point in the debate. Interior Chairman Morris K. Udall, D-Ariz., sought to clear up an argument used by Meeds&#39; supporters that logging jobs would be lost if large areas were designated as wilderness. </para>
            <para>A lot of my friends are being misled &#39;, Udall told the committee. &#39;They&#39;re being lobbied by labor unions, lobbied by timber companies ... I don&#39;t want to see them join the wrecking crew on this. The people who don &#39;t want any bill are using the labor unions to act as a battering ram for them&#39;. </para>
            <para>Instead of voting for the Meeds proposal, which would affect wilderness designation throughout Alaska, those concerned about timber-related jobs in the southeast should support a more narrowly focused amendment, Udall said. </para>
            <para>Misty Fjords. The amendment to delete Misty Fjords from wilderness classification, offered by Bob Eckhardt DTexas, apparently served that purpose for some members. It quieted the argument that jobs would be lost. </para>
            <para>Eckhardt used Forest Service figures to show that adequate timber would be available from non-wilderness national forest lands to keep timber production in southeast Alaska at existing levels with room for growth. </para>
            <para>The amendment was passed 8 March on a 27-15 vote. It deleted nearly 2.5 million acres of proposed wilderness area. </para>
            <para>These deletions will assure that not a timber-related job will be lost in southeastern Alaska as a result of this legislation &#39;, Eckhardt said. </para>
            <para>Conservation v Energy Development </para>
            <para>The anticipated fight over designation of wilderness in the possibly oil-rich Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is perhaps the best example in the Alaska lands legislation of the conflict between the natural value of land and its potential for development. </para>
            <para>Sources predicted that a &#39;sacrifice &#39; amendment likely to be offered by conservationists would make it easier for the federal government, and possibly private developers, to find out more about oil and gas reserves in the Arctic range- the first step toward development of the resources. </para>
            <para>Wilderness designation for the range is supported by the administration and the Interior subcommittee. </para>
            <para>The range is a calving ground for Alaska &#39;s healthiest caribou herd, a key stopping point for millions of migrating birds and a home for some 31 species of wildlife. The administration reasoned that those factors outweighed the immediate need for the oil and gas.  President  Carter himself was involved in the decision, which pitted the Interior Department against the Energy Department. </para>
            <para>If in fact the area does have high oil and gas potential, then we are saying to you, let it be the last place that America develops if we need it&#39;, Interior Secretary Cecil D. Andrus told the committee in fall 1 977. </para>
            <para>As another administration official put it, &#39;The oil won &#39;t go away. The best place for it now is the ground &#39;. </para>
            <para>Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, and others want better access to the Arctic range for oil and gas interests and plan amendments to open it up. -By Ann Pelham </para>

              <para>- I want to prove that in the debates between the developmentalists and the conservationists in the United States the real argument has been whether certain areas in Alaska will be defined as wilderness areas. The United States Secretary of State went on record as saying that at present the United States appears to be deficient in petroleum and natural gas resources but the last place in which exploration would occur would be these wilderness areas. My fear is that even if we placate the mining interests with the three suggested uranium mining sites that will not be the end of it. I know of the dedication in the Territory Parks and Wildlife Commissions and its Federal counterpart but management plans have to be produced. If we let mining interests carry out a little more prospecting they will come back with an exciting vision of more minerals. The temptation will build up. There will be all sorts of suggestions about mining just one more little area. I came into the Senate in 1 966. 1 can recall asking <inline font-weight="bold">Senator John</inline> Gorton a question on 20 April 1966 about a brochure prepared on the proposed national park in the Northern Territory.

          <para>The Northern Territory Reserves Board administers National Parks in the Territory. There are not many. Briefly, the following is what happened on and from 6 April, April when the Board proposed to the Commonwealth Government the establishment of a national park of 2,473 square miles. The area originally proposed is shown on map &#39;A&#39;. </para>
          <para class="block">1965 </para>
          <para>The Board wrote to the Administrator of the Northern Territory seeking his approval, in principle, to the dedication of a large area of land as a National Park. In addition, the Board asked that consideration be given to extending the area to include the Woolwonga Wildlife Sanctuary, Mudginberri Station and the part of Munmarlary Station east of the South Alligator River. </para>
          <para>The total area, including Woolwonga, Mudginberri and Munmarlary, was about 2,475 square miles. At this stage no pastoral leases had been granted over Mudginberri or Munmarlary. </para>
          <para>The Board stated that it was &#39;anxious to acquire a large tract of country in the northern portion of the Northern Territory whilst it is still available, so that it could be developed as a National Park for the enjoyment of the public and preservation of its natural features.  20 April 1966 </para>
          <para>In the Senate, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gorton,</inline> representing the Minister for Territories, replying to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill,</inline> stated: </para>

              <para>-John Grey Gorton and I shared a vision but I did not think that we would have to wait until 1978 before the park was declared. There were several efforts to declare the park region. When the present Minister for Health, Ralph Hunt, was Minister for the Interior, the pastoral interests and the mineral interests were told to look at alternatives. Surely if a national park is created it should be there for evermore. It should be off limits to any mining whatsoever. When I say that people say that I am against any development. I say that that is not so. </para>

          <para>A classic illustration of this is an event which occurred in my State of New South Wales some years ago when it was alleged that a deficiency in limestone resources existed. The then Premier, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Askin,</inline> said to the conservationists and people such as myself: &#39;You will sound the death knell of the cement industry in New South Wales &#39;. Of course, he was wrong. When the conservationists remained solid the Colong Caves were protected and other limestone sources were found. The result was that we had our cake and were able to eat it as well. </para>
          <para>In this respect, dealing with mining, I find myself with an unusual ally in <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Court. Recently he preceded me to Japan. Speaking as a member of an Australian Labor Party delegation to Japan, I told the people there my views. They said: &#39;That means that we will never have access to uranium&#39;. Then I saw a smile and one chap said: &#39;Of course, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Court has an alternative. He said you can extract your uranium from desolate regions of Western Australia and you will not get involved with the conservationists who want to protect the Alligator Rivers system &#39;. It is a case of where there is a will there is a way. This is so even from the Government angle. </para>
          <para>I shall await with interest the reply by the Minister for Education to see whether he will be able to give me an iron clad assurance that if the Government has its way with the three mining enclaves it will not in either phase 1 or phase 2 of the project mine in areas which will destroy the concept of a national park but that it will be influenced to emulate the feelings which prevail in the United States of America. As will be seen in the extract which I have incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> even the developmentalists do not say that they will mine anywhere in Alaska. The developmentalists in that situation are prepared  to retain 33 million acres of land in a wilderness state, while the conservationists want 73 million acres of such an area so preserved. This wilderness area contains caribou and a host of other animals. I think it contains about 1 10 different types of birds. I fear that, whatever assurances we get in respect of the Kakadu National Park, these mining vultures will go up into the Cobourg Peninsula and will want to commit their degradations there. </para>
          <para>I say, as a person who has always been in the centre of the political spectrum in his Party that I know that the Government talks about compromise, but nowhere does it state that, irrespective of the management procedures of a national park, a certain area will be off limits. I have never heard either the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Groom)</inline> or the Minister for the Northern Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Adermann)</inline> echo the sentiments of the present United States Secretary of the Interior, who has said that, whatever America&#39;s fuel demands might be, wildlife refuges will not be mined. Such an undertaking does not appear in this legislation. Even the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> castigated a mining spokesman who put forward opposing views. </para>
          <para>On one memorable occasion, when the Minister for Education took carriage of legislation dealing with the environment he indicated to me- I accepted it in good faith- that the national view on the custody of the Kakadu National Park would prevail. I said: &#39;You will have deadlocks on the way&#39;. I think that at that time the present Minister for National Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Newman)</inline> was Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Adermann</inline> was the Minister for the Northern Territory. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> said then that those Ministers would be the supreme arbitrators. I thought that that was all right. </para>
          <para>History has caught up with us. The Northern Territory virtually has statehood. I do not want to have a shot at the honourable senator from the Northern Territory who probably will follow me in this debate. I shall give an analogy. During the Kennedy era, the United States had a problem about the rights of negroes to enter universities in the southern states. If the United States Attorney-General Kennedy had not put the federal marshals into Alabama, they would never have moved. I feel that unless we have Federal control we will have people in the Northern Territory who are beholden to mining interests making decisions. The demands- the appetite- of mining interests are insatiable. Will the people in the Northern Territory be strong enough to say No&#39;? </para>
          <para>This brings me to another point, to which I am surprised <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> did not refer. We know that there has to be constant vigilance from the national capital. I say this because constant efforts have been made by US Army engineers to meddle with the Florida Everglades. I refer to the United States Army reclamation engineers. They had ideas which would affect the water levels of Florida. It was only with Washington &#39;s supervision and that of the Senate Committee that these engineers were made to pull their horns in a little. </para>
          <para>I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> on reflection will nod his head on what I have to say now. We talk about co-ordinating committees to watch over proceedings in the Northern Territory. With <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop,</inline> I was delighted to meet the officer designated the &#39;Chief Scientist&#39;. He has to rely on the loyalty and support of a number of departments. I know that the fateful day will come possibly in three years when someone has to open a valve and release waste water into the Alligator Rivers system. I know that the theory is that if it is done when there is heavy rainfallflash flooding- the system will be perfect. I seek leave to incorporate in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> pages 2 and 3 of what was known in parliamentary Labor circles as the &#39;Mulvihill-Lamb F.P.L.P. report&#39;. Tony Lamb, the former Member for La Trobe, and I went to the Northern Territory with <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Patterson.</inline> In this report I quoted extracts from a paper on water surveys which, among other things, stated: </para>

            <para>It was also claimed that the Magela Creek System to which in extreme cases mine water waste might enter was not a continuous link across the plain to the major rivers. Nevertheless several questions on the holding pond and the size of the actual mine shaft by my colleague Representative Lamb  did indicate  that  more positive details were needed on monitoring methods in the Magela Creek and that the Department of the Northern Territory must have ready access to such readings which must  be  taken frequently. In any case even if the Magela Creek System does provide a buffer area to combat possible water pollution it is doubtful if the Noranda project can claim the same defences. It is quite apparent that your Committee will need detailed consultation with the Minister for the Northern Territory on the acute dangers that exist in polluting the Alligator River Systems. The concern of your Committee in this direction is well and truly vindicated in the following extract taken from the recently released Alligator Rivers Study Part 6 (IV. Drainage Tracts) 6-10: </para>

            <para>The quality of water and the sediments carried by it are determined by the source of the water. If it has percolated through rock masses before emerging as springs it is likely to be harder and depending on what rock it has infiltrated it may bc relatively high in heavy metals and in radioactivity. </para>
            <para>If it has entered the stream as direct run-off from the land surface it is more likely to be soft, low in heavy metals and low in radioactivity, unless it has passed directly over a radioactive deposit. </para>
            <para>In the wet season the waters of most streams are soft, slightly acid and poorly buffered, low in heavy metals, and low in radioactivity. </para>
            <para>When stream flows decrease after the wet season, the local contributions from springs and seepages become proportionately greater and their influence on the chemical constituents and radioactivity of the water may be considerable. </para>
            <para>Heavy metal and radioactive elements are carried downstream either in solution or absorbed on suspended solids. The fate of these, and the manner and extent to which man and other biota in the environment may be subjected to them are important matters on which some information has been sought. This information will assist in predicting the fate of any waste materials which may be added to the drainage system, and in estimating how much material could be added without serious damage to man or other biota &#39;. </para>
            <para>The Committee gained the impression from discussions with the mine operators that the Bureau of Mineral ReSources can play a vital role in determining areas in which mineral exploration can be intensified. </para>
            <para>In view of the recent NSW Coolong limestone deposit dispute it is thought desirable that the Bureau of Mineral Resources might seek to encourage uranium exploration in more arid regions of the Territory where conservation conflicts would be at a minimum. </para>
            <para>In setting conditions for mining operations it is essential to remember that the mining companies benefit greatly from knowing the exact conditions under which they can operate. In setting effective anti-pollution safeguards not only is the environment protected but mining companies immediately know the standards which they must maintain and will know if and when they can operate so removing speculation from their acitivities. It is essential that mining companies can move in a predictable environment in which to make decisions and that governments do not leave them (up in the air) as to their rights and obligations. </para>

With the principle accepted in the 1 973 Budget of Conservation Minister Cass having funds available for disbursement for the procurement of additional land for conservation purposes one of the early recipents should be the Northern Territory Reserves Board or the new authority which may supersede it. </para>

              <para>- This brings me back to what I said to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop.</inline> We are going to have a form of co-ordinating committee. The Chief Scientist will have to rely on the loyalty, the dedication and the sense of fair play of people within an organisation which might be called the Northern Territory resources bureau or something equivalent. He will have to get all the data together. He will be guided in a decision to open the valve and let water flow into the Alligator Rivers system. I do not think that I would be breaking confidences if I were to say that, as an extremely dedicated and competent officer, he <inline font-style="italic">will be more</inline> or less sailing in uncharted seas. He will have to evaluate the information and make those sorts of decisions. In point of fact, I think that the report of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry recommended that water impurities be not released for three years. I think that it was a good characteristic of the Chief Scientist that he favoured five years. We are finding that all of the three mining companies in the queue want to get into the act. The big danger that arises is that the river system will be burdened with outflows of impurities. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>In the chain of command- the co-ordinating committee- about which we are talking I would like to see the inclusion of a representative of the Senate Standing Committee on Social Environment. I know that, since we started agitating, the Government has had to throw out crumbs to certain Northern Territory semi-State instrumentalities. I know that there are officers in the Territory Parks and Wildlife Commission who were in equivalent Public Service positions in Sydney and that there is no question about their dedication. But we are all subject to pressures, large and small. </para>
          <para>I would like to believe that an unfettered watchdog from this Senate was a member of that co-ordinating committee. Then, if he felt that a  big rort was being perpetrated he could come into this chamber and tell all. I mean that. Some queer happenings occurred in Florida with the United States Army reclamation people. They thought they were doing the right thing. They lowered the water levels through certain channels and created havoc for the reptiles and other inhabitants of the Florida Everglades. These are the fears I have, I believe that we have not had the clear-cut responses that we should have had to some of the documentation to which I have referred. The question of Aboriginal land rights extends beyond the concept of the Kakadu National Park, phases one and two. There is the question of the use of the Cobourg Peninsula which, I know is bound up with the question of the ultimate control of Aboriginal land rights. I know of nothing to cause me to question the suggestion that the Aborigines will more or less lease the land back in the national park concept. But I do have certain fears. </para>
          <para>The State national park services are often under seige about local rules, interpretations and exemptions. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick,</inline> as a New South Welshman, would know that there has been a form of guerrilla warfare concerning the right of graziers to graze cattle on the lower reaches of the Kosciusko National Park. Occasionally they have wanted access to the higher areas. Whenever they have done so the Labor or Liberal Minister for Conservation or Lands in New South Wales has found that the graziers have the local member on side. Often the local member has led the agitation, citing the United Nations Bill of Rights, when in fact it is only a thinly veiled attempt to cause erosion. I do not want to see that sort of situation occur in the Cobourg Peninsula area. I return to my original criticism. While mining interests have the right to go to the mining warden in Darwin and get the green light to mine they will succumb to the temptation. At a given time they will say to the Government: Look, we can give you $Xm in royalties and you will be able to keep the masses in Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide quiet by providing better social services and other things&#39;. I do not think that is the right way to do it. I believe that the bulk of Australians do not want to see it done that way. That is why I have these distinct reservations. That is why I believe the amendment put forward by the Opposition is an apt one. </para>
          <para>Part (b) of the amendment put forward by my illustrious colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ryan,</inline> deals with the two pastoral leases that were mentioned. Again, I am not happy with the answers that I have received at Estimates committee hearings. I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Gunn is short of dollars. I am amazed that we do not jump at the opportunity and buy those pastoral leases. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Fox says that national park needs are on a par with mining and pastoral needs, I cannot see how we have had a real victory. I have coined the term &#39;a national park pock-marked with mining excavations&#39; to describe the area. Government supporters can say to me that mining operations will not leave the disfiguring marks that, perhaps, open-cut coal mining would leave. I accept the fact that there are some young, highly dedicated scientists on the payrolls of these mining companies. But there has been exploration for uranium outside the national park itself. I can see gaps in the case put forward by the Minister for Education <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick)</inline> in his second reading speech, but I fear most of all the sinister figure of the  Deputy  Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony).</inline> I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> would go in to bat for the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Groom,</inline> in the Cabinet discussions but I know enough about numbers to know what will happen. I have been to a few mining meetings with the  Deputy  Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anthony,</inline> along with my colleague the Honourable Paul Keating, and when I have looked at the audiences I have thought that I did not have many friends there. It is part of the National Country Party&#39;s philosophy to say: &#39;Where there is a head, kick it&#39;. That is a football term to some extent but that is the way in which the National Country Party operates. </para>
          <para>I know that in the general chain of command, the Chief Scientist could go to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Groom</inline> and say: &#39;Look, we are being overloaded with mining operations. I want a couple of years breathing space&#39;, and the Minister could then take the suggestion to Cabinet. He may, in line with what I call the Carrick declaration of several years ago, have summit talks with the Minister for the Northern Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Adermann).</inline> What I fear more than anything else is that at least one of the members of the National Country Party from the Northern Territory will get on the hot line to the  Deputy  Prime Minister and he will take the matter to Cabinet because I have grave doubts about whether the environmentalists in the present Cabinet will have the numbers to bring about the creation of the national park that we really want. I cannot speak too strongly about this matter. I believe that some of the amendments may allay my fears, but at the moment I have been unable to get any clear-cut answers. </para>
          <para>The Northern Territory Reserves Board has had some very fine people as members of it, such as Colonel Rose. In many ways he was a rough diamond but he was a fundamentalist. On reading the last report of the Northern Territory Reserves Board, I noticed that there were many other areas that could be added to the national park. I fear that we lost too much in the mid-1960s as a result of dilly-dallying. We should have established this area as a national park and said to the prospectors: &#39;Outside this area you can go your hardest. Once you come up with particular mining finds, subject to environmental impact statements, we could make a deal &#39;. However, at the moment we have mining council spokesman with the philosophy of Paul Phillips who believe that whatever they want they can get. </para>
          <para>There have been interjections from honourable senators from the non-socialist parties in regard to this matter, including one from near where <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> sits. It might have been from one of his Western Australian colleagues. In regard to the earlier legislation they said: What about the effect of mining rights on the farmer on his land?&#39; That is just the point. The Government will be creating a Frankenstein monster if it allows these people into the area free of restrictions. In seconding with the strongest force at my command, the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ryan,</inline> I say that I believe that there are not enough safeguards to make the park what it should be and that would emulate the philosophy that seems to premeate the United States Congress. Even at this late stage I believe that the Government could at least have the  Chairman  of the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment sitting in on the meetings of the proposed committee of Federal and State departments. Alternatively, I would like to believe that the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment could have access to the minutes of this committee in case there is any general difference of opinion. </para>
          <para>I remind those people who believe that the members of the Senate Committee would blab to the newspapers to get a scoop that several years ago six honourable senators- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack</inline> would know about this- had a long conference with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Barbour,</inline> the then chief of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, and nobody blabbed about the meeting. We argued about the emphasis to be placed on what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Barbour</inline> told us but nobody breached any confidence. I emphasise again that I agree with what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> said at the commencement of his second reading speech concerning the vision splendid for Kakadu National Park, but I remain unconvinced that there are safeguards for this or any other national park in comparison with what appears to operate in regard to the wilderness concept in the United States. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- This debate concerns three Bills that are all directly related to and associated with environmental protection. They are three Bills of a package of five Bills, two of which we have dealt with already to some extent. I refer to the AtomicEnergy Amendment Bill and the Environment Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill. Of the five Bills, there are three dealing with environmental matters, each covering specific areas. They are the Environment Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Bill, which is more localised, the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Amendment Bill, which deals with much broader areas but which still deals with conservation and protection of the environment and the Environment Protection (Northern Territory Supreme Court) Bill. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>These Bills to some extent, one could say, are the result of the Ranger Inquiry, because in them many of the major recommendations there propounded have been taken up, to ensure that they will be put into practice. I have heard the Opposition today express concern over many aspects of the proposed legislation, concern with regard to the risks of the environment. I have also heard a lot of criticism from other countries about the strict, rigid terms of the Government&#39;s guidelines for the marketing of uranium. They are probably among the strictest that any country has laid down. We have likewise laid down strong guidelines in these three Bills which, I repeat, deal with the environment. That is a matter which is of extreme concern to the Government. </para>
          <para>I am troubled a little to hear mention of such things as the risk of radon gas. Yes, radon gas is a deadly gas. Centuries ago in some European countries, during mining operations associated with the making of ceramics, a mysterious illness killed a number of miners. Eventually it was found that this was due to the presence of radon gas from underground uranium mining. I emphasise, first, that we are not talking about underground mines. We are talking about opencut mines, and I become weary of the antiuranium lobby which keeps saying that these things are dangerous. The average housewife of this country faces death many times a day. She is only marginally away from death every time she switches on a light. Every time she picks up an iron the insulation on the electrical cord against her arm is the only thing that is between her and death. Steam trains are dangerous. If one keeps stoking them and does not watch the pressures they will blow up. Therefore, one would have to say that steam trains are dangerous. Similarly, radon gas is dangerous. </para>
          <para>I would like to refer to the report of the Windscale inquiry conducted by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Parker in England, a document to which I have referred previously in debates on uranium. For the information of honourable senators, I would note that Windscale was one of the earliest nuclear energy research centres set up in any country. Windscale has a history of practicality and I refer now to the report of a further inquiry that has taken place concerning its activities. On the environmental aspect <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Parker refers at page 33 to the effect of emissions as follows: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The emissions from coal burning stations which were considered when making the statements quoted include sulphur dioxide, carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, carcinogenic hydrocarbons, radioactive and other particulates and heavy metals. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>He goes on to state that: </para>
          <list type="lowerroman-dotted">
            <item label=".">
              <para>. coal, however, carries its own risks which, quite apart from the risks from mining, which might be described as voluntarily accepted by miners, are every bit as much imposed as are the risks from nuclear plants. Indeed, such risks also include risks from radioactive emissions, a fact which is not widely known. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">Again, one hears many criticisms, concerns and fears about plutonium. Let me make it clear that 1 also have a fear of it. We know that it is a natural element required in nuclear explosions. On the other hand, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Parker went to great lengths to discount much of the rumour and fear, that are circulated on this subject amongst the community. He states that it is true: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>That plutonium is a bomb making material. That if plutonium reaches a critical mass there will be a chain reaction . . . </para>
            <para>That in certain circumstances plutonium is very dangerous to man. </para>
            <para>That plutonium, if released into the environment, persists for a very long time. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">But he then states:  lt is not true that plutonium never existed until man man made it. </para>
          <para class="block">He goes into some detail on that aspect and then states further:  lt is not true that plutonium is highly radioactive. It is not true that plutonium has only two uses, making bombs and making electricity commercially. Plutonium 238 is used within the body as the power source for heart pacemakers. </para>
          <para class="block">One cannot get much closer to the nervous system than that, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Acting President. Mr Justice</inline> Parker added: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>It is not true that in all circumstances very small amounts of plutonium are lethal. Insoluble particles when inhaled certainly are hazardous in small quantities. Considerably larger amounts could be eaten without appreciable harm. </para>
            <para>It is not true that plutonium is only safe when protected by massive shielding. As regards shielding from its radiation, it could be sat on safely by a person with no greater protection than, as Professor  Fremlin  put it, &#39;a stout pair of jeans &#39;. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>And so one could go on. Although 1 may be digressing a little, I mention those findings to show how people in a community can be misled. My concern at the moment is that the community can be misled by statements about, as some people would put it, the lack of concern, where it is proposed to mine uranium in the Northern Territory, for the protection of the environment. The Government is doing all that it possibly can, as I said earlier, in regard to marketing by way of its guidelines, and in regard to mining and the protection of the environment generally in the area of the Northern Territory where that mining is to take place. </para>
          <para>I appreciate that that area has a scenic beauty which is unique unto itself and that this must be protected. It has wildlife. It has so much there. It has the Aboriginals, who must also be taken into consideration. All of this is being done by the Government. No doubt, if later it appears that certain aspects of that protection need strengthening or even modifying, that will be done by the Government. Already, subsequent to the passage of these Bills in the other place, the Government has seen fit to introduce amendments to them, demonstrating clearly that it is accepting its responsibilities; that it will continue to do so. </para>
          <para>I mentioned earlier that the major content of these three Bills results from the report of the Fox inquiry, one that took place not over one or two months but over an extremely long period. It was an in-depth inquiry. In fact, there was concern that it was perhaps taking too long, that there was great delay with regard to the overall aspects of the uranium issue. Nevertheless the report finally came out. It has been studied by the Government in depth, and great notice of it has been taken. One can go through these Bills and relate so much of them to the Fox report itself. </para>
          <para>I was very pleased to see, first, that the Government will now give more representation to the Northern Territory legislature. Previously I had been concerned that the Territory, which is rapidly approaching statehood, would not be represented in regard to certain areas. I am glad that the Government has responded to the concern expressed in the Territory and has seen fit to make amendments to the legislation that will result in a greater involvement of that Territory&#39;s legislators. In dealing with the Environment Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Bill, which concerns a local area, we can see very clearly just how much effort is being put into making sure that there will be environmental control and protection; that the Government will even go as far as to make sure that those activities are coordinated </para>

              <para>- I think it is extremely important that the Government has taken this step. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> made an interjection in respect of Aboriginals. The answer to his interjection is that the Government has taken this action. The Government has made sure that not only will it do all it can to protect the environment but also it will enlist the right type of representation from this area to serve on the consultative committee. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Not only has the Government set up a consultative committee with a supervising scientist, to whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> referred this morning when he spoke to this legislation, but also it has gone further and set up a research institute to ensure that the work will not be purely observational but will involve research to make sure that the environment both in the short and long terms will be protected. When I say &#39;protected&#39; I use a capital &#39;P&#39; because this is the aim of the Government in this area. The Government will make sure that there are strict environmental controls and safeguards generally in this region where mining is to take place. Members of that committee will come from areas covering a very broad spectrum. They will come from the mining side of the industry and from the representation side including the Federal Government, Aboriginal bodies and the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. The committee will also include people with specific qualifications. As such it will be able to assess fully and watch closely the environmental impact in this area. This, of course, is related to the research institute. </para>
          <para>The Opposition today criticised certain aspects of the legislation. We heard the same type of thing the other day when we dealt with amendments to the Atomic Energy Act. But one can only say that the members of the Opposition are nit-picking or playing a game of political charades because what they should be doing with their attitude on the mining of uranium is standing up and saying: &#39;We oppose the lot&#39;. But they have not done this. They keep referring to amendments. They have moved an amendment in respect of this legislation. I challenge members of the Opposition- not that I will support their proposed amendment- to say that if we were to accept their amendment they would accept the mining of uranium in Australia. The truth is that they would not. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Melzer</inline> shakes her head and says &#39;no &#39;on behalf of her party. Therefore to me the Opposition&#39;s amendments are a farce. We cannot describe the situation in any other way. Many members of the Opposition are in favour of mining but they are bound by their policy. </para>
          <para>When the vote on the second reading of a previous Bill was taken two members of the Liberal Party crossed the floor and sat on the other side, not because they were opposed to the mining of uranium but because they were concerned about certain aspects within that proposed legislation. We do not see this happening on the other side of the chamber. What we have seen is members of the Opposition proposing certain amendments when in reality and truth they are opposed in totality to the mining of uranium. Why do not members of the Opposition stand up and say that? On top of this last week I received a telex- I presume every other South Australian senator received the same thing- from the  Deputy  Premier of South Australia in which he expressed concern about certain areas of the proposed package of legislation. He said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I ask you to support your State of South Australia and exercise your responsibilities as senator to this end. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Quite frankly I take exception to this telex because it asks us to stand up and oppose some aspects of proposed legislation. This is despite the fact that the Government of South Australia stands publicly and states that it is opposed in totality to the mining and exporting of uranium. </para>
          <para>It is interesting to look at what the actual position is in South Australia. We know that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Dunstan,</inline> the Premier of South Australia, over a number of years had discussions with the previous Whitlam Government. He is having discussions, indirectly through agencies of the State Government, with the current Government on the feasibility of the establishment of an enrichment plant in South Australia. Enrichment is Stage 3 or 4 of the mining of uranium. First one explores for it; if one finds it one then proves it to be an economic mine. Secondly, one mines it. Thirdly, one mills it and processes it. Fourthly, one enriches it. Enriched material will be exported because there is no nuclear reactor in Australia that will require an enrichment plant. Therefore this discussion on the feasibility of the establishment of an enrichment plant is purely for the export of uranium from Australia, in particular from South Australia. Yet that State Government has the audacity to send telexes to State senators of South Australia and also to stand and say that it is opposed to the mining of uranium. </para>
          <para>We are also aware that on top of this the Mines Department in South Australia, an agency of the State Government, directed by the State Government, was a client of Amdel (Aspect) Pollution Consultants in South Australia doing research at South Australian taxpayers &#39; expense on the exploitation of uranium by the leaching process. Yet the South Australian Government still stands and says that it is opposed to the mining of uranium. We know that in South Australia the green light has been given to a predominantly German firm to explore for uranium within 30 kilometres north and south of Adelaide, the capital city of South Australia. We also know that exploration is still taking place in the Olary province. I refer particularly to Plumbago Station. I referred to that aspect on another occasion when we were debating uranium in this place. I was challenged by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> when I stated that the South Australian Government had given the green light for exploration in areas of South Australia close to historical Aboriginal sites. </para>
          <para>I have been in touch with a woman in South Australia who has taken a very keen interest in this matter. She is the Honorary Inspector of the Aboriginal and Historic Relics Preservation Act.  Her  name is <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs M.</inline> F. Nobbs.  Her  address is 8 Hazelwood Avenue, Hazelwood Park, South Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Nobbs</inline> in correspondence to me and also in discussions I have had with her has stated that there is a list of dreaming sites on the Plumbago Historic Reserve. It has been declared an historic reserve. In answer to my queries following criticism which I received from one of the Opposition senators, <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Nobbs</inline> stated in her letter: </para>

              <para>- But the difference is that we are standing up and dealing with environmental aspects, openly saying that we are in favour of the mining of uranium. However, the South Australian Government says that it is opposed to the mining of uranium and that it is opposed to doing so many things in relation to uranium. Yet it is allowing exploration to take place close to Aboriginal sacred sites. Let me make it clear that I do not condemn the State Government for this action but I do condemn it for its political hypocrisy. That is what I am condemning. In respect of environmental protection, the Government is doing all that it can to make sure that the environment is protected.

          <para class="block">It is interesting to read her comments. She is talking about a government that is opposed to the mining of uranium but which, to quote her, has allowed over 1,000 drill holes to be put down specifically for uranium, not for other minerals. This morning there was talk about the problems of radon gas resulting from material from open cut mining being brought to the surface. Here is the Dunstan Government in South Australia doing the same, but is the Opposition standing up and condemning that Government for its actions? Silence reigns supreme. The manager of the station in the Olary Province has stated that drilling has been done very close to Aboriginal sites and environmental damage from drilling has not been repaired. Let me make it clear that I am expressing concern but am not condemning the South Australian Government for one moment for the exploration for uranium. However, I condemn that Government for the double standards it is adopting on this issue. I condemn it openly and, I hope, sufficiently that the Opposition will take some notice of what is being said. </para>

                <inline font-weight="bold">- Mrs Nobbs</inline>has given me the figure of 1 , 000 drill holes. We are now talking about the environment and the concern which is being expressed by a State government which has sent me and no doubt you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> as a South Australian senator, a telex criticising the Federal Government because the Federal Government is openly bringing in legislation to protect the environment and doing all it can to make sure that the environment is protected. Yet the State Government is conducting these activities without saying to the public what it is doing, although it says that it is opposed to the mining of uranium. I now come to the interesting part of the letter from the Minister for the Environment. He said: </para>

          <quote>
            <para>Nowhere within the Aboriginal and Historic Relics Preservation Act, 1967, are mining or exploration activities excluded or prohibited from historic reserves. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">In other words he is saying: &#39;We have an Act over which we have total control. We have the numbers in South Australia to change that Act. The Act of 1 967 says that we can do these things so we are going to do them. At the same time we will condemn the Federal Government for what it is doing openly and honestly&#39;. It is on this point that the Opposition senators have to take stock of themselves. Then the Minister goes on to refer to uranium minerals within the host rock- I will not read the earlier verbiage in the letter because it will take too long- and spells out that uranium is the specific mineral to which the State Government is referring and the specific mineral for which the companies are exploring, hoping that they can exploit it. In his letter he then said: </para>

            <para>Each stage of explorations carried out by the companies in the past seven years has added to the knowledge of the ore body and has defined additional mineralisation. </para>

In reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Nobbs&#39;</inline> correspondence and complaints, and let us not forget that she is the honorary inspector under the Aboriginal Historic Relics Preservation Act in South Australia, he later stated: </para>

          <para class="block">I also have statements from the manager of the property on which many cave paintings have been damaged- in fact, some cannot be repaired- and nothing has been done to repair them. There has been a change of portfolio in South Australia. Since <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Corcoran</inline> has been Minister, there has been a change in approach. Today there are more restrictions and there will be some ministerial direction. I make that clear with due respect to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Corcoran,</inline> the  Deputy  Premier of South Australia. However, he is not the State Government, only a member of it, and it is the overall policy of that Government to which I am referring and which I am condemning. </para>
          <para>We then reach another very interesting point with regard to the leaching process. I mentioned earlier the research that has been done and is being done by Amdel (Aspect) Pollution Consultants, the Australian minerals group in South Australia and one of the major research centres in Australia. The Department of Mines has been a client of Amdel with regard to research into the leaching process. I heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> today very genuinely and sincerely express concern about the pollution of water in the Alligator Rivers Region and I accept his concern and so does the Government. The Government is watching it and it is going to have it researched and set up a consultative committee to make sure that these matters can be watched closely so damage will not be done but, if it is, it will be minimal. One would expect that with this research and the consultative committee we will be able to ensure that damage is not done.

          </list>
          <para class="block">Let me make it clear that we are discussing environmental aspects of the mining of uranium in the Ranger area. The South Australian Government has been looking at means by which it can leach uranium out of the ground- in other words, put it in a solution form and get it out of the ground. I stress that this is being contemplated where there is ground water. The South Australian Minister for the Environment has said that it should not significantly impair the quality of the ground water within the uranium ore body. Opposition senators have stood here today and, quite frankly, hypocritically condemned this legislation on the basis of four or five clauses and moves an amendment. They do not stand up and openly oppose the whole package deal on uranium. Here we have a State Government openly standing up and condemning this Government and sending South Australian senators telexes asking them to support its policy in South Australia. At the same time the South Australian Government is allowing exploration in its own State within a few kilometres of the city of Adelaide and in areas close to historic Aboriginal sites, causing concern to those who are in charge. According to the South Australian Government&#39;s claims it has put down 1,000 drill holes to enable it to study a process whereby uranium will be leached out of the ground, bringing it out in liquefied form. There is the great danger of much of this spreading into the underwater systems, but apparently because it is salty it does not matter. We are not discussing whether we will drink that water. What the Opposition is concerned about and what it is criticising us about is the lack of environmental safety. </para>

              <para>-Why does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Melzer</inline> not stand up and condemn the South Australian Government- and not just for the double standards it has. It is preaching one thing to the people and doing another thing behind their backs. It is also researching a process which is a greater risk of polluting the environment because of the underwater streams than anything that would take place in the Ranger area. That is what the issue is all about today for me as a South Australian. I have mentioned these things today because I had a telex sent to me. I ask the South Australian Government in turn to stand up as a government of this country and give support to a government in Canberra that is doing all it can to make sure that there will be environmental protection. The Federal Government has openly stated that it will mine and export uranium with stringent safeguards, both with regard to the sale of uranium and with regard to the conservation aspects of the environment in that area. The South Australian Government is saying that it is opposed to the mining of uranium; yet it is going ahead and encouraging exploration. It is going ahead with research into a leaching process. It is going ahead with a feasibility study in the hope that it will get an enrichment plant in South Australia. I hope it gets one, too; we need it. We need one in Australia and, as a South Australian, I should like to see one in my own State. But the double standards being adopted totally appal me. </para>

          <para>No doubt I will be criticised and condemned by some of the members of the South Australian Government for standing up and supporting the Federal Government in the stand it is taking with this package of Bills in relation to the mining and export of uranium. All I can say is that hypocrisy reigns supreme in South Australia at the present time. I will stand firmly behind this Government, which has declared its policy openly and in such a way as to assure me that it will take all the precautions it can, many of which are far more stringent than those of any other country. The Federal Government is conscious of the fact that there is a need to mine uranium. We in Australia have not told the world to go nuclear. But we in Australia are very conscious of the fact that there is an energy crisis- a crisis that will get greater and greater unless that gap is filled. The world itself has decided that it will go nuclear to make sure that it will avoid that energy crisis. We in this country have the resources to help the rest of the world. It is up to us to make sure that we do that so long as at the same time we support legislation such as is before the Senate at present. It is also up to us to make sure that if there is a need to close any gaps within that legislation the Government will- I know it will- accept its responsibilities. It will make sure that there will be protection of the environment generally and at the same time make sure that we meet our international responsibilities. </para>

This Government has said it will bring into being and enforce precautions in the mining of uranium in the area of the Northern Territory about which we are talking in order to protect the miners. If the dangers of radon gas are so much worse in the mining of coal and superphosphate, why are Government supporters not standing on their high horses and demanding that the same sort of preventive measures be introduced for the mining of coal and superphosphate. Evidently it does not matter because it will only be the miners who will suffer, so why worry! There is no agitation from Government supporters about safety measures in the mining of coal and superphosphate, yet, according to them, in those areas the danger is so much greater. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline>said that there would be no underground mining in Australia. I suggest that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> take another look at Jabiru, where the Pan-Continental company says it will mine uranium. He should remember a conversation with an engineer about how deep the mine will be and how the uranium will still be there, going under the hill. He pointed out that it would be much cheaper to mine it underground than it would be to remove the hill to get at the uranium. </para>
          <para class="block">Do not tell me that once the mine is open they will not continue on the seam and continue to take the uranium out underground because there is nothing in this legislation to stop them. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline>went on to talk about what he called the so-called dangers from radiation. Evidently, according to him, all that has to be done is to wrap it up in brown paper bags and there will be no trouble at all. If it is as easy as his authority makes out and if there is as little danger as his authority would have us believe, why is it that in Washington a congressional study has raised once again some old questions about the future of nuclear energy, at least in the United States. Despite 30 years of federal control in America the government and industry so far have failed to produce a solution to the problem of radioactive waste. That is one of the main themes to have emerged from a 104-page report on nuclear energy which is soon to be released by the Environment, Energy and Natural Resources SubCommittee of Congress. The Congressional report charges that no permanent acceptable storage method has yet been found for radioactive waste and that this disposal problem, more than any other factor, threatens the future of nuclear energy in the United States of America. The Congressional report also finds itself in agreement with a recent study by the Rand Corporationa Californian-based &#39;think tank&#39;- that the cost of nuclear energy is climbing astronomically and that this cost spiral and the waste problem are already causing some American States to back away from nuclear power development. </para>
          <para>California, for example- America &#39;s most important State- has rejected nuclear development, opting instead for more conventional energy sources such as coal, and at the same time investing public research moneys in safe alternatives such as solar power. I suggest that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> send his reference both to the Congressional Committee and to California so that on the one hand they will be able to realise the imminent dangers in California and on the other hand perhaps they will get him sufficient brown paper bags in which to wrap the stuff so that it can be disposed of safely. When he has convinced those authorities about those particular problems, perhaps he will then start on the uranium miners who, at the moment, have a five times greater chance of getting lung cancer than other people in the community. That is not because they smoke cigarettes; it is because they mine uranium. </para>
          <para>In supporting the amendment that my party has moved I state that I am very much in favour of this land in the Alligator Rivers Region becoming Aboriginal land. I am very much in favour of this Aboriginal land being leased to the Department of National Parks and Wildlife to be managed with the assistance of the Aboriginal people as a park, as the Kakadu National Park. I believe that this is not only the heritage of Australia but also the heritage of the world. Because of its beauty, its splendid vistas, its quietness, its loneliness and its grandeur, it is significant in the very attitudes we take when we talk about civilisation. Also, of course, it has the richest deposit of uranium in the world. That is the snake in this Eden. </para>
          <para>Aboriginal people want uranium left in the ground. Although they have said that under some circumstances they will agree with mining at Jabiru, they have also said that if this Government is determined to go ahead with mining uranium they would like to see the smaller site at Nabarlek taken up first so that they can have a first hand look at the results of uranium mining. Although at Jabiluka they have said &#39;No. We do not want uranium mining in any circumstances&#39; we know from talking to many of them that they really want the uranium left in the ground despite the riches which might flow to them from the mining of the uranium. They do not count riches as we do, in dollar bills and silver coins. They give high priority to keeping that area uncontested and unviolated </para>
          <para>We know that more than half the people in Australia want uranium left in the ground. We know that there are thousands and thousands of people in the world- the number is growing all the time- who want uranium left in the ground. We want it left in the ground, particularly in that area so that the Park will not be violated. This Government, at the behest of mighty mining companies, sees the profit that it thinks it will make from mining uranium and it wants it out of the ground, no matter what sort of havoc is wreaked in doing so. The Government says, of course, that these Bills will protect most of the areas from the harmful effects of mining. Its method at the moment to protect those areas and to protect the Park is by excluding the mine project areas from it. The Park is planned in two sections. We declare the land between the mines a park now and when the miners have finished with the land, we declare the second part to be added- the bits that are left between the dumps, the rock heaps, the polluted water and what is left after the roads, towns, tracks, ore dumps, holding ponds and the treatment plants have been built. If there are any rock formations, sacred places or Aboriginal paintings left which are not affected by blasting, by fumes or by people, they will all be added and then we will have a whole park. In his second reading speech, the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Groom)</inline> said: </para>

          <para class="block">The Minister assures us that steps will be taken in the second stage zone to ensure that the wildlife and natural features are protected adequately. How will that be done? Will it be done by drawing a line on a map and saying that everything outside that line is now protected, and that this line will somehow protect everything outside that line by what goes on inside the line? How will the line on the map protect the area when we know so little about it? The Ranger uranium report, which the Government loves to quote out of context and by no means fully, in part states: </para>

            <para>The diversity as well as making Ranger so interesting, implicates the problem of assessing the impact of any manmade disturbance to the environment. </para>

          <para class="block">It states further: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>But much less is known about the interactions between them, which constitute the regional ecology and which could be disturbed by developments. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">We do not know what the environment or the ecology is like before we start, yet the Government has drawn up Bills to protect them. As most honourable senators would know by now, the area is very wet. It carries an enormous body of water in the wet season. Uranium mining uses a lot of water. We have been told that contaminated water will be kept in dams. The Ranger report recommended that very strict conditions should apply to the security of those dams. Indeed, when we visited that area, the miners told us that the Ranger report was wrong, that the conditions it had imposed on the dams were wrong, that they were too expensive and would not work. The miners had their own ideas. </para>
          <para>The Government is not insisting on the implementation of the proposals brought down in the Ranger report. Presumably, it is letting the miners have their own way as to how that contaminated water will be kept. When we were at the site, the interesting point raised was where the dams were to be put. The Ranger proposal is that the dams will be built at the project area. We visited Jabiluka and even the miners apparently were a little concerned that the dams were right on the floodline of the creek. They were talking about moving the dams to the other side of a mountain. They did not know where the dams were going to be built, yet we are talking about going ahead with mining in that area. We visited Nabarlek and again they did not know where the tailings dams were going to be. How can these Bills keep that part of the environment free and clear when the miners themselves at this stage do not know where the dams will be built? The Government cannot say that they will be in a safe place or that the environment will be kept safe. </para>
          <para>The Fox report said that the real situation will become apparent only when mining commences. That is what worries the Opposition. The real position will become apparent only when it is too late to do anything about it. I should like to refer to some of the comments contained in the Fox report when it referred to water. It stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Aquifers are likely to play an increasingly important role as a source of fresh water if development proceeds and knowledge of the characteristics of the different types is necessary if they are to be successfully exploited and protected from contamination. </para>
            <para>Water quality in many of these aquifers is good which suggests that they are recharged locally from the surface. In some very localised areas, groundwater radioactivity is above World Health Organisation standards for drinking water.  lt went on to say: </para>
            <para>Higher than normal chloride concentrations in some bores means that the river has been interpreted as meaning that some contamination of the aquifers from the river occurs and as offering a warning of the possible effects on this source of water if mine and other contaminants should enter the South Alligator drainage system. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">But at this stage we do not know what these effects will be. We are told that a research institute will be set up to find out the possible effects. But we will be finding out what the dangers may be at the same time as we are mining and polluting. That is not sensible. It only means that at the end of such an examination we will be able to say: &#39;There you are; now we know how the pollution occurred &#39;. The report goes on to say: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Information on their occurrence and potential as water sources is very limited. Seepage from the shallow aquifers in weathered rock, sand sheets and sandy drainages probably extends the period of flow of streams and the life of some billabongs in the dry season. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">So we are told that we should be worried about where the water goes in the wet season but it appears that we may need to know what happens in the dry season too. But at the moment we do not know. The Government says &#39;We will find out&#39;, but we will be mining at the same time. The report says: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Any contaminants from proposed mining and processing operations . . . released into and remaining in surface water . . . would be confined to the Magela drainage system . . . The  desination  of contaminants entering deep ground water is less certain. </para>
            <para>The hydrology of the system can be described only in broad terms because limited stream flow data exists. Some water from the Magela Creek and its tributaries is probably lost to deep aquifers associated with faults in the basement rock. Several major fault lines have been identified within the catchment. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Honourable senators will recall that we are less than certain about the destination of contaminants and their entry to deep ground water. We are less than certain about so much of the environment in this area. The report says that the total flow past Jabiru in a normal year is 250 million cubic metres and in a wet year it may exceed three times that volume. But not enough information about the local oceanography exists to enable the way river water diffuses into the sea to be determined. There is this vast amount of water which will flow past the mine. If there is any sort of breakdown in the precautions or the banking that the mining companies are going to insitute we do not know where that polluted water is going to finish up. The report says: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Particularly relevant in the Magela system are the levels of heavy metals and radioactive materials. </para>
            <para>Data on concentrations of these materials are of variable quality. The figures quoted can be regarded as giving only an indication of the quantities present. The data available are not adequate to show how concentrations vary during a year or between years of different flows . . . Information is not available on the chemical form of metals in Magela Creek water, a major factor influencing their toxic effects. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">So all along the line we are told: &#39;We do not know what will happen; we will find out&#39;. Why cannot we find out first before the damage is done? The reason is because the Government is in such a hurry. The report is full of those sorts of quotes. When we think about water, about seepage, about the pollution of water and where the water will go, I remind the Senate that three or four years ago in Washington 200,000 gallons of high level waste leaked out of containers that were &#39;safe&#39;. They were monitored by methods which were considered to be inviolable- could not go wrong- by computers. But the human being who was in charge of the computer forgot to look and therefore did not notice the leak. The 200,000 gallons was seeping through the ground and had almost reached the Colorado River. It may have reached it by now but the authorities cannot do anything about it. They do not know what will happen. They cannot smell it. They cannot taste it. They cannot see it. It has happened. Nothing can be done to undo the damage. </para>
          <para>In Canada energy authorities are worried that radioactive water will seep into the town and city water supplies from disused uranium mines. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Coates,</inline> who is the Canadian Government&#39;s mining and energy research chief, said that </para>
          <para class="block">Canada is spending vast amounts of money trying to solve the problem. He said that there is a strong possibility of the radioactive water seeping into the rivers and dams that supply water for commercial, domestic and agricultural use. He said that if it happens it could result in genetic deformities, cancer or one of the other hazards of radioactive material. Canada is trying to find a solution after the problem has arisen. We have a chance to work out what the problems may be and thereby avoid them, but no, we are not doing that. Honourable senators will all remember that in India just a short time ago it was found that a deadly poisonous and highly radioactive plutonium isotope was lost 13 years ago in the sacred Himalayan Mountains by the Central Intelligence Agency. Teams of scientists are now 13 years later checking the water of the Ganges for any contamination. </para>
          <para>What damage has been done to the millions who use the waterway every day has not been established. It may be that the substance has not got into the Ganges. However, if it has it is far too late to do anything about it. This is the point we are trying to make. Once you have destroyed a resource in this way it cannot be restored. I ask honourable senators to recall what happened at Rum Jungle which was only a very small installation compared with the proposed mining at the Kakadu National Park. Just remember what happened there when a dam broke. We are all told now that this will not happen again but human beings are fallible and the things that we build are sometimes unreliable. We were told by the Department of the Northern Territory that it will take at least $ 12m to restore that small area of Rum Jungle. So how much would it take to restore the area in the Kakadu National Park should one of these little accidents happen again? The imagination boggles at how much it would cost. It also boggles at how man can go forward and endanger his own environment in this unthinking, unknowing way. </para>
          <para>We do not know anything about the ecosystem in that area. We do not know anything about the ecosystem in the area in which we live in the south of Australia. We do not know what is the balance of life. We do not know the balance between an insect and the system. We do not know about the life chain, the food chain or the effect on our food chain. Yet blithely in we go despite the report which says, amongst other things, that a rare and interesting type of semi-deciduous forest exists there. We talk about things that really we do not know anything about. We do not know how the life chain could be destroyed. We do not know the balance between life and water. We do not know what the killing or wiping out of one insect in this area might do to the existence of birds which nest there, birds which fly south and destroy insects in the south. I and other honourable senators found when we were investigating the wood chip industry and were asking questions about what would happen if a certain insect were wiped out or a bird no longer existed and was not there to remove insects to protect the forest, that the answer we got over and over was We do not know&#39;. Yet the Ranger report is putting before us very clearly the areas about which we know nothing. </para>
          <para>For instance the report in part says that a rare and interesting type of semi-deciduous forest exists. It is rare and it is interesting; that is all we know about it. Another part of the report says that many more species probably remain unrecorded because the species in the lessaccessible parts of the park, in parts of the plateau and some permanently wet areas were not collected as thoroughly as they should have been; some species were not known previously; regions are notable for their present relative freedom from introduced species. That is an important point. At the moment it is relatively free from introduced species. In Australia we have seen in so many parts species being introduced and then taking over by wiping out vegetation, wiping out livestock and threatening the livestock industry. We have not had a clue about what to do to overcome such problems. For instance in Queensland which is your State, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy President,</inline> lantana still ravages. We have not found a way to cope with it. Yet into an area like this which we have the nerve to call a national park we are bringing an industry that with the amount of material and number of people involved could very easily introduce species that would take over and wipe out the natural, rare, interesting and previously unknown species that exist there. Some species are very rare. Some are known only in the Northern Territory or in Arnhem Land. The report states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The feral cat population is small, and the great abundance of small mammals in the Region is probably due in part to this fact. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">If we continue with mining at least one town will be established there. With the best will in the world, Australian human beings unfortunately do not seem to be able to move very far without their pets. It is inconceivable to think that cats will not get into the area and multiply with the same rapidity as they have in other areas of Australia. They have become one of the real predators in this country. What will they do to what we are pleased to call a national park? No line drawn on a map will keep them inside the boundaries. They have been known to step across boundaries and take off. Evidently, food is there in abundance for them. The report also states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>A number of rare bird species could be endangered if trapping were permitted in the Region. Also any extensive hunting of water fowl could seriously affect the survival of local populations . . . </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Already the mining companies are saying that their workers should have the right to use the land around the mining areas for recreation. Recreation could very well include trapping. It could very well include shooting wild fowl and all sorts of things. What will that do to the local population of animals and birds that we have only just discovered? The report states further: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Biological information on the fish species is limited   . insects . . . could be important as indicators of environmental change. Changes in numbers of, for example, dragon flies . . . could indicate the presence of water pollutants . . . About 4,S00 insect species have been recognised in collections during the Fact-finding Study, and further identification and collection are expected to reveal a total of over 10,000 species. Knowledge of the roles of all these insects in food chains, nutrient recycling processes and so on is very limited. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Yet we are blithely going into the region for the mighty mining companies. We will destroy the pattern that has been set up there over centuries. The report states that it may prove possible to use pandanus as indicators of excessive concentrations of heavy metals. However, much additional research would first be needed. The Ranger report maintained that any research body would have great difficulties in establishing baseline biological data. One witness quoted by the report proposed a three-year program costing $lm a year but he agreed that even this would provide little information of value for resolving the problems before the Commission. How can we talk about preserving the environment? Why are we bringing in environmental Bills when we do not even know what the environment is and we are not prepared to wait to find out? </para>
          <para>The report also stated that the desirable objective would be to gain an understanding of the region sufficient to enable any man-made changes to be detected quickly. We will be completely unable to detect those man-made changes because we do not know what we are changing. On this matter the report finally stated that the Commission supported the proposition that if mining or other developments are to proceed as much information as possible should be obtained beforehand. We are doing nothing beforehand. We will allow some sort of research to go on in the area at the same time as we are beginning to mine and setting up all sorts of problems that we shall discover but which we shall not be able to solve. </para>
          <para>We have the time to wait and see. We are endangering this splendid land because of the boom and bust nuclear power industry. As it goes downhill we are destroying our heritage. According to American sources no industry has ever declined as rapidly as the nuclear power industry.

          </quote>
          <para class="block">We are destroying our heritage for an industry which is going downhill and which may never rise again. Even our own Atomic Energy Commission has reported that demand for Australia &#39;s uranium by the mid-1980s will be drastically down on past estimates. We have the time to establish the basic facts about the enviroment and to find out what the dangers really are before we start, but we are not going to do it. All the danger signs have been pointed out to us. We know what has happened in other countries which have allowed the environment to be polluted, but we are not going to learn by them. Why? Because we have to get the uranium out of the ground. The uranium miners believe that if they do not get it out of the ground and sell it now they may never sell it. I think that they are right. Why will they not sell it? Other countries are finding that the costs of producing energy from uranium are too high and that the other consequences that may come from using it are much too high to take a chance with. </para>
          <para>One of the sureties we are given by the Government is the Supervising Scientist. It is very hard to see from the Bill how much freedom the Supervising Scientist will have to act. He will certainly not have the power to step in and stop things when he finds they are going wrong. He has the power only to advise that things are going wrong. Other people take the steps. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> spoke highly of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fry.</inline> I think it was mainly because they had been to school together. I do not doubt <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fry&#39;s</inline> integrity but I believe that he is committed to the mining of uranium. One of the reasons I believe that is that throughout the past two or three years in debates in Victoria on the pros and cons of uranium mining on many occasions <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fry</inline> attended those debates as the adviser to the mining companies who were taking a pro-uranium stand. I do not doubt <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fry&#39;s</inline> integrity but I doubt his ability to be evenhanded in the matter of dangers to the environment. I think that he is committed to the mining of uranium. Therefore, he will see any dangers in a lesser light than people who are not so committed to the mining of uranium. </para>
          <para>The composition of the Co-ordinating Committee worries the Opposition. We do not believe that it is a co-ordinating committee in any way. It certainly will not co-ordinate all the people who have concern with the area. It comprises nominees from federal departments of a government committed to uranium mining. It has representatives of mining companies who are committed to uranium mining. I cannot see that those people will see all around the questions and the dangers which may arise. I certainly cannot see how mining companies will in any way see the problems or will understand the feelings of the Aboriginal people in that area. I recall that the mining industry had an annual dinner in Canberra some time ago. The leading paragraph in a news story about that dinner stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The joke of&#34; the night at the mining industry&#39;s annual dinner in Canberra this week had as its main gag line the fact that a gorilla was mistaken for an Aboriginal in a fur coat. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I cannot see that people who treat other human beings in that fashion will be very disturbed about sacred sites being tampered with or destroyed by fumes, people or blasting. I cannot expect that people who could laugh at something as boorish as that would be very worried about Aboriginal rights to the land, how they live or where they live. Yet these are the sorts of people on the Co-ordinating Committee. </para>
          <para>The Government is bringing in extraordinary precautions to protect a commercial enterprise. It is refusing to bring in strong controls over that commercial enterprise. It provides for the appointment of a Supervising Scientist who will have no authority and for the establishment of a co-ordinating committee which will be made up mainly of people from the industry. Yet, overall, we have the oppressive threat that the people of Australia might not be given information about what is going on there. In some ways I find that the most extraordinary feature of the legislation. Yet, in this extraordinary industry, how can we find anything extraordinary? </para>
          <para>Why should the people not know what is going on in their Park? Why should they not know if there is an accident or pollution or if the whole project is not going well? I bet my bottom dollar that there will be plenty of information about how sweet things are going. No stopper will be put on that son of information getting out. But this legislation specifically prohibits information on other areas of the mining industry in the Kakadu National Park being given to the people. Why is this so? We all know why; it is because the miners are afraid. They know that the first accident will bring to a head the resolve of the Australian people to leave uranium alone- to leave the Park whole and untouched. So we will not be allowed to talk about any of the difficulties which might arise because that would be the finish of the mining. We have cover-ups and evasions and we will never know the facts. Once the companies start mining under the legislation which this Government wants to put through, we will not even be allowed in to look at what is going on. </para>
          <para>With all this pressure on the non-miners, if the Government&#39;s stated concern about the environment is real, why has it not put any pressure on the miners? Why do we impose extraordinary fines and extraordinary jail sentences only upon non-miners? Why will miners not be fined or imprisoned for any breach of the regulations? Why must they not ensure the total safety of the project? Why must they not give a complete assurance of this before one sod is turned? We are not in a hurry; we have time. We can allow them time to research and to discover totally safe measures. Perhaps this way we might achieve more caution. If the miners were to have the threat of a fine of $50,000 or 20 years gaol hanging over them they would be more careful. But no, they dig now and we pay later. We know that the Government is not prepared to bring in regulations which would make the mining of uranium totally safe and which would put the onus on the miners to prevent any pollution whatsoever. We all know that it is going to be impossible for them to mine uranium there without there being danger to the miners, to the environment and to us all. </para>
          <para>At the dreaded risk of appearing emotional on the subject, I shall quote a resolution which was published by the National Council of Churches in America, which set up a committee to investigate nuclear power. I think we should take serious note of this resolution, which states: </para>

            <para>We are charged by God to be caretakers of Creation, not only for ourselves, but for the future generations. Even if tonight were the world&#39;s last night, the decisions we take should be such that future generations would have no cause to curse us.

We are talking about the future of humanity and its heritage when we talk about endangering the Kakadu National Park by allowing uranium mining in any portion of that Park. I believe that we should not mine uranium at all. Surely those people who believe that we should mine uranium can take the time to ensure unconditional safety. In the meantime, because there is no shortage of uranium- as the Australian uranium miners know only too well- we should leave this area undisturbed in its splendour. </para>

            <para>- I respect <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Melzer&#39;s</inline> opinions- obviously they are her own. Having heard the various statements she has made over the past three quarters of an hour, all of which state that uranium mining should not take place, I should like to ask her one or two questions. Of course, she cannot answer them now, but no doubt some time in the future she will do so. I think that some of the statements she made are totally incorrect. From the statements she has made today, I wonder where she stands with respect to the Australian Labor Party policy. </para>

              <para>- She says that she knows it better than I do, and no doubt she does. First of all, I must point out that the development of uranium mining in Australia was first proposed when Labor was in power. We went through this last week. We pointed out that the honourable member for Werriwa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr E. G. Whitlam),</inline> who was the then Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns,</inline> who was the then Treasurer and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor,</inline> who was the then Minister for Minerals and Energy, made an agreement with Peko Mines Ltd and the Electrolytic Zinc Company of Australasia Ltd and other people for the development and the ultimate sale of uranium. This agreement was made some time ago when people knew less about uranium than they do now. I think it is a very odd situation, to say the least, that during a debate such as this honourable senators opposite come into the chamber crying poor when some years ago- as I said, when people knew less about uranium than they do now- they were looking for the riches. </para>

          <para>I am all for safeguarding the environment. I come from the Northern Territory and, with one or two exceptions, I support the Bills which are before us, namely, the Environment Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Bill, the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Amendment Bill and the Environment Protection (Northern Territory Supreme Court) Bill. I am concerned about one or two aspects of the legislation. I was interested to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Melzer&#39;s</inline> comments about destroying the environment- the animals, the people, et cetera. We heard at length about these issues. Obviously <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Melzer</inline> is very interested in the Kakadu National Park, as I am. I compare my attitude with hers and state that not only am I interested in the Northern Territory but also am I interested in Australia and the various parts of Australia. </para>
          <para>I draw <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Melzer&#39;s</inline> attention to a project which I understand was announced in Victoria within the past few weeks. I think the project will cost $ 1,000m. I refer to the development of the Loy-yam coalfields in Gippsland. This area contains many cities- Morwell and others. Victorians tell me that this is one of the most beautiful areas in the world. At least it is that in their eyes. The open cut system of coal mining will engulf the area, which covers some 15 miles by 8 miles. Where are the critics of this project which will scar and destroy the area. </para>

Why is it- I exclude the honourable senator from the expression I am about to use- that the &#39;greenies&#39; are concentrating on the Northern Territory- the area in which, naturally, uranium will be mined- and ignoring the other parts of Australia where immense projects which are to take place will destroy the environment and may result in ill-effects for the communities near those projects. At least we know what effect coal mining has had throughout history on the various places where it has been mined. Why do we not hear people speaking - </para>

                <inline font-weight="bold">- Senator Mulvihill</inline>is shouting his head off. He has made one speech. He is now making a second speech; so he is out of order. Much has been said about the mining of uranium and the haste in the development of the uranium areas in Australia today. Can anyone really criticise the uranium package that was introduced into Parliament several months ago? It is a very complex and complete plan of action in which the environment is safeguarded and in which the mining and development of uranium is safeguarded. I suppose it would be true to say that the safeguards that the Australian Government has introduced for the mining and development of uranium would be the most advanced of any country in the world. </para>

              <para>- The honourable senator obviously has visited various parts of the uranium province. She has cited what happened at Rum Jungle as a good reason why uranium mining should not take place. We know full well that lessons have been learnt in regard to the mining at Rum Jungle. In fact, I referred to this matter two or three weeks ago. There is no excuse for what happened at Rum Jungle. There is no excuse for the way in which mining has been carried out in other parts of the country. What really happened there was that there was a casual approach to the mining of uranium but the uranium itself did not cause damage to the country or pollute the streams. The base metals were allowed to be eroded away by the tropical rains that leached them into the river and into the ground. That situation is being corrected and the river is coming back. </para>

              <para>- If the honourable senator feels so strongly, why on earth did he not attempt to get the Labor Government to take action when it was in power and the mining of uranium was taking place in the Northern Territory. The Labor Party&#39;s attitude to the whole situation is rather hypocritical. Let us forget about the Opposition&#39;s viewpoint. I think it has many holes in it. In fact, it is destroyed by the actions of the Labor Party over the last few years. </para>

          <para>We are dealing today with three Bills- the Environment Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Bill, the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Amendment Bill and the Environment Protection (Northern Territory Supreme Court) Bill. I suppose the Bills have been grouped together because for one reason or another they are controversial. The exception I have taken to the Bills, particularly in the last two weeks, has been to the fact that despite the work that has been done in the Northern Territory since the 1950s for the protection of national parks and those things which we wish to protect these days, the legislation excluded the participation of the people of the Northern Territory. The Northern Territory Reserves Board is a very skilled body, employing numerous skilled people, including Aborigines. It was the Board which in the first place proposed, some years ago, in the interests of Australia and the Northern Territory, that there be the Kakadu National Park, Since then much work has been taking place on 30-odd reserves. </para>
          <para>On 1 July 1978 the Northern Territory will go into a system of responsible self-government. That legislation is before the other place now and I presume that the Senate will be debating it next week or soon after. No doubt we will have much to say about it. As I have said before, the complaint that I had in the last two weeks was about the fact that the development of uranium outlined in the package that was presented some months ago to Australia and the world totally excluded participation by the people of the Northern Territory. I expect and hope that all honourable senators will agree that this was the wrong thing to do. No matter where one lives in Australia, whether it be a State or Territory, the people of that area have at least some right to some say in the things that happen in that place. In this case the people were not recognised. The organisations that have been working for the good of the nation were not recognised. The situation was as I have described. </para>
          <para>As honourable senators realise, over the last two weeks certain discussions have taken place. I am pleased to some extent to be able to say that, as a result of those negotiations between the Federal Government, the people of the Northern Territory and the  Chairman  of the Northern Land Council, an active part will now be played by each of those three bodies. It is all very well for people down here, whether honourable senators or members in the other place, to make plans for Australia, and especially for the Northern Territory, without paying heed to what they are doing. </para>
          <para>I would like to touch on that subject briefly. It means a tremendous amount to me- naturally, it means probably more to me than it does to any other senator. I implore senators- and if I have to get down on my hands and knees I will certainly not be too proud to do it- to keep in mind that laws and policies relating to the Northern Territory which are made in the Federal sphere should take into account the fact that, as a territory and a people, we are a little different from most other parts of Australia. Our population is made up of mixed races. We have a large Aboriginal community. We have many migrants. We have many people who have been born in the Territory, or who have gone there to live. The future of the Territory depends upon the ability of its people to live in what I would call a state of co-existence. That is not to be taken as a racist term. Co-existence recognises that the Aboriginal people, despite the troubles they are going through now, are a proud race and will always exist.  In  my mind there will not be integration in the sense of the absorption of the black- the production of a type of brown-skinned individual. I can not see that happening at any stage. Certainly if it ever did happen it would be many decades hence. </para>
          <para>At the same time we have the Europeans, people who have come to live in the Territory since 1824. Our future lies in the ability of both groups to work and live alongside each other. Over the last few years we have been under extreme pressures because, although we have been endeavouring to foster this recognition of each other, to live together, to be an ordinary community, we have been subjected to stresses and strains as a result of the views of many organisations and governments, in applying to us certain laws and policies. I will have more to say next week on the stage of self-government that we are now entering, but I would say now that, having brought Kakadu and the uranium industry into being, we must ensure that whatever we do we encourage the people of the Territory to live and work together. I have my doubts as to whether that can be achieved. </para>

              <para>- As honourable senators know, the mining people are well contained. They are so contained that, despite the fact that they have outlaid millions of dollars, they are unable to move. It is a fact of life now that, in view of the time that has been wasted, one must doubt that very much will be done in the Top End during the present dry season. I doubt that we will see any real work done. I believe that for the next three years the contracts made a few years ago by the Labor Government to supply uranium to other countries will not be fulfilled. There will probably be a delay of at least 1 8 months and if certain work is not carried out now, delivery will have to be put back for a further year. Therefore, it is nonsense to say that mining companies are these days creatures of their own will; that they can do as they wish. We know full well that they cannot. In the Northern Territory they have been waiting for two years or more- and especially is that true of this year- to carry out works that had been agreed to. </para>

          <para>On the question of representation of the Northern Territory, I am pleased to say that most of the proposals put to the Government, and agreed to by the Northern Land Council in Darwin a week or so ago, will now be implemented by way of this legislation. By the insertion in the Bills of these numerous points the Government will ensure that the people of the Northern Territory will, to the degree promised in the course of various conferences, correspondence and so on, have some say in the development of uranium. The proposals that I, with the assistance of others, have put forward, will merely place the Northern Territory in a situation whereby agreeements made previously will, to a degree, now be embodied in legislation. Some 80 per cent of the proposals originally made have been agreed to, and I assume that one cannot have everything that one desires. </para>
          <para>I would have wished that in the running of Kakadu Park, the experience of the Northern Territory could have been employed. The States have had a similar experience in running their own national parks. Those parks are not run by the Federal Government or a Federal body. We wanted Kakadu Park to be run by the people of the Territory jointly with a Federal body, the latter to have policy making powers, provision for funding and so on. However, the Territory will be participating in the park plan. It will have access to the Supervising Scientist and representation on the Co-ordinating Committee. </para>

I wonder whether she has ever been to the Pancontinental Mining Ltd site at Ja Ja. I presume that if she has been to what we call the uranium province she would have seen this site. Has she visited the laboratory that has been set up by Pancontinental at Ja Ja for use by scientists? Has she seen the work that has been carried out by the scientists? Has she seen the environmental surveys and plans that have been conducted? I suppose the mining company is concerned to protect itself by employing scientists, biologists and people of such training who are now in the field looking at things such as tree growth, the flow of rivers, the catching and tagging of fish and many other aspects. These people are now taking measurements in the air, in the water and on the ground so that as years go by and as development takes place we will have a yardstick for further measurements. It is not fair that such work should be carried out? </para>

My understanding of the views of the great majority of the traditional owners is this: As long as their sacred sites are protected and as long as they see that the ground is not going to be destroyed they wish mining to take place. I am not talking about what is said in the Press. I am putting what I believe a handful of traditional owners in this area were saying. There is a handful of traditional owners and their wishes are being respected. Therefore let us not have the nonsense that we have been hearing. If we take notice of it we will put up walls and promote confrontation and battles in the future. In fact I believe that when the financial arrangements for these royalties have been worked out we will see that the Aboriginal people will be extremely well off. I expect that this money will be spent for the benefit of the people. </para>
          <para>Much can be said on this particular situation. At this stage with time running out I am not able to speak at length about the problems of a closed town.

              <para>- The man with the high-powered rifle can be a vandal in any part of the world. The sort of protection we receive is dependent on our laws and on the rangers who police those laws. We have all heard about the country being destroyed through mining. Less than one per cent of the land area of the uranium province will be disturbed. It is interesting to make a comparison with the coalfields of Victoria. The Senate should look at the tens of square miles that have been denuded by gravel pits of construction contractors, governments and so on, as a result of work carried out on the Arnhem Highway. To my mind that is vandalism. Why have people not cried out about that? Why have they not said that about all the roads that have been built through Australia and the Northern Territory, such as the Arnhem Highway? Why have they not kicked about that? That sort of thing is destroying the environment, is it not? I find some of the arguments put forward rather strange. </para>

          <para>I do not support the amendment. The amendment opposes mining in the catchment areas of the Alligator Rivers, a portion of which is in the proposed boundaries of the Kakadu National Park. I say once again that the uranium package overcomes the problems there. Work that is being carried out will ensure that everything done there will be done to protect the country. The Government is urged to proceed forthwith to acquire Goodparla and Gimbat pastoral leases. If I remember rightly they are in the second stage of the National Park. That, in my mind, is a foregone conclusion. I do not support the amendment. I certainly support the development of uranium and particularly the three Bills now before us because they give recognition to the Northern Territory and enable it to play a part in its administration. </para>

            <para>- in reply- I thank honourable senators for their participation in this debate. This debate today follows the debate yesterday and the cognate debate some days earlier on two Bills. Now we are dealing with three Bills together. They are part of the sequence implementing the Federal Government&#39;s decision to mine and mill uranium for marketing outside Australia. The Bills we debated yesterday provided that power. They also provided that we could act overseas under the safeguards of the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. They also provided a code for safety and security within Australia. Today we are debating three Bills which are essentially environmental in nature. They are the Environment Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Bill, the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Amendment Bill, and the Environment Protection (Northern Territory Superme Court) Bill. Inevitably, the debate has been not so much on these Bills at all as upon, as with yesterday, whether uranium ought to be mined. That is natural because the issue has been a great one. It is a pity that the Bills have not been debated in detail because their mechanisms are important. The fact is that a great deal of the debate has been on the more extreme viewpoints and emotional viewpoints rather than on the central issues. For example, Opposition senators have argued that it is wrong to mine uranium because mining companies will get profits and make a dollar. </para>

              <para>- The <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reports of the debate yesterday and today will show that. I simply remind the Opposition that it was the Whitlam Government which made the memorandum of association with the mining company enabling it to make a profit. It has been argued that it is wrong to mine near or on Aboriginal sacred or traditional land. I remind the Opposition that that also is precisely what the Whitlam Government&#39;s agreement intended. It was also argued that it was wrong to mine on what will be a national park, but that again is exactly what the Whitlam Government intended. Basically, the emotional issues raised have failed to account for the fact that these are the very things that the Labor Government had set out to achieve. </para>

          <para>Sadly there has run through this debate the polarisation of the argument that the protection of the people of Australia and of the world against radiation and genetic mutation and destruction is best achieved by not mining uranium in Australia. It is suggested that those who mine are creating dangers. I reminded the Senate yesterday, as I must do again today, that the Fox Committee report indicated that there were very large dangers to the safety, security and survival of the people of the world if Australia failed to mine uranium under proper safeguards and instead allowed the proliferation of plutonium. I make it clear that the debate is not helped by the polarisation of an argument. The fact is that the Fox Committee said, and it is the authoritative body, that with proper safeguards the hazards of mining and milling uranium could be properly contained and were quite tolerable within the community. So, the general nature of the argument has been distorted. </para>
          <para>No one wants to under-estimate the real hazards that must exist with any radioactive materials but let me put the matter in perspective this way: Many of us have been to Jabiru and have wandered out to that glorious spot which is described as the Ranger anomaly 2 which is located right against the escarpment at Mount Brockman and against the most sacred tribal and traditional Aboriginal ground. With the aid of a geiger counter, I registered radiation there in terms of millirads well above the level that the world health authorities would tolerate. Yet I am bound to say that over the centuries, the aeons of history, Aborigines have camped there, drunk there, eaten kangaroo flesh from there and eaten fish from there. That is not to say that I or my Government would want to add a single millirad to the amount of radioactivity in the community. To get it in perspective, in Canberra the millrad level from natural radioactivity in the atmosphere is something like 102 millirads, plus another 2 millirads for all the atom bombs that have been exploded. So we are being subjected to about 104 millirads. However, in respect of the area I have referred to I am not talking about 105 or 106 millirads but about many hundreds of millirads. I have referred to this only to expose the situation. No one would want to add another millirad of radioactivity to the atmosphere. </para>
          <para>What are we talking about? The first point is that we are aiming to establish under the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Amendment Bill perhaps the world&#39;s greatest national park and certainly one of the greatest wilderness and wetland parks the world has known. That is something to be excited about. Anyone who has been to Kakadu which is located within the systems of the three Alligator Rivers, and seen the Woolwonga wetlands and bird sanctuary would be excited about establishing something that ought to have been achieved years ago. It is now going to be done on a grand scale and this stage of development will be larger than was envisaged by the Fox Committee. It will take in all the traditional Aboriginal sacred sites in the area with a guarantee that they will be preserved. So, let us not snivel in our miseries. Let us simply say that this Government is establishing now once and for all, and not to be alienated in Australia, Australia&#39;s greatest national park, wetlands and wilderness. It is something that will be a heritage forever. That ought to be accepted as an accomplishment. Furthermore we have projected that in stage 2 we will add considerably more so that this area will be greater still. The Act is being amended also to allow land that is part of a park or reserve in the region to be granted to an Aboriginal land trust. The land is to be subject to the granting of a lease to the Director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service. The Bill seeks to establish conservation zones to provide interim control and protection of land in the region until a park or reserve can be proclaimed and a series of other measures which, I think, should be applauded. </para>
          <para>The second Bill sets up mechanisms to ensure that the environment is protected in perpetuity. Why would one want to argue with that. Why would one want to oppose the concept of the series of safeguards which the Fox Committee said ought to be established? Why would one oppose the establishment of an Office of Supervising Scientist? Why would one want to oppose the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fry</inline> to this office? He is one of the most distinguished and experienced Australian scientists. Why would one want to oppose the powers, functions and conditions of service of the holder of that office and the establishment, functions and membership of the co-ordinating committee of the Alligator Rivers region? Are we opposed to the co-ordinating committee, the concept to the Fox report? Are we opposed to the establishment, functions and management of an Alligator Rivers region research institute, and are we opposed to the whole range of measures that give life to these elements? It has been said that these objective have been weakened. It is claimed, for example, that the Supervising Scientist has to act with secrecy, that if he makes some kind of discovery it cannot be announced. I wonder whether whoever talked of this had read the Bill beforehand. I wonder whether they had looked at the provisions of the Supervising Scientist to make his report and for his report to be made public. There is no provision for it to be only an annual report. He can make a report whenever he feels the necessity to do so. Indeed, I wonder whether honourable senators realise that in any case the advisers, whether scientific or otherwise, to Ministers are in that recommending capacity and that the fundamental responsibility for ascertaining and revealing the truth of the matter lies with the Ministers themselves. </para>

              <para>-I shall be happy to respond to that in the Committee stage. I simply say at this moment that the provisions are those which normally apply to public servants in the discharge of their duties. It is a well known situation. But we can discuss that in the Committee stage. </para>

          <para>The third Bill- the Environment Protection (Northern Territory Supreme Court) Billproposes to confer jurisdiction on the Supreme Court in the Northern Territory in relation to the enforcement by it of certain legal requirements for the protection of the environment in the Alligator Rivers Region. That, of course, is one of the Fox Committee &#39;s recommendations. Again, I was somewhat surprised by various comments because I cannot believe that one would not want to carry out what the Fox Committee recommended in that regard. Indeed, I think some Opposition senators said that we ought to have vested the power not in the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory but in the superior Court, the Federal Court of Australia. Let me say that the concept is that the Federal Court is not an original court of jurisdiction in the ordinary sense. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Fox himself saw the Supreme Court as that body. </para>
          <para>A number of amendments have been drafted as a result of discussions. They have been drafted in order to bring about proper consultation between the Northern Territory and the Commonwealth Government. I shall refer to those in a moment or two, but, to put the matter in context I say that when we are looking at what we are doing with these Bills we should remember that we are providing first of all for the very elements of the Fox Committee&#39;s recommendations- the establishment of a national park and the establishment of mechanisms within that national park to monitor all the ecological changes and all the ecological scientific matters so that it can be made known whether there are any threats or challenges and how we can preserve these lands. This, of course, is something that is practical and real. It should be done and it will be done. It will add to the store of our heritage, not detract from it. </para>
          <para>One honourable senator asked about our undertakings on mining in the region. If honourable senators had looked at the various statements made by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> and others they would have seen that the following statement has been made: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>There will be no exploration, development or mining, at least for the time being within the area initially declared a national park. There will be no exploration, development or mining within the remaining area except with the express approval of the Commonwealth authorities involved. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Of course, over-riding all this is the setting up of a mechanism of a national parks and wildlife concept, a management plan and a responsibility within that management plan by that body, by the Supervising Scientist, by his advisory committees and by his research units, taken as a whole, with the aim of preserving. </para>
          <para>In the Committee stage I shall be proposing amendments to the Environment Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Bill. Those amendments arise from the agreement reached in Darwin on 10 May. The amendments underline our recognition of the role of the Northern Territory in respect of the powers and functions of the Supervising Scientist which are to be established under the Environment Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Bill. The amendments give statutory recognition to the Government&#39;s earlier statements that the Northern Territory Government will be represented on the Co-ordinating Committee to be established under the Act. They provide also for the Supervising Scientist to have regard to the views of the Northern Territory Parks and Wildlife Commission and for reports prepared by the Supervising Scientist under clause 36 of the Bill to be provided to the appropriate Minister of the Northern Territory. In the light of the constitutional development of the Northern Territory, I am sure all honourable senators will agree that these are all very proper and responsible proposals. </para>
          <para>As to the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Amendment Bill, we will be proposing amendments, again resulting from discussions on 10 May with the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly and the Northern Land Council. Honourable senators will know that some concern has been expressed about the role which the Northern Territory should play in the development of that plan for the Alligator Rivers Region as a consequence of the Commonwealth Government&#39;s decision to mine uranium. Two major decisions of the Government are, firstly, to proceed with the establishment of the Kakadu National Park and, secondly, to make special arrangements for the supervision of environmental protection measures in the region. The Bill to amend the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act will facilitate the establishment of the Kakadu National Park, while the other Bill- the Environment Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Bill- will establish the environmental protection arrangements. Following the discussions in Darwin, the Government is pleased to say that there is agreement on the way in which the parks should be managed, respecting the rights and responsibilities of both the Northern Territory Executive and the Northern Land Council. The amendments I propose to introduce represent the agreed proposals. They provide that the Director of National Parks and Wildlife shall consult with the Northern Territory Parks and Wildlife Commission in respect of the preparation of the plans of management for parks or reserves declared under the Commonwealth Act in the Northern Territory. Provision is made for the Commonwealth to consult with the Northern Territory and to make arrangements with the Territory in respect of the performance of functions and the exercise of powers under the Commonwealth Act by officers or employees of authorities of the Northern Territory. </para>
          <para>The rights and interests of Aborigines are recognised in arrangements that may be made under these proposed new sub-clauses by providing that such arrangements shall not be inconsistent with the provisions of any law, including of course the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act, or with any agreement between the Commonwealth and an Aboriginal land council. Honourable senators will appreciate that the land comprising Stage 1 of the Kakadu National Park is to be granted to Aborigines under the provisions of the Aboriginal Land Rights Act. Land is then to be leased to the Director of National Parks and Wildlife to be proclaimed and managed as a national park. </para>
          <para>There is also a provision in the Bill which places the Northern Territory in a position similar to the States. Sub-section 6 (2) of the principal Act provides that the Commonwealth cannot acquireland for the purposes of the principal Act without the consent of the State where such land is also reserved under State laws for conservation purposes. The Uluru- that is, the Ayres RockMount Olga- National Park and the Alligator Rivers Region are excluded from the operation of this provision because the Commonwealth has already established national park interests in these areas. </para>
          <para>These amendments are a recognition of the emerging independent status of the Northern Territory. I conclude by once again thanking honourable senators for their contributions, by reminding them of the significance of these Bills as part of the total development, by reminding them of what the Fox Committee said in all these matters and by reminding them that we are moving into the general orchestration of the Fox Committee in the light of the statement by that Committee that if we had proper safeguards it would not be improper to proceed with the mining and milling of uranium. I commend the Bills to the Senate. </para>

          <para>- I wish to seek clarification on the amendments. The Minister for Education used the term consultative role&#39;. I wonder whether he would expand on that term. Do I take it that it is proposed that, to take the extreme case, in the event of a clash of interests, after those people have expressed their points of view and after the points of view of the departments in the Northern Territory have been put, the matter will go to the responsible Federal Ministers and ultimately the supreme arbitrator will be the Cabinet as a whole? </para>

          <para>- In various matters such as the co-ordinating committee and bodies of that kind, where members are appointed they will by their participation and deliberation make known their views so that in the end they will be expressed as a consensus; they will be part of the consensus in terms of the ordinary discussions on the formulation of ideas and recommendations. In the general situation the final and ultimate responsibility rests with the Commonwealth in terms of its head of legislation, but the aim of the Commonwealth will be at all times to reach a consensus with those on the spot, particularly the Northern Land Council and the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, the bodies which have profound interest in ensuring that the legislation is complied with. </para>

          <para>- The amendment is totally unacceptable to the Government. It is fundamentally opposed to the concept of the Supervising Scientist as the Government sees it. The Supervising Scientist is a vital person to carry out investigations and to make assessments and recommendations to the Minister. If the new clause were to be added, particularly sub-clause (3), it would make a recommendation of the Supervising Scientist mandatory if no motion for disallowance was moved. That amounts to the delegation of legislative authority in default of disallowance to an official who is not even responsible to the Parliament. That may well deprive the Government of the opportunity of assessing the recommendations in the light of all known circumstances. The fundamental principle is that this should be an advisory matter. My understanding is that that is what the Fox Committee intended. The Government opposes the amendment. </para>

        <para>The Opposition moves this amendment as it considers that the co-ordinating committee as proposed, and even as expanded by the Minister for Education <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick)</inline> in the amendments he has just moved, will still not be representative enough of all the bodies which will have an interest in this matter. We are still concerned that the committee as proposed will be dominated by pro-mining interests and will not properly represent the interests of those people who have objections to or reservations about mining. Honourable senators will notice that the bodies which we seek to be represented on the committee include prestigious scientific bodies such as the Australian Academy of Science, the Australian Conservation Foundation, which is the body which nationally represents the interests of conservationists throughout Australia and the Northern Territory and the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies, which we include because it represents nationally the interests of the Aboriginal people. We propose the inclusion of those bodies specifically, as well as the inclusion of the bodies mentioned in the Minister&#39;s amendment to this clause. </para>

          <para>- I wish to supplement <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ryan&#39;s</inline> comments. The Minister for Education <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick)</inline> will anticipate part of my remarks. I think that anyone who participated in the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry- that would include bodies such as the Australian Conservation Foundation- obviously obtained, even from other witnesses, an insight into what was contemplated. What I am about to say I say with all due respect. I do not claim that in the Public Service the old-boy network alone prevails. I think that on occasions it takes a very brave public servant to step out of line when he belongs to a department with a Minister who has a certain point of view. His job can be put on the line if he is thought to be troublesome. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The response might be that there is another side to the coin. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> from the Northern Territory hinted at the friction and rivalry which exists under the surface between the Territory Parks and Wildlife Commission, which is sponsored by the Northern Territory, and its Commonwealth counterpart, the National Parks and Wildlife Service. I would like to believe that the coordinating committee will consist of representatives who do not feel shackled. If the members of the Fox Inquiry, which held lengthy hearings, had consisted only of representatives of Commonwealth departments and had dealt only with mining companies we would have felt that it was a case of the government bureaucracy versus the mining companies. The Australian Conservation Foundation appears to be a happy blending of people and merits representation on the coordinating committees. </para>
        <para>If the Minister says that that is not on, I commend to him the comments I made during the second reading debate on this legislation, when I mentioned the role which the United States Senate played when the United States Army reclamation engineers ran unchecked. Senate committees had to curb some of the perhaps well-meaning excursions that ran counter to conservation philosophy. The searchlight has been placed on deliberations about the membership of the co-ordinating committee. I do not doubt the integrity, sincerity and dedication of members of Federal and State departments but I believe that they live in a sort of cocoon atmosphere. I believe that the leavening which would occur through discussion with representatives of the Australian Conservation Foundation and the other bodies mentioned in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ryan&#39;s</inline> amendment would promote open government, somethong about which we all talk but with which we often are reluctant to live. </para>

            <para>- I am in some difficulty because I first saw the Government&#39;s proposed amendments to this clause last evening. My Party has not had an opportunity to discuss the amendments in Caucus. I think my Party decided on the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ryan</inline> somewhat prior to knowing what amendments the Government intended to move. I criticise the Government for not making its proposed amendments available to us earlier. I think that the situation that that has created can now be rectified only by the acceptance of all or part of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ryan&#39;s</inline> amendment. </para>

        </continue>
        <para>The Environment Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Bill deals with an area which will be almost exclusively Aboriginal land under the provisions of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act. The Aboriginals have a good record of conservation. They spoil the environment less than the white population. They have a sacred affinity with the land. They have ownership of the land without interference in every respect except that the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly has control in, I think, four respects: One relates to entry and another to the preservation of wildlife. The Northern Territory Legislative Assembly has attempted to legislate on the preservation of wildlife but the legislation was found to be unacceptable by a committee which was set up by the Parliament. </para>
        <para>There is genuine conflict between the tribal Aboriginals and the Legislative Assembly in Darwin. From time to time this conflict becomes apparent. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff,</inline> the honourable member for the Northern Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Calder)</inline> and two Ministers made a trip to the Northern Territory. They came back with a proposed amendment to the legislation to the effect that we should appoint to the co-ordinating committee two members of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly and only one representative of the tribal owners of the land. Surely this cannot be justified. Two interests- oft times conflicting interests- are involved. Yet the tribal Aboriginal owners of the land have been relegated to a position of half the importance of the Legislative Assembly, which has very little control over land which has been conceded to be Aboriginal land under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act. Apparently we have made a decision on that issue. I think that the Northern Lands Council should have representation which is at least equivalent to the representation of the Legislative Assembly on that co-ordinating committee. I do not think that would hurt anyone. It would be a recognition of the equality of Aboriginal land owners with white land owners and, through the Aboriginals&#39; Land Council, they would have an Aboriginal tribunal which was equal to the white man&#39;s tribunal in the Northern Territory. But the Government is not going to do that. It is giving the white man&#39;s tribunal superiority over the Aboriginals&#39; tribunal on matters relating to Aboriginal land. This is completely foreign to the intention of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act. Acceptance of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ryan&#39;s</inline> amendment could possibly rectify the situation which has been created by the Minister&#39;s amendment, which provides for the appointment of two members of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly and one member of the Northern Land Council to the co-ordinating committee, which has just been carried. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ryan&#39;s</inline> amendment includes provision for a representative of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies. One would think that that body would have at least the approval of the Aborigines. I ask the Minister for Education <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick)</inline> to consider the inequality of the membership brought back by the delegation that visited the north, what it is now asking us to pass- apparently we have passed it- and the effect that this will have on the Aboriginal community. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">- Senator Mulvihill</inline>said that I had hinted at a breakdown in communications- they were not quite the words he used- between the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Northern Territory Parks and Wildlife Commission. I did not hint at that situation arising. I want to make a brief explanation. What I said, insofar as the Northern Territory Parks and Wildlife Commission is concerned, is that it is about time that outside influences got off the back of the Northern Territory because it is growing up and can look after itself. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> misled the Committee- I must correct him- when he said that there is a difference of opinion between the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly and the Aboriginal people. This is the sort of story that the Opposition likes to foster but the fact is that that is quite incorrect. </para>

        <para>The situation with regard to the legislation that is complementary to the Aboriginal Land Rights Act is that details of that legislation have been circulated among the Aboriginal people. Because the Aboriginal leader, Galarrwuy Yunupingu, has indicated that he needs more time to look at that legislation he has been given that time. That is an indication of the liaison that has been developed between the Majority </para>
        <para class="block">Leader of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, Paul Everingham, and the Aboriginal people. It is quite incorrect to say that there is a difference of opinion between the Aboriginal people and the Legislative Assembly. This story has been fostered by the Opposition. I suggest that we should do nothing here to try to break the union that has developed very well. Insofar as the membership of the Co-ordinating Committee is concerned, I state once again that the discussions in Darwin were three-sided. The Government took part. Northern Territory interests- that is, the Executive, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Calder</inline> and I- took part. The  Chairman  of the Northern Land Council, Galarrwuy Yunupingu, and all his advisers also were present. We came to a unanimous decision. All parties were happy with the conclusion reached. I see no reason why a unanimous decision which has been reached in Darwin should be altered here. </para>

          <para>- I must rise once again. I get somewhat irate when it is suggested that I have been making misleading statements to the Committee. If I have in any way misled the Committee, I apologise for it. However, one must accept that there is strong evidence to suggest that my comments were not misleading. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Temporary Chairman,</inline> you were the  chairman  of the committee of which I was a member and which went to the north and found great hostility to the Legislative Assembly. The former Majority Leader, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Letts,</inline> refused to talk because of some television program on Aborigines. The committee appealed to all parties for harmony. The Legislative Assembly&#39;s proposals for complementary legislation to the Aboriginal Land Rights Act were rejected outright by the Northern Territory Land Council with the result that numerous amendments were suggested to the Legislative Assembly. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> said, these have just been circulated for consideration and discussion. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I have copies of those amendments in my office, along with a letter from the Northern Land Council asking for opposition to be expressed to them because the amendments are not suitable and provide little improvement to the original legislation. A delegation from the Northern Land Council came to Canberra and asked for opposition to be expressed to the very proposals we are now discussing as they were not representative of their views. It would appear that if they were prepared to journey to Canberra to tell a different tale to the one told by the mission which journeyed from Canberra to Darwin, there is justification for believing that I am not trying to mislead the Committee but that I am reporting to the Committee the suggestions contained in those representations. If good rapport is being established between the Legislative Assembly and the tribal Aborigines in the Northern Territory, no one would suggest that this rapport would be upset or corrupted by giving Aborigines in the Northern Territory equality with the white man&#39;s parliament in the Territory. I do not think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> would suggest that we would be corrupting that cooperation and friendship by giving them equality with the white man. At least we can say to them that we think that they are entitled to that equality and that therefore it should be given to them. In the absence of any proposal by the Minister as to how he can get over the injustice created by the proposed amendments, I suggest that he should indicate at least some support for the reasonable amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ryan,</inline> which seeks representation from among a panel of organisations which have a great interest in this field. </para>

          <para>- I do not want to continue a running commentary but I want to clear the air. As I have said before, there is rapport between the Majority Leader of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly and the Aboriginal people. I could well imagine that there is a clause here or there in the complementary legislation that requires adjustment. As the doors are wide open to the  Chairman  of the Northern Land Council and as there is agreement between him and the Majority Leader, I suggest that that matter should be taken up there. I see absolutely no reason why the discussion of complementary legislation should be undertaken in Canberra. It is not our responsibility. I think it would be a very good idea if we were to leave the Territory to the Territorians and let them work it out. The Commonwealth Government should stay in the Federal sphere and let the States and Territories resolve matters in their own spheres. </para>

        <para>As far as representation on the Co-ordinating Committee is concerned, who said that the Minister will nominate particular people, white or black? Who said that the Legislative Assembly will nominate two white people? I suggest that we should leave the Territory alone and let it find its own way out. In these discussions it was the suggestion of the Majority Leader and me that the Northern Land Council should be represented. As this body develops, it will be found that there is more than one Aboriginal person on it. </para>

When the Minister takes back that list I wonder whether, if there is some question about the Australian Conservation Foundation comprising people from the south, he would consider recognising the claims of the conservation societies in Darwin to be represented upon that committee. Further to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff&#39;s</inline> comment about the need for better relations between the Northern Territory National Park and Wildlife Service and the Federal body, I wonder whether the Minister could use a parable to illustrate the functions of the proposed committee. If there were differences of opinion such that the Northern Territory wildlife people were to contend that water buffaloes should be retained as a commercial proposition and the Federal people were to advocate their total eradication in order to produce a better habitat for other forms of wildlife, would not that be a situation in which one could apply the litmus test to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline></para>

        <para class="block">Then we have a whole list of the duties of the coordinating committee. Those duties are directed to looking after the environment of the Alligator River, not the mining of uranium. It is to protect the environment, since mining is to take place, and to ensure that the land is reclaimed after mining has ceased. The co-ordinating committee is to include a supervising scientist, the Director of National Parks and Wildlife, two members appointed by the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, one appointed by the Northern Land Council and another chosen by the Minister. But does this in fact restrict the Minister? Sub-clause (2) of clause 1 8 provides: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The Minister shall cause to be prepared and kept a list setting out the name of each Department, authority, incorporated company or other body that in his opinion has an interest in uranium mining operations in the Alligator Rivers Region. </para>

        <para class="block">It is not those who have an interest in the environment of the Alligator Rivers Region who are to be listed; rather it is those who have an interest in uranium mining. The conservation organisations of Australia have been pursuing a protest concerning the mining of uranium. Surely they should be on the list of those eligible for appointment to an environment co-ordinating advisory committee. The wording of sub-clause (2) is such as to suggest that the very purpose of the Bill will be defeated. If the committee is to comprise, in addition to possibly the scientist and the Director of National Parks and Wildlife, 1 8 other persons who represent mining interests, one can appreciate the fears of those who oppose uranium mining. Sub-clause (2) should at least be expanded to include the phrase &#39;or other bodies&#39;, with the emphasis on conservation bodies rather than those interested in mining. </para>

            <para>-I will invite the Minister to look at what is proposed. I do not undertake that such an amendment should be made now. It could perhaps be made in another place. It is a long while since I tried to understand law, but as I understand the legal meaning of &#39;interest&#39; it would mean an interest, not merely in positive exploitation but also in preventing detriment. I will gladly pursue the honourable senator&#39;s proposal. </para>

          <para>- I understood the Minister, in answering <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh,</inline> to say that in this instance his own view was not far removed from that of the honourable senator. I can see no reason why such an amendment could not now be made. The Minister has promised to take the amendment back to the Minister in charge of the Bill in another place, but that may be too late. Would he agree to postpone the passage of the clause until there could be consultation with his officers and with the Minister with a view to including the amendment now? There would be plenty of time in which to do that. The Committee has a number of clauses to consider, and a number of other amendments are to be proposed. Once the Bill went back to another place there would then be no undue delay in its being passed. </para>

          <para>- I, of course, did not undertake to take an amendment back to the Minister, and certainly not the Opposition&#39;s proposed amendment. I wish to correct that misapprehension. I have no doubts as to the plain meaning of clause 18 (2). I believe that it incorporates precisely what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> has in mind; that it encompasses the environmentalists and conservationists as well as the exploiters. I have undertaken in good faith to take the Opposition&#39;s view to the Minister. Doubtless the lawyers can then examine it. The Bill will go back to the other place and any change could be made there. I suggest that the Bill should be carried now. </para>

          <para>- I want to direct some remarks to clause 20(2). The Minister for Education <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick)</inline> when speaking to clause 18(2) said that it had been a long time since he had studied legal interpretations. He said he thought the word &#39;interest&#39; applied to many people other than those engaged in uranium mining. He pointed out that the word could be applied to people who were opposed to uranium mining. The Minister&#39;s admission that he has not studied legal interpretations for some time is borne out by the fact that recent judgments of the High Court suggest that we cannot rely too much on the dictionary meaning or the generally accepted meaning of words. It is evident that we must seek the legal meaning of words that are used in documents. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>When the Senate debated the Australia-Japan Foundation Bill 1976 I drew attention to the fact that words of which we did not know the legal meaning were used. For instance, the legislation contained the words &#39;pecuniary interest&#39;. The legislation placed certain restrictions on a member of the Foundation who had a direct or indirect pecuniary interest in a matter being considered. Our founding fathers knew what the term &#39;pecuniary interest&#39; meant. We all thought we knew until the High Court judgment in a case against <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster.</inline> We are told that if one is a director of a company with in excess of 25 shareholders and one has a contract with an authority one does not have a pecuninary interest. Therefore one does not have a pecuniary interest if one &#39;s company has a contract with an authority. </para>

I mention to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> that great minds run in like channels and there have been great minds among Parliamentary Counsel from time to time. They have been more in line with the Cavanagh formula than with the words of which we do not know the meaning. I draw the attention of the Parliamentary Counsel to a more proper definition of &#39;pecuniary interest&#39; which is spelt out in Commonwealth legislation. A chief justice would have great difficulty in construing it to mean something that the average person does not think it means. I refer the Senate to section 15 (5) of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies Act.

          <para>- Clauses 27 and 28 require consideration from a substantial point. Clause 27 authorises the Supervising Scientist by notice to require any person to furnish him with such information in the possession of that person as is specified in the notice. Sub-clause (l)(b) provides that the Supervising Scientist may require a person to furnish to him, within such time and manner as he thinks fit, with such documents in the possession of the person as are specified, being information relevant to his functions. Honourable senators should note that sub-clause (2) states: </para>
        </talk.start>

          <para>A person shall not, in purported compliance with a notice served on him under sub-section ( 1 ), knowingly furnish information that is false or misleading. </para>
          <para>Penalty: $1,000 </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">To make my point I go now to clause 28, having noted that clause 27 deals with a case where the furnished information is false or misleading. Clause 28 provides for the situation where a person fails to furnish the information required, either in whole or in part. An unusual course is then taken. I hope that the Minister will tell me, if his advisers can give him the information, where any similar jurisdiction exists in any court. It would exist in the older courts, such as courts of equity, on discovery, to order information but what is the situation from the point of view of administering acts which are visited by penalties where the court is brought into it? That is by the way. </para>
        <para>Clause 28 deals with the case where a person has refused or has failed to comply with the notice to provide the information required. In that case the court may make an order requiring that person to furnish the information or documents. Sub-clause (4) of clause 28 states: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The court shall not, under this section- </para>
        </quote>
        <para>It does not say: &#39;Under this act&#39;; I emphasise that it says &#39; under this section &#39;-   . . require a person to furnish information or a document if the Court is satisfied that compliance with a requirement to furnish that information or document might tend to incriminate that person. </para>
        <para class="block">I suggest that what is wanted is not that dichotomy between clauses 27 and 28. It should not be a case where the court, if it is satisfied that the document might tend to incriminate, shall not order that it be furnished. We want a provision that says that nothing in either clause 27 or clause 28 shall be construed to require any person to furnish any document or information that might tend to incriminate him. </para>
        <para>Let me elaborate on that point. I have pointed out that, under clause 27, merely the supplying of false or misleading information, pursuant to the notice, is an offence. A person is not excused from that offence because he has told a lie while trying to cover up his crime. But what the law, other than this provision, guarantees to a person is a right not to be required to incriminate himself by official requirements of any authority except in certain cases- special cases. So it can be seen that under clause 27 a person is exposed to a penalty if he tells a lie to camouflage his criminal activities. But if he refuses to supply any information whatever, under clause 28 the court is forbidden to order the information- but here again it applies only if it is satisfied that the information may tend to incriminate. The point is that when one takes advantage of the privilege against self-incrimination, one does not have to go into the witness box. One just says: &#39;I refuse to give evidence because any evidence that I give may, in my opinion, tend to incriminate me&#39;. A person does not have to satisfy a court that the evidence would tend to incriminate him. He simply makes the statement. The Crown can get information aliunde- from another source- but that person has the right not to incriminate himself. </para>
        <para>I keep these things in mind because I am reminded of the time when the most cantankerous person in the world had his ears cut off for insisting upon his right not to tell, I think it was the Star Chamber, of the sermon that he had preached contrary to some ridiculous law relating to religion in 1640. When the Long Parliament came into office, in indignation at the injustice that had been done to him, it voted him no less a sum than &#163;5,000 in recompense. As I say, that was in 1640. Since then we have had established in our jurisprudence this right not to incriminate oneself. Therefore, in clause 27 there should be a provision that nothing in this clause shall require any person to furnish any document or information that might tend to incriminate him. That should be repeated for clause 28. It is not a case of satisfying the court that the evidence or document might tend to incriminate a person; it is a case of where the Crown has to prove that the person is not entitled to immunitythe privilege, as we call it in the law of evidence, not to give any evidence or furnish any document or information that might tend to incriminate him. </para>
        <para>I suggest that during the suspension of the sitting for dinner the Minister for Education should take the time to see that those two clauses are remoulded. Instead of having the present subclause (4) of clause 28 we should introduce a new sub-clause (4) that provides that nothing in clause 28 or clause 27 shall be construed so as to oblige any person to give information or to furnish documents that might tend to incriminate him. </para>

          <para>- In recent days there have been many statements about the great qualities of being a well-furnished lawyer. I am the most starkly unfurnished of people in the law. So that I can more fully understand <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> and on the basis of what I call plain words, being duly reproached, and properly so, by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> on that, I suggest that clause 27 does not in any way make it an offence to refuse to comply with the notice. It makes it an offence to furnish false or misleading information. Clause 27 implies only one offence. So, if a person feels that he is being incriminated, he has a simple resort which ought to be available under the law. He simply says: &#39;I do not wish to comply because it may incriminate me&#39;. If, instead of doing that, he gives false information then he is liable- I think quite rightly so- to a penalty. Clause 28, as I read it, says on the one hand that the court shall compel a person to publish information but on the other hand it says that if the publication of that information would incriminate the court shall not compel. It seems to me that that having been stated satisfies what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> is seeking. But if it does not, perhaps he could discuss the matter with the law officers during the suspension of the sitting and we could then see whether we can get to a more sophisticated and better furnished arrangement. </para>

            <para>-Thank you. Let us proceed in utmost goodwill. I point out that if, in my innocence, I were to get a notice from an official and I knew full well that I had 100 units of uranium and that this was contrary to the law of the land, and if, thinking that I would tell a lie, I said that I had only 50 units, I would be punishable under clause 27 and subject to a $1,000 fine. But if I knew my rights and if this Parliament had protected them properly, I would know that when I got that notice I need not answer it because to answer it would incriminate me. Having told a lie, as we simple country folk are often disposed to do rather than wrestle with the officials of Canberra or the Northern Territory, I could be fined for furnishing false information. But if the clauses were drafted properly and said that nothing in clauses 27 or 28 required any person to furnish documents or information that might incriminate him, I would not be liable to the penalty unless the Crown proved the offence otherwise than by information from my mouth. I say to the Minister that that is the point. Clause 27 provides only for false and misleading information but in that case one does not preserve the right of a person to be immune from incriminating himself. Under clause 28, when the court is approached for an order to require a man who has refused or failed to comply with the notice to furnish the information or document, that right is given after the court is satisfied. That is to say, it is after the onus has been placed on the defendant- and it is a misplaced onus. I hope I have made myself clearly understood. By breaking up the two situations into two clauses- giving at one stage the right against self-incrimination under clause 28, albeit with a misplaced onus, and having at the other stage, clause 27 dealing with the furnishing of false or misleading information in relation to a matter where a person could have claimed privilege from selfincrimination I have shown that the clause needs an explicit provision saying that nothing in these clauses shall require a person to furnish information or documents that might tend to incriminate. </para>

          <para>- If the matter raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> is to be discussed during the suspension of the sitting, then I suggest that some other points should be taken into consideration. Whilst I have always been opposed to trie necessity for a person to answer questions that might incriminate him, we as a Parliament have adopted that principle. The Evidence Act now provides that a person has no privilege where an answer may incriminate him. A lot of other Acts contain the provision that a person has no escape where an answer may incriminate him, but I believe the answer he may have given to the Supervising Scientist in investigating whether the Act has been breached cannot be used in a court of law. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>It appears to me that the offenders under this clause would be mining companies. We have to ask: Are the mining companies protecting the environment? Do they have documents which indicate they are not protecting the environment? Therefore, can they escape the provisions of the Act by not making that information available, just by stating that that might incriminate them? Is this yet another protection for the mining companies? </para>
        <para>Clause 29 deals with the right of the Supervising Scientist to enter premises, with the consent of the occupier to make a search. I do not suppose anyone could complain about that. Subclause ( 1 ) of clause 30 states: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Where the occupier of a building or place has refused, or is unwilling, to consent to the entry of the Supervising Scientist into that building or place under section 29, the Supervising Scientist may apply to the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory of Australia for an order under this section- </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">The Northern Territory Supreme Court may make an order granting entry to the Supervising Scientist so that he can see whether there has been any breach of the Act. I am concerned about this particular clause as it will apply to Aboriginal land and Aboriginal communities. It seems to me that it would be in breach of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act, which gives the tribal elders the right to say who enters their property. I visualise that there could be many areas of tribal land which have some sacred significance into which the elders would not wish to see any intrusion. Therefore, I doubt that it is right for the Scientist to expect to have the right to enter Aboriginal land or that it is right for the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory to order that the Supervising Scientist may enter the land if there is some objection by the </para>
        <para>Aboriginal people. I cannot visualise that the Aboriginal community would be offenders against the Act and, therefore, I think some protection should be afforded to them. I think some alteration should be made. Clauses 29 and 30 should not apply to Aboriginal settlements on Aboriginal land. I do not know how far the Minister for Education <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick)</inline> can go in giving this matter consideration. </para>

          <para>- I am not at liberty, of course, to do anything other than to express a view. My interpretation of the clause is that the consent of the occupier has to be given in the first place, and if that consent is refused, it would be necessary for the Supervising Scientist to go to the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory and to establish- the Court having full, conscious knowledge of all the traditions and sacred attitudes of the Aborigines- that there is an overriding public interest. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I am bound to say to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> that, provided that is the case, I would not grant the Aborigines total exemption from the overriding public interest even though I very much respect the profound and complex Aboriginal culture. I believe that the liberty of every individual citizen in this country must be put to the final test as to whether it contests the overriding public interest. So long as we take it to the courts of our land which fully understand these matters, in the absence of further pleading I rest assured that the court would not allow the Supervising Scientist to intrude unless the court were satisfied that there was an overriding public interest so to do. </para>

          <para>- I agree with the interpretation of that clause by the Minister for Education <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick).</inline> He upholds the principle of overriding public interest more than his Government upheld the overriding public interest in the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act. Public interest is not involved there. It is Aboriginal land. The Aborigines have full control. It has been argued in this chamber that the rights of the public applying to other land do not apply to land that has been granted to Aborigines under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act. Aborigines have the right to refuse persons entry to their area. The only exception is when there is a national interest in mining. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline>resides in Western Australia and in that State if a person is using his land for other purposes he can prevent mining on his land. But the Aboriginals cannot do that. In their case the public interest was overriden. The intention of the Government was to override public interest and to give greater consideration to Aboriginals but we are breaking down the principles embodied in the Aboriginals Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act by taking into consideration public interest and allowing someone to invade their property and to search their houses. That is the danger of this clause. This issue might not arise. In the interests of Aboriginals it should be put beyond doubt and they should be given some protection. </para>

            <para>- Prior to the suspension of the sitting there were several matters outstanding on which I agreed I would seek advice and report back to the Committee. One matter was that raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> concerning a conjunction of two clauses regarding possible penalties for non-disclosure of information. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> has had a brief opportunity to talk to the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Durack)</inline> and I have undertaken that I will pursue this matter further with the Minister concerned. On that basis <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> has indicated that he will not at this point pursue the matter further. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>The second matter concerns a question raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh.</inline> I have sought advice upon it. My attention has been directed to a similar provision in the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill under which land councils are given the same kind of rights and authority to take such action as is the Supervising Scientist. So in itself it is not a new provision, but my attention is directed to the fact, in conjunction with my own comments on the matter, that it is not compulsory that the judge shall make an order for access. The judge may at his discretion make such an order. My understanding therefore is that the judge would first of all look to the requirement ibr the Supervising Scientist to establish that there was a need beyond any doubt at all and without alternatives to get access, and that would take, in the judgment of those who advised me, a very considerable effort to establish. The judge, in the terms of the Bill, would have to assure himself that there were no other alternatives, that this was something without alternatives and indeed absolutely necessary in the discharge of the scientist&#39;s duties, and the judge of course would be aware of the reasons for non-access and the particular cultural reasons. Therefore, on this basis the judge has a discretion to allow access or not. In the ordinary situation of weighing up the matter and the fact that the provision had been used before in the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill it seems that that ought to be a satisfactory explanation. </para>
        <para>I do not think we can accept a situation in which there would be a total prohibition upon access. In other words, no citizen of Australia would have a right of total prohibition to prevent access. The ordinary law of Australia, I should think, must prevail in that if it can be established that for very good reasons and when there are no alternatives a lawful purpose must be pursued, with respect, I think it must apply to the Aborigine as it must apply to the non-Aborigine, consistent with the facts that in any case the judge is given discretion. On that basis I commend to the Committee the Bill as it now stands. </para>

          <para>- I can only voice my protest. I think the judge would act with caution in such a situation. I accept that, but it seems to me that for the first time there has been a breach of the land rights legislation under which tribal Aboriginals were supreme. I notice that under clause 30 if permission to enter is not given to the Supervising Scientist he may make an application to the Supreme Court. Under clause 30 (2) the person against whom an order has been sought has the right to appear in the proceedings. Sub-clause (3) reads: </para>

          <para>- I have been interested in this subject which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> raised prior to the suspension of the sitting. If I may be permitted I will take a minute to remind the chamber that in industrial matters industrial inspectors are given the right to enter premises almost on demand for the purpose of inspecting documents and records to ascertain whether there has been compliance with industrial awards. That has been a long-established authority to enter premises. </para>

            <para>- Business premises, yes. There has developed in this chamber a rather vigilant regard for the rights of property so that other officials usually are required before they enforce a right of entry to get a justice&#39;s warrant, a warrant authorising search which a justice should give only on a prima facie case of reasonable evidence that the entry is required to establish a prima facie offence. In this instance it is not an industrial matter. It is a new sphere of exceptional industrial development and so far as I know the draftsman- and let me be informed if my knowledge is insufficient- is informing us that the Supervising Scientist is entitled to enter but only with the consent of the occupier. However, if consent is withdrawn, for some reason all that the court is empowered to order under clause 30 is that the occupier give his consent. I will be pardoned in my despairing effort to acquire knowledge in this place if I confess to a dismay as to why the order of the court should not be that the Supervising Scientist shall be entitled to enter. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>I now come directly to reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> &#39;s inquiry which is the inquiry within my mind too. If the occupier having been ordered to give his consent says &#39;I am damned if I will give my consent &#39; or if he just says &#39; I do not consent&#39;, only contempt proceedings are available- long drawn out proceedings in which obviously the court proceeds with the utmost restraint. For my part I do not understand this new aspect of draftsmanship which puts within the mouth of the judge jurisdiction only to order that consent be given. What is required, if it is justified, is an order that the Scientist shall be entitled to enter. I point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> that the requirement to go before the judge is a much greater protection to the right of property than we usually accord to ordinary property rights which can be trespassed upon when there is a reasonable suspicion of an offence having been committed simply upon the obtaining of a warrant from a justice of the peace who has listened to an ex parte statement or seen an affidavit. </para>

          <para>- Before the Minister for Education <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick)</inline> replies I wish to comment on what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> said. I thank the honourable senator for his legal words of wisdom which could stand in good stead some defendant under the Act in the future. Perhaps the need to investigate would not be as urgent by the time the court hears a contempt charge against the defendant. However, I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> misses the point. We acknowledge the right of inspectors to enter premises to see that the law is being obeyed. We have accepted that right in industrial law and in every law which concerns the collection of a tax. I remember the law relating to the hen levy. There was a dispute over whether inspectors should get a warrant. The point I make is that we have placed certain areas of Australia under the sole control of Aboriginals. We promised that under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act. They are the supreme controllers of the land. Now we are whittling down that control. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I believe that the offending clause of this Bill is 29 (2) which provides that notwithstanding section 70 ( 1 ) of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act except in the performance of function under this Act or otherwise in accordance with the Act or a law of the Northern Territory a person shall not enter or remain on Aboriginal land. We offered this land to the Aboriginals. We got them to accept it. Now we are trying to whittle down their control of it. I do not think that I can take the point any further. I want to clarify the position. There is a difference between an industrial inspector and the Scientist under this Act. </para>

          <para>- I am grateful for the discussion from both honourable senators. It is my understanding that the judge&#39;s recourse would be to contempt proceedings. I acknowledge that this is a more gentle approach than the normal approach but I think that it has been done deliberately to try to exhaust every procedure without penalty. I have not studied this matter but I do not believe that the granting of land rights gives an absolute exemption to Aborigines against the ordinary running of the bulk of our ordinary Australian laws. For example, I cannot believe that the ordinary access in pursuit of criminal law could not be allowed. </para>

            <para>- I am simply saying that whether this comes under a law of the Northern Territory or under a Commonwealth law is irrelevant to the principle of whether one could have such access. 1 am now advised that under section 70 of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act except in the performance of function under this Act or otherwise in accordance with this Act or a law of the Northern Territory a person shall not enter or remain on Aboriginal land. Quite clearly the law of the Northern Territory operates. </para>

          <para>- The Opposition opposes this clause entirely. The purpose of the clause is, in fact, to ensure the confidentiality of business information acquired by the Supervising Scientist or his staff in the course of their duty. We are opposed to the enshrining of the principle of business confidentiality above the requirement for the Supervising Scientist to have the freedom to report any information that may be of interest to the Minister or the Parliament. </para>

          <para>-This clause concerns me. I raised the matter three hours ago by way of an aside. I am yet to understand why in this legislation there is such a concerted effort to preserve the secrecy of information that is acquired by the Supervising Scientist. If a proper case is made out to preserve secrecy then the safeguards of the public interest seem to me to be dependent upon a Minister&#39;s discretion. From that I do not always get full confidence. Clause 31(2) states:   . . a person . . . shall not, either directly or indirectly, except in the performance of a duty under or in connexion with this Act, make a record of, or divulge or communicate to any person, any information concerning the affairs of any other person acquired by him by reason of his office or employment under or for the purposes of this Act. </para>

        </list>
        <para class="block">Having reached an understanding that the Minister is obliged to lay before the Parliament the annual report and any additional reports required by the Minister, the Bill adds that the Supervising Scientist may from time to time furnish to the Minister also such other reports as he thinks fit. So the Supervising Scientist will be able to furnish an additional report to the Minister once a day and the Minister will thereby become bound to put that report before the Parliament. What is the need for the secrecy provision contained in clause 36? Why, under clause 31 sub-clause (3) paragraph (b) in particular, is it left to the Minister to determine whether it is in the public interest that any communication of information or any document furnished by the Supervising Scientist should be made available to a certain person? </para>
        <para>I point out the structure of this provision simply because we in the Parliament are entitled to a simple disclosure of matters of public importance which are going on at the expense of or in the interests of the government of the country. Under this provision the Supervising Scientist could tomorrow and every day thereafter, in the form of a report, state: &#39;I have received this information, Minister. My comment is that XY is transgressing your policy&#39;. He could state: &#39;My comment is that XY deserves a bonus for particular efforts to preserve the environment&#39;. He could make any comment he wished. If he put it in the form of a report to the Minister it would be bound to be tabled in the Parliament and would then become subject to parliamentary privilege for communication to the public. </para>
        <para>What in the name of Christmas is the principle by which secrecy is to be preserved under clause 31(3)(b), which provides that only in cases where the Minister forms an opinion that it is in the public interest that information gained by the Supervising Scientist should be communicated, not to the public, but to any person other than the Minister, the Permanent Head of the Department or an officer of the Department who is approved by the Permanent Head? Whence have we obtained that expression that within the departmental service of this country the head of a department can say: &#39;Bill Smith and Tom Jones are approved as authorised communicants, but the rest of the Department has no such approval &#39;? </para>
        <para>That is not the point. The point is that by way of reports all the information can be communicated to the Minister, automatically channelled to the Parliament and then, with full and absolute privilege, communicated by the Press to the public at large. Yet we are using clause 36 to entrench an absolute system of secrecy. Perhaps there are principles behind it which impelled those people who propose the Bill to establish this citadel of secrecy. I have shown how this secrecy provision will be simply demolished. If we have a Supervising Scientist who is bent upon providing to the public all the knowledge he has in his possession, he has only to put the information in the form of a report to the Minister from day to day and it will become public knowledge. I beg to be excused from participating in the stupidity which in clause 3 1 erects a citadel of secrecy, which is subverted by the following clause dealing with reports to Parliament. </para>

          </talker>
          <para>- I am grateful for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright&#39;s</inline> remarks, but I believe that what appears to him to be irreconcilable can be reconciled. It is a normal process of government that the servants of government preserve confidentiality of information which comes to them day to day. Subject to certain provisions contained in the Environment Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Bill the staff of the Supervising Scientist and the Supervising Scientist himself should not be exceptions to that requirement. The fundamental point is that it is for the Government and not an official to determine whether information received from a confidential source should be made public. Indeed, I should think that every day in every country Ministers make that precise decision. They receive information from their officers which is regarded as confidential and they make a decision as to whether it is made public. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I think that frequently Ministers will make a decision that certain confidential information in the public interest should be made available to a particular person. I can accept, for example, that confidential* material might need to be made available, shall we say, to the Australian Ionising Radiation Advisory Committee or to some other scientific body or some body with specialist knowledge. This might- be information which would normally be confidential because it concerned the performance of a particular enterprise but of which limited disclosure was required for a particular purpose.. </para>
        <para>The great safeguard in this provision- it is the answer to the Opposition&#39;s arguments- is that the Supervising Scientist, who will be a highly responsible and very senior officer and whose judgment day by day will be relied upon in terms of what is critical and what is not, will know that there is a safety valve against anything which is relevant or critical being hidden from the community if this is being done or if he thinks it is being done by the Minister. So there is no way in which a Minister can suppress something that the Supervising Scientist regards as critical. That, surely, is the maximum possible safeguard. The Supervising Scientist is to be an enormously responsible person. He will put in an annual report. He may also put in other reports. These reports are to be tabled. In a moment I will be moving amendments to clause 36 which provide that copies of the reports shall be laid upon the tables of both Houses of Parliament within 15 sitting days. This situation should be tightened as a result of these amendments. I do not believe that it is irreconcilable. I believe that normal confidentiality must be observed by the ordinary officers, who would receive a great deal of confidential matter. It is for Ministers- not officers- to judge what government material is released to the public. There is the magnificent safeguard of the Supervising Scientist&#39;s responsibility to publish. I commend the amendment. </para>

Personally, I am opposed to the amendment for the reasons I have stated previously. The Supervising Scientist must have consultations. That is understandable. This amendment is the result of the trip in a VIP aeroplane to the Northern Territory during sitting hours. It is a sell-out to the Legislative Assembly.

The Aborigines are not mentioned in this regard. They do not count any more. This is the whole basis of the Viner administration of Aborigines. They do not count in the Australian society. We take their land against their will and turn it into a national park. As I have said, they are possibly more concerned with conservation than is the white man. We consulted every white adviser in the Territory but no one thought to consult the Aborigines who are living there. It is their tribal land, but we do not consult them or seek their advice on conservation, which is wrong.

          <para>- I reject outright the statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh.</inline> Whilst I respect entirely his genuine concern for the Aborigine and the energy he has devoted to their welfare, he has no monopoly, either practical or theoretical, for their welfare. I think he would not mind me saying that as I say it with good will. There are to be Aborigines on the Coordinating Committee. The Supervising Scientist will be working directly with the Aborigines in that regard. In the whole matter of the management plan of the national park, the Aborigines will be consulted at every turn and the Supervising Scientist will be walking alongside them every step of the way. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I wish to make it absolutely clear that the tendency to say that the Government is favouring the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, as though it was an alien body, and ignoring the Aborigines is wrong, lt is strange that we are talking about what will be a sovereign governing body of a Territory and ultimately a self-governing State- that is, the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly- and seeing it as some alien thing. It is extraordinary that we believe that there is some glory or deity in the sovereignty of the Senate or the House of Representatives but see something imperfect or wrong in a mirrorimage body, the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. I think it is an error of judgment to do so. We should all hope for the long term success of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. The Assembly will walk alongside the indigenous people. It will have a profound effect upon the day by day lives of the Aboriginal people and they are not to be regarded as something alien. It is to be regarded as the sovereign government of the Territory in which these things are occurring. Therefore, we should co-operate with it fully. </para>
        <para>Under the Constitution the Commonwealth has direct responsibility for Aborigines. In a very practical way the Commonwealth is carrying out that responsibility. It will from time to time act in co-operation with and as a partner to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. The Commonwealth will not abdicate from its responsibilities to the Aborigines. I make it abundantly clear that the Fraser Government is second to none in its practical desire to further the welfare and dignity of the Aborigines. Nothing in this Bill detracts from that. The reverse is true. As we establish the Kakadu Park, as we set up mechanisms to ensure the preservation of the ecology, as we define the sacred lands, surely we build the dignity, the freedom of choice and the fulfilment of the Aborigine. I would like to put that on record. </para>

        <para>Minister for Education, or that anyone in the Fraser Government, has made on Aborigines. Their statements have been admirable. It is their actions that I am concerned about. </para>
        <para>Although the Minister says, &#39;We will be consulting&#39;, we do not know who the Supervising Scientist will be. Whether he will consult or not we do not know. But the Government does not trust him too far. His consultation with the Director of National Parks and Wildlife is made mandatory. He is not trusted to consult with everyone. His duty is set out in the statute, so he will have to fulfil it, but there is no concern about Aborigines. We are told, &#39;He will consult, because we make statements that he will &#39;, but the Government does not bind the scientist towards the Aboriginals as it does towards the director. Why is this? </para>
        <para>We have to face the whole situation. Whilst that is a winning plea as election propaganda, in fact the legislation of this Government is wholly anti-Aborigine. That is shown again here. There is surely no harm in asking the Supervising Scientist to consult, and heed, the Aboriginals as to what should occur on their land; but we are told &#39;He may do it, we hope that he will, but we do not put him under the same compulsion to do so in their case &#39;. </para>

          <para>- I have, and always have had, regard for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> &#39;s attitude towards the Aboriginal people, and to the responsibilities that he had when he was Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, but he should realise that the attitude he is now taking stamps him as living in the past. Times are changing. When he speaks of a sell-out to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, he should realise that that Assembly represents the people of the Northern Territory; that from 1 July it will, in its own right, have control of the Territory. I regret that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> should have continued to adopt that frame of mind.  His  attitude to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly and to the people of the Territory is divisive. </para>

        <para>Ours is now a Territory approaching statehood. We are responsible for our own land and must not think in terms of white and black. We must think of ourselves as the people of the Northern Territory regardless of colour. Let us not be paternal. Let us recognise that times are changing; that the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly represents the people of the Territory as a whole. I look forward to the day, which I believe is coming, when we shall see more and more participation by Aboriginal people in the government of the Northern Territory. That is certainly to be encouraged. I see nothing wrong with this situation at all. Earlier I did, in that the Federal Parliament was being paternal towards the Northern Territory. It had not realised that times were changing. The Territory has a right to have a say in these matters. It will have it, and when I speak of the people of the Northern Territory I speak of them all, white and black together. </para>

          <para>- Certain things that have been said call for a reply. The Minister for Education <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick)</inline> acknowledges my sincerity on the Aboriginal question, as does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff.</inline> I too acknowledge that I have not a monopoly of sympathy for Aboriginals. Indeed, I believe I am only one of what is the majority of Australians; that the minority group is represented by this Government. I admit that I am living in the past. 1 am living in that period of history when Labor tried to lift up Aboriginals and give them something. I see that movement declining but I am still hopeful that we can return to that era and really do something for the Aboriginal people. My remarks do not attempt to ignore the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. The amendment gives recognition to it, and necessitates consulting with it and accepting its advice. I want only to put on an equal footing with it the Aboriginals of the Northern Territory. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> is coming very close to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sheil</inline> in his action. </para>

            <para>- I would be very willing to withdraw it. He says: &#39;Now the Territory is going to come into its own; we are going to have self-determination on 1 July; we will rule as one people, white and black. We are going to combine as Northern Territorians, no matter what the colour of our skins&#39;. But unfortunately those with dark skins have had bad treatment from Australian society. That Government. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> &#39;s Government, recognises this fact. It has given them a benefit- land rightsover and above the ordinary white citizen of Australia. Now we have an attempt to take them back to the stage they were in before those concessions were made, to the days of nonrecognition. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> says that he hopes to see more in the Legislative Assembly; that they can get into parliament and thus control themselves. </para>

        <para>No privilege is extended to these unfortunate people -who have for some 200 years been the underdog. The Government was forced to give them some benefits in the form of land rights but there is no attempt to recognise them. I say that we acknowledge the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. We acknowledge as equal to it the Aboriginal community on that section of the Northern Territory over which the Federal Government has given it control. As to that land over which the Federal Government has given them control, they should have the say. They, as well as the Northern Territory Government, should be consulted as to the future. The Minister has uttered nothing but pious platitudes about what the Government will do for the Aboriginals of the Northern Territory. I ask the Government to show its loyalty, its faith, in the legislation instead of making it mandatory for the scientist to consult certain people but not to consult the Aboriginal people. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">- Senator. Cavanagh&#39;s</inline>remarks are still divisive. There is absolutely no argument in the Northern Territory that this piece of country that we are talking about, the Kakadu National Park, belongs to the Aboriginal people. Under the current situation the Aboriginal people have leased it as a national park to an organisation that is running it as such. It is Aboriginal country that has been leased as a national park to this organisation. It is quite proper that the people of the Territory, both black and white, participate in the running of this organisation. Earlier the people of the Northern Territory had no say whatsoever because this was a federal matter. Now the people of the Northern Territory have a say in the running of the park. The Aboriginal people are participating in the day to day running of the park. They are having a say and they are consulting with this organisation to which they have leased the land under the arrangement proposed by the Fox report. </para>

          <para>- I regret that I must delay the Committee. However I believe statements which are not correct should be rectified. First, there is an acceptance that the park area is Aboriginal land. The Aboriginals have not leased it to anyone. The legislation we are considering seeks to provide machinery to enable the Aboriginals to lease the land. The Fox Committee made a recommendation which the Government could adopt or reject. As I have pointed out, the Aboriginals have not been able to lease the land to anyone. This will be the situation until these Bills are passed. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Aboriginals on the Northern Land Council came to meet members of the Labor Party&#39;s Aboriginal affairs committee. They asked us to oppose certain sections of the legislation, particularly that section of the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Amendment Bill which provides that if they refuse to lease their land the Minister can appoint an arbitrator to decide whether they must lease it and, if so, the terms and conditions of such lease. The Aboriginal community has not leased the land and it is opposed to leasing it under the provisions of the wild life legislation. They believe that the land should be a national park and under Aboriginal control. </para>
        <para>I have no doubt that this legislation will be carried because of the numbers that the Government has at its disposal. My whole purpose in raising this matter is not to divide the people of the Territory, because they are divided enough now. This situation will remain while the Legislative Assembly and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> maintain their attitude in respect of Aboriginal communities. </para>

            <para>-They are divided. Out of this legislation I want to see the rights of Aboriginals preserved in respect of land that we have given to them. It is their land. I am not trying to give them exclusive rights over that land. I say they should be consulted at all stages in a manner equal to the way in which the Legislative Assembly is consulted. No one has argued against this proposal. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> says that the Aboriginals will be part of the Northern Territory and as such they will have a say. The Minister says they will be consulted all the way along the line. But whilst we make it mandatory to consult with other people there is nothing in the legislation to make it mandatory to consult with Aboriginals. </para>

Let us not forget that a Liberal-Country Party government was in office for 23 years during which time these people were suffering. That government had time to do something then. However, it took a Labor government to give Aboriginals land rights. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> got up in this place and claimed that it was a Liberal-Country Party government that did it. The Labor Government introduced the legislation. As has been said often in this place, legislation to give Aborigines land rights was introduced into the Parliament on 1 1 November 1975 when the Labor Government was unceremoniously sacked. Therefore, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> should not get up and accuse the Labor Party of doing nothing. </para>

        <para>Everything that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> has said and done, first as a back bencher, then as a Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and now again as a back bencher, has been in the best interests of Aborigines.  His  integrity in these matters is beyond question. It is a sad state of affairs when a new senator from the Northern Territory, who has not known <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> for very long, gets up and accuses him of living in the past. We who have known <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> for a long time acknowledge that he has always been a champion for the underdog and that he will not be browbeaten by anyone no matter what is said.

Nobody in this country has tried harder to unite the blacks and the whites than has <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh.</inline> If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> would like to read some speeches in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> he will find that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> is on record on many occasions as defending Aborigines against <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff&#39;s</inline> colleagues in the National Country Party who have tried to exploit them over the years. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> gets up and accuses <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> of trying to divide the community in the Northern Territory. He says: Leave it to us in the Northern Territory&#39;. But what did <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> do in the Northern Territory in all the years he had the opportunity to do something for the Aborigines? In the short time I have been a member of this place I have been out on settlements in the Northern Territory and I know that the honourable senator had the numbers in the Legislative Assembly of which at one time he was the  President.  What did he try to do when he had the numbers- and when he had no opposition at all? He could have done everything in those years which he now says the Government will do if we hand over everything to the Government. </para>
        <para>AH that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> is seeking in speaking to this amendment is to ensure that the Aborigines of the Northern Territory are given the full recognition and the same rights as the white community. Of course, as I said when I spoke last night on other legislation, all that people in the Northern Territory- people like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff-</inline> want to do is to get control of the mining interests in the Territory so that they can exploit the situation to the fullest and get every dollar they can out of uranium mining for their mining company friends. That is all they are after. Therefore I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> not to get up here again and say unkind words about <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> because I will not stand for it. </para>

          <para>- I oppose this amendment for the same reason that I opposed the amendment to clause 33. 1 do not want to go over it again because the debate tends to develop into a defence of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh.</inline> I have no embarrassment about taking this action. If my prestige in the Territory is not high enough to carry me through now I am sure it will be when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff&#39;s</inline> remarks are distributed throughout the Territory. If this national park is to be anything there must be a tri-party agreement between the Federal Government, the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly and the Aboriginal community which owns the land. That is not dividing the issue; it is a recognition of the fact. Now we find that the Minister shall cause a copy of any report furnished to him and laid before the Parliament to be furnished to the &#39;Minister of the Northern Territory&#39;. However, where does the poor Aborigine get his information and learn what is in the report? I do not know. Possibly he has to wait until it is published in the newspaper. He has been completely excluded from this arrangement. This is an arrangement between the Federal Government and the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly and the Aborigines are left out in the cold. This is so despite all we hear about what this Government is doing for Aborigines. I just leave it at that. The remarks I made about the amendment to clause 33 apply equally to this amendment. I want to know what is the violent objection that this Government has to including the Aborigines, the owners of the land, as equal partners in this venture? </para>

          <para>- I do not think that those comments deserve a reply. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh,</inline> if he is nothing else, is a student of Parliament and of parliamentary procedures under which he knows that the way in which one makes a document available to the public, whether the public be Caucasian or Aboriginal, is for the document to be tabled in Parliament. It then becomes available to the public, whether European or Aboriginal. The best way to facilitate the availability of such a document to the Aboriginal people in the Territory is to table it in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly where the Aborigines as full citizens of the Territory and of that Parliament will have total access to it. They will get access to it in the same manner as every other citizen, that is, by direct handing of the document to them or by direct mail instantaneously once the document is tabled. There can be no neglect at all of this provision. Day after day we table documents here which are imperative to the interests of sections of people in this country. We do not race out and give copies of the documents to the people before we table the documents in the Parliament. The whole basis of the Westminster system of Parliament lies in the fact that the publication of documents is through the table of the Parliament. It is not to be said that this amendment is in any way a denigration of the Aboriginal people. It is the procedure by which they as full citizens are enabled as quickly as possible to get total access to documents and they will get that access equally and as speedily as every other Australian. </para>

          <para>- The Minister for Education <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick)</inline> is correct. As a student of the Parliament, I know that the procedure which he has outlined is the correct procedure. We have received an assurance that the Aborigines will get these documents but there is no such provision in the legislation. If the Minister for Education were responsible for seeing that they did and we had a guarantee that he would remain responsible for that we could rest assured that the Aborigines would get them. However, we embody strict guidelines in legislation to ensure that, if some other Minister with less responsibility than the Minister for Education is made responsible for this matter, he will not do something that the Minister for Education would never anticipate being done. Ministers do not have a record of holding office in perpetuity. Sometimes they die; sometimes they resign; sometimes they get promoted; sometimes they are sacked. Who the next Minister will be we do not know. Therefore, when we provide security for the Parliament and for the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly in respect of this matter we should give security also to the Aborigines just in case the next Minister is not as reputable as the Minister for Education. After all, within the near future we could have even a Labor Minister. </para>

        <para>What the Bill says is that a report shall be laid before each House of the Parliament within 1 5 sitting days after the report is received by the Minister and that a copy of it shall be furnished to the &#39;Minister of the Northern Territory&#39;. It does not say that the report shall be laid before the Northern Territory Parliament. I suppose that the &#39;Minister of the Northern Territory&#39; would then lay the report before the Northern Territory Parliament. It then would become public property and the newspapers would take it up and publish it. But can the Minister tell me what newspapers are circulating in the Alligator Rivers Region? Which of the multitude of newspapers that go to the outback Alligator Rivers Region do the Aborigines read? We would want to know that to ensure that the Aborigines get the information that is contained in the report. Can they speak the language in which the newspaper is published? While this is not a problem for the &#39;Minister of the Northern Territory &#39; it is a problem for the Aboriginal community. So, despite the nice words that have been said by the Minister, this amendment again means the rejection of one of the parties to the agreement. </para>

          <para>-  The Opposition opposes the amendment moved by the Minister. In content, it conflicts with the amendment moved by the Opposition <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> the motion for the second reading of the Bill, which was to the effect that certain pastoral leases should be assumed immediately by the Commonwealth and made part of the national park without reference to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. We were unsuccessful in moving that amendment but we still persist with the view that the Northern Territory administration should not be required to give its consent to certain actions of the Commonwealth. We still believe that the Commonwealth should assume those pastoral leases immediately and not be obliged to get the consent of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly in order to do so. </para>

          <para>-  The matter I wish to raise- I do not think it concerns a hypothetical situation- is whether under the new system according to this legislation the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, like any State government, would line up in the queue to partake of any nature conservation grants that were made from time to time. It may be argued that some particular area justifies the making of a grant, just as happens in a recipient State. If the Federal National Parks and Wildlife Service puts up the argument that the Northern Territory should receive a nature conservation grant, would the spending of any grant apportioned be on a team spirit basis by the two park systems? </para>

What it basically means is that after we have constructed these parks, the Northern Territory government can, in effect, dedicate other areas as national parks by its own decision, just as the States can do. When it does that, the power of the Commonwealth to acquire land for other purposes is qualified by this provision. There is nothing new in that. As I have said, it is identical with what exists already. As to what would happen in any arrangement between the Commonwealth and the States, in particular in regard to the Territory after it gains self-government, in relation to the money supplied, I would imagine that this would be by way of an arrangement under section 96 of the Constitution in the ordinary way in which one would make such an arrangement. But if the Northern Territory government dedicates a park of its own then that park will function as a State park, the same as happens in any other State. </para>

          <para>-  I feel that I must add something to this debate about this matter because I have keen interest in it. I have an obligation as a result of the visit of a delegation from the Northern Land Council which a few weeks ago in Canberra had discussions with various people concerning Aboriginal Affairs. I am very much opposed to this clause. I should have liked to have spoken on this matter during the second reading stage of the debate but, apparently because of some arrangement between the Opposition and the Government, I found at the last minute that I was unable to do so. We have a National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act which does not include a reference to Aboriginal land. The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Act provides for the appointment of an arbitrator if Aboriginals do not agree to the leasing of their land. The point is that the Aboriginals have not leased it yet. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The Northern Land Council is opposed to the right of an arbitrator to decide whether Aboriginal land shall become a national park or whether it shall be controlled by someone else. In the Northern Territory we are dividing up the northern area into parts on which Aborigines may live, some parts for plants and wildlife, and some parts over which mining interests can take control. The mining interests are given first preference if they decide to mine. If a dispute arises about whether land should be for the use of Aboriginals or for growing trees, of course the trees take preference over Aboriginals and the Aboriginals are kicked out because we want to preserve some flora or fauna. I recall <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright&#39;s</inline> remarks about Lake Pedder in Tasmania. He referred to the benefits the people of Tasmania would receive from the proposal to build a hydro-electric scheme for the supply of electricity. Then Moss Cass went there, and found a wizened old worm under a rock and immediately said: &#39;This project must be stopped so we can preserve this worm &#39;. Of course, if in the Northern Territory we see a frizzled, half-alive worm under a rock and it is desired to preserve that worm so that our children and our children&#39;s children for generations to come can go and see a dried up, frizzled half-alive worm then that area has to be preserved for the worm, not for the Aborigines. That is the position: The worm gets preference over the Aborigines. </para>
        <para>It is possibly to my discredit that the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act was introduced by the Labor Government. It is one of the most vicious, discriminatory Acts on the Commonwealth statute books. This Act is an infringement of human rights and civil liberties. I do not think that anyone examined it when it passed through the parliament, It gives a warden the right to arrest people, to seize a vehicle and to keep it for 60 days. If he launches a prosecution against an individual he can keep that vehicle until the case is heard. Therefore, we find that the Aboriginals are placed under this restrictive clause. Their vehicles can be seized; they can be arrested but they need not be charged. That is what we are doing to the Aboriginal people in this legislation. </para>
        <para>Those people who want to protect the land for the dried up old worm or for some stunted scrub are so sincere about this matter. Let them protect that land but not to the detriment of the Aboriginal people in the area. If there cannot be agreement on the matter, I suppose it is reasonable that an arbitrator should be appointed to decide who is superior, who should get the benefit of this land- whether it be the conservationists who want to preserve it for the worm or the Aboriginal people. The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Act makes provision for an arbitrator to be appointed but the Aboriginals are concerned because section 7(2) of the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act states: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Subject to this section, the Governor-General may- </para>
          <list type="loweralpha">
            <item label="(a)">
              <para>by Proclamation, declare an area specified in the Proclamation to be a park or a reserve and assign a name to that park or reserve; and </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(b">
              <para>) by the same or by another Proclamation, declare the whole or a specified part of the park or reserve to be a wilderness zone. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">Therefore, it is not a question of whether the Aboriginals consent; it is not a question of arbitration; it is a question of a proclamation by the Governor-General, obviously acting on Executive Council advice. The Ministers in Canberra decide that they will declare an area. This does not apply only to the Alligator Rivers Region. It applies to all areas and territories. Therefore, the Aboriginals are forced under. They did not mind giving way to the conservationists when they were not involved. But this particular clause seeks to include Aboriginal land in the definition of &#39;area&#39; in section 7 of the Act, which provides that the Governor-General may issue a proclamation. </para>
        <para>Therefore, the Aboriginal community is brought under the power of the Act whether they want it or not. They are brought under repressive sections of the Act. An Aboriginal going about his lawful and traditional way of life, perhaps performing some sacred obligations of his tribal customs, under this Bill can now be arrested for carrying on the traditions of his tribe in a particular area if a warden, without a warrant, decides to arrest him and seize his vehicle. This is foreign to Aboriginals. The Government will not get their co-operation in any way by forcing them to come under the terms of such an Act. Therefore, I support the opposition to the inclusion of this new clause 5 (a) (aa). The matter has operated satisfactorily, but it is unforgivable for the Government to want to involve Aboriginals and apply it to all territories. </para>

          <para>- Much of what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> has said relates not to this Bill but to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill which is now a statue. Indeed, many of his comments about the arbitration of an agreement between the Northern Land Council and the Director relate to that Act. It is important, I think, to look at the basic principles.

          <para>- I want to clarify this question because obviously I did not make myself understood and I apologise for that. It is a weakness. An Irishman is allowed to speak until he is understood, I believe. I cannot see how I am confusing this with the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act. Proposed paragraph (aa) is in the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Amendment Bill, not in the Land Rights Act. How on earth anyone can say it is in the Land Rights Act is beyond me. I read section 7 (2) (a) of the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act which gives the Government power to make proclamations. There were some things that I would have said on the amendments to the Land Rights Act if I had had the opportunity, but this is the one that definitely gives the power. As the Minister for Education has demonstrated, the Fox report said that the area should be made a national park under a perpetual lease to the Director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service. Of course the lease has to be voluntary. There is no suggestion in the recommendation by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Fox that if the Aboriginals do not agree the Government should confiscate the land. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>There may be justification for the appointment of an arbitrator if the Aboriginals are opposed to the proclamation but are prepared to enter into an agreement with the Commonwealth to preserve the area as a national park. There is no suggestion in the report by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Fox that the provision in section 7 (2) (a) which gives the right to acquire by proclamation land for development into a national park should ever be permitted in respect of Aboriginal land. Therefore all that the Minister has said is no defence to compelling Aboriginals to give up their lands. I think it is agreed that if it is in a national park area they should give it up but in view of the multitude of powers that the director has and the controls by which the Aboriginals are compelled to abide, and which they do not understand, to my mind that is something criminal and should not be allowed to happen. </para>

          <para>- Before the Minister for Education <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick)</inline> comments on the amendment, I feel that the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> and the forebodings of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> necessitate some explanation. If the Government does not accept our amendment what penalties will exist wherever the township is established if people in the township go out on the rampage? With all due respect to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff,</inline> people may have high-powered rifles. This point was made by Professor Harry Messell. What penalties will apply if people in a mining town transgress wildlife ordinances? During the Estimates Committee hearings <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> admitted that it will be a king-sized job to try to make people conscious of the environment. People will be stuck out there. They may be bored. There are so many problems in isolated areas. With all due respect to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh,</inline> I sometimes believe in penal clauses. It depends on who they are directed against. I am anxious to know how these town people will be controlled. They could get high-powered rifles and go out on an orgy of destruction. </para>

          <para>- The Government will oppose the amendment, primarily because it is superfluous. Within the existing Bill there is more than ample opportunity for consultation.

        <para class="block">Bill makes extensive provision for consultation at the plan of management stage. I refer honourable senators to the amendment to section 1 1 of the principal Act. Consequently, extensive provision is already included for consultation on the establishment of a town. I repeat that the proposed amendment is superfluous. </para>
        <para>With regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> &#39;s comments, no township can be established or defined without a plan of management. That plan of management is prepared by the Director after very considerable consultation. Within that township the authorities have full control to see that there is no breach of the law. As to the town&#39;s people going out into the national park or wilderness areas, ample provision is made in the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act for wardens and rangers to police their activities just as in any other situation. This would occur particularly because of the highly sensitive nature of the area concerned. </para>

          <para>- The Government will oppose the amendment. It believes that the amendment is not only unnecessary but it could aiso have some unfortunate and unintended effects. The proposed amendment would require the Director to relinquish to the Commonwealth any interest held by him in land in a park within the Region for the purposes of Part II of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act. The requirement would also apply even if no land rights claim were made. The Director&#39;s leasehold interest granted by the Aboriginal land trusts could also be affected even though the land is already vested in those land trusts. The Director is subject to ministerial direction. If a land rights claim were upheld and the Director refused to surrender his interest in land within a park the Minister could use this power of direction. The amendment is, therefore, unnecessary and unfortunate in its possible consequences. </para>

          <para>- I do not wish to move an amendment to Clause 8, but I wish to take the opportunity presented by the consideration of clause 8 to correct a misleading statement which was made during the second reading debate this afternoon. Clause 8 deals with provisions relating to mining within the National Park area. In my remarks on that provision during the second reading debate I quoted from an article which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Mark</inline> Oliphant wrote for the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> published on 9 May 1978, in which he described the effects of radon gas, which is one of the inevitable consequences of the milling and mining of uranium. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Later in the debate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> disagreed with the views expressed in <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Mark</inline> Oliphant &#39;s article which I had put forward. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> made a claim which I believe seriously misrepresents the position of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Mark</inline> Oliphant with respect to uranium mining. As I recall, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> claimed that he had had a conversation with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Mark</inline> Oliphant and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Mark</inline> Oliphant was not opposed to uranium mining and did not consider it hazardous. I am not quoting <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> &#39;s exact words, but that was certainly the effect of the claim he made. </para>
        <para>During the suspension of the sitting this evening, I telephoned <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Mark</inline> Oliphant because I was concerned that his position had been misrepresented. He told me that he was opposed to uranium mining. He said he was against uranium and the use of uranium reactors.  His  main reason for opposing the use of uranium reactors was not based on health considerations but rather on proliferation considerations. He does not believe that there are any safeguards which can guarantee against the proliferation of nuclear reactors. He does not believe that written guarantees regarding safeguards provide any assurance that there will not be a proliferation of reactors. That is the main reason for his opposition. </para>
        <para>He did say that there were steps which could be taken to safeguard workers in the industry against the very harmful effects of radon gas. He said that these were not difficult steps to take but would be very costly. Indeed, he described these steps in the article from which I quoted. They involved such measures as complete washing down of workers, providing a separate air channel for them and so forth. I take this opportunity to correct the misrepresentation made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> with regard to the position of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Mark</inline> Oliphant who is against uranium and against the use of uranium reactors. </para>

        <para class="block">This amendment relates to a report given to the Minister which would indicate whether the Director of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service had in fact complied with an agreed plan of management. The Opposition does not believe that the Minister should determine the matter other than in accordance with the plan of management. We believe, therefore, that the wording of the amendment will, if accepted, tighten up the intent of the Bill, will make it more explicit and will give a clear direction to the Minister as to his function in determining the matter. </para>

          <para>- The Government opposes the amendment. The amendment as proposed would restrict the Minister&#39;s powers. It is possible that the Minister may wish to go beyond the strict requirements of the plan of management to ensure equity in a matter. On the other hand ministerial responsibility to Parliament would ensure that the Minister would not give directions which failed to ensure the observance of the minimum standards of the plan and that he would not abuse his discretion by going too far in the other direction. The Minister&#39;s power would not affect any legal remedies against the Director to ensure compliance with his statutory duty. On those bases, the Government opposes the amendment. </para>

I imagine that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Mark</inline> would support the exact statement I made, namely, that there is no danger in the mining and processing of uranium. The only time we have to worry about uranium is when that mineral is converted to energy and we have to deal with the disposal of the wastes associated with it. I just mention that point. </para>

            <para>- Early in February of this year I was notified by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ray</inline> Lette of the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union in Queensland of a situation concerning the refusal to pay unemployment benefit to workers at the Roma meatworks. My information on this matter is as follows: Anderson &#39;s meatworks in Roma closed on 24 November 1977 for its annual shutdown. Certain members of the union applied for unemployment benefit when their leave entitlements were exhausted. I looked at this matter after <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lette</inline> referred it to me and it seemed to me that these employees, after having found themselves out of work, had been wrongly refused unemployment benefit. If I might digress for a moment, I ask the Minister for Education <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick)</inline> whether the Minister for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Guilfoyle)</inline> will be in the chamber this evening. If she will not it would probably be worth while if I continued what I want to say at a later stage. </para>

          <para class="block">When I looked at the reply and at the circumstances surrounding the unemployment of these particular meat workers, I was convinced that some of them were, in fact, eligible for unemployment benefit and that their claim for unemployment benefit had been wrongly refused. I made this known to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lette</inline> but he had had already written to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal on behalf of his members. I think it is pertinent that I read the letter because it outlines the circumstances quite clearly. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lette</inline> &#39;s letter to the appeals tribunal read as follows: </para>

            <para>I am writing in regard to the &#39;ineligibility&#39; of the members of the AMIEU, Roma district to receive unemployment benefits within the meaning of the Social Services Act. </para>
            <para>Andersons (Roma) Meat Works closed down on November 16, 1976 and did not reopen until April 15, 1977. During this five months period, extensive alterations were made to the slaughter floor. The employees went on their annual leave or their pro rata annual leave as of November 16, 1976, and on termination of that leave, duly made application for Social Services Benefits and were paid same. </para>

          <para class="block">If I may interrupt the course of the letter, that was the situation in 1976. When the Meatworks closed down they were paid unemployment benefit if they were not able to find work in the area. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lette</inline> &#39;s letter continues: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The works duly opened on 15 April, 1977 and continued processing through to 24 November, 1977 and then ceased operations indefinitely. Indications are that they will re-open on approximately 3 1 January weather permitting. </para>
            <para>The employees of Roma meat works on 24 November, 1977 in the main, would have accrued approximately <inline font-style="italic">2Vi</inline> weeks annual leave credits for being employed from 15 April, 1977 to 24 November, 1977. Some of them would not have accrued annual leave at all. The award makes provision for having to be employed more than one month before qualifying for pro rata annual leave. </para>
            <para>On completion of their annual leave credits because of them being unemployed, they registered for Social Service Unemployment Benefits. These applications were denied because they were deemed &#39;not eligible to receive unemployment benefits with the meaning of the Social Services Act &#39;. </para>

          <para>I have sighted a reply from the Department of Social Security to one of the members of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lette</inline> &#39;s union, after that member made a claim for unemployment benefit. In part, that reply said, &#39;As you are on annual stand-down, you are not considered to be eligible to receive unemployment benefit within the meaning of the Social Services Act, and your claim has therefore been rejected &#39;. </para>
          <para>This particular member of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lette</inline> &#39;s union finished work on 24 November, 1977. On 28 November, 1977 he registered for unemployment benefit and was subsequently interviewed on 19 January, 1978. The fact that this person was genuinely unemployed is shown by the length of leave entitlement he had when the works closed down. This entitlement was for two weeks and four days. </para>

          <para class="block">Some subsequent correspondence passed between the Appeals Tribunal and me but it was purely of an administrative nature and is not relevant to the argument I am developing. Finally, I received a letter from the Tribunal dated 1 6 May 1978, which states: </para>

            <para>I refer to your representations concerning the eligibility for Unemployment Benefit of persons employed at Andersons (Roma) Meat Works during the period of the annual shut down of the meat works.

            <para>The Tribunal is of the opinion that these persons should be regarded as unemployed and thus eligible for Unemployment Benefit at the end of the normal leave period provided for under the AMIEU award. The Director-General of Social Security however has directed that these claimants cannot be regarded as unemployed during the period of the annual shut down and consequently are not eligible for Unemployment Benefit during that period. </para>
            <para>As the Director-General is the final authority under the Social Services Act no further action can be taken by this office. I will advise those persons who have lodged appeals of this decision. </para>

              <para>-The situation, therefore, is that the Social Security Appeals Tribunal, on assessing the matter, decided that these people should be regarded as unemployed and thus should be eligible for unemployment benefit. The Director-General, however, apparently decided that he would not accept the recommendation of the appeals tribunal and directed that the claimants not be regarded as unemployed and therefore eligible for unemployment benefits. I am not sure how often it happens that the Director-General does not accept the recommendation of an appeals tribunal, but it has happened on at least two occasions known to me in recent months. The Minister would know of one case which I referred to her personally. </para>

          </continue>
          <para>I am not arguing with the fact that the Director-General does not have to accept the recommendation of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. That Tribunal has powers of recommendation only, but the situation now is that these meat workers in Roma are quite confused. Originally they saw themselves as eligible for unemployment benefit. They were refused it by the Department of Social Security. They went through the appeals system and now they are told that the Appeals Tribunal deems that they should have been paid unemployment benefit, only to find that the Director-General has ruled that the will not be paid it. As a result, there is quite an amount of confusion, justifiable confusion I believe, among these workers. I ask the Minister whether, in this case, we can be given a statement or outline as to why the Director-General directed that these claimants could not be regarded as unemployed during the annual shutdown, in spite of the fact that the Tribunal considered otherwise. </para>

            <para>- The case that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colston</inline> raises tonight is probably only one of many that in fact occurred during the annual close-down last year. I had experience of similar cases in Adelaide, when one of the Social Security branches rang me to say that it had received instructions that people stood down because they did not have full annual leave entitlements, and who therefore were unemployed for a period of from a week to three weeks in 1 977, would not be paid their unemployment benefit, as they had been paid in the past. I contacted the head office of the Department of Social Security in Adelaide and spoke to the Assistant Director to ascertain whether the head office had received a similar instruction. I was advised that no such instruction had been received and that the same provisions as had applied in the past would continue to apply; that is, that any employee stood down because of the annual leave shut-down who did not have the full annual leave entitlement, provided he registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service and was prepared to accept employment during the period of the stand-down, would be entitled to unemployment benefit. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Having passed this information on to the Christies Beach branch of the Department of Social Security and the employees concerned, I was later advised by head office that it had made a mistake. It had discovered an instruction that had been received from the Director-General that decisions which had operated prior to 1 977 had been cancelled, that employees would not be entitled to unemployment benefit during the period for which that particular plant was closed down for annual leave. </para>
          <para>What I would like to know from the Minister for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Guilfoyle)-</inline> because I asked a similar question some time ago- is when the branches in the various States were given the changed instructions for the annual leave close-down of 1977 and why the head office of the Department of Social Security was not so advised, at the same time as the branches in South Australia were advised. This did cause a lot of confusion, not only among employees but also among officers of the Department and others, including myself. Because I had received wrong advice, I gave wrong advice to these branches of the Department and also to employees who were stood down during that period. I would like to know whether the instructions sent out by the Director-General were sent to all branches or only to those outside the metropolitan area. </para>

            <para>
              <inline font-weight="bold">- Senator Colston</inline>advised me that he would be raising this matter and I did inquire concerning the meat workers in Roma, which was the principal aspect to which he addressed his remarks, although he did seek a general clarification. The workers in question were on leave over the Christmas 1 977 holidays with no entitlement, or only partial entitlement to holiday pay. They were the ones about whom the honourable senator was concerned- those who did not have that entitlement to give them income during the holiday period. It has been confirmed by the Department that the workers at the Roma meat works had their positions open to them at the end of the holiday period. The information I have received from the Department is that an appeal has been disallowed by the Director-General in these terms: A person on leave is not unemployed for the formal reason that his employment continues during the leave. This would be true of a period of leave, even without pay. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The matter was raised with regard to those workers around the holiday period of 1977, and it was made clear that people in that position, who had no income because they had no holiday entitlement, could be considered for the granting of a special benefit. That was made known to the Department, and by the Department to those who did seek assistance of that kind. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colston</inline> also asked how often the Director-General declined to accept the recommendation of an appeals tribunal. Appeals tribunals make recommendations to the Director-General and in a percentage of cases the appeal decision is not upheld when it reaches him for final determination. This was one such case, because of the ineligibility of people to receive unemployment benefit as they were on leave and could not be considered to be unemployed in terms of the Act. </para>
          <para>I think I could best assist the Senate in this matter by referring to a question that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> asked in February of this year, and to which he addressed his remarks tonight. He asked at that time: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Is it a fact that prior to 1977 employees who had not qualified for full annual leave entitlement at the time of the annual leave close-down at their place of employment could register for employment with the Commonwealth Employment Service to receive the unemployment benefit for the period they had no income but were prepared to accept any employment offered? Has that practice now been discontinued? When were the branches of the Department of Social Security notified of the change? </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I made some comments in reply and told the honourable senator that I would investigate the position and advise him later. I was advised by the Department that the Social Services Act provides that, in order to qualify for unemployment benefit a person must, among other things, be unemployed. Where a person is employed at the start of the close-down for the holiday period and is told to report back for work at the end of it, he is not considered to be unemployed. The view of the Department in this case is based on a legal opinion given by a former Attorney-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Garfield</inline> Barwick. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Garfield</inline> determined that a person on leave is not unemployed, for the formal reason that his employment continues during the leave, and that this would be true of a period of leave without pay. That is, of course, the situation that has been referred to by the two honourable senators, in which people are on leave because of the closedown and have not had a holiday pay entitlement during that period. </para>
          <para>The Department further advises that towards the end of last year it became apparent that there was some confusion among officers as to whether unemployment benefit was payable in these circumstances. Advice was received that in one State, namely South Australia, benefit had been paid in some instances over the Christmas standdown period in the preceding year. That is obviously the matter referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Donald</inline> Cameron. </para>
          <para>A memorandum clarifying the position was sent to all State Directors on 14 December 1977. This responds to the question asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Donald</inline> Cameron tonight about when the advice was sent. The memorandum indicated that where a person was employed at the start of the holiday period and was told to report back at the termination of the vacation period he was not considered to be unemployed and employment benefit was not payable. It also indicated that, where on the other hand, an employee&#39;s services had been terminated and he would not be reengaged after the close-down, unemployment benefit would be payable subject to the normal conditions of eligibility. </para>
          <para>I understand that a further memorandum was sent to offices of the Department on 22 December 1977 reminding Directors that special benefit may be paid where the employee- that is the person who has no entitlement to holiday pay- has no money or readily available assets with which to maintain himself and his dependants. Thus, where a person had not been in a particular job long enough to accrue sufficient leave credits to cover the period of the close-down, special benefit was available as a means of providing some financial assistance. The Director-General advises me that he must emphasise that the policy expressed in the above paragraphs does not, in any way, represent a change in the requirements of the law that have operated in the past. He stated that the reply that was given to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Donald</inline> Cameron correctly states the position that a person on leave is not a person who is unemployed. I hope that this further information was given to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Donald</inline> Cameron at that time. </para>
          <para>What I have said perhaps deals with the broad question that has been raised by the two honourable senators this evening- that is, the question of whether people who are on leave during the annual shut-down of a factory or holiday period of a factory are unemployed and are entitled to the unemployment benefit. I have read from the determination of the then Attorney-General and the interpretation that has been placed on this matter by the Department that they are not unemployed and are therefore not able to be considered for the unemployment benefit. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colston</inline> pointed out that the Social Services Appeals Tribunal upheld an appeal that was made and he asked why this decision was rejected by the Director-General. Of course, the decision is rejected in terms of our interpretation of an unemployed person and his eligibility to receive unemployment benefit. </para>
          <para>I hope that what I have been able to say clarifies for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Donald</inline> Cameron the advice that was given to the Department at the end of 1 977. 1 hope it also clarifies the position of meat workers at Roma, a matter which was raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colston.</inline></para>

            </talker>
            <para>- I rise briefly to ask the Minister for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Guilfoyle)</inline> to reexamine the application of entitlement in respect of the case raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Donald</inline> Cameron and the case that was put by myself to the Department concerning people employed by the Noarlunga City Council. People who were employed by the Council for a short period before the Christmas break had to wait for four weeks for the engineering and construction teams to start work again. However, because they were working before the break they were judged to be not eligible to receive the unemployment benefit. As a result of union representations the State Government provided some unemployment relief payments. Also, an arrangement was made to pay a certain amount to married employees during the break. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I would like the Minister to consider this anomaly. People who are employed at the end of the year suffer because their employment is interrupted by the Christmas break. This is particularly the case for people employed in the engineering and construction industry. However, married people would have applied for the special benefit if they had known that such a benefit was available. The case I have mentioned was brought to the attention of the local office of the Department of Social Security. The union made representations to the local council and it arraned loans for half of the married group so as to tide them over the Christmas period. I would suggest, without asking the Minister to respond tonight, that she might examine the circumstances of people who are employed not for the whole year but in the last month or two of the year, sometimes on State unemployment relief work, and who would be left for a period of three or four weeks without any income at all. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator GUILFOYLE</inline>(Victoria-Minister for Social Security)- by leave- I undertake to look at the matter raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop.</inline> If he has further detailed information he would wish to give for reconsideration I would be happy to have it looked at. I accept the point raised by all honourable senators who have spoken that people not entitled to holiday pay suffer from a serious lack of income during a holiday period when limited employment opportunities are available. This situation could apply to a person who has been unemployed for several months, who finds a job towards the end of the year and then faces a shut-down period for which he is not entitled to any holiday pay. It was for this reason that we made the provision that such people should be considered for a special benefit if their job was of a permanent kind. I believe that the Department attempted to make this fact known. I would certainly see that any particular case raised with me would be reconsidered in those terms. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator COLSTON</inline>(Queensland)-by leave- I believe it might be reasonable, when people are rejected for unemployment benefit in such circumstances as have been mentioned, that the letter that goes out saying that their benefit has been rejected also contains a sentence or two indicating that special benefits may be available under certain circumstances and therefore they should check with the local branch of the Department. It would seem to me that if this were done some people who do not know that special benefits are available might be able to avail themselves of those benefits. </para>

It is clear, however, that the absolute level of rolling stock that is obsolete or in need of renovation would have little, if any, bearing on the need for the replacement or repair of such rolling stock. Considerations of this nature, of course, are dependent primarily on the projected demand for freight and passenger services from railways, and in this regard, it is considered that the rolling stock industry in Australia has more than enough capacity available now to meet the assessed demand for rolling stock after due allowance has been made for a realistic rate of growth in the requirement for rail services. </para>

Economies of scale may be achieved in parts of the production process but the opportunity for scale economies would be limited by the diversity of the design and specification requirements of the various purchasing authorities. There would also be significant under capacity utilisation from time to time arising from the wide fluctuation in demand for rolling stock and the irregular nature of order placements. </para>

This i s, fundamentally, that such materials should be open to public scrutiny and debate, and not be simply imposed by schools or teachers. I also drew his attention to the many approachcs I have had from local and national education bodies, academics, education authorities, teacher associ- ations and parent groups on this issue which overwhelmingly s upported the work of the Curriculum Development Centre a ind the SEMP materials, with some reservations about small s ections of SEMP. The MACOS materials should, in my view, be assessed on the basis of the same general principles is SEMP. I have provided the Queensland Minister with a ample list of the national and local bodies supporting SEMP, and asked him to make the list and the supportive views of these bodies known to the Queensland Parliamen- t ary Committee of Education Review.

            <para>Of the nineteen aids listed by the Federation as having failed on Monday 10 April, only four related to faults occurring on that day or the preceding weekend. They were Wagga DME, Pt. Lookout DME, an unspecified VOR (probably Wee Jasper), Tamworth DME. The failed aids were all properly assessed as Category 3 faults because of the availability of alternative aids in accordance with design and redundancy. (Category 3 faults are those which are to bc rectified at the first available opportunity rather than by a specified time.) These faults were rectified and the aids returned to service on or before 12 April. </para>
            <para>With two of the other aids listed (Casino DME and Coffs Harbour NDB) there is no record of any failure during the period in question. Both aids operated continuously. </para>
            <para>Three were long term notifications of permanent withdrawal of facilities (Wagga VAR, Canberra Middle Marker, Pt. Lookout VAR) and two were advisory notices in respect of new aids (Wagga VOR, Pt. Lookout VOR) which had not been commissioned at that time but have since beenWagga VOR on 2 1 April 1978 and Pt. Lookout VOR on 26 April 1978. </para>
            <para>The Sydney Radar was withdrawn for planned maintenance of part of the facility over a period of two hours and this had no significance in relation to handling of traffic. </para>
            <para>Two (West Maitland VOR and Sydney 16 Outer Marker) were standing cautionary notices on aids in use but subject to long term intermittent problems such as industrial radio interference. <inline font-weight="bold">Major investigations</inline> arc in progress. </para>
            <para>One was to correct a chart printing error (Canberra Localiser Back-Beam) and was of no significance to normal operations, whilst one other (Sydney DME) related to long term withdrawal of a facility requiring major maintenance to achieve better performance. </para>
            <para>Two involved obstruction lighting at Albury. Having regard to availability of other lights and operational procedures in force, these faults were correctly designated Category 3 and restoration was effected accordingly. The failure affected neither the status of the aerodrome nor the safety of night operations. </para>
            <para>One involved short term unserviceability of an obstruction light on a Sydney broadcasting radio tower for which maintenance is the responsibility of the owner. This was of no significance to controlled operations. lt will bc seen that only a small proportion of the aids listed had unexpectedly failed and with those failures restoration was in accordance with long standing procedures, alternative navigation aids were available and safety standards were not affected. </para>

              <para>1 ) A survey was undertaken in some State Offices of the Department, but because the records for pension and benefits payments are not kept on a uniform basis and in some cases are still compiled manually the data returned provides no meaningful answer on a State-wide basis to the question. </para>

              <para>As a general observation I would like to point out that the average waiting time between a claim for a particular benefit and the first payment is dependent on many factors. Sometimes claims are lodged before eligibility arises: sometimes (as with unemployment benefit) delay on the part of the claimant means a delay in payment; sometimes other types of payments are made during the waiting time. My department attempts to keep its processing time as short as possible to ensure that claimants are not placed in a position of hardship. Where there are legislative provisions which have the effect of setting the date of grant of a pension or benefit at a date subsequent to the claim, and where persons are facing hardship as a result, special benefit payments may be made. In these circumstances cheques may be made available immediately. </para>

              <para>An annual grant of $8,500 for staff support from the Australian Government to the Overseas Student Service was discontinued from the beginning of the present financial year. Some limited assistance to enable overseas students to attend Overseas Student Service conferences on student affairs has been provided by the Government in recent years. This has amounted to $594 in the present year. However this support is to be discontinued with effect from 1978-79 since the National Overseas Student Service is no longer carrying out the function which attracted Government assistance, namely the effective representation of the main interests of the majority of sponsored and private overseas students. I am informed that the Australian Union of Students no longer provides any funds to the Overseas Student Service. </para>
