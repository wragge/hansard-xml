        <para class="block">That on the 10th December 1948, the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted and proclaimed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which declares that, 'Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in the Declaration. . . .

The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government; this will shall be expressed in periodic and genuine elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret vote or equivalent free voting procedures.'

            <para>- I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Health, a question relating to components in first aid kits sold in Australia which may or may not be marked as Australian first aid kits. Is it a fact that the Department of Health is interested in standards  control only of therapeutic substances which are contained in these kits- for example, antiseptic creams or liquids- and that there is no control on other goods such as bandages and lint that are contained in the kits? </para>

          <para>Is it a fact that the vast majority, if not all, first aid kits sold in Australia are assembled in Australia but with imported components such as bandages, dressing strips, wool-, lint and gauze? Is it a fact that there is no quality control at all by the Department of these imported components and that no certification is made that the kits are sterile? Will the Minister ask the Minister for Health whether the Department could look at the possibility of a quality control of all components of first aid kits, in view of the fact that many of the components now being put in the kits come from countries with very different standards of public health and hygiene from Australia's? </para>

            <para>- I am aware of the honourable senator's continuing interest in this matter and his desire to see Australian ambassadors driving around in Australian made cars. I am also aware of the excellent example that the Prime Minister has set in this matter in the recent purchase of an Australian car. It is a fact that traditionally the High Commissioner in London has driven in a Rolls-Royce. It is my understanding that a replacement vehicle was ordered some time ago and that the replacement vehicle was a Rolls-Royce. I further understand that, in fact, the funds for this motor vehicle were made available this year and that a deposit has been paid. I am looking at the matter to ascertain just how far advanced the purchase has gone and whether the decision is one which might be reviewed. I think it is quite clear from the statements of the Prime Minister in the House of Representatives that he is anxious to ensure that a larger number of Australian embassies and high commissions use Australian vehicles. At the moment there are difficulties due to the fact that in some countries cars are left-hand drive, and so on. These problems are all under examination, along with the problem of ensuring that if Australian made cars are sent to countries in which there is no wider market for them at the moment we will be able to maintain and resell them- a point that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sibraa</inline> raised in a question some time ago. The position in London is one that I have under examination at the moment. I am sorry that I cannot give a final and firm reply to the honourable senator. </para>

              <para>- Just listen, please. By way of explanation, I should say that the Australian Gemmological Society has written, asking that a stone be nominated and that that stone be the Australian opal. In view of the great place that mining has in Australia. It would seem appropriate to accede to the request that there be a national stone and proposals that that stone should be an opal are most appropriate. </para>

            <para>-It is true that all such matters of national symbols, emblems and so on come within my interesting and varied portfolio. It is true that at the moment there is no national stone for Australia. That is a matter which is of concern to a number of people, including the people who have made representations to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MacGibbon.</inline> I understand that this question was raised with a previous Minister for Administrative Services and that he was not subjected to the ribald comments that greeted this question. In any event, no action has been taken to this date to obtain a national stone for Australia, but a report on that subject is being prepared and I expect to be able to consider it in the next few months. I may then be in a position to give the honourable senator some more definite information. When I am considering that report I will bear in mind the point he has raised in his question. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. I appreciate the fact that she has difficulty in answering some of these questions, but my question refers to an apparent conflict of interest. Did <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Beadman</inline> the Minister's Acting Senior Private Secretary, in correspondence dated 2 November 1976, to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Daly</inline> of the architectural firm of Terence Daly and Loffi, state that the Aboriginal Housing Panel would be in the best position to advise Aboriginal communities of the housing proposals offered by that firm? Did the Minister instruct <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Stern,</inline> the director of Aboriginal housing programming within the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, to supply Stawell Timber Industries with the names and addresses of all Aboriginal communities and housing associations to permit the firm to contact the communities and associations direct with its particular housing proposal? Why was the different method of contact directed, thus giving Stawell Timber Industries preferential treatment in being able to contact the client direct, while this was denied to Terence Daly and Loffi? </para>

            <para>- I think that there may be some misunderstanding of the nature of the Government's intention in this regard. I speak purely from my own recollection, having been, incidentally, a member of both the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence and the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. A standing committee has been functioning in Australia for many years. Its membership includes top industrialists whose job is to advise the government of the day upon the feasibility of manufacturing defence hardware in Australia. There is, within the Government framework, the mechanism for Australian industry to review the hardware- the material itselfand to recommend strongly if there is a practicable way of Australian industry manufacturing the equipment, either wholly or in part. There are often trade-off situations. There is no let-up in the intention of this Government to do whatever can be done within Australia to provide, as far as possible, a self-sufficiency base. We have to determine whether we should pay a significantly higher price or whether capacity exists here to develop the more sophisticated materials that are necessary. My understanding is that it is not intended to reduce the Australian content of defence manufacturers. Indeed, wherever practicable and wherever orders are placed overseas there will be strong attempts to increase Australia 's manufacturing content. </para>

The Attorney-General will recall that he recently told me, in answer to question on notice No. 972, that, contrary to the procedures recommended by the statute of the International Court, the Australian national group failed to consult either the High Court or the nation's law faculties before making its nomination of candidates for election to the International Court. What are the reasons for this failure to consult in accordance with the international statute? In particular, will the Attorney-General confirm that it was linked with the Prime Minister's veto earlier this year, against the advice of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, of the possible candidature for this court of the former Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gough</inline> Whitlam, this veto producing a situation where there was no potential Australian nominee with sufficient international stature to have a chance of election? </para>

            <para>-Professor Karmel, the  Chairman  of the Tertiary Education Commission, recently supplied his report to the Government. The matter is now under consideration by the Government. I acknowledge on behalf of the Government that there is some urgency in dealing with it. I regret that the report could not have been available much earlier this year but circumstances have prevented this from happening. The non-government colleges area is, as honourable senators will know, very complex because it almost opens up a Pandora's box. I acknowledge that next year some 3,000 or 4,000 students in Australia will be interested financially in the decisions of government. I will try to expedite the matter so that the information is known. I hope that that can be done within the next week or so. </para>

Serious allegations have been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Townley</inline> concerning the integrity of telephone technicians in Australia. Will the Minister ask the senator to produce the evidence that he has for his claim that these people have been conspiring to defraud the public, and to lay it on the table of the Senate? </para>

            <para>- A number of matters have been raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Townley,</inline> I think over a period of months, relating to alleged deficiencies in Telecom operations, including the method of charging. Most recently, I gather, there have been suggestions that officers of Telecom may have been interfering with lines and doing things in a way which I have no doubt would be quite illegal. Those allegations, I think, have been referred by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Townley</inline> to the Government, not to me. The honourable senator is indicating to me now that he has written to the Prime Minister about the allegations, and I assume that they will be followed up in the usual and proper manner. I do not know that I would favour the procedure set out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Melzer.</inline> It seems to me that to do so would subject individuals who might be involved to wide publicity which may, on subsequent investigation, one would hope - </para>

              <para>- There has been no publicity with respect to any individual. I think that what the honourable senator is asking is that information relating to individuals be tabled. I would take the view that that would be a rather poor procedure to follow; that any allegations that have been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Townley</inline> should certainly be investigated but that no individual should be accused of wrong doing until the matter has been dealt with in the proper way which, I would have thought, if an element of fraud were involved, would lead to proceedings before a court. </para>

            <para>- I recollect <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> 's question and welcome that of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lajovic.</inline> The matter is important. The background is that the Declaration on the Mass Media was adopted by acclamation on 22 November by the UNESCO General Conference in Committee of all member States. It is certain to be adopted as a matter of course in the Conference 's final plenary session during the next few days. Developments on the Declaration had moved very rapidly. Honourable senators will recall that on 8 November in a reply to a question in another place the Minister for Foreign Affairs stated firmly that the original text of the Declaration was unacceptable and that Australia would not support its adoption. I made similar statements in this place. Australia accordingly worked actively and closely in concert with its Western partners to devise amendments to the original text which would make it acceptable to us. These Western amendments were incorporated in the new text prepared by the UNESCO Director-General's special representative assisted by a former  chairman  of the UNESCO Executive Board and newspaper editor, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hector</inline> Wynter of Jamaica, in the closest consultation with Western representatives. The new text was circulated formally by the Director-General on 21 November, replacing the original, which was withdrawn. It was this text which was adopted by acclamation by all UNESCO member states in Paris. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Declaration as it now stands is very different from its predecessor. All contentious areas, from our point of view, have been excised or adequately amended. It excludes unacceptable references to government involvement in media activities and no longer reflects a view of the relationship between the state, the media and the individual which is foreign to our conception of a free and democratic society. Moreover, the Declaration now includes significant provisions which favour a desirable improvement globally in the free, extensive and responsible flow of information. </para>
          <para>The Australian delegation sought in particular to have included in the Declaration provisions which would afford journalists the best possible conditions for practising their profession. We strongly supported the inclusion of clauses recognising that the mass media of developing countries in particular should have the resources to enable strengthened co-operation both amongst themselves and with the media of developed countries. Australia is pleased that the Declaration has been adopted in a form which has attracted the consensus support of the international community. We are particularly gratified that this has not been at the cost of any compromise on issues of fundamental importance to us. This matter points up the significance of UNESCO and the significance and continuing importance of the Australian delegation to UNESCO. May I, therefore, pay a tribute to our delegation led by our Ambassador, Professor Slatyer </para>

            <para>-I direct a question to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> in his capacity either as Minister for Education or as the Minister representing the Treasurer. I ask: Is it correct that postgraduate awards from non-Commonwealth sources are exempt from income tax? If so, does the Government intend to remove that tax exemption just as it did in this year's Budget for Commonwealth postgraduate awards? Does the Government expect that if the present differential system remains a number of students will try to relinquish their Commonwealth postgraduate award in order to go into a university-funded scheme? </para>

            <para>- I must indicate that an anomalous situation exists with regard to postgraduate awards. The fact is that at this moment there are a number of postgraduate awards, and it appears that the Commonwealth postgraduate award, which emanates from my Department is subject to income tax and the others are not. I do not think that anyone has argued the merits of the present award for which I have responsibility or that it ought not to be subject to income tax. There has been an argument about the quantum and the effect that income tax has on it, and that is a matter that can be looked at and reviewed. I say in passing that by and large, because the provisions will apply only in respect of some eight months of this year, most people who have little supplementary income will not be affected by income tax this year. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I cannot say that will be the future policy of the Government in respect of other postgraduate awards. I am not free to comment on that although I can say that there has been no decision in that regard. I have no knowledge of any attempts to relinquish a particular award in order to take another and naturally I as the Minister concerned would be highly sensitive to this situation if it were so. I think that there is a need, as conditions allow, for the Government to encourage postgraduate activities in Australia. Therefore, if there are anomalies I will be keen to look at them to see what can be done to obviate them. </para>

            <para>-I am sure that the attention of the Minister has been drawn to the reports that appeared in newspapers and so on which are referred to by the honourable senator in his question. I have no information about whether, specifically KLM, UTA, or JAT have expressed concern, or about Alitalia and the Italian Government, but I do have some more general information which I can let the honourable senator have. As far as the paper prepared by ASEAN countries for consideration by heads of government is concerned, I understand that a confidential note along the lines indicated by the honourable senator was received in June, which was in fact before the Government announced its policy. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>But returning to the earlier part of the question asked by the honourable senator, I am advised by the Minister for Transport that negotiating teams are at present in Europe and South East Asia explaining details of the new government policy to governments of countries which are our bilateral partners in civil aviation arrangements. The Minister advises me that in general the response which has been received has been encouraging, but a number of matters still require resolution. These matters will be discussed more fully in talks between the airlines when details of fares and arrangements for implementation of agreed policies will be discussed. Further talks will be required at government to government level to reach final agreement on new bilateral agreements. </para>
          <para>Naturally, countries have not accepted completely the Australian proposals in respect of some points although no formal concern has been expressed by airlines to the Australian Government, it is known that some European airlines would wish to modify arrangements. The negotiating team has taken this into account, along with views expressed by representatives of other government delegations. The negotiating team has attempted as far as possible to meet the objections raised by other countries and at the same time to maintain the central thrust of Australian policy which is aimed at providing, in concert with other countries, the development of air service arrangements that allow for the needs of the widest possible range of resident and visiting passengers to be satisfied in a safe, efficient, rational and commercially viable manner. </para>

I am further advised by the Minister that Qantas has stated that it does not pay commission to nonIATA agents. As to whether there have been complaints of illegal discounting by Tabros Travel Service, I have no information and will have to refer the matter to the Minister for a reply. Similarly, I will have to seek detailed information on whether Qantas staff might have tagged baggage for final destinations which are not those shown on the tickets. I will let the honourable senator have a reply on this matter. </para>

            <para>-The answer to the honourable senator's question is no. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> if you wish there to be a short answer that answer will suffice. If we have a few minutes to spare I can inform the honourable senator, who has or had dairying interests in Victoria, that, as he will be aware, a similar question was asked in another place and the Minister for Primary Industry gave a very adequate reply to the question that was raised. The honourable senator will be aware that the Commonwealth Government introduced support to the extent of 75 cents per lb butterfat. That was done in legislation which was agreed to. The honourable senator took part in the formulation of that legislation. The Victorian Government decided that it wished to pay 80c per lb to its own producers. That decision apparently was conveyed to the Minister for Primary Industry about four months after the legislation had been introduced into the Federal Parliament. The basis for the decision is that the Victorian Government wishes to decide on the support which it pays to its own producers. It seems to me totally inappropriate that any condemnation should be made of the Federal Government, particularly of the Minister for Primary Industry, if the Victorian Government is not willing to perform and to pay the producers in that State. It is not the responsibility of the Federal Government to do so. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>My understanding is that the Australian Dairy Corporation has offered to do all the computer calculations, which obviously would be a difficult task, so that the exact amount of production could be equated to the additional 5c which the Victorian Government intends to pay. That is purely a function for the Victorian Government to perform. I notice that the Minister for Primary Industry questioned whether the additional 5c had been appropriated in the Victorian Budget. That is certainly something for that Government to take up. At no level should any criticism be made of the Federal Government in this matter. My understanding is that the Minister for Primary Industry has said that at the earliest opportunity, when legal barriers have been overcome, legislation will be introduced so that we may be able to assist the Victorian Government in its desire. </para>

I refer to the Touchfone which is so aptly named by Telecom Australia. I understand that when this improved instrument was introduced a charge of $50 was made for its installation and that, at present, that charge has been reduced to $38. As I believe this still represents a touch, I request that the Minister examine the possibility of enabling telephone subscribers to replace old telephones with this new device at a substantially reduced charge. Can the Minister tell me whether a charge is applied to new subscribers for this improved device? If so, will the Minister negotiate to see that that charge is removed? </para>

            <para>-The information which I have on this matter arises from the information given to one of the Senate Estimates committees with which at least some honourable senators are familiar. It is true that an additional charge is made for the installation of a Touchfone. I understand that the charge applies whether a person is replacing the machine or having one installed initially to a new connection. But the explanation which, from my memory, was given to the Estimates committee was that the Touchfone is, in fact, a more expensive instrument for Telecom Australia to purchase. Telecom has taken the view that that more expensive instrument should be available to those people who want to have it. I must say that that seems to me to be a most reasonable approach. If a person wishes to have a telephone service he is entitled to choose the old dial system and get the benefit of having it installed more cheaply. In other words, those people who wish to have the additional advantage of the Touchfone are required to pay for it. I would have thought that that was something which was very defensible. Any suggestion that the Touchfone ought to be available without charge presumably would involve, since Telecom is required to operate commercially, increasing charges in some other area or diverting funds from the extension of services in other areas, and bearing in mind the significant number of complaints that are received in this chamber and elsewhere about the need for extended services in remote areas and other inadequacies, I would have thought that the policy being followed by Telecom was probably the sensible one in all the circumstances. </para>

            <para>-No doubt all honourable members would have been delighted to read the recent publication of the Australian Bureau of Statistics which will be accepted as being accurate and objective reporting. That document, along with many others, says that all these indicators are pointing fair. It is all right for the Labor Opposition to deride these things because it has a vested interest in taking a Jeremiah line. But the fact is that the objective statistics point to these things. It is also a fact that there is evidence of a restoration of consumer confidence. Nobody ever thought that this would happen overnight. The restoration process is a long one. The fact is that, laugh though the Labor Party may, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has paid tribute to the soundness of our policies as have international experts such as David Rockefeller. In fact, all of those people who might be regarded throughout the world as being both expert and responsible judges have paid tribute to the success of this country even, if I may say so to those Opposition members who laugh- and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline> laughs loudest- the Labor Premier in Tasmania has advertised that the success of the local loan is being pinned - </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Health. Is the Minister aware that the National Acoustic Laboratory services to hearing impaired children on Aboriginal settlements in Queensland are severely hindered for want of funds? Is it true that NAL personnel do not visit Aboriginal settlements for the purpose of testing hearing problems in deaf children? Is it further true that hearing aids are posted by the NAL to schools on Aboriginal settlements and that these aids are passed on to the children by school authorities without any NAL staff being on hand to ensure that the correct aid is given to a particular child and without any proper training being given by NAL staff to the school authorities? </para>

            <para>- I refer the Leader of the Government in the Senate to the question asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Messner</inline> which he just answered. Is he aware of the latest report of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation which highlights a growing problem on the home loan front? Has he read the article in the Australian <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> which states that because of the surge in home loan defaults recession has hit the great Australian dream? Is the evidence that is now emerging showing that because of the policies of the Government we are entering into a dangerous stage of recession? Unless the Government alters its position many people in the housing industry and the home ownership area will be in increasing difficulty. This will affect the whole economy. That picture is contrary to the picture the Minister just painted in answer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Messner</inline> 's question. </para>

            <para>-I have not read the report of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation or the article in the Australian <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review.</inline> I will read both. I remind the Senate that for several decades three-quarters of the people of Australia could own a home by paying one quarter of the breadwinner's average weekly wage in loan repayments. That was possible because of stable inflation and interest rates and the employment policies of governments of Liberal faith. The huge upsurge in inflation and interest rates which followed, in the period from 1973 to 1975, precluded people earning average weekly wages from owning their own homes, forced up interest rates and costs and forced wives to go to work. The combined income of the husband and wife was required to purchase a home. People were costed out of the ability to own homes by the policies of the previous government. The road back to home ownership, to use the average weekly wage quartering principle, is a reduction in inflation and interest rates. Nothing can gainsay the fact that the continuous reduction in inflation and the recent lowering of interest rates was very good news for the people of Australia, particularly for home owners. </para>

My question did not relate to the purchase of homes; it was about the ability of people who have bought their homes to keep them. They are now faced with the possibility of being unable to do so because of the policies of the present Government. Will- the Minister please tell me how these people will manage if the policies are not changed. </para>

            <para>- I promised to get some information to respond to a question asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sim</inline> about internal political developments in China. With your forbearance, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> I would like to give a relatively brief answer. I am advised that the present wall poster campaign in Peking has embraced criticism of the late  Chairman  of the Chinese Communist Party, Mao Tse-tung, of the current  Chairman,  Hua Kuo-feng, and praise of Vice-Chairman Teng Hsiao-ping. The matters being debated on the walls are a re-evaluation of the historical role of Mao, revision of high level miscarriages of justice and reversal of the official assessment of the public demonstrations in Tien An-Shen Square in April 1976 which led to the temporary disgrace of Teng Hsiao-ping and which are now judged to have been exploited by Mao's widow and her radical supporters for their own political ends. Mao's role in that incident is criticised and Hua's  role hinted at, because of his responsibility for public security at that time. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>There are indications that the present spate of wall-posters may be coincidental with a highlevel meeting of the Chinese Communist Party which may make some further adjustments to the shape of the Central Committee. It would be premature to suggest, however, that the wall poster campaign represents a major power struggle between China's most senior leaders. Although Hua and Teng show differences of emphasis in their public presentation, there have been no recent indications of significant divisions between them on major lines of policy. </para>

        <para class="block">I do so in order to make a few sharp comments about the proposed presentation of papers. On the last day of the sitting a three-page list of reports and other papers are to be presented. These include important reports which, in the normal course, would have been the subject of considerable debate. I refer, for instance, to the text of Australia's Model Bilateral Nuclear Safeguards Agreement, and to the statement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs entitled 'Australia and Papua New Guinea: Negotiations on Maritime Boundaries and on Other Matters Relating to Torres Strait. These very important statements and reports are to be tabled on the last day when we are unable to debate or comment on them properly. On several occasions I have remarked on the importance of not introducing significant legislation in the last week of the sittings, especially preceding a long recess. Today we have another problem emerging in that reports are being presented in substantial numbers on the last day of sitting. </para>

            <para>- Yesterday I commented on the fact that we had before us a list of reports that was two pages long. Today the list is three pages. During the last week we have had tabled reports that should have been tabled before the Estimates committees sat. I made that complaint yesterday. Today, I wish to complain that three pages of important statements, upon which we are unable to comment, are to come before the Senate. One can resort to the device of taking note of these papers and adjourning debate, but that debate would take place half way through next year when, in many cases, events may have passed us by. I ask the Government to accept my criticism and make certain that next year this problem does not recur. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator CARRICK</inline>(New South Wales Minister for Education)- I share the worry of honourable senators concerning the delay in the presentation of some reports. I share their concern that reports have not been available for the Estimates committees, and that debate upon them has not been possible. May I indicate to honourable senators that if, upon the resumption of the Parliament for the autumn sittings, they want to respond to particular reports by debate I will see whether we can arrange that at an early date. I know that that is no compensation for delay. I move: </para>

        <para class="block">This report, as is the case with many others, is a very important one. It is the report of the Director-General of a department which is involved in the expenditure of some 25 per cent of Budget outlays each year. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> has suggested in respect of other reports, in the past the report has been presented before the Estimates committees met. Also, in the past, reports as important as this one have been given to the Opposition two hours before being tabled. Usually an explanatory statement comes with the report but I notice that this is not the case this time. </para>
        <para>I believe it is important that at least the Opposition have the opportunity to make some comment, however brief, on a report of this importance. I think it is quite wrong that the report should be as late as it is, that it should come down on the last day of the sitting of the Parliament, that no one should have sighted it before it appeared in the Parliament and that no explanatory statement is brought down with it. I think those remarks apply also to the reports of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations and all the others. </para>
        <para>The situation is not satisfactory. The Parliament is being ignored and this is typical of the attitude and the arrogance of members of the Government at the moment. The Government cannot get reports down on time. They are not brought into the Parliament on time. The ordinary, common decencies that were observed in this place until now are not being followed. There is a deliberate attempt to avoid debating important issues and important reports in this place. Having made that protest, I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </para>

I also point out that there is another very important report that is usually tabled in the Parliament on the eve of each parliamentary recess, and that is the VIP flight manifests provided by the Department of Defence. I note from this list of papers to be presented today that those manifests are not included for presentation. I want to express my concern. I believe that the very important persons who travel on these special flights could be put in the same category as the very important pigs that we debate here. I remind the Minister responsible that in future we would like to have that report tabled prior to each recess, that is, twice a year. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </para>

        <para class="block">As the Senate's representative on the Council of the National Library and as its  Deputy Chairman,  may I take a moment to commend the report to the Senate. Through the year the Council and the Library have endeavoured to reflect the terms of its Act of Parliament in relation to the maintenance of collections and the provision of services relating to library matters. The various collections in the National Library have advanced during the year, with particular reference to the Australian International and Ethnic Library or Ausintel. as we call it. It is helping to meet a growing demand for information from governments and the public at large. The collection is also housing a number of very valuable items presented to us by overseas embassies. All of this is part of the Library's service to what we call the area of the humanities. This takes in additionally the most extensive Australian National Music Library. </para>
        <para>In the area of ANSOL- the Australian National Social Services Library- the year under review saw the assembling for the first time of the National Library's law collection. This is the largest law collection in Australia. The development of computer-based awareness bulletins during the period has met with excellent response and they are developed in line with government policies. The data bases provide information in co-operation with a number of government departments and authorities and in this connection during the year the first Australian Directory of Technical Information Services for Industry has been published. This is a notable and wide-ranging directory and certainly will extend the use of our services and information resources in relation to industry. </para>
        <para>An important initiative has been in the library requirements of the handicapped. A comprehensive survey and report has been completed and this and many other services will develop when staff and resources become available. A service of importance is the oral history section, where arrangements are made to interview notable Australians for the purposes of historical record. A great number of these have already been completed and we frequently receive inquiries from interested people relating to further interviews. The service contributes to the collection of Australian biographical material and it is important to observe that, whilst transcripts are offered, provision is also made, if requested, for the withholding of information for considerable periods- up to 30 years after the death of the interviewee. This is just a brief reference to the vast and complex activities of this national institution. It is closely related to the Parliamentary Library and, in the international field, to the Library of Congress in the United States and to the British National Library. This Parliament has an involvement with the National Library and I commend the report to honourable senators. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </para>

          <para>- For the information of honourable senators I present the report and financial statements of Qantas Airways Limited for the year ended 3 1 March 1978. May I just add that I, like the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick),</inline> have noted the comments made by the Opposition Whip about the late tabling of these reports and would share the views that he has expressed on the matter. Could I also draw the Senate's attention to the fact that we are rising approximately a fortnight earlier than usual and that this may have contributed to the rush of reports. I do not say that by way of excuse or to justify the tabling of reports on the last day of the session, but I think it is a factor that has probably exacerbated the situation. </para>

        <para>The reports of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and of the Department of Environment, Housing and Community Development are of great concern to this Parliament because of decisions that have been made in those two areas. They are particularly of importance to Queensland senators because of the Iwasaki project and the fact that the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority has been given the responsibility of supervising one of our great national heritages. </para>
        <para>I say to the Minister that it is not good enough to say that we are caught with all these reports because we are rising a week earlier- not two weeks earlier, as he said. That is not good enough. I would not give an out to these departments. It is extraordinary that these departments are not preparing their reports throughout the whole year. Surely a department does not have to wait until the end of the year before it starts to prepare its report for the previous year. It seems to me that we may have to bring down some sort of regulation which will force departments to report to the Parliament before a certain date. I believe that some departments and authorities are escaping the scrutiny of this Parliament by bringing in their reports very late indeed. </para>

          <para>- I take note of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> remarks. I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> has looked at the supplementary report of the Auditor-General which was tabled yesterday, because it was very gratifying to note that the Auditor-General is now joining issue in this matter which has been raised in the Parliament. It is quite clear that he is putting his point of view to stop departments and statutory authorities claiming his Office as an excuse. It is clear that departments and statutory authorities are not keeping their accounts in a form which enables them easily and quickly to present their final accounts to the Auditor-General for approval. There is a hold up in the sense that they are just not in the right form for submission to him. I welcome his support of our attempt to make departments and statutory authorities more responsive. We reiterate that we have the option of the interim report which can avoid the delay which comes with the approval of financial accounts at any time. I just hope that departments and statutory authorities will make sure next year that we get at least those interim reports before the sittings of the Estimates committees so that we can have a proper scrutiny of what is happening in those areas of governmental and semi-governmental authorities. </para>

            <para>-by leave-The 174th report of the Committee relates to the acquisition of automatic data processing systems in the Australian Public Service. This report is mainly about the acquisition of medium-scale and large scale computer systems. It also deals with the procurement of equipment to expand existing systems and with maintenance services. It does not look in detail at procurement of software or services other than maintenance. This report is one of a series in a comprehensive study by the Public Accounts Committee on major aspects of computer acquisition and usage to be presented to Parliament. Others in the series will deal with: The Public Service Board's mandate system; the planning and co-ordination of automatic data processing developments; the efficiency and effectiveness of installed computing; and the collection and dissemination of statistical material by the Commonwealth. </para>

        <para>During the period 1962-63 to 1977-78, the Australian Public Service has spent approximately $150m on the purchase and hire of computing equipment. In the last five years, there has been an average annual growth rate in equipment spending of 15 per cent. Some procedures and practices currently in use for ADP acquisition are unduly costly with little compensating benefit. Moreover, they tend to be inflexible, inhibiting the optimum match of vendors' solutions to the user's requirements. The major unsatisfactory aspect of present procurement practice is the length of dme it usually takes. The Department of Administrative Services has estimated that, under new administrative arrangements for the acquisition of computers, the time required to acquire a computer from the beginning of the feasibility study to the beginning of implementation would be in excess of 48 months. From evidence received, this is three times greater than the usual time taken in the private sector. </para>
        <para>We suggest that the Public Service Board should set itself the modest objective of reducing the average time for the acquisition of computer systems in the Public Service by 25 per cent. This will still mean the average will be approximately twice that in the private sector and will produce some $6m per annum in additional benefits and reduced costs. The Committee has reviewed the interim guidelines produced by the Public Service Board and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and the Department of Administrative Services, and has concluded that, if implemented, they will not result in efficient and effective computer system procurement. The guidelines are largely orientated towards review, approval and checking. They do not deal with the inefficiencies that exist in the present process; indeed, if implemented, they will exacerbate many of the present inefficiencies. </para>
        <para>The interim guidelines, which do provide adequate opportunity for ministerial scrutiny during the procurement cycle for a large amount of inter-departmental committee surveillance and for an independent assessor, do not contribute to the achievement of, or recognise the need for, moving the task of computer system procurement more firmly into the hands of departmental management. The great emphasis that they place on review and checking by the IDC on ADP suggests that they may even have the opposite effect- that of further reducing the generally already inadequate level of involvement and control exercised by permanent heads in computer system acquisition. Currently, a significant component of the time cycle for procurement of large computer systems is the time taken in obtaining the endorsement for approval of departmental proposals by the IDC on ADP. It has been estimated that the IDC could be costing $4.5m in deferred benefits. The Committee considers it unlikely that the IDC review produces annual benefits of equal magnitude. </para>
        <para>It is the Committee's view that review and coordinating bodies such as the IDC on ADP should be publicly accountable for the costs saved and benefits lost because of their function. New administrative arrangements for computer procurement should be based on a cost-benefit analysis which takes into account the effect of delay on both direct costs and lost benefits. The Committee has suggested new interim guidelines to ensure that there is adequate opportunity for Ministerial scrutiny without the delays in the existing guidelines. </para>
        <para>In brief, the responsibility for the review of departments ' computer proposals would be vested with the Public Service Board. The Board would be charged with responsibility for the speedy processing of proposals. The Board's officers would be responsible for drawing Cabinet's attention to proposals which would involve possible difficulties such as conflict of interest. The Committee is anxious to ensure that fairness, honesty, free competition and more open negotiation prevail in any procedures developed. In all, the Committee made 40 recommendations which it feels will improve the acquisition of ADP systems in the Public Service. This has been the first major review undertaken relating to the acquisition of ADP systems in the Australian Public Service. The Committee wishes to express its appreciation of the co-operation and assistance accorded to it by officers of the Public Service and suppliers of computer equipment and services. The information and material provided have greatly assisted the Committee in its prompt presentation of this report. </para>
        <para>The Committee would also like to acknowledge the outstanding contribution of its technical adviser, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Peter</inline> MacGregor of P. K. MacGregor and Associates, in the preparation of this report. Parliament rising a week early has seriously impacted our production of this report.

        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline>
      </para>
      <para>In 1976 1 commenced the practice of informing the Parliament of the activities during the past year of the Joint Parliamentary Committee of Public Accounts. As we are rarely given the opportunity of debating the numerous reports which are tabled, I believe it is important that the Parliament should be given details of our activities. The year 1978 has been a record year in terms of meetings of the Committee and the general areas which it has reported on. In all there were 45 meetings of the full committee and 29 meetings of sub-committees, a total of 74 meetings. </para>
      <para>In addition to our regular reporting on items such as the Auditor-General's reports and our investigation and subsequent reports to Parliament on the Advance of the Minister of Finance, we also finalised our inquiry into ownership and leasing of overseas property by the Commonwealth, and we commenced a most significant examination into the use of computers in the public sector. The report on overseas property was tabled last Tuesday and today, I have tabled the first of a series of reports on computerisation in the public sector with regard to the acquisition of ADP systems. This will be the first of a series in a comprehensive review by the Committee on major aspects of computer acquisition and usage. Next year, we will present reports on the Public Service Board MANDATA system, planning and co-ordination of ADP development, the efficiency and effectiveness of installed computer services, and the collection and use of statistics by the Commonwealth. </para>
      <para>We believe that these reports will give the Parliament a substantial basis upon which to assess the role of the public sector in this most significant and expensive area of administrative development. The Committee has also decided to undertake early in the new year a comprehensive review of the cost effectiveness of services to the unemployed. This examination will take into account the reports of the Norgard and Myer's reports into the Commonwealth Employment Service. The review will test the effectiveness of specific schemes in terms of established Government policy. </para>
      <para>The work of the Committee was significantly helped during the year by the secondment of officers from the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Public Service Board and the Auditor-General's Office. The Committee believes that the continuation on a regular basis of the secondment of officers from other departments is very useful, both to the Parliament and to the departments concerned, as it enables middle-ranking officers to obtain valuable experience and insight into the financial affairs and administration of a wide range of other departments. It also enables them to gain an appreciation of the role of the committees of the Parliament in financial scrutiny. </para>
      <para>During the year, the Committee also commenced the appointment of outside advisers, not only to help us with specific inquiries, but as a means of ensuring that the secretariat had access to specialists in areas of relevance to the Committee. Accordingly, we appointed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Peter</inline> MacGregor as our consultant in the area of automatic data processing. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr</inline><inline font-style="italic">K. C.</inline> O. Shann, C.B.E.- up until recently  Chairman  of the Public Service Board- and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr R.</inline> Jay, a specialist in government accounting and Federal-State financial relationships, have accepted appointments as special advisers and I hope to be soon in a position to announce that a retiring Justice of the Supreme Court of New South Wales will also take up a similar position with us. </para>
      <para>In 1978 we saw an extension of the Committee's interest in developing associations with similar committees in the Parliaments of our near neighbours. Following a visit to Canberra by a delegation of the PAC of the Parliament of Papua New Guinea, arrangements were made to second the previous secretary of the Committee to help the Papua New Guinea Parliament for a period of six months. We understand that the secondment of this officer has been of immense value. We also received a delegation from the Public Accounts Committee of the Parliament of the Solomon Islands and they are interested in maintaining a close relationship with us. Upon their attaining self-government, we also had discussions with the Government of the Northern Territory and we stand ready to assist them should they wish to establish a committee for financial scrutiny in that legislature. </para>
      <para>The Committee is encouraged by the growing interest internationally as well as in the State parliaments of Australia, in more effective scrutiny of public expenditure. During the year the  chairman  and secretary were invited to give evidence before a committee of the New South Wales Parliament and we have reason to believe that the PAC in the New South Wales Parliament will be significantly strengthened. The Commonwealth Parliamentary Association has established a working party made up of PAC chairmen from a number of member parliaments, including our own. They will be reviewing progress in London next September. </para>
      <para>Amendments to the Audit Act and introduction of efficiency auditing are seen by the Committee as being of great significance. We regret that it has not been possible for the Parliament to pass the enabling legislation during this session. Following discussions with the Government, it was agreed that the PAC and the Expenditure Committee of the House of Representatives would consider all efficiency audit recommendations and reports made by the Auditor-General. It is the PAC's preliminary view that we would be interested in acting as an arbiter in cases where departments are unable to agree to recommendations made by the Auditor-General and we have already commenced this role. </para>
      <para>We have noted with some concern the growing tendency of committees of the Parliament and even Ministers, to question publicly the recommendations made by the Auditor-General in his reports. We believe that the integrity of the Auditor-General should be safeguarded at all times and we fear that any major public criticism of him would not be in the best interests of the Parliament, nor assist the efficiency of government administration. Nevertheless there is a heavy responsibility on the Auditor-General to ensure that his reports are at all times balanced and fair. The PAC has always found this to be the case. In my 1977 report, I foreshadowed a number of significant amendments to the PAC Act. Unfortunately, little progress has been made on this matter, but we are assured by the Minister that enabling legislation will be passed during the autumn session. </para>
      <para>The Committee is concerned with the need to improve relations between the Parliament and the Public Service as a whole. We are conscious of a lamentable lack of appreciation by the latter of the work of Parliament, and of the tendency for public servants to forget that both the administration of Government policy and Parliament's right to protect the interests of electors, are in fact closely related. We are both indispensable parts of the same system of government, the efficiency of which should be of common interest to us all. As in previous years, the  chairman  of the Committee and the secretary were invited to speak at a number of seminars conducted by the Public Service Board for medium and senior officers of the Public Service. We have also continued our close relationship with the Royal Institute of Public Administration. The Committee has decided to take a further initiative in this field by establishing on an annual basis a seminar for medium ranking officers of the Public Service, where members of both Houses of Parliament, especially those who are involved in the work of committees such as the Senate Committee on Finance and Government Operations, and the Expenditure Committee, can join with us in discussing issues of relevance with middle-ranking officers of the Public Service. The first seminar will be held in Canberra during the second week of the autumn session. </para>
      <para>It is my hope that during 1979, we will also be able to build further regular contacts with professional organisations in the private sector, in particular the Institute of Auditors and the various State branches of the society of accountants. While we do not question the need for an independent career Public Service, nevertheless there is a constant need for a greater degree of co-operation between the private and public sectors, not only at the level of staff transfers and secondments, but just as important, the establishment of a regular means of more effective communication. </para>
      <para>I would like to conclude by thanking the Auditor-General, the  Chairman  of the Public Service Board and the Secretary of the Department of Finance, as well as their officers for the considerable support they have so willingly given us during the year. I must also, on behalf of my colleagues, thank our extremely hard working secretariat, ably led by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Michael</inline> Talberg; without their dedication, the effective performance of our task would be quite impossible. </para>

          <para>-by leave- For the second time this week we are indebted to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts for the reports that it has brought down. We are suitably impressed with the amount of work that it has done. It surprises me that the Committee, meeting before the Parliament sits, has managed to deal with its work load. That it has been able to carry out an analysis of the problems that have been referred to it is worthy of admiration. Those are nice comments to make but they have to be made. We will need to look at the work load which we impose upon the Public Accounts Committee. I do not know whether the Committee is able to break into subcommittees. If it is not, such a provision should be made to facilitate its investigations. If that is not possible, we may reach the point where there will need to be not one but two Public Accounts Committees to enable the excellent work that has been detailed in this place this morning to be continued. </para>

        <para class="block">Yesterday, the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare in its report on ethics in wine promotion expressed its concern at the Australian Wine Board 's use of a film to promote Australian table wines. Though it was not central to the issues which were raised it was declared both in the report and in my statement to the Senate that the film <inline font-style="italic">Drink No Longer Water</inline> had not been submitted for registration and classification under the prescribed procedures. This statement was made on the basis of advice from the Commonwealth Film Censorship Board. It was given to us by the Board. It was also made on the basis of advice from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Robert</inline> Mayne, National Promotions Manager of the Wine Board.

          <para>The film 'Drink No Longer Water' produced by the Wine Board was submitted to Censor and received a 'G' rating (Commonwealth Centre P77/ 1635).

        </quote>
        <para class="block">So, this same gentleman has informed us now on two separate occasions of two separate procedures that apparently were followed in respect of the same film. The Committee had further inquiries made this morning and these inquiries have established that the information given to us earlier was, in fact, incorrect despite careful checking at the time. The Committee has now been advised that a film under a somewhat different title was submitted to the Film Censorship Board by a firm of film distributors in December 1977 and given a 'G' classification by the censor who viewed it. We understand that this is the same film which is now known under the title <inline font-style="italic">Drink No Longer Water</inline> and which was viewed by the Film Censorship Board, as a result of the Committee's inquiries, and classified NRC- not recommended for children- by the Film Censorship Board itself. So, the same film has been given two classifications. The *G' classification is now being revoked. </para>
        <para>On the major issue of the format of the film and its suitability for use in the promotion of wine, the Committee's view remains unchanged. However, we express our regret at any inaccuracy which may have been contained in our statement to the Senate yesterday and which obviously was made on the basis of incorrect information. I make this statement on the Committee 's behalf at the earliest opportunity so as to put the record straight. </para>

            <para>- As we all know, Japan is Australia's largest export market and I was particularly grateful to have been given the opportunity of visiting that country for the first time as a member of the Australian parliamentary delegation. During the period we spent in Japan we had significant interviews with prominent Ministers including the Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fukuda,</inline> and the Foreign Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sonada.</inline> We also met representatives of all the political parties as well as leaders in the steel, atomic energy, electronics, motor vehicle and fishing industries. We had very useful discussions on matters of mutual interest. This report highlights aspects of the tour which we believe are significant and some of the matters raised require attention and action by the Government. The delegation's report draws attention particularly to the exorbitant air fares between Australia and Japan and urges the Government to exert every effort to have these air fares substantially reduced. As we all know, the Japanese are enthusiastic tourists and it is felt that a reduction in air fares would result in a marked increase in the tourist flow between the two countries. The Government should also give further encouragement to cultural exchange between the two countries as a way of promoting a greater understanding between our two peoples. </para>
          </talk.start>

        <para>I believe that the members of the delegation worked particularly well together in the interests of Australia when we visited that country. 1 would like to pay particular tribute to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ian</inline> Cochran, the Serjeant-at-Arms who was our Secretary, and also to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Don</inline> Dobinson, the Foreign Affairs liaison officer. The assistance of those officers was invaluable and without their expert attention and guidance the results achieved by the delegation would not have been anywhere near as successful as they were. I draw the attention of honourable senators to the fact that copies of this report are available in the Par.liamentary Library or in the Journals Office for anybody who would like to look at it. I commend the report to honourable senators. </para>

          <para>-by leave- Most of us who were members of the parliamentary delegation that visited Japan went there with some preconceived ideas about the Japanese, their way of life and their economy. Some of those preconceptions were confirmed but others were not. I think that two weeks certainly is insufficient time in which to become an expert on another country, but it was sufficient time for us to gain some insight into the various aspects of the Japanese way of life. I am sure that the members of the delegation who made this visit in July of this year will continue to have a long association with our major trading partner as a result of this visit. I am sure also that the association between the members themselves and Japan will continue. I would like to quote just one part of the report and comment briefly on it. The part that I would like to quote is concerned with the recommendations on page 27 of the report. One recommendation reads as follows: </para>
        </talk.start>
        <quote>
          <para>The Australian Government, in conjunction with the State Governments, should determine and provide the additional facilities and resources necessary to ensure the much wider teaching of the Japanese language and other Asian languages in Australian schools. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">I am very firmly of the opinion that we in Australia should make a great effort to encourage language teaching- not necessarily in the languages that traditionally have been taught in Australian schools, but especially in South East Asian languages, and amongst those I include the Japanese language. I think, too, that we should have a look at providing these teaching facilities not only in the secondary schools, where traditionally languages have been taught, but also in the primary schools, where children are very adept at learning languages if they are given the proper opportunity. </para>
        <para>Let us look at the official figures on language teaching in Australia. For the information of those honourable senators who are interested, I point out that a report termed 'Teaching of Migrant Languages in Schools' was recently before this Parliament. On pages 17 and 38 of that report there are some firm statistics which show how we in Australia are lagging in providing opportunities for students to study the languages of our near neighbours. We see from those tables that both in primary schools and in secondary schools the languages that are taught the most are the traditional languages of French and German. There is also fairly extensive teaching of other European languages such as Italian, but very little of the languages of South East Asian countries and very little of the Japanese language. </para>
        <para>The hospitality that was shown to the delegation by our Japanese hosts was almost overwhelming at times. It was hospitality which one could not fault. I take this opportunity to thank our Japanese hosts for all that they did for us. I trust that some day I will have the opportunity to return the hospitality which was shown to the delegation. </para>

          <para>- On 20 October last year <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen,</inline> on behalf of the Joint Committee on Publications, presented to the Senate the Committee's report on its inquiry into the purpose, scope and distribution of the Parliamentary Papers Series. Honourable senators will recall that the Committee's inquiry was the first thorough investigation of the content and effectiveness of the Series since the examination by the Joint Select Committee on Parliamentary  and Government Publications in 1964, some 13 years earlier. The report of the Committee has been closely studied by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker</inline> and me and our respective officers. I now wish to inform the Senate of the action which we have taken, or propose to take, as a result of the Committee's recommendations. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>In respect of recommendation 1, which deals with the duplication of distribution and wastage, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker</inline> and I have accepted this recommendation and we will shortly be writing to honourable senators and honourable members, advising them of the arrangements we propose to make to give effect to the recommendation. Recommendation No. 2, which deals with the encouragement of departments, et cetera, to report to the Parliament, is a matter for the Government and we have written to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser),</inline> drawing it to his attention. </para>
        <para>In respect of recommendation No. 3, which deals with failure to meet statutory requirements to table annual reports, the presentation of annual reports to the Parliament, in accordance with the statutory requirement, has long been of concern to the Senate. The Committee has recommended that the  Clerk  of the Senate and the  Clerk  of the House of Representatives advise the  Chairman  of the Publications Committee where a department, statutory authority, et cetera, has failed to meet its statutory requirement to table its annual report, return or other document within the specified statutory period, or within a reasonable period of time following the completion of the period to which the report refers. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker</inline> and I are pleased to implement this recommendation and we have advised the Prime Minister that we intend to interpret ' a reasonable period of time following the completion of the period to which the report refers' as being three months. This action has particular relevance for the Senate as it will mean that those bodies that report to the Parliament on a financial year basis will have the period up to the end of September in which to report and those that report on a calendar year basis will have the period up to the end of March. Observance of these deadlines will further assist the work and effectiveness of the Senate's Estimates committees. </para>
        <para>Recommendations 6 to 9 have been accepted. However, in relation to recommendation 6, concerning the free distribution of the principal parliamentary publications, the Australian Government Publishing Service has expressed some concern that the number of those eligible for such publications could increase alarmingly and therefore greatly increase production costs. We have determined that the guidelines suggested by the Committee are not significantly different from those currently operative and that the increase in the number of recipients will not therefore become a matter of concern. However, our officers will watch this aspect closely and, should problems arise, we will refer the matter to the Publications Committee for re-examination. Recommendations 10 to 13, 15 to 18 and 23 fall within the ministerial responsibility of the Minister for Administrative Services. The  Speaker  and I have drawn his attention to the matters raised by the Committee. The  Speaker  and I have accepted recommendations 19 to 22 and the necessary action will be taken as soon as possible. </para>
        <para>The  Speaker  and I are pleased to have been able to respond to the report of the Publications Committee. I trust that the actions I have outlined to honourable senators will have the full support of the Senate. I table the text of the statement, together with a copy of the recommendations of the Committee. </para>

          <para>-by leave-As  Chairman  of the Senate Publications Committee, of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> is now a member- a fact that he realised with pleasure yesterday- let me say that he will be pleased to see that his Committee as long as 14 months ago had got down to the particular aspect that is now worrying him. The Presiding Officers have taken practical steps to bring this matter into action. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> I welcome very much, on behalf of the Committee, the initiative which you and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker</inline> have taken and the action you have set out in the report. We feel that this will be of very great assistance to the operations of the Parliament. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Perhaps I need say no more about the failure to present annual reports, which has been and continues to be a long-standing problem which needs action. Clearly, what you have indicated will bring it to the attention of the Senate, and the House of Representatives will have the same opportunity to see where statutory bodies fail to carry out their undertakings. We will not have to wait until the end of the year to do this. At the same time I draw attention to the fact that recommendation 4, which is not mentioned in the statement, was one in respect of which we as a Committee had in mind that as a follow-up the Committee would table in Parliament at the end of each session a return indicating which bodies had failed to carry out their undertakings. I suppose it is within the power of the Committee to do so. Now that you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> have indicated an order of procedure, I trust that the Committee will go ahead and table a return at the end of each session so that we will know which bodies are not complying with the undertakings given. </para>
        <para>Other recommendations call for action which we hope will be taken by the Minister for Administrative Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Chaney).</inline> The parliamentary paper series is an important part of parliamentary equipment It records the various important reports that are made from time to time. It is important that the series be standardised and readily available to people. The Committee welcomes the initiatives which you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker</inline> have undertaken. We trust that they will lead to practical results. </para>

          <para>Australian National University Amendment Bill 1978 </para>
          <para>The Government has been concerned for some time with the question of compulsory membership of student organisations in universities and colleges of advanced education, and with the opportunities for expenditure of moneys by these organisations on activities which many students and their parents find offensive. The Australian National University Amendment Bill 1978 is designed to protect the rights of individual students by ensuring that they are not compelled as a condition of enrolment to join an organisation of students and that fees provided are not used for purposes which are not directly related to theninterests as students. </para>
          <para>Specifically, the Bill will provide that membership of student organisations will be voluntarythe University will still be able to collect voluntary membership fees on behalf of ari organisation; that a compulsory fee will continue to be levied by the University for the provision of amenities and services to students which will directly benefit the University; that a student is not to be penalised within the University for failure to join a student organisation; and that the proceeds of compulsory fees are not to be paid to any national organisation representing students. In addition, the Bill places the obligation on the governing Council of the University to declare in a statute which are the approved amenities or services on which the compulsory fees are to be spent. The Council is also to have the obligation to have prepared and audited financial statements relating to the expenditure of compulsory fees. These statements are to be made freely available to students. The Bill provides also that in application of these principles the University will not be able to allocate compulsory fees moneys to student representative organisations on campus unless the members of the governing body of those organisations have been elected by at least one-quarter of the members. </para>
          <para>The Government believes that these arrangements should be governed by provisions in the University Act rather than by subordinate legislation. It has commended the principles embodied in these amendments to the States for application to their own universities and colleges of advanced education. Honourable senators will also note that the Bill provides for the substitution of the office of Secretary of the University by that of Assistant Vice-Chancellor. This amendment has been sought by the University Council in recognition of the functions now associated with this position in the University which account for a preference for the title of Assistant Vice-Chancellor. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>
          <para>Canberra College of Advanced Education Amendment Bill 1978 </para>
          <para>Following on the amendments which I have outlined for the Australian National University Act, the Government also intends to introduce similar legislation for the Canberra College of Advanced Education. The Canberra College of Advanced Education Amendment Bill 1978 makes the same provisions with regard to student organisations as the Australian National University Bill, with the difference that the college Bill takes into consideration the relationship between the Minister and the College which already exists in its Act. This means that the Minister will continue to have the power of direction with regard to determinations on fees by the College Council and will now have the same power with regard to the determination of which amenities or services are eligible to be supported from compulsory fees. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

            <para>- by leave- I am advised by the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> that the non-passage of this Bill will cause some delay in payments, particularly in the industry promotional area. However, every effort will be made to minimise this effect and to ensure that payments are not unduly delayed. The passage of the Bill is expected early in the autumn session of 1 979. </para>

          </para>
          <para>The main purpose of this Bill is to authorise the payment to Queensland of $2 1.7m in 1978-79 as a special grant. The payment of this amount is in accordance with the recommendations of the Commonwealth Grants Commission contained in its forty-fifth report on special assistance for the States which was tabled recently. In accordance with normal practice, the Bill also seeks authority for payment of advances to Queensland in the early months of 1979-80, pending receipt of the Commission's recommendations for that year and enactment of necessary legislation to provide for any special grant that may be payable to the State in that year. The Commonwealth Government from time to time on the recommendation of the Commonwealth Grants Commission and following applications by States makes special grants to the less populous States to compensate them for such factors as lower capacity to raise revenue from their own sources and higher costs of providing government services of a standard comparable to that provided by the financially stronger States. </para>
          <para>When such special grants were first paid they constituted the only regular form of general revenue assistance to the financially weaker States for this purpose. However, for many years now, the main way in which special compensatory assistance has been provided to these States has been through the payment of higher per capita amounts of other general revenue funds. This situation is reflected today in the fact that personal income tax sharing entitlements paid to Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania are higher, in per capita terms, than the entitlements paid to New South Wales and Victoria. Under the personal income tax sharing arrangements, the less populous States continue to be free to apply for special financial assistance on the recommendation of the Commonwealth Grants Commission. This is one of the explicit understandings between the Commonwealth and State Governments in relation to the tax sharing arrangements. Such special grants supplement a State's entitlement under the tax sharing arrangements in the same way as they formerly supplemented the financial assistance grants. </para>
          <para>Queensland has been the only claimant State in recent years. However, Tasmania, which withdrew from claimancy in 1974-75, applied on 30 June 1978 for special assistance in respect of 1977-78 and the matter has been referred to the Commission. Queensland's estimated entitlement in respect if 1978-79 under the personal income tax sharing arrangements is $844.9m, representing $387 per head of population compared with an estimated average of $287 per head for New South Wales and Victoria. Accordingly, the assistance provided by way of the special grant should be seen as supplementing the special compensatory assistance of $ 100 per head, or some $220m, provided to Queensland by way of the tax sharing entitlement. </para>
          <para>The Commonwealth Grants Commission, in arriving at its recommendations in relation to claims for special assistance, makes an assessment of the 'financial needs' of a claimant State. In making such assessments, the Commission compares in detail the finances of the claimant State with those of New South Wales and Victoria, taking into account differences in revenueraising capacity and differences in the cost of providing comparable services. Normally special grants recommended by the Commission consist of two parts. One part is based on a preliminary estimate of the claimant State's financial need in the current financial year, and is treated as an advance payment subject to adjustment two years later when the Commission has compared in detail the finances of the claimant and standard States for that year. The other part represents the final adjustment to the advance payment made two years earlier and is known as the completion payment. This adjustment may be positive or negative and therefore may result in the final grant in respect of the year being higher or lower than the advance payment for that year. </para>
          <para>The payment to Queensland in 1978-79 of $2 1.7m provided for by this Bill comprises: An advance payment of $ 16m in respect of 1978-79; and a completion payment of $5. 7m in respect of 1976-77. The completion payment in respect of 1976-77, when added to the $ 1 8m advance grant paid to Queensland in that year, brings the final grant in respect of 1976-77 to $23.7m, which is $12. lm below the corresponding figure for 1975-76. The advance grant for 1978-79 will, in accordance with normal practice, be subject to adjustment in two years time. The Commission's recommendations in relation to the special grants arrangements have been adopted by the Parliament each year since the Commission's inception and the Government considers that they should be accepted on this occasion. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </para>

          <para>The purpose of the Bill now before the Senate is to give effect to the Government's decision to provide assistance to the assembly in Australia of general purpose commercial motor vehicles, including buses, having a gross vehicle mass of 2.72 tonnes or more. Following advice from the Industries Assistance Commission in its report No. 169 of 15May 1978 on light commercial and four-wheel drive vehicles and heavier commercial vehicles and components, it has been decided to accord assistance by way of a bounty scheme providing for payment to eligible Australian assemblers of a bounty at the rate of 20 per cent of the into-store value of axles, gear boxes, propellor shafts, air brake equipment and suspension systems, having an Australian content of not less than 65 per cent, which are purchased from suppliers not associated in business with the vehicle assembler for use as original equipment in the assembly of general purpose commercial motor vehicles, including buses, having a gross vehicle mass of 2.72 tonnes or more, during the period to which the Act applies. </para>
          <para>The scheme, which will operate from 17 August 1978 and cease on 31 December 1984, is part of a total package of measures designed to encourage the assembly in Australia of commercial motor vehicles; generally to maintain employment in the industry; and at the same time to provide opportunities to reduce the impact of the prices of commercial vehicles on transport costs in Australia. The other elements of the package, which were implemented on 17 August 1978, involved the setting of the rate of customs duty on imported completely built up vehicles at 22.5 per cent and the admission duty free under by-law of imported original equipment components and assemblies which do not form part of unassembled vehicles at the time of importation into Australia. Clause 22 of the Bill continues the Government's policy of expanding, wherever possible, the jurisdiction of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in relation to administrative decisions which affect the rights or entitlements of persons under Commonwealth legislation. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </para>

          <para>These amendments are simple machinery matters so I intend to be brief. The first amendment will enable a member of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, appointed to office under the Trade Union Training Authority Act 1975, to receive remuneration and allowances in the performance of the duties of that position with the Authority and at the same time retain office as a member of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. This type of provision is by no means unusual and has been inserted in other relevant legislation in the past. Honourable senators will know that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Commissioner</inline> M. E. Heagney, a man with long trade union experience, and who has contributed much to the work of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission over the past 6 years, was appointed National Director from 1 August this year. I am sure that honourable senators on both sides would congratulate Commissioner Heagney on his appointment as National Director, and that with his sound leadership TUTA will continue to gain increasing support from the trade union movement and industry generally. </para>
          <para>The second amendment concerns the question of remuneration for chairmen of the councils for union training established in each State. The Government sees these State councils providing valuable advice in respect of trade union training in each State. The chairmen of these councils will be required to contribute a significant amount of time to their tasks and consequently appropriate remuneration is warranted. Under the current terms of the Act, the chairmen are precluded from receiving remuneration. </para>
          <para>The purpose of the third and final amendment is to protect the position of a member of or candidate for election to State or Federal Parliament who accepts an office on a council or the Executive Board of TUTA. I am sure that all senators will agree that those members of parliament who are prepared to contribute their skills and valuable time to statutory authorities such as TUTA should not be discouraged from doing so. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

            <para>-The Opposition opposes this legislation. The purpose of the Trade Practices Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1978 is to amend the Trade Practices Act 1 974 to provide a specific prohibition on a person who, together or in concert with another person, engages in conduct for the purpose having or likely to have the effect of preventing or substantially hindering a third person, not an employer of the first person, from engaging in interstate, territorial or overseas trade or commerce. There are, of course, complementary sections to that main purpose of the Bill. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In the limited time which is available to me might I, for the benefit of laymen, restate the purposes of the Bill in a somewhat different way. </para>
          <para>I refer to an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr John</inline> Short. When describing this legislation he said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The need to extend Section 45D to cover certain primary boycotts follows from the Government's realisation during the live sheep export dispute last April that there are considerable difficulties in construing such disputes as secondary boycotts. </para>
            <para>This is because secondary boycotts are denned as concerted actions by persons hindering or preventing a third person in supplying goods or services . . . </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">He went on to say: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Therefore, in order successfully to invoke the secondary boycott provisions of the Act in the live sheep export dispute it would have been necessary to prove that the relevant union was putting pressure on, say, the shipping lines to stop the exportation of sheep. </para>
            <para>But it would have been difficult for any party using the Trade Practices Act against the union to prove that the union was, in fact, putting such pressure on the shipping lines. </para>
            <para>Under the amendments introduced yesterday it would not be necessary to establish such pressure. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I have referred to that article because for the purposes of the comments which I briefly want to make about this question it is perhaps an adequate explanation of the purpose of the legislation. </para>
          <para>On 2 June 1977 the Parliament, which was to rise on that day for the winter recess, debated the first inclusion in the legislation of provisions relating to secondary boycotts. It is an extraordinary facet of the operations of this Government that any legislation which is of a controversial nature, and particularly legislation of a controversial nature which impinges upon the area of industrial relations, is always introduced on the last day of a sitting. Not only is it introduced on the last day of a sitting but also the experience so far has been that much of that legislation has not been used. This has been the pattern with the Industrial Relations Bureau legislation and with the Commonwealth employees conditions of employment legislation which prescribed penalties for Commonwealth employees who take industrial action. Although this sort of legislation has been introduced on the last day of a sitting, not one piece of this legislation in fact has been proclaimed. </para>
          <para>It is, of course, characteristic of this Government that its industrial relations policy is really confined to trying to induce high drama into a situation which is not one in which dramatis personae perform with the most effective results. When the Trade Practices Amendment Bill 1 977 was before the Senate on 2 June 1977 1 said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>It is a matter of regret that it is brought into the Senate on the second last day of the parliamentary sitting before . . . the winter recess. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>In referring to this aspect of the legislation I drew to the Senate's attention the Labor Opposition's concern in these terms: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>We say that this is a silly part of the legislation and one which should be exorcised by an intelligent government which is concerned with its own rhetoric about industrial relations. Of course, by virtue of that provision substantial penalties can be imposed on persons, including unions, engaged . . . in secondary boycotts. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I went on to speak to that matter in those terms. Again, as I say, this legislation is legislation which comes up under the guise of trade practices legislation which is basically concerned with the situation of industrial relations in this country. I would like to quote from a 1975 speech of the present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> on this subject. In regard to the subject of industrial relations he said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Our view is that satisfactory industrial relations depend ultimately on the attitudes of mind of people in industry. Attitudes of mutual respect, a willingness to listen, to understand, to reason and discuss in an informed way, are essential. These attitudes cannot be created by any party's industrial relations policies. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>What I briefly put to the Senate in relation to this legislation is that again it is symptomatic of the silly courses of conduct that have been followed by this Government on industrial relations. I also draw attention to one or two matters that I think are very important in this regard. The scapegoat syndrome runs very strongly through this Government's overall policies, and particularly so through its industrial relations policies. None of the rhetoric about attitudes of mind in which the Prime Minister indulged himself in 1975 has ever been reflected in legislation brought before the Parliament by this Government. </para>
          <para>Of course, important documents relating to the very questions that are concerned with attitudes of mind have been tabled in the Senate. For example, the Jackson Committee had some very savage things to say about industrial relations in this country and the determinants in bad industrial relations generally. This Government has done nothing about any of the matters relating to industrial relations that were raised in the Jackson Committee report. That, of course, is not a malaise which results purely from the conduct of trade unions. It is one which affects Australian industry, employer and employee alike, and is one of the principal causes of the problems from which we now suffer, and which the Government seeks to rectify by empty rhetoric about its industry policy. </para>
          <para>The greatest problem that faces this country is that of the inability of Australian manufacturing industry to compete. That, in turn, involves all sorts of factors. It is not, as this Government would have us believe, just wage overhang. Important management factors are also involved. There is the important factor of morale in the work force. The Government has done nothing about all these things. If it were to be good enough to consult the last Bureau of Statistics' figures on strikes in Australia- which both by Australian and international standards are at a relatively low level- it will note a most interesting category of strikes in Australia which relates to the Jackson report- management induced strikes. Some 15 per cent or more of strikes are described as management induced. Similarly, the Jackson Committee had things to say about the high level of industrial accidents, another area in which this Government either nationally or through negotiations with the States, has given no leadership. It has introduced a lot of legislation that is full of sound and fury, signifying not very much- legislation that has proved totally irrelevant to the resolution of industrial disputes. </para>
          <para>The Government, as it brings down this legislation today, has right before its eyes the transport workers' strike of a week or two ago, in which the provisions of section  45D  were invoked by a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gorman</inline> in Victoria. There was a lot of noise and huffing and puffing about all that but, again, the resolution of the dispute was in the hands of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, which brought it to a quite speedy end. </para>
          <para>We can refer, as we have done in debates before, to the live sheep export question. The resolution of that matter has not been in any way in the hands of the Government. In two of the key States concerned it has been resolved by negotiation. One can go right back through the major disputes which have plagued industrial relations in this country for the last two or three years. I have in mind the Telecom strike, in which the Government interfered, with the direct result that the strike was kept going longer than it need have. Again, the Government interfered in the Waterside Workers' Federation strike. That strike was a direct consequence of this Government's failure to do anything about the capacity of Australian unions to amalgamate. The Latrobe Valley strike also was settled by process of conciliation and arbitration. </para>
          <para>One can examine every major strike that this country has had since the Fraser Government came to power and note that it has been settled through the conciliation and arbitration system and largely, if not exclusively, as a result of the negotiating efforts of the  President  of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, whom this Government indulges in the luxury of abusing from time to time. The important role played by the  President  of the ACTU, in terms of the public interest in this country, has not been matched by any of the scrappy and rubbishy legislation in this field which this Government has brought down. </para>

              <para>-Yes, but maybe the honourable senator will think about it over Christmas. He would need three months to do that. I have made the point on numerous occasions in this place and it is now sinking into the Government's skull to the extent that a special committee of Ministers has been appointed to deal with industrial relations. What decisions of value to society will result from the deliberations of that committee, if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack</inline> 's comment is any indication of its quality, I do not know.

          <para>My final important point is that during this Government 's term of office these matters have been resolved within the province of the conciliation and arbitration system, which is unique in the world but, which I agree, is full of faults. But that is the arena in which, I would put it on behalf of the Opposition, these matters should be dealt with. This Government's policies are very derivative. The amendments to the trade practices legislation represent basically a pinch from the United States of America, where a totally different industrial situation obtains. In that country there is no conciliation and arbitration system. It does not have Bob Hawkes, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Moores and such people, who are appropriately concerned with these matters, experienced in them and have the capacity to settle them. </para>

              <para>-No, I did not say that. That is a clever interjection, but the honourable senator knows that I did not say it. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> is seriously interested in the point he should read the comment that I made when we last debated the trade practices legislation and its social and utilitarian value. The point I make relates purely to industrial relations, an area in which there has been massive failure by the Government. The amendment before us is but another attempt to wave a big stick to support the empty rhetoric which has come from Government Ministers but which produced no results in terms of the public interest. For the reasons that I have given, the Opposition opposes the legislation. </para>

              <para>- No, because I want to devote my time to another aspect. In any event someone else will doubtless speak on that aspect. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> went perhaps a little further than he had intended and appeared to have given away trade practices legislation altogether. Perhaps he was saying that only the trade union movement should not, under any circumstances, be touched by trade practices legislation. If that is so I find it a curious concept and one which I certainly do not support. I believe that trade unions also should be subject to such legislation and I have no doubt that it will be understood by the public that this is what this Bill does. </para>

          <para>The part of the first Bill to which I want particularly to refer is that which brings into effect a law, which now will be applicable throughout the whole of Australia, relating to the creation of manufacturers' warranties. It is an important amendment to the law and means that justice will be given to the consumer who finds himself in a situation where there is something defective in goods that are sold to him. At the moment he can sue perhaps only the person who sold him the goods whereas the manufacturer who, in fact, is responsible for the inefficiency of the goods gets away scot-free and has done so for some years. This is an aspect of the law which I think it is important should be remedied. It is a matter about which this Parliament has had some concern and in recent years there have been reports on this subject. The Swanson Committee reported in favour of such national legislation and the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, whose report I tabled in this Parliament in December 1976, likewise reported in favour of legislation. The Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Fife)</inline> in his second reading speech had this to say about those reports: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Those reports considered that it is the manufacturer placing goods on the market in the first place who is largely responsible for the quality of the goods. Accordingly, it is sensible for the law to require manufacturers to be directly responsible for statutorily imposed standards in respect of the quality of those goods. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>The legislation we are discussing today, I think quite effectively, carries that into operation. </para>
          <para>I want to say two things and I will refer to the first very briefly. The course of debate on these Bills in the House of Representatives was interesting inasmuch as they were amongst the first Bills to be considered by the new legislation committees. There was a useful discussion with the Legislation Committee by members of the House of Representatives on the significance of these Bills and also on the amendments which arose in the course of that discussion. I think that it is useful that legislation committees are now an operating part of the House of Representatives. The second and more major point I wish to make is that what is now being carried into effect by this legislation is the very useful scheme of adopting statutorily created warranties which will be applicable to contracts. This will be in the interests of consumers. </para>
          <para>During the course of debate the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, the Honourable Wal Fife, produced a document which I think is very useful and ought to be incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> because it sets out the law reform provided in the ordinance which was the subject of the report by the Senate Committee and the reform which is included in this Bill. However, there are some differences between them. I think that it would be useful if this document, which I have shown to the Opposition and of which, of course, the Minister is aware, were incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> I seek leave to incorporate the document. </para>

			<para>The A.C.T. Ordinance imposes on manufacturers, liability for their goods in the form of statutorily created warranties in favour of a consumer, as if a contract existed between them. Where one of these warranties is not complied with, a consumer can commence an action against the manufacturer to recover damages as if it were an action for breach of warranty under contract between the manufacturer and the consumer (sub-section 5(1)). </para>

          <para>Under the Commonwealth Bill the liability of the manufacturer flows from the statutory rights of action given to a consumer, where the prescribed elements of the causes of action set out in the Bill (proposed sections 74b- 74g) are established. There is no implied contractual relationship; the consumer can recover compensation for loss or damage suffered by the failure of the statutory obligation. Damages are neither specifically contractual nor tortious. </para>

        <item label="3.">
          <para>The obligations in the Bill on manufacturers with respect to their goods are essentially the same as those contained, in the form of warranties, in the Ordinance, namely that: goods are of merchantable quality; goods are fit for purpose; goods correspond with description; goods correspond with sample; manufacturers ensure a reasonable availability of spare parts and repair facilities; manufacturers comply with express warranties. </para>

            <para>- This document sets out an analysis of the differences between the Ordinance and the Bill. At one stage the ordinance was not in effect. It had been disallowed but as a result of the Senate Committee's consideration, was subsequently reintroduced in an amended form. There are a number of alterations being made to the law and I want to refer to two or three of them that are included in the Bill in a different form. They cover essentially the same area inasmuch as they provide warranties which require that goods shall be of merchantable quality, as represented; that they will be fit for the purpose for which they are represented; that they will correspond with description and sample, where samples are provided; and they implied that manufacturers will ensure a reasonable availability of spare parts and repair facilities and that they will comply with express warranties. They cover the same general ambit but in regard to the definitions of 'goods', there is some difference. Whereas in the Ordinance the goods that were covered were those of a kind ordinarily acquired for private use or consumption, in the Bill they are described as 'of a kind ordinarily acquired for personal, domestic or household use or consumption'. That, of course, may cover less in some cases and in others it may cover more. There will be that variation. </para>

		  <para>The legislation is a little different from the Australian Capital Territory ordinance, as it now stands, in that there are different time limits. People will have to take action within three years instead of the ordinary common law requirement to take action within six years if they have a claim. Overall there is an absolute limit on any action in respect of goods more than 10 years old. In addition, this legislation does not contain any stipulation that where there is a breach of the liability in respect of spare parts, there is an offence. In the ordinance failure to provide spare parts was an offence subject to a fine. In this Bill the contract may be voided if the requirement is not complied with, although no offence is created. One other aspect which I find a little disappointing. I hope that consideration will be given to including it in the future- is that whereas in the ordinance or in the law as it exists in the Australian Capital Territory there is power to prescribe written regulations which set out the form of the written warranties to be given by manufacturers and also the manner in which such warranties are to be printed this is not included in the Bill. Certainly the Senate Committee in its report considered that this matter was rather important because a great deal often hangs on the way in which guarantees are set out and the way in which they are presented to people. Paragraph 35 of the Committee's report stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Committee recommends that, before the ordinance is reintroduced, section 10 should be amended to allow the Minister to make regulations to provide for the form of written guarantees and to prescribe or regulate the manner in which those guarantees are to be printed. The Committee recommends that if an offence is to be created for breach of the regulations, the nature of the offence and the penalty to be imposed should be spelt out in the ordinance itself. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I believe that that would have been advisable. I think that it is an important aspect and I hope that further consideration will be given to it. However, I do not desire to be niggling about this. This Bill does one very important thing. It now provides for the whole of Australia, through the Trade Practices Act, a law which was applicable previously only in the State of South Australia and in the Australian Capital Territory. I think these were the main areas where such laws applied. Therefore, one would expect some differences. No doubt certain representations have been made since the Committee reported two years ago and they should be taken into consideration. </para>
          <para>I want generally to commend the Government for going ahead with this legislation, and for making this particularly valuable alteration to the law. It will be useful to all consumers throughout Australia. I therefore hope that the Bill will be accepted by this Parliament and brought into speedy operation. </para>

            <para>-The Opposition's primary concern in this cognate debate is the Trade Practices Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1978 which has the effect of increasing very substantially the scope of section 45D of the Trade Practices Act. It is to that Bill that I devote my remarks. The amending legislation before us represents the final abandonment by the Government of the pretence that section 45D has anything at all to do with anti-competitive activity, or indeed to do with anything else that is properly within the scope of the Trade Practices Act Neither section 45D nor this amending legislation increasing its scope has anything at all to do with commercial law, with consumer protection or with the maintenance of fair and open competition in the market place. What section 45D is about is not the law of trade practices but the law of industrial relations. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>What an ill-conceived, what a misguided, what a provocative and what a destructive piece of legislation this is. What it is about is the protection of the interests of business, not from the depredations of monopolies or from other people unfairly manipulating market power, but rather from the legitimate activities of trade unions and their members; protection from trade unions and their officials doing the kind of things for the protection of their members that they have done since time immemorial and that they will go on doing so long as they are to discharge the trust and the confidence that their members vest in them. </para>
          <para>Like so much of the industrial legislation for which this Government has been responsiblethe establishment of the Industrial Relations Bureau; the amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act significantly increasing the scope of the punitive or penal powers under that legislation; and the Commonwealth Employees Act vesting powers of suspension, stand down or dismissal of public employees engaged in just about any conceivable form of industrial action; specific provisions of legislation like the Atomic Energy Amendment Bill, aimed quite specifically and directly at particular forms of legitimate trade union protest- this Bill is just another crude and vulgar piece of legislative union-bashing. Section 4SD is such in its original form, and it will become even more so by the passage of this amending legislation. </para>
          <para>Section 4SD, in its short and unhappy history so far, has done absolutely nothing to improve or rationalise industrial relations in this country. It has done nothing to encourage the effective resolution of disputes through the only machinery that has proved itself capable over the years of so doing- the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. On the contrary, section 45D has done an enormous amount to sour and embitter industrial relations, to create a climate in which simple and routine industrial disputes can and do rapidly escalate into full blown industrial crises. As a result, the work of the industrial tribunal is made infinitely more difficult. </para>
          <para>Let me remind the Senate of just what kinds of penalties and sanctions are associated with the operation of section 45D. They are penalties and sanctions on a scale which is unparalleled in any previous industrial legislation. Under section 76 of the parent Act, trade unions or their officials are liable for statutory penalties of up to $250,000. They are also liable under section 82 for open-ended civil actions for damages. Furthermore, under section 8 1 they are liable for injunction proceedings, with all the consequential liability associated therewith for contempt if injunctions are breached by maintenance of bans after court orders have been made. </para>
          <para>In respect of what kinds of industrial action can these penalties and sanctions be applied? Under section 45d, any kind of industrial action which is aimed at hindering the movement of goods or services to or from a corporation- the corporation in question not being the immediate employer of those applying the bans- subjects unions and their officials to these sorts of penalties. It is true that the provision is subject to exemptions, the effect of which I will mention in a moment. But simply to state the basic prohibition in those terms is not to appreciate the enormous potential width of it. It has a particular, and immediate and an obvious application in the service industries to unions which are engaged in the packing, the storage, the transport and the distribution of goods from corporation to corporation. That point, of course, has not been lost on employers in that area and in recent days writs have been flying around like confetti against unions like the Transport Workers Union and the Storemen and Packers Union. </para>
          <para>Apparently section 45d is not wide enough and far reaching enough to satisfy the insatiable appetite for industrial provocation of this Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> and his Government. We now have before us amending legislation extending the range of that basic prohibition into all forms of industrial activity aimed at hindering not just corporations but anyone at all in the market place, again other than the immediate employers of those imposing the bans. It is aimed at anyone engaged in trade, as the Bill says, between Australia and places outside Australia, in trade among the States or in trade within a territory, between a State and a terri.tiory or between two territories. A whole new set of constitutional powers is being wheeled in to sustain the legislation, not just the previous power in section 51 (20) of the Constitution relating to corporations. Now section 51(1), the trade and commerce power, and section 122, the Territories power, of the Constitution are being employed. What we have in this amending legislation is a massive escalation in the scope of the operation of the Act so that it will bite on all forms of industrial action as they affect interstate, overseas or territorial trade. I hardly need spell out in burdensome detail just what proportion of Australian industrial and commercial activity is subsumed under those particular categories. </para>
          <para>We were told that the object of the amending legislation- we were not told this very candidly in the second reading speech but it emerged during debates, particularly in the other place- is specifically to empower the Government and the courts to deal with the particular issue of live sheep exports which, for technical reasons, were not specifically caught up by section 45D. But on the very face of the provision now before us it is clear that the amended section is to have an infinitely wider application than that. A whole set of new ingredients is being added to the already potent recipe for industrial conflict that section 45d represents. It is said that legitimate or proper trade union activity is exempt from the operation of section 4Sd, that it is excluded both from the scope of the provision as it now stands and the scope of the provision as it will be if this amending Bill is passed. </para>

              <para>-It is true that industrial action is exempt by virtue of section 4SD (3) if its dominant purpose- how difficult it is to establish the dominant purpose of any particular piece of industrial action- has to do with the remuneration, the conditions of employment, the hours of work or the working conditions of particular employees engaging in a strike or a ban or other limitation action in question. It is also said, and it follows from the terms of the legislation, that if it is a dispute about job terminations in the particular work place in question, then that also is covered. But even the most cursory scrutiny of the terms of those exemptions makes it very obvious that they cover only one small corner of what has been traditionally regarded as legitimate industrial action. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Let me indicate just some of the familiar areas of industrial controversy which are not covered by the terms of those exemptions. I can identify without too much difficulty seven substantial and familiar areas of industrial controversy which are not so covered. In the first place, any form of action which is designed to assist the remuneration or the conditions of employment of fellow members of one's union working under different employers is not covered by those exemptions. </para>
          <para class="block">Even if it is familiar industrial action in the sense of that term that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MacGibbon</inline> would accept, it is not covered by the terms of that exemption if it involves a situation where employers other than the immediate employers of the unionists in question are concerned. In the second place any form of industrial sympathy action, whether or not it extends across different union boundaries but certainly if it extends across the boundaries of different employers or different work situations, is again outside the scope of this legislation. Thirdly, any action taken by unionists to protect the strength and the bargaining power of themselves and their union by an endeavour to unionise work places which are not unionised or not completely unionised at the time of such action- for example, the kind of action that is in issue in the present Alliance Messenger dispute in which the Transport Workers Union again finds itself involved and which aroused the indignation of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Smithers earlier this week- again is clearly outside the scope of those limited exemptions for which the Act provides. </para>
          <para>Fourthly, any industrial action by employees of a particular employer which is aimed at securing an increase m their actual remuneration, their take home pay, by means of an increase in their actual earnings- for example, in the form of additional overtime rather than an increase in the rates of pay themselves, which is entirely familiar and routine industrial action- is again outside the scope of that section. Again, we have the authority of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Smithers in the Red North case for that astonishingly limiting interpretation. In the fifth place, any industrial action which is taken to improve the actual take home pay of workers by political protests against Medibank levies or increases in taxes, which have a direct and immediate bearing on their actual remuneration, is clearly outside the scope of these exemptions. </para>
          <para>Sixthly, any action which is taken in support of what might be described as peripheral employment benefits- for example, the provision of a creche for working mothers in a factory- would be outside the scope of these exemptions. On a strict interpretation of these words it could not be construed as something going to employment conditions, nor, I think, would it be construed legally speaking as relating to the actual working conditions of employees in the sense that it involves safety considerations or other things immediately related to job performance in the work place itself. Seventhly, it has to be said, acknowledged and noted that the certainly regrettable but all too familiar feature of our industrial scene- demarcation disputes between unions as to their respective coverage in a particular work place- would also be quite outside the scope of those exemption provisions. </para>
          <para>I am not saying that full blown industrial action in the form of strikes, bans or limitations is necessarily always defensible in every one of the industrial action situations that I have just been outlining and listing. But what I am saying is that there is an enormous range of forms of industrial action of the kind in which trade unions and their members have always engaged and will always engage from time to time so long as this is necessary to protect the interests of the working men and women of this country. An enormous range of industrial activities of this kind had been absolutely and completely outlawed by this draconic legislation in a way that is quite unprecedented in the 74-year history of our federal industrial system. </para>
          <para>The whole history of industrial relations in this country, both in recent years and going back over the whole course of this century, suggests that this kind of iron glove approach to industrial problem solving which has been taken to extremes in this particular legislation just cannot and will not ever solve anything. In taking a look back over the course of industrial relations in this century, the Prime Minister should stop and take a particularly long and hard look at the fate of Stanley Melbourne Bruce in 1929 when he decided single-handedly and unilaterally to achieve an industrial millennium at the expense of relying on the conciliation and arbitration machinery. </para>
          <para>The argument is made, and no doubt it will be made again by someone in the course of this debate, that what this Act is really doing is simply giving a bargaining counter to the employers, giving them some muscle with which to force the unions into a posture of retreat and compromise, and that its real significance is as a counterbalance to the raw brute force of industrial bargaining power exercised by the unions themselves. It may be a bargaining power, but so is a can of petrol and a match in the hands of a madman. Just as with a can of petrol, waving this kind of legislation about in a kind of random fashion to which it is potentially applicable can result in an explosion which will engulf not just the intended victim but also indeed everyone in the vicinity. Section 4SD of the Act has become the wild card in the pack. It is being used with an ever increasing frequency by people, especially small scale employers, who have no real experience, sensitivity or sense of responsibility when it comes to the handling of large scale industrial confrontations. </para>
          <para>The capacity of section 45D, with all the paraphernalia of lawyers, courts, injunctions and fines that go with it, to escalate with extraordinary rapidity small manageable industrial disputes into large and unmanageable industrial disputes is being increasingly recognised by everyone in the system who is concerned with maintaining industrial harmony, within the parameters that that is ever possible, rather than sharing the Prime Minister's obsession with political points scoring and provocation at all costs. Every leading spokesman and participant in the industrial arena who has some responsibility for actually solving industrial disputes rather than creating them or making public or political capital out of them has shared either publicly or privately this particular view. It is certainly the view of Bob Hawke, the  President  of the Australian Council of Trade Unions; it has been put on the record on innumerable occasions. It also is the view of George Polites. It also is the view of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Moore. It also is the view of every commissioner of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission who has been forced into the position of having to untangle the industrial nightmares which are created when section 4SD writs are issued. I do not think that it is telling any tales out of school if I say, as is indeed universally known, that it is the view of the Minister in charge of this particular area, Tony Street, who has, for all his other deficiencies, slightly more of a realistic feel for his industrial responsibilities than his political master would ever allow him to express publicly. </para>
          <para>As everyone who has any experience or even a skerrick of experience in the industrial arena knows, industrial disputes can be finally solved only in an atmosphere of what has nicely been described as 'jaw not war', in an attitude where it is consultation rather than confrontation which is the order of the day. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> said earlier, this was acknowledged in an extraordinarily lucid and sensible passage in what the present Prime Minister had to say in 1975 on industrial relations. Let me remind the Senate of what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Malcolm</inline> Fraser had to say in August 1975. He said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Our view is that satisfactory industrial relations depend ultimately on the attitudes of mind of people in industry. Attitudes of mutual respect, of willingness to listen, to understand, to reason and to discuss in an informed way are essential. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The pity of it is that like so many other of the Prime Minister's pronouncements that have any kind of credible ring about them, this pronouncement has been more honoured in the breach than in the observance. If the Prime Minister and the senators who follow him so sheep-like really believed what he said in 1975, the Government would withdraw this latest lunatic piece of industrial provocation and consign this Bill to the dustbin where it belongs. </para>

            <para>- The Opposition is opposed to the use of the Trade Practices Act in trying to settle industrial disputes. Is the Government trying to settle industrial disputes? What is the reason for extending the provisions of section <inline font-style="italic">45 J? of</inline> the Act? I think it is very important to think about that. In my opinion, this Government has got itself into an unsavoury mess in its legislation. The electorate is opposed to this Government, as can be seen from the results of the recent by-elections. I believe that the Government intends to create trouble in the trade union movement to take the pressure off itself. That is the reason for this change in the legislation. The provisions of section  45D  have been extended primarily to stop industrial action by meat workers of the kind seen recently. There was some doubt whether old section 4SD was sufficient to enable the Government to act against industrial boycotts. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I have been employed on the waterfront and I have had a great deal to do with the shipping of livestock from this country, especially from Port Adelaide. It is true that many unions are engaged in that export trade. They cover waterside workers, transport workers and railway workers. Members of the Australian Workers Union are also involved in that trade, which contributes a considerable amount of work to that port. Meat workers have been given guarantees and assurances that a certain proportion of the meat to be export would be killed at Australian abattoirs. Those promises and assurances have been broken. Any union has the right to defend its workers. I believe that the right to work is very important. It is the duty of a government to ensure that people have the right to work. All that these workers are doing is trying to establish that right. In the present circumstances, this Government should not introduce further legislation to bash unionists. Why should it not be trying to bring about better relations between management and labour. It knows full well that the new Act will not do that. This Bill is a deliberate attempt to create trouble. </para>
          <para>I also bring to the attention of honourable senators what actually will happen when a farmer tries to take action under this new legislation. These people have no experience whatsoever in arbitration or conciliation. I doubt very much whether people who are engaged in farming and who have had no experience in industrial relations can achieve a peaceful settlement in a dispute. There can be no hope of a reasonable settlement with unreasonable people who have not been trained in the field of arbitration and conciliation. Members of a union can be fined very heavily under the proposed new Act- up to a quarter of a million dollars- irrespective whether there is dissention between unions. Some unions say that the farmers have the right to export live sheep. However the meat workers want a share of the slaughtering work. Some dissatisfaction exists among unions. If and when this Government implements the provisions of this legislation and fines a union, most certainly the whole trade union movement will protect that union. Why should that not be the case? Without the protection provided by the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the unions combining forces, this Government would pick off one union at a time. I stress that if one union is touched, the whole of the trade union movement will do battle with this Government. However, there is no need for this. </para>
          <para>There is a better way. This Government is not following it. It should be fostering better industrial relations. There should be better understanding between the unions. I know this only too well. I was a member of the Waterside Workers Federation. It was the most turbulent of all unions in this country. The conditions that prevailed on the waterfront were deplorable. In my lifetime I have seen men die because of a lack of decent medical attention, which was impossible to get. We had to fight for everything we won. The bitterness that came out of that era was deplorable. Since 1967 the unions and management have worked together, which goes to show that it is possible. The great struggles, the bitterness and the hatred that existed have now disappeared. If a union such as the Waterside Workers Federation can work with management for the benefit of all people in the industry, it goes without saying that other industries should be looking at what has been done. Good relations between management and labour exist on the waterfront today. We trust each other. Agreements are made and kept and we have respect for each other. The provisions of section  45D  should not be extended. Lawyers have written more laws into the statute books of this country to knock unions than is the case in any other country. </para>

              <para>-I understand the problems of the farmers also. Many of the workers in this industry understand their problems. There is no animosity between the farmers and the waterside workers. I believe that a good deal could be achieved if they could get together and talk about some of the problems that exist in the industry. The ability to export sheep from this country has meant a good deal to the farmers because they have been able to get rid of their old wethers. In the main these are the sheep that are shipped out. The food that is produced in South Australia is a big export earner too. </para>

          <para>During the last confrontation between the farmers and the unions I believe that members of this Parliament on the Government side deliberately inflamed the farmers to the extent that the farmers carried guns and pick axes. The unionists then retaliated. I know this only too well because I had a look at what was going on. Had that trouble lasted one more day there would have been bloodshed, and I think that would have been a deplorable situation. There is no need for such activity. As I have said, the only way to solve disputes is by sitting down and having some meaningful talks. This Government should be condemned for introducing these amendments. The legislation will be passed but whether its provisions are implemented is another question. If they are implemented I think it will be a very bad day for this country. </para>

            <para>- The Senate is discussing two amending Bills to the Trade Practices Act but I would like to address my remarks to the Trade Practices Amendment Bill (No. 2) which is concerned chiefly with amending section 45D of the Trade Practices Act. The issues concerning section 45d of the Act have been canvassed very deeply over a period of months in the Senate as they were in the debate when the original amendment was brought forward. Therefore, I do not intend to go into that area at this stage other than to acknowledge that the amendment which was made to the Act in June of last year was a very proper one. In fact, the institution in the Trade Practices Act of an even-handed approach to the question of businessmen as well as unionists who both have equal opportunities to boycott the businesses of other businessmen seems to me to be an entirely proper approach. In fact, at the time I commended the Government for taking the step that it did. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The weaknesses that have revealed themselves in the implementation of the, law have been referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elstob.</inline> I believe that this amending legislation, which covers the export of goods and goods being traded between the States and territories, is a further extension of the principle of ensuring that there is absolute clarity in the implementation of the law. Hopefully it will circumvent the sorts of problems that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elstob</inline> experienced in South Australia because of the legal vacuum that existed in the dispute over the export of live sheep to which he referred. </para>
          <para>The questions raised in this debate by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elstob</inline> referred to the success of discussions between unionists and employers. I believe that to be a proper development. I believe that all disputes can be properly settled by an acrossthetable approach. No one believes that the passing of a law such as this or its implementation will solve all the problems of a particular industry. We should look upon this legislation as establishing a framework of rules within which people should work. If it is even-handed in its approach then I believe that this is an entirely proper way of going about business. Without legislation such as this we would have one section of the community treated under the law differently from other sections. I believe that this legislation will ensure equity and justice for all. </para>
          <para>I notice in the annual report of the Trade Practices Commission that there has been a great degree of success. Paragraph 3.33 of the report reads'. </para>
          <para>The Commission has not so far instituted any court proceedings under section 4SD. There has, however, been a degree of success from the arrangements made with the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the National Employers Industrial Council that will consider whether they can secure the lifting of a boycott or threatened- boycott before the Commission considers court proceedings. </para>
          <para class="block">Clearly that indicates that the Commission is interested in going through normal procedures of discussion in trying to find solutions to the problems of industry and solutions to disputes before taking any action. In fact, the annual report of the Commission goes further to point out that no proceedings have been entered into at all by the Commission in its short life. </para>

              <para>-Yes. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> points out- I was just going to mention this- there is provision for others such as businessmen, or the Government if the national interest is involved to take part in actions against the unions under this legislation. Indeed, the Trade Practices Commission has been very careful to ensure that it did not become looked upon as some sort of heavy in trying to force issues on trade unions, and I commend that approach. The sorts of fears that were running around last year that the legislation could have been of an oppressive nature and result in the Commission becoming such a body, have not eventuated. I agree entirely with the approach that the Commission is adopting. As I said, the legal framework is there for. people who feel that their rights are being affected by the activities of others in secondary boycott situations. This is provided for under this legislation. I support the amending legislation which extends the provisions to cover trade in other areas. </para>

            <para>- First, I wish to place on record my objection to legislation of this nature being brought into the Senate on the last day of the session. It is not the first time that this has occurred. When the substantial amendments were made to the Trade Practices Act in 1977 they were made on 2 June 1977, the last day of the autumn session. It can be seen from the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report that debate in the Committee stage on that amending legislation was truncated. The Bill was declared an urgent Bill, and there was no debate. As far as I can see from a quick reading of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> and from my recollection there was no opportunity for amendments to be moved to the Government's Bill at that time. I certainly was concerned about that legislation. I believed that there would be unpredictable consequences flowing from the Government's amendments to the Trade Practices Act as introduced in 1977 insofar as they pertained to the new section 45D. What those amendments did was incorporate into an Act which essentially ensures free competition, a provision which is designed to interfere with the industrial relations processes that are the preserve of other Acts of this Parliament, principally the Commonwealth Conciliation and </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Arbitration Act. Having said that, history has proven that since 1977 there have been unpredictable consequences. </para>
          <para>It was said at the time that there would not be an intention on the pan of the Government to act without consultation. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Messner</inline> has just said, the Trade Practices Commission itself in its report has adverted to the need to ensure that matters of industrial relations receive consideration elsewhere before the Commission takes action. I will read from what the Trade Practices Commission said in its fourth annual report, which was for the year ended 30 June 1978. On page 1 1 of the report, the Trade Practices Commission had this to say: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Commission has not so far instituted any court proceedings under section  45d.  There has, however, been a degree of success from arrangements made with the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the National Employers Industrial Council that they will consider whether they can secure the lifting of a boycott or threatened boycott before the Commission considers court proceedings. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That is all very well so far as the Commission is concerned. What is complained of and what is causing grave concern to both the employers nationally and the trade union movement nationally, and to each of those organisations in each of the States, is the maverick-type action that is being taken by individual employers, utilising the provisions of section 45D to obtain for themselves an unfair advantage. That, of course, is quite contrary to the spirit of the Trade Practices Act as a whole. </para>
          <para>The principles behind the Trade Practices Act are generally unexceptionable; they are accepted by all parties throughout Australia generally, except those firms that wish to have monopoly control of certain commodities. By and large, the principle that there should be fair trading and fair competition and that situations in which there is unfair competition or unfair advantage should not arise is generally accepted. The fact remains that because of its provisions section 45D is being used by certain firms to achieve an unfair advantage. Let me give an example of that. It is not for me to deal with certain cases that are currently before the courts. I do not know whether it is desirable for me to address myself to that matter. Let me give a hypothetical example so that people will be able to understand what I am talking about: Firm A is employing union labour, is honouring its awards both in spirit and in the letter, is enabling the union to go into the plant, is ensuring that safety, health and welfare provisions and procedures are followed and is able to ensure that there is proper consultation between the management and the employees so that the employees are not unfairly disadvantaged. Firm B is a shop that is non-unionised, cheats on the employees, does not permit the union organisers to come in and address the employees or do some problem solving, and has conditions which are quite unsafe and quite untenable. They are tenable only in this time of unemployment because the people concerned are too frightened for their jobs to do anything about it. </para>
          <para>Those two firms are in a position where one firm has an unfair competitive advantage over the other. Firm B, by virtue of its anti-union stance, has an unfair competitive advantage over Firm A. What does the union attempt to do in that circumstance? It attempts- and is entitled to do so, in my view- in Firm C not to accept the goods from Firm B. That, of course, is a classic secondary boycott under the provisions of section 45D. Of course, because the employees of Firm C are not employed by Firm B the exemption provisions so far as wages and working conditions are concerned just do not apply. So, Firm B is using the provisions of the Trade Practices Act to obtain an unfair advantage. I believe that the Government did not foresee that that would take place. I believe that that was an unpredictable circumstance. I believe that it is important for the Government to recognise that the Act is being used in that way. I ask the Government to have consultations with the national employers and the trade union movement in order to ensure that the Act is not used in that way. </para>
          <para>Admittedly, most of the actions that have been taken, as has been said before in the debate, have been taken by mavericks; but I know of one instance in which a small employer is taking the action and employing solicitors who are briefing Q.Cs, and that employer is being backed up by a very large company. That action is now taking place. I am not going to say who it is at the present moment. I will do so after the case is concluded. I will do it publicly, outside this place. I do not think it is proper, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elstob</inline> said, when a whole lot of academics intrude their airyfairy ideas into the field of industrial relations. The net result of this type of action, taken under this piece of legislation, is that the only ones to win out, of course, are members of the legal fraternity. It does nothing for the advancement of industrial relations in this country. </para>
          <para>I go further and say- if the message was not clear from what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elstob</inline> said, I will say it quite clearly- that the abuse of the Trade Practices Act for that purpose is going to throw the nation into confrontation. It is going to throw those within the unions who do not believe in confrontation against government, but who believe that the union is there to get the best deal possible for its members with the least cost to them and the community, into the fold of those extremists within the trade union movement who believe that the trade union movement can be use as a political battering ram. The Government has to realise that that will be the case. I would like to quote from an article written by Peter Westmore in the <inline font-style="italic">Quadrant</inline> of May 1977 just before the amendments to the Trade Practices Act which included the insertion of new section 45d. The article reads: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Neither governments, nor industrial tribunals, have yet found an effective way of legislating against political strikes, without facing the prospect of massive resistance from the trade union movement. Legislation such as the amendments to the Trade Practices Act and the Arbitration Act, now before Federal Parliament, have aroused opposition across the whole trade union spectrum, because they restrict legitimate trade union activity, as well as abusers of union 's power. The only restraint on the misuse of power by an individual union is the possibility of isolation from the rest of the trade union movement, and the possibility of government action (e.g. deregistration) against the union. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I agree with those remarks. My worry is that if the Government goes ahead with this addition to section 4Sd it will be faced with unpredictable consequences. Who knows, as a result of this amendment we may witness the bloodshed which was referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elstob</inline> as being just around the corner. What is required is a sensitive, intelligent and co-ordinated approach to this problem amongst people of goodwill and people who desire to see the system of industrial relations work in this country. It has already been said by the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the national employers that the Trade Practices Act is not, and should not be, the vehicle for the settlement of industrial disputes. There needs to be a co-ordinated approach to this matter between all those people who desire to see the industrial relations system work and those who desire to isolate the minority groups within the employers organisations and the trade union movement which are out for confrontation. </para>
          <para>I remind the Government that ultimately the success of the system depends on the respect that the participants in the system have for the federal court. The federal court has the overview of the provisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act which imposes certain requirements on registered employer and employee organisations. It is to the federal court that the rank and file unionist has ultimate recourse to ensure that the rules of an organisation are not unreasonable, oppressive and unjust. It is to the federal court that the union itself ultimately has recourse to ensure the protection of its eligibility rule, its constitution rule. </para>
          <para>If the federal court is demeaned in the eyes of the participants to the conciliation and arbitration system, as it could be by the statements of a senior judge of that court such as we heard this week, the <inline font-style="italic">Government</inline> and those within the industrial relations system who want to see it work are really in trouble. It is that court which ultimately will have to determine whether or not a union should retain its registration. I believe that the statements which came from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Smithers could have been said only because the Government has put laws on the statute books which are untenable. I leave the Government with the thought that ultimately if respect for the federal court is demeaned in the eyes of the participants of the industrial relations system, the action that it may legitimately have to take to deregister a union which has persistently confronted the Government and the rest of the trade union movement in the community will also be demeaned, and that will be a tragic day for Australia. </para>

            <para>- I support the two Bills dealing with amendments to the Trade Practices Act which have been introduced by the Government. I listened with interest to the wide-ranging discussion this afternoon. It ranged from a sensible discussion of principle to a discussion and exposition of the finer points of the law. When we are debating these aspects we are always concerned with an area that is up to challenge. I do not believe this legislation is sinister. I do not believe that it is legislation that leads to significant concern in the community and to talk of confrontation and bloodshed. I believe, quite on the contrary, that this legislation is in some real measure due to the recommendations of organisations such as the Swanson Committee, a Senate select committee and the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs. I; is well based on unbiased recommendations. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The legislation is the result of a continuing and proper process of examination and adjustment of a specific law which dates back to the Whitlam era of 1974. The amendments represent proper adjustment and development according to circumstances as they change in the life and operation of any community. I think that this community is prone to believe that an undertaking or a circumstance that applies in a specific year must apply forever; if it does not somebody has broken a promise or let somebody down. </para>
          <para>Only several years ago the Opposition suggested for instance- I say this in the context of genuine discussion- that uranium in this country should be mined and exported. Today the Opposition contends that that is not its view. I would be the first to agree that the Opposition has a right to change its view in that sort of circumstance. Similarly I believe that most, if not all, of the laws under which we live are of a nature that we, if truly free and democratic people, have a duty and obligation to change, mould and fit to the changing circumstances of the society and the economy. </para>
          <para>What the Government has done in the amendments to the Trade Practices Act is, I believe, a responsible exhibition of that sort of changing and moulding. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button,</inline> with almost the first words he used earlier today, said that much of the legislation has not been used. I believe he made that statement in the form of criticism. I think it is wrong to criticise the legislation on that basis. If it is not necessary to use the legislation, one would assume that commonsense is occurring in the first place. The fact that the legislation is not being used does not necessarily mean that it is bad legislation. I believe that there would be no need to use the legislation if, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elstob</inline> said, there is better understanding, there are long term contracts and there is responsibility. If we are now moving towards that state of affairs, against the background of the legislation that we have and that we change from time to time, we are on the right track. </para>
          <para>The Trade Practices Amendment Bill applies itself to three main matters. It extends the present exception from the prohibition in section 45a of price fixing for joint ventures relating to services to correspond to those relating to goods. That is a reasonable and proper exercise. The Bill also extends the specific prohibition of false or misleading advertisements from being applicable only to agencies to being applicable to individual employers. I believe that is a proper circumstance. Finally, it deals with manufacturers warranties. It is proposed that the same responsibilities will apply to manufacturers as already apply to retailers and importers. That, too, is a proper responsibility. </para>
          <para>As to the Trade Practices Amendment Bill (No. 2), the Government takes the view that in simple and round terms the national interest must surely be dominant at all times in considering relationships between capital and labour and employer and employee and relationships in the community in which we live. This country is a great trading nation. We have sufficient problems in respect of the vagaries of climate and the vagaries of international markets not to confront ourselves in any way with unnecessary industrial unrest. I hope that the amendment to section 45d will serve purely and simply to contain problems in the industrial field so that reason and commonsense will be given a fair and proper opportunity to survive and so that this country can progress to the point to which it should progress. </para>

            <para>-In reply- The Senate has before it this afternoon two Bills which seek to amend the Trade Practices Act. The first of those Bills, that is, the Trade Practices Amendment Bill, provides, among other things, for the imposition for the first time under the Trade practices Act- indeed for the first time anywhere in Australia except South Australia- that the manufacturer of goods has to observe as a matter of law certain standards which have been familiar in the area of the sale of goods but mostly as a liability on the seller or retailer of goods, namely, that the goods he has manufactured and put into circulation should be fit for the purpose and be of merchantable quality. This is known as a manufacturers warranty. As I say, the purpose of that Bill is to create that liability for the first time on a national level under the Trade Practices Act. That is a very important and very valuable step forward in the field of consumer protection. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>It is rather surprising that very little has been said in this debate about that major move forward, that very positive step forward, which is being made here by the Government. I am grateful that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> devoted most if not all of his speech to this subject. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Scott</inline> also emphasised the importance of that amendment. Although little has been said about this Bill, it appears that the Senate is in fact supporting that amendment. Most of the debate today has been centred upon the proposed amendment to the Trade Practices Act that is contained in the Trade Practices Amendment Bill (No. 2).It provides for what I would have expected the Senate to agree is a most beneficial amendment to the Act, namely, the provision to stop, to prohibit, two or more persons from conspiring together to prevent or to hinder substantially any other person from engaging in interstate or overseas trade. I will be speaking about some of the defences that are available. I know that the provision in absolute terms can be very wide. The object of the provision is to prevent people from getting together and boycotting some of the really fundamental aspects of our economy, such as overseas trade and the export of goods from this country. </para>
          <para>Australia is one of the major trading nations of the world. We live by our trade. It seems to the Government necessary that we should have in our laws a very clear prohibition of conduct the purpose of which is to prevent or substantially hinder not only overseas trade but also interstate trade. We have had provisions in the Trade Practices Act which deal with secondary boycotts, as they are known, they are of a more specialised and limited character. We now have a provision which is of wider character and which does not have some of the artificial limitations and difficulties of a technical and legal kind which hitherto applied in respect of section 4SD of the Trade Practices Act. </para>
          <para>The principal purpose of this amendment is to ensure that people will not act together for the purpose of preventing other people engaging in such activities which are vital to our economy. This measure has been opposed, and opposed vigorously, by the Labor Opposition, although I am glad to find support for it from Government senators. The reason for the opposition seems to be centred upon the concern that this provision will interfere with the legitimate activities of trade unions, that it is aimed at union bashing by the Government and that it will prevent members of unions from engaging in activities to protect their interests. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button,</inline> who led for the Opposition, said that this is a typical example of the Government's attitude to industrial relations, that the Government believes it can solve strikes itself by directly legislating and so on. Of course, the Government completely rejects that interpretation of this legislation, certainly that interpretation of its motives and policies. Indeed, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> seemed to go so far as to suggest that all the Government needs to do is to leave the question of industrial relations to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke.</inline> I made the comment that here on the last day of the sitting we had to have the Labor Party showing its obeisance to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke.</inline> It was a rather strange contribution to be making at this stage on this question. We do not deny the importance of the trade union movement and of its leaders. As a government, we encourage the participation of union leaders and acknowledge their vital role in settling industrial disputes, but equally we as a government have a responsibility to ensure that there is proper machinery, and proper laws on the statute books, whereby these industrial disputes can be resolved. As a Government, we support strongly the conciliation and arbitration process in settling disputes, but we also have an obligation to have on the statute books laws adequate to protect the rights of individuals and of the community against what in many cases are the thoroughly indefensible actions of irresponsible unions and union leaders. </para>
          <para>This legislation provides certain defences. If proceedings are brought alleging conduct which is designed to prohibit trade, in contravention of this section, there nevertheless is a very important provision of the Trade Practices Act which deals with it. I shall read the section because there has been a good deal of discussion about it. It provides that a person shall not be taken to contravene this section where the dominant purpose of his conduct is substantially related to the remuneration, conditions of employment, hours of work or working conditions of that person, or another person employed by his employer, or that employer of that person has terminated his employment or that of another fellow employee. Those provisions of the Trade Practices Act are available as defences under the provision that we seek to assert, and preserve the rights of trade unions and trade unionists. Indeed, it is not true to say, as did one honourable senator, that trade unionists can be fined individually under this Act. Fines can be imposed on organisations or corporations only. </para>
          <para>I was interested in a number of the points that were "made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Evans,</inline> who said that legitimate union activities would not be covered by the provisions that I have read; that the people who engaged in them would be in breach of the new section provided for in the Bill. It was very interesting to go through the honourable senator's list of what he called legitimate union activities which would not serve as a defence for unionists. I would not agree that he was right in saying that in respect of all of them. I do not want to go into what would be a fairly arid, technical, legal debate about defences; but some of the activities which he said would not provide defences and would be prohibited by this new section were of interest. For instance, he mentioned sympathy strikes, demarcation disputes and concerted action to impose a closed shop and thereby effect compulsory union membership. I thought the piece de resistance was his assertion that the Bill would outlaw political strikes. </para>
          <para>The Government time and time again has made it very clear that it opposes- as I am sure do the vast majority of the people- actions by powerful unions for political purposes, for demarcation disputes, and to enforce compulsory unionism. I make no apology for the fact that those activities are not protected by the defences under this Act. Those engaged in those activities which have the effect of preventing or substantially hindering people from engaging in interstate and overseas trade cannot expect to have defences provided for them under this or any other legislation. </para>
          <para>That is the purpose of this amendment. It is a very important one and will have significant long term benefits in protecting the legitimate interests of the community- not only business people engaged in trade but also the community as a whole- which are otherwise held to ransom and ignored, and in many cases seriously affected by the sort of conduct that this legislation is designed to outlaw. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline>made a useful contribution to the debate. He did not identify himself with this broad onslaught on the provisions of the legislation in which the Opposition seemed to indulge. He raised points that I thought were of interest. He said that section 45D, of which this Bill is an amendment, had been used by some people in unexpected ways. He indicated that taking place in court were some proceedings which he did not identify but which may be the subject of revelation by him at a later stage. The Government would be most interested to have details of unexpected consequences of section 4SD, if there are any, and I assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> that it would certainly consider them. It does not want unintended consequences to its legislation. </para>
          <para>I am pleased that the Senate is supporting the amendments that will provide manufacturers' warranties. Despite the opposition that has been voiced, I trust that the Senate will also support the very important amendment that is designed to prohibit conspiracies which will prevent or hinder our overseas and interstate trade. </para>

          </para>
          <para>Honourable senators will recall the substantial changes made to the administrative structure of broadcasting in the amendments of 1977 to the Broadcasting and Television Act 1942. The amendments effected those recommendations of the report of the inquiry into the Australian broadcasting system- the Green report- decided upon by the Government. One of the principal changes was the transfer of power to grant and renew licences for broadcasting and television stations from the Minister to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. In addition, the new legislation specified for the first time, periods of time for the lodgment of applications for licence grants and renewals and subsequent documents relating to licence grants and renewals. As a result of the calling of applications for the grant of the first series of public broadcasting licences, it became evident that greater flexibility of procedural arrangements for the lodging of licence grant applications, and other related documents, with the Tribunal, would be desirable. Obviously, the same flexibility should apply in the procedures for the renewal of licences. </para>
          <para>This Bill seeks to provide that flexibility. Specifically, the Bill seeks to amend section 82 of the Broadcasting and Television Act 1942 to allow the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, where it is satisfied circumstances warrant it, to grant time extensions for the lodging of applications for, and submissions and replies in relation to, the grant of a licence. It is expected that in exercising this discretion, the Tribunal will ensure that there is substantial compliance with the Act. In addition, this Bill seeks to validate those applications and associated documents, lodged in pursuance of invitations for the grant of public broadcasting licences published in issues of the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> of 24 April, 15 May and 13 June 1978, and those public broadcasting licences, granted to persons applying for the grant of the licences not later than 5 July 1978, where the requirements of sections 82, 83 and 84 of the Broadcasting and Television Act were not observed. It is also proposed through this Bill to amend section 86 of the Broadcasting and Television Act 1942 to direct applications for the renewal of licences to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, rather than to the Minister, as is now the case. A similar amendment is incorporated to make consequential changes to section 33 of the Broadcasting and Television Amendment Act 1977 which contains the transitional provisions for licence renewals. </para>
          <para>At the time of the major amendments to the licensing provisions of the Broadcasting and Television Act during last year, it was felt that the Minister should continue to receive licence renewal applications as he had in the past. It was felt that this procedure would enable the Minister to make an input into the renewal process from the viewpoint of his planning responsibilities. However, it has now become clear that it is more desirable that applications for renewal be lodged with the Tribunal. The Minister will be able under section 106B of the Broadcasting and Television Act 1 942 to seek information from the Tribunal concerning renewal applications where necessary for planning purposes. The Tribunal will also have the power to grant extensions of time to applicants and other interested persons making applications or submissions concerning licence renewals. Further, it is felt that licensees should have an avenue of appeal where the Tribunal refuses to grant extensions of time for the lodging of licence renewal applications, or of licensees ' replies to submissions made in relation to renewals. An amendment is therefore proposed to section 1 19A of the principal Act to provide that licensees in this position may apply to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for a review of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal's decision. A consequential amendment to the </para>
          <para>Broadcasting and Television Amendment Act 1977 is also proposed in this regard. </para>
          <para>These amendments will provide consistency between licence grant and renewal procedures, and will add to the 'de-politicising' of the administrative structure of broadcasting in Australia as effected in the major amendments to the Broadcasting and Television <inline font-style="italic">Act</inline> in 1977. 1 commend this Bill to the Senate. </para>

          </para>
          <para>This Bill, to amend the Industrial Research and Development Incentives Act 1976, was foreshadowed by my colleagues the Minister for Industry and Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> and the Minister for Productivity <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Macphee)</inline> in a joint statement on 16 August 1978. In that statement, the Ministers announced that the $24m allocated for industrial research and development grants in the 1978-79 Budget was intended to fund a new policy for Commonwealth financial incentives provided under the Industrial Research and Development Incentives Act 1976. The purpose of the proposed Bill is to introduce a number of changes to the existing grant schemes to enable the full implementation of important elements of the new policy for the 1978-79 and later grant years. A number of administrative actions have already been taken under the existing terms of the Act to give effect to other aspects of the new policy. </para>
          <para>A strong private sector research and development capability is of vital importance for Australian industry to develop the new and improved products and processes necessary to better meet competition from imports and to create new growth opportunities based on exports. For this reason, Commonwealth financial incentives for industrial research and development have been provided to Australian manufacturing and mining companies since 1967 through the medium of various types of grants made available under legislation. The current Act, introduced in 1976, provides for the payment of two types of grants and there is also provision under section 39 for the undertaking of projects of industrial research considered to be in the public interest. However, there is strong evidence of a substantial rundown in corporate research and development activity over the past three years, and this rundown has been a matter of serious concern to the Government. The extent of the Government's concern is indicated by the decision, despite a difficult budgetary situation, to provide $24m to fund the new policy- an increase of over 70 per cent on the $ 14m allocated in the previous financial year. </para>
          <para>The immediate objectives of the new policy are to prevent further wastage of Australian research and development resources and to contribute advances in productivity, innovation and sound industry development. It is intended that these objectives will be achieved by a balanced and cost-effective strengthening of the existing grant schemes, together with a simplification of the procedures required of companies in making application for grants to allow for reduced administrative effort both on the part of the companies and the administering authority- the Australian Industrial Research and Development Incentives Board. </para>
          <para>I will now relate the provisions of the Bill to the three main elements of the new policy. Firstly, the Bill makes provision for an increase in the level of the Project Grants provided under Division 2 of Part III of the Act from the existing 25 per cent of company expenditure, subject to an overall annual limit on grant payments to any company' of $250,000, to 50 per cent, subject to a new annual limit of $500,000. The new grant levels will allow the Board greater scope to encourage company research and development projects assessed to have high technical and commercial merit. The existing levels have been found to be insufficient for this purpose and extensive discussions with industry have indicated that support up to the new levels would be required for many potentially important projects to be undertaken. </para>
          <para>In this respect, the Minister for Productivity also intends to give careful consideration to recommendations from the Board concerning his authority under the Act to approve a higher annual limit on project grant payments to a company, or a group of related companies, than the proposed new limit of $500,000. Companies considering undertaking research and development projects which may place them above the new limit should approach the Board in relation to their proposed research and development program for 1978-79. The Board could then assess the technical and commercial merits of the program with a view to making an appropriate recommendation. </para>
          <para>Other provisions of the Bill designed to improve the effectiveness of the project grant scheme include the introduction of eligibility of project expenditure from the date of a company's application, and changes which would allow the Board to enter into a single project grant agreement with a company which is acting on behalf of a number of companies engaged in a collaborative research and development project. Eligibility of project expenditure from the date of application will allow the Board and the company more time to negotiate an acceptable agreement, and a single agreement for collaborative research and development projects will act to encourage technological co-operation between firms. Such co-operation, in many cases, provides a means of making the most effective use of limited Australian research and development resources- </para>
          <para>The project grant scheme is intended to provide the main avenue for Commonwealth encouragement of company research and development, and I would take this opportunity to clarify several points which have been the subject of some widespread misunderstanding. In this respect, one of the features of the new policy which is worthy of further emphasis is the reduced administrative effort that will be required of companies in making applications for grants. New procedures are to be introduced to overcome the delays in finalising agreements and in settling grant payments which have to date inhibited company participation. </para>
          <para>Other aspects of the scheme which require clarification relate to supposed mandatory requirements for the payment of royalties to the Commonwealth, and for the acquisition of the rights to grant-assisted research and development when a company decides to terminate a project. The Act does not contain any provisions in respect of royalty payments or for the acquisition of the results of grant-assisted research and development. The Government regrets the concern amongst industry in both these respects, and the Minister for Productivity has recently issued a direction to the Board which should ensure that no further confusion arises over these matters. </para>
          <para>Concern has also been expressed by companies in relation to the eligibility of projects directed towards improved process technology. The Government regards the development of improved industrial processes as essential to realising major advances in industry productivity and such developments will be accorded a high priority. The project grant scheme has always been intended to provide support for advances in process technology as well as for the development of new and improved products. </para>
          <para>The new policy provides for a strengthening of the commencement grants made available under Division I of Part III of the Act. The commencement grant scheme is intended to encourage small and medium-sized companies to gain an appreciation of the benefits of research and development. Regulations have already been made for the 1978-79 grant year, increasing the level of the grant from the previous 25 per cent of 'eligible' company expenditure- up to an annual limit of $15,000- to 50 per cent- up to a new annual limit of $25,000. In conjunction with the increased grant level it is proposed to introduce the progressive settlement of the commencement grants which have previously been paid retrospectively, usually in the subsequent financial year. This particular change has been made in recognition of the current importance of company cash flows and should make a significant contribution towards improving the effectiveness of the grants as an incentive to companies to commence an involvement in research and development. </para>
          <para>The proposed Bill also makes provision for several other changes to the commencement grant scheme, and the most significant of these is a simplification in the eligibility criteria required of companies. Under the existing provisions of the Act a company must have had an employee engaged in 'professional or technical research and development' for a 'continuous' period of at least four weeks, whereas the Bill will allow for company eligibility on the basis of at least one employee engaged in research and development for a cumulative period of not less than four weeks, or alternatively on the basis of 'eligible contract expenditure ' in excess of $ 1 ,500. The requirement for a 'continuous' period has, in practice, caused severe administrative difficulties and has been a continuing source of concern amongst industry. </para>
          <para>Other changes provided for in the Bill in respect of commencement grants include a simplification of the definition of 'eligible contract expenditure', and a new requirement that regulations setting the amount of the commencement grant shall not be made later than 31 March in the grant year preceding the one to which they relate. The simplified definition will provide for reduced administrative effort on the part of the Board, and the new deadline of 3 1 March will allow for more certainty in company research and development planning. </para>
          <para>The new policy also provides for support to be made available to enable tthe undertaking of projects of industrial research considered to be in the public interest. Under section 39 of the Act industrial research contracts will be placed in industry to encourage the commercial development of important Australian innovations including the development of the process technologies required to increase the competitiveness of particular industry sectors. It is intended that this particular element of the new policy will be developed progressively. However, the Bill does allow for a clarification of the role of the Australian Industrial Research and Development Incentives Advisory Committee in providing the Minister for Productivity with advice on all aspects of the operation of the Act. In particular, it is the Minister's intention that an appropriately constituted Advisory Committee should provide advice in relation to the use of section 39. An initial task which the Minister will set the Committee is the formulation of a set of guidelines on what constitutes a 'public interest' project. </para>
          <para>The opportunity provided by the present Bill has also been used to introduce a number of minor clarifications to particular aspects of the Act. The clarifications, which relate to the definition of 'eligible plant expenditure', the meaning of the term 'payable' and the Minister's right to give notices under Section 31 to an acting chairman, are all consistent with the way in which the Act has been interpreted since it came into operation. </para>
          <para>Finally, it is my view that the new policy for Commonwealth industrial research and development incentives, provided for in part by the BUI, represents a positive expression of the Government's confidence in the ability of Australian industry to develop the new improved products and processes required to resist competition from imports and to create new growth opportunities based on exports. The Government now looks to private enterprise for strong co-operation in stimulating major new research and development activity to secure the technological advancement of Australian industry- an advancement based on the proven innovative skills of Australian scientists and technologists. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </para>

            <para>- We are debating the Queensland Grants (Special Assistance) Bill 1978. 1 pointed out last year when we were debating a similar Bill that as a Queensland public servant I assisted in the preparation of cases that were put before the Grants Commission. These cases were considered by the Commission when it was deciding what, if any, financial assistance should be made available to the State of Queensland. On one occasion, I appeared as a witness before the Commission. Because of my association with the Commission as a Queensland State public servant both in the preparation of cases to go before the Commission and as a witness before the Commission, I have taken a special interest in the Commission's activities. As the 45th report of the Commonwealth Grants Commission has specifically referred to Queensland, the State that I represent, I have even more interest. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The main purpose of the Queensland Grant (Special Assistance) Bill 1978, now being debated by the Senate, is to authorise payments to Queensland of $2 1 .7m in special grants. These grants are in accordance with the recommendations set out in the 45th report of the Commonwealth Grants Commission. I have already made passing reference to that report. At this stage I mention that the Grants Commission was appointed on 17 July 1933. It made its first report on 25 July the following year, covering applications made by South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania. The fact that the Commission has been in existence since 1933 makes the record of the Parliament's acceptance of its recommendations remarkable. It is well to recall some words of the Minister for Education <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick)</inline> in his second reading speech. He said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Commission's recommendations in relation to the special grants arrangements have been adopted by the Parliament each year since the Commission's inception and the Government considers that they should be accepted on this occasion. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The fact that the grants have been adopted each year by the Parliament is a remarkable achievement and one which we should continue to follow unless exceptional circumstances occur. As a senator for Queensland, I certainly support the payment of this grant, but if I were a senator from any other State or, if this grant were for another State, I would still support it because of the way in which the grants are determined. Perhaps on some occasions we have reservations about the payment of a sum of this magnitude. Indeed, at a later stage, I shall mention some of the reservations that I have. But we must remember the basis on which the Commission makes its recommendations. Once we do that, and study the Commission's current report, we realise that the recommendations should be accepted. </para>
          <para>The existence of the Commonwealth Grants Commission acknowledges the fact that some States suffer financial disabilities by comparison with New South Wales and Victoria, often referred to in this context as the two standard States. In other words, it acknowledges the fact that within our Federal system, there is financial inequality among the States. The general principle of the Commonwealth Grants Commission is to investigate that financial inequality when a request is made for it to do so. It is accepted that its recommendations will strive to ensure that the people in the State investigated will enjoy similar services to those provided to their fellow Australians in the standard States of New South Wales and Victoria. </para>
          <para>One of the great strengths of our Federation is that we can minimise the inequalities among the States using, amongst other measures, the Commonwealth Grants Commission. On the other hand, it is difficult for the Commonwealth to minimise inequalities within States. It is easy to understand why Queensland is at a disadvantage in relation to the two standard States. I shall outline some of the reasons. If one examines the population of Queensland and the populations of New South Wales and Victoria, one will immediately see a disadvantage. The population of Queensland at 30 June 1978 was 2.1 million; the population of Victoria was 3.8 million; and the population of New South Wales was 5 million. One disadvantage that occurs as a consequence of the lower population in Queensland in comparison with Victoria and New South Wales is that Queensland has access to less taxation revenue. </para>
          <para>Queensland not only has a smaller population but also has a larger area. It is the second largest State in the Commonwealth. The area of Queensland is 1.7 million square kilometres, that of Victoria 0.2 million square kilometres, and New South Wales 0.8 million square kilometres. In some respects, it is easier to provide services for a smaller population, But when that population is distributed over a large area, the cost of providing those services becomes greater. Additionally, it is well to recognise that Queensland is a highly decentralised State. There are major centres of population extending from Brisbane to Cairns. To mention just a few by way of illustration, such centres are Maryborough, Bundaberg, Rockhampton, Mackay and Townsville. It is worth while noting that there are also some reasonable centres of population north of Cairns. </para>
          <para>The vast distances in Queensland are a function of the State's large area. If one travels by air from Brisbane to Cairns one travels 1,435 kilometres. This is a long distance when compared with distances in the standard States of New South Wales and Victoria. One can go from Brisbane to another major city in Queensland and travel even further than the Brisbane to Cairns distance which I have just mentioned. The distance from Brisbane to Mount Isa by air is 1,580 kilometres. Recently I travelled from Brisbane to Thursday Island, and even this does not take one close to the northern border. The air distance for this journey was 2, 185 kilometres. </para>
          <para>The fact that such vast distances are involved in moving to the major centres of population in Queensland put it at a disadvantage in providing services equivalent to those provided in the standard States. When the Commonwealth Grants Commission examines these factors it draws attention to the fact that some States must have their income supplemented because of what are termed 'revenue needs 'or 'expenditure needs'. </para>
          <para>Part of the 45th report of the Commonwealth Grants Commission refers to these two types of need. Paragraph 1.5 states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>To enable a claimant State to function at a standard not appreciably below that of other States without having to levy taxation and other charges of greater severity than in those other States, its revenue needs to be supplemented because of: </para>
            <list type="upperalpha">
              <item label="(A)">
                <para>Its lower capacity to raise taxes and other revenue; and </para>
              </item>
              <item label="(B)">
                <para>Its need to incur higher costs in order to provide comparable governmental services. </para>
              </item>
            </list>
            <para>These ate referred to as revenue needs and expenditure needs respectively. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Commonwealth Grants Commission, in determining these revenue and expenditure needs, conducts hearings at which it is able to elicit information about relevant disabilities which confront those who administer the State. Naturally, the Commission also uses statistical data available to it. In determining these needs the Grants Commission compares the claimant State with the two standard States. Queensland is now the only claimant State to the Grants Commission. On 30 September 1971 Queensland applied for a special grant for the year 1971-72 and it has been a claimant State ever since. </para>
          <para>It is relevant to mention the other nonstandard States and indicate when they ceased to be claimant States. South Australia ceased to be a claimant State on 1 July 1975. This was as a result of an agreement between the Commonwealth and South Australian governments in relation to the transfer of the non-metropolitan South Australian railway system. Tasmania made, but later withdrew, applications for special grants for 1974-75 and 1975-76. In reality, Tasmania ceased to be a claimant State in 1 974. Tasmania 's withdrawal as a claimant State was the result of other additional finances being made available to Tasmania. That State has now applied for special assistance in respect of 1977-78 and the matter has been referred to the Commission- The only other non-standard state which I have not mentioned is Western Australia. It was last a claimant State in 1 968-69. </para>
          <para>Earlier, I mentioned that the Grants Commission determines revenue needs and expenditure needs for a claimant State. What the Grants Commission assessed to be the revenue needs for Queensland for 1976-77 is shown in its 45th report. Queensland's revenue needs were grouped under three main headings- taxation, land revenue and mining revenue. Under the heading of taxation, the Grants Commission assessed the revenue need for Queensland as being $ 108,724,000. 1 refer chapter 4 of the 45th report to those honourable senators who are interested in how this figure was determined. </para>
          <para>With land revenue and mining revenue there are significant differences. The Grants Commission considered that in these two cases there was a negative need. In other words, Queensland had an above standard revenue capacity for land and mining. Its capacity to raise finance in these two areas was higher than that of the standard states of New South Wales and Victoria. For land revenue there was a negative need of $8,508,000. For mining revenue the negative need was even greater, namely $44,956,000. So from the assessed taxation revenue need these two negative needs were subtracted. The assessed revenue need for Queensland thus was a net $55,260,000. </para>
          <para>The expenditure needs for Queensland were also grouped under a number of headings. These were social services, business undertakings, debt charges and another group called other net expenditure. The assessed expenditure needs were all positive; that is, Queensland was at a disadvantage in all four cases in relation to the two standard States. </para>
          <para>The total assessed expenditure need for Queensland was $110,458,000. The revenue needs and the expenditure needs are added to determine the total needs. But that total is not the grant which is recommended by the Grants Commission. From that total has to be subtracted the amounts made available by way of other Commonwealth Government assistance. This was done in the case of Queensland to determine a total need of $23. 7m. It is on the basis of the $23.7m that this Bill is before the Parliament. An advance grant of $ 18m had been paid some time before. This meant that a total completion grant for 1976-77 of $5.7m is payable. </para>
          <para>I mentioned earlier that the total amount recommended for payment by the Grants Commission was $2 1.7m. The $16m difference between the $5.7m which I have just mentioned and the $2 1.7m consists of an advance grant for 1978-79. Before proceeding with some other general comments, I indicate that I am pleased to be able to support this recommendation of the Commonwealth Grants Commission. I am especially pleased that the recommendation is for a grant of $2 1 .7m to Queensland. </para>
          <para>Last year when the Queensland Grant (Special Assistance) Bill 1977 was being debated, there were some outrageous statements on both sides of the chamber about Queensland's right to receive funds following the Commonwealth Grants Commission's 44th report. I am convinced that those statements would not have been forthcoming if a detailed study of the Commission's report had been made. Certainly, one can criticise the administration of the Queensland Government, and before I conclude today I intend to do so. But that administration should, as I shall shortly argue, be regarded as something quite different from the grant being debated. I invite any honourable senator who this year intends to criticise the payment of this $2 1.7m to Queensland to make a detailed study of the 45th report before he or she does so. I am convinced that if any objective study of the report is made, criticism will not be forthcoming. </para>
          <para>During last year's debate to which I referred a minute or so ago, there was a suggestion that Queensland, in receiving assistance under the Commonwealth Grants Commission was not pulling its weight in the Federation. In case a similar suggestion is made today, I outline the contribution which Queensland makes to Australian export earnings. Although Queensland represents only 15.2 per cent of Australia's total population, it contributes 22.9 per cent of Australia's export earnings. I do not intend to pursue this matter in detail but to illustrate my argument I simply seek leave to incorporate in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> a table entitled 'Queensland's Overseas Exports Compared to Australian Total 1977-78' which shows in greater detail the export contribution made by Queensland. This table was prepared for me by the statistical section of the Parliamentary Library. </para>

              <para>-I thank the Senate. As I read the 45th report of the Commonwealth Grants Commission I was interested to see that Queensland was credited with an allowance of $ 1.99m for special difficulties in the provision of police services. This allowance probably attracted my attention because I once worked in the Queensland Police Department and I have some knowledge of the special difficulties which are associated with the provision of police services in Queensland. Earlier I mentioned that I had some reservations about the $2 1.7m grant. Certainly they are minor reservations, but reservations nonetheless. Those reservations were evoked because of this $ 1.99m allowance for police services. Along with other honourable senators, I have some concern that the funds provided to the Queensland Government from this Government are used responsibly. I am absolutely certain, however, that the Queensland Government is being totally irresponsible in its spending of funds in relation to the Queensland Police Department. As we all know, the Premier of Queensland has continued to use battalions of police to control- 'harass' may be a more apt word- protesters who believe that they have the right to march when voicing their protest. Recently he admitted that his use of the police to confront protesters had probably cost about $lm. This raises in my mind the question whether we should be providing funds when they are squandered in this way. In some respects, however, this may not be a question to which we have to pay great attention. I am certain that if the Premier of Queensland continues to act in this way the electors of Queensland will provide him with such a rebuff that he will no longer be Premier. When that occurs the assistance provided under the Grants Commission will have the opportunity to be spent much more wisely. It is with pleasure that I announce that I support the Bill. </para>

            <para>- The purpose of the Bill before us, which the Opposition is not opposing, is to change the  basis of protection for assemblers of heavier motor vehicles and also for the Australian manufacturers of the components of heavier motor vehicles. In March of this year the Government sent a reference to the Industries Assistance Commission on this matter. The reference was of the type with which we became familiar in the 1960s during the McEwen era. It was the type of reference in which the recommendations are written into the terms of the reference. In giving the reference to the IAC, the Government virtually instructed the IAC to bring down the sort of report and recommendations which it finally brought down. If anybody cares to look at page 78 of the IAC report on this matter, where the letter of the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Fife)</inline> is republished, they will see precisely what I mean.

            <para>- The recommendations made by the IAC were that an import duty of 22 <inline font-style="italic">lA</inline> per cent be applied to completely built-up vehicles and that the components from which those vehicles may be assembled be allowed duty free entry. That move in isolation, of course, would have removed any protection from the Australian manufacturers of" those components, and so the IAC recommended that a bounty of 20 per cent of the cost of locally produced components be paid to Australian manufacturers of those components. The Government made only one minor variation to the recommendation when it limited the range of components upon which that 20 per cent bounty would be payable. Conceptually one can easily work out the effective rate of protection provided in this legislation for assemblers. </para>
          </talk.start>
          </continue>
		  <para>The formula for working out the effective rate of protection is the landed cost of the completely built-up vehicle divided by the landed cost of the completely built-up vehicle minus the landed cost of components, the product of which is multiplied by 22 <inline font-style="italic">Vi</inline> per cent. The formula is relatively simple, at least when one sees it written down,  but we do not know what in reality it means. From the sources that I have consulted I have not been able to find out what the landed cost of the components is as a proportion of the landed cost of the completely built-up vehicle, but I would guess that the landed cost of the components would be about two-thirds of the cost of the completely built-up vehicle, in which case the effective rate of protection would be 6714 per cent. If the landed cost of components is one half of the cost of the completely built up vehicle, the effective rate of protection would be 45 per cent. Either of those figures is fairly high. To that calculation one rider should be added. If, as the IAC thought possible, the final prices of these vehicles came down, the effective rate of protection would be less. But if those final prices are not lowered the cost per extra job, as this Bill affects vehicle assemblers, will, according to the IAC estimates of its employment generating potential, be in the vicinity of $90,000 which is an extremely high level of employment subsidy, if I could use that term. The effective protection for the local component manufacture, on the other hand, appears to be something less than 20 per cent lower than for manufacturing industry as a whole. </para>
          <para>This legislation demonstrates the ad hoc nature of the Government's industry policy. A couple of pages of definitions illustrate that this Government has much less objection in practice than its rhetoric suggests to government intervention- or government meddling as, I suppose, members of the Liberal Party would be inclined to put it- in the economy. The final point I wish to raise is really a question of the Minister. If he does not mind I will put it to him in the second reading debate instead of in the Committee debate. Clause 5 (a) stipulates a component purchased by a vehicle assembler from an Australian manufacturer becomes eligible for a 20 per cent bounty payment. Does an assembler who is also a component producer- where the two activities are integrated- receive any bounty payment for that component which such a firm would be supplying to itself? </para>

          <para>-This is one of a series of Bills which the Government has introduced by way of amendment to the Broadcasting and Television Act. The Opposition does not oppose the provisions of this BUI, having seen them as part of the necessary machinery to carry out certain recommendations of the Green report on broadcasting in Australia and to bring up to date certain related provisions of the Act. For a long time we in the Senate have been discussing a series of Bills, all of which seem to be introduced on the last day of the parliamentary sittings, dealing with broadcasting and television. This Bill represents yet another step in the saga of those Bills. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>A number of specific matters are contained in this Bill of which I have indicated the Opposition approves. In the context of the debate about broadcasting and television in this country, they are rather ad hoc measures. However as I have said, they appear to me to be necessary. I have no doubt that in the context of a debate which normally flows freely in the Senate on matters of this kind when all points are taken up by different honourable senators my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ryan,</inline> will take up in detail the points which concern the Opposition and which the Opposition approves of in connection with this Bill. There is no need for me to dwell on those details. I merely indicate that the Opposition is not opposed to the legislation. </para>

          <para>- I thank my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button,</inline> for introducing the Opposition's point of view on this matter. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> has said, the Opposition does not oppose the Broadcasting and Television Amendment Bill. In fact, most of its provisions are most welcome. However, I would like to make some points in relation to the Bill on behalf of the Opposition. The Bill amends the procedures for lodging either applications for, or renewals of, licences for radio and television stations. It completes the transfer of responsibility for licensing matters begun in the 1976 amendments by the Minister for Post and Telecommunications <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Staley)</inline> to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>However, it is worth noting that the amendments to the Act before us arise out of administrative difficulties experienced by the Broadcasting Tribunal, firstly, at the public radio licence applications in April and June of this year and, secondly, the television licence renewal hearings in Adelaide in October and November. The amendments give the Tribunal discretionary powers in waiving the strict time limit for receipt of applications for new licences or lodgment of licence renewals. They also allow for extension of time for receipt of submissions, evidence or replies in licence hearings or renewals. </para>
        <para>The legislation contains an aspect of retrospectivity which is necessary to cover the irregularities in the applications for public radio licences and problems in the lodgment of renewal of applications for the Adelaide television licences. The problems over the public radio licences stemmed, firstly, from the confusion caused when the  Chairman  of the Tribunal, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gyngell,</inline> gave information which was not correct to people interested in making applications for public radio licences. Problems also arose from the failure of the Broadcasting Tribunal to clear regularly its post office box. Both of these factors caused a great deal of confusion at the time when applications for public radio licences were made. </para>
        <para>Although welcoming the fact that the mistakes are now being remedied, the Opposition must be critical of the fact that the introduction of retrospective legislation was necessary. I think the confusion on the part of the Tribunal itself, the confusion on the part of the  Chairman  and the confusion caused to applicants with regard to licence applications demonstrates that the Government had not been properly prepared for the innovation in public broadcasting. Of course, retrospective legislation is now necessary to validate applications for 26 public broadcasting licences and applications for the renewal of three commercial television licences in Adelaide. </para>
        <para>The public radio licences marked the first round of licence grants by the Tribunal. The television licence renewals were of great importance as they were the first public renewal hearings, and, as such, were a central element in the concept of public accountability of licence holders. It is disturbing that in both of these important undertakings by the Tribunal major irregularities have occurred. These irregularities were, of course, the result of the Government's earlier amendments to the Broadcasting and Television Act. In the Government's haste to transfer licensing power to the Tribunal two major points were neglected: firstly, that the Tribunal had sufficient administrative and legal competence to ensure that the provisions of the Act were properly observed; and, secondly, that the major inconsistency between renewal and application procedures was removed. This normally meant that whilst application for new licences were lodged with the Tribunal, renewals were lodged with the Minister. </para>
        <para>The Government's and the Minister's embarrassment was further compounded by the administrative incompetence of the Tribunal which failed to ensure in the public broadcasting applications that its post office box was regularly cleared. This resulted in 12 applications being deemed ineligible because of late receipt. The matter has now been rectified. These amendments give the Tribunal discretionary powers to extend any deadline for submission of applications, renewals, evidence or replies to submissions. The Opposition welcomes that power and expects that it will be exercised in a fair and impartial manner to ensure that hearings are conducted in the most open manner. The Opposition also welcomes the right of appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to ensure that such impartiality is observed. We of the Opposition are pleased to see that if an application is not granted an extension of time the applicant may appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. If it is the intention of these amendments to depoliticise further the granting and renewal of licences by removing them from the Minister's jurisdiction, then the Opposition welcomes the amendments. </para>
        <para>I do not wish to delay the Senate unduly because the Opposition is not opposing the Bill. As I said, we of the Opposition welcome several of the provisions in it. However, we hope that retrospective legislation of the kind contained in this amendment will not be necessary in the future and that the Government will, in pursuing innovations in the broadcasting area, ensure that sufficient resources are devoted in the planning stage to avoid the chaos which this legislation is designed to remedy. The Opposition is supportive of the institution of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal and the powers that have been given to it. It certainly is supportive of the practice of public hearings for licence renewals and licence applications. However, we would be most disappointed to see the public hearing procedure reduced in effectiveness by either administrative incompetence or insufficient resources. So in the expectation that future activities of the Tribunal will go more smoothly than they have to date, the Opposition is happy to see the passage of these amendments. </para>

I have noted their remarks, particularly those made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ryan.</inline> It would be common ground between the Government and the Opposition that one would prefer that this sort of retrospective validation not be necessary.

            <para>-The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Industrial Research and Development Incentives Act 1976. Amendments on this legislation were foreshadowed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> and the Minister for Productivity <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Macphee)</inline> in a joint statement on 16 August this year. The main points of the Bill, as I read it, are: Firstly, to increase the size of grants payable to eligible companies under the Act; secondly, to revamp the various elements of the Act aimed at simplifying the procedures governing the application by companies for grants and the processing of these applications by the Australian Industrial Research and Development Incentives Board; and thirdly, a change to the date on which the grant rates are set for a particular grant year. The Opposition does not oppose this Bill. Indeed, it welcomes it. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>However, I will make just one or two comments which seem to me to be important. The past performance of the Government in the area of industrial research and development has been very poor. There has been a good deal of erraticism in its funding to the Industrial Research and Development Incentives Board. This has had a very detrimental effect on the level of industrial research and development in Australia and has caused a general decrease in the level of industrial research and development. The Minister for Administrative Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Chaney)</inline> made a significant statement in his second reading speech when he said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>However, there is strong evidence of a substantial rundown in corporate research and development activity over the past three years. This rundown has been a matter of serious concern to the Government. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I mention that statement because it refers to a rundown in the level of industrial research and development in the past three years. The fact which the Senate and this country have to face up to is that by overseas standards the level of industrial research and development in this country has been bad over the last 20 or 30 years. The Government's statement about a rundown in the last three years is a much more serious statement than might at first have been thought. </para>
          <para>This country suffers from a number of very serious economic difficulties at the moment and no amount of whistling in the dark by the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick)</inline> or the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> in so-called speeches to the nation which herald a new dawn in 1980 and beyond will make those things happen unless we come to grips with some of the issues which are, in fact, facing industry in this country. .They are the sorts of issues which I have referred to in another context today and which are the subject of the Crawford Committee review of structural adjustment in Australia, the Jackson Committee report, the White Paper on Manufacturing Industry and a wide variety of other reports which, if the Government has considered them, it has taken no action upon. </para>
          <para>It is only two or three weeks since we had what I regard as an important debate in the Senate on the role of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. It was a debate in which there was unanimity of opinion amongst members on both sides of the chamber who displayed an intelligent concern for the problems of scientific research and development in this country. Every one of those speakers in that debate made important points about the need for Australia to develop its own indigenous research capacity but, more importantly, for Australia to have proper arrangements for research done by a body such as the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation to be translated into reality in terms of application by Australian industry. </para>
          <para>The sad fact of the matter is that in this country, with the exception of rural industries, we have enjoyed a very high level of protection for a long period of time. That protection has been good for manufacturing industries and of very doubtful value to rural industries. Whilst that protection may have been necessary and may still be necessary, in sheer economic terms, in terms of the viability of Australian industries which employ a substantial portion of the work force, and so on, it has had a very deleterious effect on the psychology of Australian businessmen. The fact of the matter is that research done in Australia by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation or private researchers in universities or elsewhere is just not taken up to the extent to which it ought to be taken up by Australian industry, which has been very content to rely on derivative technology from overseas, to rely on derivative business practices from overseas and not to grapple with the important task of applying Australian research and development in a relevant way, particularly with regard to Australian export markets. </para>
          <para>These are matters of very serious concern. The matter of great regret, of course, is that the Government has again brought into the Senate on the last day of sittings a most important piece of legislation. As honourable senators wander back into this chamber from a series of social gatherings prior to the rising of the Senate, it is important to record the Opposition's concern that the subject matter of this Bill- which we were prepared to debate with great seriousness on an earlier occasion- has not been considered more seriously. If I appear to be labouring the point, I do so only because I think it is important that the Senate be regarded, as it sometimes is, as a serious and important institution and that it should not devote all of the remaining time available to it to an exchange of fraternal and convivial greetings and things of that kind, which as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> well knows are not the sorts of things we are paid for. I am sorry if I aroused the concern of a number of honourable senators by putting that matter in what was perhaps a slightly abrasive way. I certainly did not intend to do that. </para>

          <para>The important point is that the Government is again introducing on the last day legislation which is a consequence of legislation introduced a month or so ago in relation to the CSIRO, which probably produced the best and most serious debate that the Senate has had in this session. The Opposition regrets that the Government has seen fit to take that course. We hope that on the next occasion on which the Parliament meets we will have an opportunity to debate these very important matters, which are of vital concern to Australian industry, in a more serious way. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume</inline> nods his head like Noddy. He was one of the contributors to the previous debate. I hope that he will make a contribution to this debate in the same spirit as in the last one. The Opposition does not oppose this legislation. We hope that the pious hopes expressed in the second reading speech will be fulfilled. </para>

            <para>- I had intended to commence my reply by wishing <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> a happy Christmas, but in the light of his comments on the Bill I do not propose to do that now. I thank the Opposition for it support of the Bill. To some extent the concern expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> is reflected in the second reading speech and in particular in the passage to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> referred. It is unusual in the present Budget climate to find an item of government expenditure which is rising by 70 per cent. That fact alone- the increase in expenditure from $14m to $21m in one yearunderlines the serious approach the Government has to this problem and the fact that it is determined to grapple with it. I do not think there is anything else that needs to be said on the Bill. I commend it to the Senate. </para>

            <para>That the Bill be now read a second time. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The purpose of this Bill is to make an alteration to section 44 of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia. The alteration will enable persons holding an office of profit under the Crown to be chosen as senators or as members of the House of Representatives. Before discussion the purpose of this Bill, it is pertinent to examine the provisions of section 44 of the Constitution. Under the heading of 'disqualification', section 44 reads: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Any person who- (i.) Is under any acknowledgement of allegiance, obedience, or adherence to a foreign power, or is a subject or a citizen or entitled to the rights or privileges of a subject or a citizen of a foreign power or (ii.) Is attained of treason, or has been convicted and is under sentence, or subject to be sentenced, for any offence punishable under the law of the Commonwealth or of a State by imprisonment for one year or longer, or (iti.) Is an undischarged bankrupt or insolvent: or (iv.) Holds any office of profit under the Crown, or any pension payable during the pleasure of the Crown out of any of the revenues of the Commonwealth: or (v.) Has any direct or indirect pecuniary interest in any agreement with the Public Service of the Commonwealth otherwise than as a member and in common with the other members of an incorporated company consisting of more than twenty-five persons: shall be incapable of being chosen or of sitting as a senator or a member of the House of Representatives. </para>
            <para>But sub-section (iv) does not apply to the office of any of the Queen's Ministers of State for the Commonwealth, or of any of the Queen 's Ministers for a State, or to the receipt of pay, half pay, or a pension, by any person as an officer or member of the Queen's navy or army, or to the receipt of pay as an officer or member of the naval or military forces of the Commonwealth by any person whose services are not wholly employed by the Commonwealth. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Constitution Alteration (Holders of Offices of Profit) Bill 1978 relates to sub-section (iv) of section 44. An effect of sub-section (iv) is that any member of the Commonwealth or State public service who seeks election to the Federal Parliament must resign his Public Service appointment prior to nomination. If the public servant does not resign, he continues, of course, to hold an office of profit under the Crown. Thus, if he is successful in the election, he runs the risk of being declared ineligible to sit in the Senate or in the House of Representatives. </para>
          <para>Very few would argue that a public servant should be eligible to sit in either the Senate or the House of Representatives. The holding of an office of profit under the Crown is a traditional form of disqualification for membership of houses of parliament established on the British pattern. It is quite conceivable that employment by the Crown or in the Public Service could affect the independence of a member of parliament. </para>
          <para>On one hand, the practice that a public servant should not be eligible to sit in the Senate or House of Representatives is a sound one. It prevents a degree of potential conflict of interest from arising. On the other hand, it does restrict the ability of the public servant to contest a Federal election. Other Australian adults enjoy the freedom of nominating for political office without being required, by virtue of constitutional provisions, to resign from their current employment. The public servant, however, is required to resign his position before contesting a federal election. Thus one of the basic tenets of Australian democracy, namely the freedom of the individual to offer himself for public service in the Parliament, is severely limited for public servants. </para>
          <para>One important consequence of this situation is that there are probably many highly qualified public servants who could make a significant contribution to this Parliament but who choose not to seek election because of the possibility of losing their livelihood in merely attempting to enter Parliament. It is all too easy to say that the public servant who desires to serve his country in Parliament should accept the risk of losing his employment. But responsibility tugs hard at the person with a family and spouse to support. The prospect of throwing away job security and all that means for one's family must be too daunting for many public servants even to contemplate a possible parliamentary career. </para>
          <para>I have previously outlined in this Parliament the limited opportunities for re-appointment to the Commonwealth and State public services for public servants who have resigned to contest a federal election. For a more detailed discussion of this topic, I refer honourable senators to Senate <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of 29 May 1 978, pages 20 1 9 and 2020. At this stage, it is simply sufficient to say that in the Commonwealth Public Service or the public service of any State or Territory there is no right of re-appointment. Certainly the public servant in Australia who unsuccessfully contests a federal election may be re-appointed but it is important that the word 'may' be stressed. It is clear that there is no automatic right of reappointment. I am convinced that this Parliament is all the poorer because many highly capable public servants do not, due to the restrictions of section 44 of the Constitution, even consider the prospect of standing for Federal Parliament. </para>
          <para>In terms of justice for public servants themselves, it is necessary to do something about a system which fetters their right to nominate for Federal Parliament. In terms of the contribution that Parliament can make to the democratic process, it is important that each person in Australia should, as far as humanly possible, be able to contest a place in the national legislature. Thus we must ensure that public servants are not deterred by unnecessary constraints from offering themselves for parliamentary service. </para>
          <para>This Bill is aimed towards that end. It allows a person who holds an office of profit under the Crown to be chosen as a senator or a member of the House of Representatives. The Bill further provides, however, that a person who holds an office of profit under the Crown and who has been chosen as a senator or member is not able to receive any allowances or to sit in the Parliament. In other words, he must resign his public service appointment before becoming eligible to take a seat in the Parliament and to draw salary and allowances as a member of Parliament. </para>
          <para>The question could be raised about what would happen if a public servant was elected and did not resign his public servant appointment. It appears that sections 20 and 38 of the Constitution would cover such a situation. Under these sections, the place of a senator or member becomes vacant if, without the permission of his house of the Parliament, he fails for two consecutive months to attend Parliament. </para>
          <para>The alteration to the Constitution as outlined by this Bill would require amendments to some existing Commonwealth and State legislation. These amendments will be necessary because some existing legislation is based on the assumption that public servants cannot be elected to the Federal Parliament whilst still holding their public service appointment. These amendments, however, may be made readily by the Commonwealth and State parliaments. No further constitutional changes are required to allow the necessary complementary legislative amendments to be made. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

          <para>- I announce to the Senate the retirement of the Principal Parliamentary Reporter, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Kenneth</inline> Ross Ingram, which will take place on 18 December. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ingram</inline> joined <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> 42 years ago as a cadet reporter and since then he has occupied all reporting and editorial positions on the staff of the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Born in Dundee, Scotland. in 1913, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ingram</inline> migrated to Australia with his family in the mid- 1920s and their decision to live in the developing national capital enabled him, as a schoolboy, to witness the opening of Parliament House in 1927. Since then he has witnessed many other notable events in the history of the Parliament, including three double dissolutions, the appearance of persons who were called to the bar of the House of Representatives and of the Senate, the advent of the daily <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> in 1955, and the only joint sitting of the two Houses. Since 1968, when he was appointed  deputy  head of the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ingram</inline> has played a most significant part in controlling the operations of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> An achievement of much importance was his establishment and development of the tape transcription centre, without which the considerable volume of evidence currently being given to the large number of parliamentary committees could not have been published. </para>
        <para>Ken, as he is universally known, has served the Senate well, both as a working reporter and as Principal of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff. Always courteous and helpful, he has brought credit to his own high position and the Parliament which he has served so faithfully. I thought it appropriate, as I crossed Kings Hall today, to note that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ingram</inline> figures prominently in the painting of the 1974 opening of Parliament by  Her  Majesty the Queen. No doubt that painting will- we hope it will be in 1988- grace the new and permanent Parliament House. </para>
        <para>Regrettably because of illness, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ingram</inline> is not in his place in this chamber today, and that is a disappointment to us all. But I hope that he is listening to the broadcast of the proceedings and, if not, that he will read this tribute to him. On behalf of aU honourable senators, I thank <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ingram</inline> for his long and distinguished service in maintaining the high standards and traditions of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> in the reporting of the parliamentary debates. We extend, too, best respects to Ken's charming wife and wish them both good health and happiness. </para>

          <para>- I am sure aU Government senators would want to join with you, sir, in the tribute to Ken Ingram. You have in fact outlined the career of a remarkable and dedicated person, a person who uniquely has viewed this Parliament through the whole of the journey from its inception here and who has had the tolerance, kindliness and quiet wisdom to look at us with friendship and with great understanding, perhaps beyond the ordinary bounds of tolerance. We say to him- and in paying tribute to him we pay tribute to the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff itself- how much we have enjoyed the journey with him not only in his function as a senior officer but also as a friend. The senior <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff have a remarkable capacity to help us. We want to say how much we have appreciated what he has done for the institution of Par.liament and the institution of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> ever since Luke and Thomas Hansard almost invented the system. We say to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ingram</inline> and to the rest of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff that we marvel at their ability to take the incoherent utterances of most of us- I am not the least of the offenders- and put them into print with some magic of kindness, generosity and understanding which makes them intelligible to others and immortalises them. We feel that we are dealing with people whom we are proud to have as friends. We say to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr and Mrs Ingram</inline> and their family that we wish them good health and happiness for the future. We hope to see a lot of them in the future. </para>

          <para>-Mr William Worth came to the Parliament as the interim Security Coordinator on 16 March 1978. He had the difficult task of bringing in the new and not always appreciated security measures decided upon by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker</inline> and me. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Worth</inline> had previously served with distinction in a wide variety of specialist positions-. He was for seven years the  Deputy  Secretary-General of the South East Asia Treaty Organisation and he managed the Australian participation in Expo 67 in Montreal and in Expo 70 in Osaka. He was also the Australian Commissioner General for Expo 74 in Spokane, United States of America, and for Expo 75 in Okinawa.  His  final appointment in the service was as Administrator of the Territory of Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean. </para>

        <para>I am grateful that he agreed to come out of retirement temporarily to take on the task of Security Co-ordinator on an interim basis.  His  wide experience and quiet pursuit of the objective of a sound security system has been most helpful to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker</inline> and me in our endeavour to provide a secure meeting place for the Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Worth</inline> will be relinquishing his duties as Security Co-ordinator on the thirtieth of this month. On behalf of all honourable senators I thank <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Worth</inline> for his invaluable services to the Parliament. I place on record sincere thanks and extend to him every good wish for his future activities. </para>

We join with you, sir, in thanking <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Worth</inline> and wishing him every happiness and health for the future. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline>while I am on my feet I would like first of all to pay tribute to you. You are a very distinguished  President  of this chamber, a person whose temperament, judgment and quiet personality have made an enduring impression on this chamber and a person whose fairness and sensitivity to the chamber have added to the dignity of the Parliament. We acknowledge that and wish you and your good wife every happiness. Particularly, we are all grateful to you for your wonderful hospitality. </para>
          <para>If I may, through you, turn to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Clerk,</inline> his senior officers and all of the staff of the Parliament: If indeed the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> officers are the psychotherapists of the Parliament, of the senators and members, may I say that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Clerk</inline> and his officer are not diminished in stature thereby. They have an amazing ability to remove the difficulties that we encounter in our journey down the road and work out procedures which make this institution run, both in the chamber and outside. I would like, therefore, to pay tribute to your officers and staff and, through them, the wide range of people who make this Parliament work. </para>
          <para>I refer to the attendants, who know us and do such a good job around the place; to the Parliamentary guides', to the guards around the place; to the refreshment room staff who, I think, bring a cheerfulness and effectiveness of service beyond the ordinary call of duty; to the telephone operators who tolerate us so magnificently; to those who hide downstairs in Records and look after our pay, allowances and office furniture; to the people who really make the place run- to the Library and to the research staff, the non-clerical people, the engineers and the gardeners, the committee staffs; to the Commonwealth car drivers in their enduring patience with us; to our own individual parliamentary staffs. In paying a tribute to my own staff and their dedication, I acknowledge the dedication of all. </para>
          <para>In expressing my appreciation I would be recreant if I did not, in the first place, say to the Senate Opposition: I acknowledge your courtesies. I acknowledge, if I may do so with presumption, the friendships that you have extended. I acknowledge that this is a chamber in which the battles are real and meaningful and should be. I acknowledge that the Senate has a spirit and tradition which we all seek to uphold. I pay tribute to the vigour of your fight, even though sometimes the scars are on my nose. I thank the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wriedt)</inline> and the Opposition Whip for their courtesies and helpfulness and, indeed, the pursuit of their own rights and issues, which I respect. It would be wrong if I did not pay tribute to perhaps the real gods in the machine. I have never thought of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> as a god, but if we are going to have gods in the machine, may I say to the Whips and Assistant Whips, who somehow or other behind your chair, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> manage to straighten out our troubles, thank you. </para>
          <para>Finally, for my own part, to my own front bench, who tolerate me with great good humour, and to my back bench, who have shown as private senators, through their work in the committees of this Parliament, the true spirit of the Senate, I say thank you. In saying those things I wish them all, through you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> a very well-earned recess which will not, of course, be a holiday but will simply mean that the work will go on out in the electorate, and express the hope that they will get, however brief, a real vacation. I express the wish that they and their families, at Christmas and New Year, will have full enjoyment of that period. </para>
          <para>May I wish us all for 1979 all the good health, happiness of spirit and all the adventure of the mind and body to which we can as eager Australians look forward. I thank you very much. </para>

            <para>- On behalf of the Opposition, there is not very much that I could say other than to express my regret that, according to the summary that has just been circulated, the Government won all the divisions in the Senate. It won ten divisions and the Opposition won none. The Government won all the divisions in committee; the Opposition won none. I can assure the Government that that is only a temporary phenomenon. My only regret is that this is not a parliament that is rising to conduct an election but perhaps we will be doing that in two years time. I am sure that we will do so with exactly the same confidence with which we would be doing it now. On behalf of the Opposition, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> I wish you, Government members and all my colleagues the compliments of the season and I look forward to all of us being back here in the new year, refreshed and ready for yet another year's confrontation. </para>

            <para>-I am sorry to break into this jovial occasion with a somewhat more serious subject. It is something I have been trying to do for a couple of days now but have been unable to get the opportunity to do so. I well remember a former Liberal Party senator who regularly spoke on serious subjects in the adjournment debate on the last day of sitting and caused some controversy. </para>

              <para>- He was not from the same State. Therfore I do not feel constrained not to raise this subject today. I feel that I must do so because the subject is an important one and I would like the Minister for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Guilfoyle)</inline> to make some inquiries in the forthcoming recess into what should be done to ensure that justice is seen to be done in this country. I am sure that justice is not at least being seen to be done in this matter I am going to talk about and I am certainly not at all sure that justice is in fact being done. The subject, as the Minister and others know, is the large number of people, mostly Australian citizens of Greek descent, who have been charged with conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth through the social security system. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The subject is a difficult one to talk about for several reasons. Firstly there are people before the courts and, therefore, their cases are sub judice. I do not want to touch on any of the details or make any judgment as to whether anybody is guilty or not guilty. Secondly, most of the cases concern people who are or have been ill and, therefore, involve medical reports. We in this country have a tradition of respect for the confidentiality of the relationship between a doctor and his patient and we believe that reports from the doctor about the patient should be privileged and confidential. As a result, it is difficult to discuss cases like this. Thirdly, the community concerned has suffered and is suffering as a result of the publicity given to these cases. I believe that this Parliament is the place where, allegedly, we are able to redress injustices of this type and that is what I will try to do. </para>
          <para>As I have said in the past, the facts are that at the beginning of April this year people were arrested, some of them doctors, some of them psychologists, most of them pensioners, allegedly for conspiring to defraud the Commonwealth. Initially and since then the treatment of these cases in the media has been unfortunate, and senators on both sides of this chamber have commented on this. There were dramatic headlines and dramatic reporting of the type which appeared on 3 April following the raids and when the cases came to court. We saw Inspector Don Thomas, who was leading the investigation, giving interviews in the Press, describing how proud he was of the investigation he had conducted and saying that in all some 1,000 people were involved, that there would be 1,000 future charges, that there would be 350 people, if possible, brought back from Greece and that, hopefully, all 1,000 people who were guilty would be charged. There were allegations that telephones were bugged and police tapes were handed to Greek interpreters. There were claims in several newspapers that up to $42m was involved. On the day of the court case there was extreme confusion in the court because of the lack of interpreters. The next day the newspapers ran photographs of the policeman in charge of the case, Chief Inspector Thomas, and the Director-General of Social Services, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lanigan,</inline> leaving the court together and expressing satisfaction with the way the situation was progressing. </para>
          <para>The people in the Greek community, not unfairly, I believe, became very annoyed at the way in which their community apparently was being singled out by the Press in this unfair way. As I said, people on both sides of this chamber have talked about it. This has continued since. We had a disgraceful article in the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> in July by a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Peter</inline> Samuel in which he not only took to the Greek community but to other communities. For example, he said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The $60m a year fraud by Greeks is said to have been only one of three major organised ripoffs detected by the Social Security Department. Turks and Lebanese have been involved in other major organised frauds, say departmental officials. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Members of this Parliament, and I single out particularly <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McVeigh</inline> in the other House, have frequently made remarks in speeches about Greeks ripping off the system. Comedians like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Barry</inline> Humphries have decided it is a suitable vehicle for cracking jokes at the National Press Club. So we have a community that is upset. </para>
          <para>As honourable senators know, I have been interested in the situation. I have an enormous file on the problem, and the Minister knows that I have had correspondence with her Department. We had a claim that over 1,000 people would be charged. In fact, less than 200 have been charged. We had a claim that 350 people were going to be brought back from Greece. In fact, of course, nobody has been brought back from Greece because the Greek Government would not agree to extradition. Only 135 people in total lost their pensions in Greece. We had claims that people who were being investigated would not lose their pensions until the investigations had been held. We know, and the Minister knows because she and her staff later had to deal with the problems, that people were losing their pensions. It was only at a later date that the Department corrected this situation and people got their benefits back. We know from Greek welfare workers and from cases that members of Parliament have had that some people went without support for some six to eight weeks, relying on friends for help. Some of this could be put down to the difficulties and the chaos that reigned at the time, to the inexperience of some departmental officers in dealing with problems of this type, because there were a lot of people involved. However, the result was confusion in the community and a heightening feeling that the community was being got at. </para>
          <para>If I could recapitulate to this stage, we have a situation where the Commonwealth Police have conducted an investigation and laid certain charges. The Department of Social Security has been closely involved and has been seen to be closely involved, although I am not implying that there was anything improper about the Department's action. People in the community who have been charged or who have lost their pensions and are appealing have had to go back to the Department, which they see as co-operating with the police. They feel that they have difficulty getting justice in a situation where they do not really understand our system of justice. Greek social workers involved with the Greek community in Sydney have written repeatedly since this has arisen to me, to other members of the Parliament and to the Minister expressing their concern. There have been repeated meetings expressing concern about their treatment, about the difficulty of appealing, and about the difficulty, particularly in Greece, in getting justice and appealing there. We have had two debates in this place, yet still I find, and I know that others find, that the complaints are flowing in just as they were before. The feeling that members of the community are not getting a fair go is as strong as it was before. For instance, I know that one Government member at least has had an unpublicised meeting with members of the Greek community because of his .concern over what is happening. </para>
          <para>In the course of investigating this matter certain things arose which disturbed me. The first was that on looking at the official records of interview between the Commonwealth Police and the people who were charged, one finds certain, absolutely rock solid evidence that police did in fact have the medical records of these people before they were arrested and charged. As I said, in this country we believe it to be important that a doctor's medical records of a patient are confidential, that they are held in a secure place, secure from other people, from third parties. Yet now we know absolutely that in fact the Commonwealth Police had these records before charges were laid. I think that raises all sorts of questions. It certainly makes it difficult for people, particularly those with psychiatric illnesses, to approach the Department if they believe that at some future time their medical records may not be secure and might be handed to a third person. </para>
          <para>The second matter is- and this does not involve the Minister for Social Security- that I have absolute evidence, in writing, that a member of my profession, the medical profession, forwarded a patient's medical report to the Department of Health without the permission of that patient and without the permission of that patient's general practitioner. As a doctor, I am horrified that such a thing could happen. I am most concerned that it happened, as are other people and they are taking action about this case. This, when added to the other things, makes it difficult for the people of the Greek community to have any sort of faith in the system. </para>
          <para>I have here evidence of another case- I will give the documentation to the Minister but as it contains medical records I would be reluctant to divulge it all on the records of the Senateconcerning a man whose invalid pension was withdrawn. This man had obtained his invalid pension on the evidence of two medical practitioners- one a clinical psychologist and the other a general practitioner- but his pension was withdrawn on the evidence of one other specialist. I shall call that specialist <inline font-weight="bold">Dr R.</inline> When this man appealed against this decision, he was referred by the Department to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr R</inline> for his appeal. In other words, when this man's pension was withdrawn he appealed against the decision and was sent on appeal to the same doctor who recommended the withdrawal. Incidentally, this doctor has been the source of many reports to the Department of Health and, I understand, to the Department of Social Security because of his attitude to members of the Greek community. </para>
          <para>Another thing that disturbs me is the treatment of people in Greece. We know that a fairly high proportion of people of Greek descent in receipt of invalid pensions went back to Greece. We know that after 1 April some 135 of these people in Greece lost their pensions. The Minister said, I believe in the course of debate in this place, that those people could go to the Australian Embassy in Greece where they would be examined and if their pension had been unfairly withdrawn it would be restored. She said that all this could be done within two weeks. I remember the Minister saying that by the next pay day, 14 April, these people would again be receiving their pensions. I believe that in the time since then 29 of those 135 people have had their pensions reinstated in Greece. The Minister also said that they would be able to appeal. But, since saying that, she has said that to appeal they will have to come back to Australia. The remarkable fact is that five of them have done so. They have saved or borrowed money- borrowed money in most cases. In one case the children have been left behind. In fact, they have come back to Australia to appeal, despite the political climate as they see it and despite some disgraceful articles in Athens newspapers. What disturbs me is that over 100 people who are still in Greece have lost their pensions. To appeal they will have to come to Australia. </para>
          <para>What adds to my concern is that recently I have seen the story of two people who have returned from Greece. One man had his pension stopped in Greece on the advice of the Commonwealth Police because of his connection with people involved in the case. He went to the Australian Embassy, where he was seen by a doctor. He was referred to two Greek specialists in Athens. There is no record of that in the report of the Department of Social Security. However, there is a report from a doctor in Athens saying that this person is no longer eligible for an invalid pension. But, on this man's return to Australia, it was found that he is very seriously ill. He is considered to be intractably ill. In fact, he has gone back to receiving his invalid pension. If this has happened- another case is similarone wonders how many of the other 105-odd people in Greece who are unable to appeal would win an appeal if examined by competent specialists; how many of those people, if they were not afraid of coming back to Australiathey have a fear because of the atmosphere surrounding this case- and came back to Australia in fact would have their pensions reinstated. I think that it is unfortunate that we cannot get a team to go to Greece to consider these appeals properly because these people, most of them in good faith, returned to Greece within the laws of this land. </para>
          <para>I believe that this whole situation should be properly investigated. I am aware of the difficulties. I am very much more aware that at present court cases are proceeding. But a senior police officer was reported in newspapers and on television repeatedly as saying: 'Over 1,000 people are involved and we are going to get them all. There are over 300 in Greece and we are going to get them back'. Nowhere near that many people have been charged. My understanding of the replies from the Minister is that not as many as that will be charged. I do not believe that senior police officers should make that sort of statement and then not be able to back it up. We know from reports in the newspapers that on the days of the so-called raids- I cannot think of a better word- when the Commonwealth Police went to people's homes and arrested them, one newspaper in particular was notified beforehand and went along. The newspaper knew that the raids were going to happen. The newspaper concerned was the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Sun.</inline> It described now the operation was prepared and how they followed the police officers around in the raids. I believe that that is improper and not the sort of thing that should happen in this country. But it did happen. We have reports that the police were accompanied by observers, senior officers of her Department. I have asked the Minister a question on this and I know that I will get an answer eventually. I want to know who those officers were and why they were there. We know that the most senior officer in the Department, the Director-General of Social Security, was at the court on that chaotic first day of the case. He has been seen to be associated with the people who are doing the prosecuting. I am not suggesting that he was there other than perfectly innocently, but what happened has put into the minds of these people that he is associating with those who are doing the prosecuting. </para>
          <para>We know that soon afterwards- I will not go into the details- certain doctors in Sydney suddenly would not see or were reluctant to see people of Greek descent and that special arrangements had to be made with public hospitals to get doctors to care for people of Greek descent. We know that since this has happened </para>
          <para class="block">Greek welfare officers in Sydney have had considerable difficulty in handling the problems that have arisen. We know that there are problems back in Greece. We know that those people who have come back from Greece have succeeded in their appeals. The person I have seen was seriously ill. Quite frankly, his illness should not have been missed and the decision to stop his pension in Greece should not have been made. I believe that this and other things that I have mentioned point to the fact that we need an investigation. The question is: What sort of investigation do we need? </para>

              <para>- We need an investigation of the conduct of this whole case and the behaviour of people in the case. The question is: What sort of investigation do we need? I will try to answer the honourable senator's question. We cannot expect the Commonwealth Police to investigate themselves. We all know what happens in this country and in any other country when police forces investigate themselves. The Department and senior officers of the Department are seen by the people to be intimately associated with the police officers who are conducting the case. I suggest that they are not in a suitable situation to investigate this sort of case. After the recess and perhaps after the court case, because the court case does complicate the issue, we may get to the situation where the only appropriate body in this country to investigate this case is this chamber or one of its committees. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume</inline> looks horrified. Alternatively, I think that we have to have a judicial investigation. I think that people must look at those two alternatives because there is a problem. It is no good people saying that there is no problem and that these people are paranoid, cannot understand the system and have no case. From what I have seen of their community I believe that they have a case. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I have seen documentary evidence about the behaviour of people who could be called my professional colleagues which disturbs me considerably. Some action is being taken in that respect, but we cannot ignore the court case that is going on, say that it is sub judice and push it to one side. We cannot ignore the fact that people feelrightly or wrongly; I believe in many cases rightly- that they are being put upon. We cannot allow the unfortunate and inherent xenophobia that exists in all other communities to exist in this community, as it does, whereby people of Greek descent are being discriminated against because of the publicity they have had in the Press. For example, because of this court case, people such as Barry Humphries think it is great fun to crack jokes at the National Press Club and other places about people of Greek descent. Peter Samuel has written outrageous articles without a scintilla of evidence and said that $42m was involved and that Greeks, Turks and everyone in Sydney were ripping off the system. Even senior journalists like Alan Reid have done the same sort of thing. In fact, members of this Parliament have made broad, sweeping allegations about the matter, whether or not they were made in the heat of the moment. </para>
          <para>I believe that we will need to conduct an investigation. Not only people in the Greek community are concerned <inline font-style="italic">about the matter, but</inline> also people in the medical profession in Sydney have approached me and expressed their concern. People in the social welfare community have approached me and expressed their concern. In fact, some of them are forming committees to see what they can do about the situation. People in the diplomatic community also are concerned about what is happening. I believe that a judicial inquiry or a parliamentary inquiry may be necessary. I will be receiving and correlating further evidence in the future. I know that other members of Parliament will be doing that also. I know that the Minister will be sympathetic in that situation. We have a very real problem in that people are reluctant to come forward with information to the Department which they see as being involved with the police in the case. It may be that the people involved will come forward with evidence finally only to some independent investigation in which they can have faith. </para>
          <para>I raise this matter in all good faith. I raise it because I believe that people in the Greek community in Australia and the whole ethnic community deserve better treatment than they have had. I attribute malice to no one. I think that we must investigate the matter and make sure that some people are not acting in a malicious way for their own gain, for their own preferment <inline font-style="italic">or for</inline> the purpose of promoting themselves in some way. I believe that we must assure the Greek community and members of all other ethnic communities that they have the protection of law and justice in this country like everybody else, that they have the protection of this Parliament like everybody else. I believe also that it is to the good of the whole community that if an injustice has been done or if it seems that an injustice has been done we take action and prevent either the reality of the injustice or the appearance of the injustice from worsening community relations in Australia. </para>

I thank in particular Senators Missen and Martin who, as chairmen of committees, have been particularly helpful in explaining what goes on around the Parliament I thank the Whips for the way in which they have helped us to integrate into the parliamentary system. To Senators Carrick and Guilfoyle who have been good enough to pass on to me a number of matters in order to ensure that my weekends were not spent in idleness, perhaps I could slightly misquote Gilbert and Sullivan to sum up the situation: </para>

            <para>- I do not wish to detain the Senate for very long. However, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline> has raised a serious matter and one that is of great concern to me. He began his remarks by saying that he hoped justice is seen to be done and that justice is being done. I think that he almost concluded his remarks by saying that he hoped an injustice would not be seen to be done. I concur with the sentiments expressed by the honourable senator because of the nature of the court case which is expected to take place towards the end of January next year for numbers of people who have had charges laid against them by the Commonwealth Police </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>It will be recalled that there were debates on this matter on 10 April and 3 May this year. Many comments have been made in various places from time to time. I have had the opportunity to express the concern of this Government to the Greek Consul-General, the Greek Charged 'Affaires, a deputation from the Australia.Greek Welfare Society and others who are regarded as leaders of the Greek descendants in this country that they should feel embarrassed as a community by some of the Press comments that were made. I have also expressed to them the very great admiration that the Government and the Australian people have for the reputation which is enjoyed by those people of Greek descent, those people who are Australians in their own right by birth in this country or by accepting Australian citizenship. </para>
          <para>I will be pleased to hear from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline> the evidence of some of the cases which he has mentioned. If as a parliamentary representative he feels that he can make these representations to the Department of Social Security with detail that shows some of the injustices that he claims exist, I would be pleased to have them investigated and to see that any action that can be taken by the Department is taken as soon as possible. If he has the names of people who have made claims that they wish to have processed I would be pleased to have them. I must say that in all of the representations that have been made to me very few names are given. In fact, I can almost say that no names have been given to me that would allow me personally to take further action on behalf of individuals. This may be related to one of the factors mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes-</inline> the reluctance of people to give information. However, if the Department is to assist these people to have their claims justly dealt with, information that can be given- perhaps through parliamentary representatives, community leaders or others- would certainly be welcomed by me so that whatever steps can be taken are taken on their behalf. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline>has cited some statistics in respect of this matter. I also have some statistics which relate to those people in Greece. The figures which I have show that 105 pensions were cancelled in Greece; 29 were restored on a permanent basis, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline> said. The total figure I have is 134, which I think is one different from the figure mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes.</inline> Throughout the whole of the investigation of those people who came before our notice, many pensions were cancelled on the income test basis and not on the medical test basis. It will be understood that an invalid pension attracts those two tests. In many cases, it was the income test which, on review, prevented the pension from being continued under the terms of eligibility of the Act. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline> mentioned his concern with regard to those people who are living in Greece and who wish to make an appeal against the decisions that were made. Statements were made at the time with regard to the appeals. People were tested again to determine their pension eligibility. However, because of my concern in this matter, we have arranged for Commonwealth medical officers to go to Greece- they may have already left for Greece- to enable those people who are living in Greece to make an appeal against decisions which they would wish to contest. </para>

              <para>- I do not have the names of the doctors. I believe that one of them is from the Victorian Branch of the Department of Health. I am not sure about the other. The arrangements were made some weeks ago. They may already have travelled to Greece and have done the work. If not the trip must be pending because it is some weeks since I asked that those arrangements be made. The matters raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline> with regard to medical records and the lack of confidentiality concern me. The officers of my Department are well aware of their responsibilities with regard to the confidentiality of records under the Act. Again, if there is evidence of this not being observed by officers of the Department I would like to see it so that appropriate action can be taken. If, on the other hand, it is evidence from doctors outside the Department and there is some way in which we can deal with it I would be pleased to hear. </para>

          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline>mentioned the reporting of this matter. I see <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ryan</inline> in the chamber. I recall the approach she took to this matter as the spokesman on media matters for her party. She referred to the sensationalism of the Press with regard to those who had been charged. I think we all expressed concern at the time that the matter was not reported with sensitivity or balance. It was reported as a sensation. I understand that a number of people were concerned about their treatment. In my position I am unable to suggest what redress there is against that sort of treatment by the media. Fair minded people would consider that matters ought to be reported fairly. When charges have been laid and court cases are pending judgments should not be taken until the justice of the Australian system is tested in the courts. Perhaps that should be said at this stage. Court cases are pending and there are cases before the court. For us to pre-judge the decision of the court is improper. It is something I would not propose to do. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline>showed an admirable sense of fairness in the way in which he put this matter. I ask only that that sense of fairness does not exclude the New South Wales Branch of the Department of Social Security. He suggested that the Department is associated with this matter which has inhibited it from dealing with people requiring our services. This is something I find difficult to understand. My Department must deal with applications for pensions and benefits. The Commonwealth Police laid the charges. My Department cannot help being associated in the sense that it is responsible to test eligibility for pensions and benefits. I find it. difficult to understand some of the assertions about my Department being involved in this matter. My Department is the processing department. The Commonwealth Police on behalf of the Commonwealth Government have laid charges. </para>
          <para>Does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline> wish to dissociate the Department from this matter? I fail to see how that can be done given the system under which we work and how our Department has to supply information. As I have said before, if there is to be a sense of fairness <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline> should not exclude the Department of Social Security and the officers in the New South Wales Branch. As far as I know, from all the information that has been given to them they have dealt fairly with the requests. They have tested eligibility as fairly as they are able. Given all their responsibilities they have processed as quickly as possibly any applications that have come before them. I conclude by saying that this is a matter of difficulty and one which is still before the court. It is of personal concern to me that there should be distress and that allegations should have been made somewhat wildly in many ways about the whole issue. Because it has happened in this country, I believe that when the court case is heard and the judgment of the court delivered justice will be seen to have been done. </para>

              <para>- I do not attribute any malice to the Minister for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Guilfoyle),</inline> but I do wish to explain that I had pointed out that one of the difficulties of the case in question, and one that I am very acutely aware of, is not that the Department of Social Security and its officers are involved- as they must have been because it was in the course of doing thenduty as they saw it that the attention of the Commonwealth Police was drawn to the matter- but that the Department is seen by members of the community to be one of the groups of people involved in the case. And that the head of the Department was photographed in the company of a senior policeman at the court hearing. This makes it very difficult for the people involved in this matter to accept that they will get an unbiased departmental investigation. I accept that these people may be completely wrong in thinking this, but it is a matter of appearances. I make no allegations against anyone in the Department. I make no assertion that anyone in the Department has done anything improper. In fact, they all may have at all times been doing their duty with the utmost probity. The facts are that it was the Department carrying out its duty in taking pensions away from people, it was the Department doing its duty to assess people receiving pensions, it was the Department doing its duty, as it considered it should have been done and as I accept that it should have been done, which drew the attention of the Commonwealth Police to this matter. It is very difficult to say to people who frequently have a low standard of education or who come from rural areas and do not understand our system that they should go to the Department and 'it will solve all your problems'. These people do not think that way and I do not think that under the same circumstances many other people in this country would think that way. I make no such assertion of malice. I merely point out the difficulties of investigating this case. Unless it is an independent investigation by the Parliament or the judiciary, then both the Department and the police are seen by the community to be involved. </para>

              <para>- I accept <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes's</inline> assertion that he is making no claim that any officer of the Department of Social Security has been guilty of malice. I accept that without reservation. I say to him that I also accept the difficulties that there are for people who do not share the same language with the officer in the Department with whom they are dealing. I should have said earlier, as I have said on other occasions, that it is the responsibility of my Department and others to see that those people who have come from another country and who do not share our language have available to them interpreters and others who are able to assist them in dealing as smoothly as possible with those who are seeking to serve them and to meet their needs. I accept what was said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes.</inline> I did not wish to impute to him any malicious motive in bringing forward on the number of occasions on which he has the matter of the association of my Department with this case. My Department is not the one that is laying the charges. My Department is the one that tests the eligibility of those who seek to receive pensions and benefits under the Social Services Act. </para>

There are no current plans to extend the present service at Katherine. </para>

            <para>Each case has to be considered on its own merits to determine whether its particular circumstances fall fairly within the relevent definition.

It is not necessary that both parties intend the relationship to be permanent. </para>

            <para>The article which appeared in the Brisbane <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Sun</inline> on 1 October 1978 was based on a News Release prepared by the Queensland office of my Department to highlight the continuing need for the employers to recruit and train apprentices to meet the future needs of industry. However, the wording of the first paragraph of the article did not form part of the Departmental News Release. Consequently, the wider connotations contained in the sentence quoted by the honourable senator do not represent the Government's view. </para>
            <para>Nevertheless, the Departmental News Release does constitute part of a continuing effort to create an awareness among employers of the urgent need to train more apprentices. This of course includes the provision of information to employers of the benefits available under the Commonwealth Rebate for Apprentice Full-time Training (CRAFT) Scheme. Under this Scheme, up to 30 September 1978, 2,500 Queensland employers had received rebates for releasing 3,500 apprentices to attend basic trade training at technical college in the 1 977 academic year. </para>

            <para>The article in the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Sun</inline> of 22 October 1978 is not correct and there is no loss of family allowances in the situation mentioned. </para>

            <para>Payments of family allowances therefore become due at the end of each endowment period but in order to avoid congestion at the banks one half of the mothers are paid a fortnight early (odd numbers) and the other half at the end of the period (even numbers).

However, had the Wyndham Office been maintained the rental was expected to increase quite sharply as existing accommodation is grossly inadequate and the space occupied was required by the State Government for their own purposes.

            <para>I wrote to the honourable senator on 21 November 1978 explaining the position. In brief, the answer as set out in the letter is- </para>
            <para>Occasional winnings such as those referred to are capital gains and are not income for unemployment benefit purposes. In determining income for unemployment benefit purposes under the Social Services Act, the emphasis is on payments of a periodic and more or less regular nature. The type of payments mentioned by the honourable senator would therefore not be treated as income. </para>
            <para>However, should a person be making a regular income from horse racing, Le., a professional punter, his winnings would be taken into account in assessing the rate of his unemployment benefit </para>

            <para>The Commonwealth and South Australia have accepted a preliminary draft substitute River Murray Waters Agreement as a basis for inter-governmental discussions on a new Agreement which, among other matters, would extend the powers of the River Murray Commission to take account of water quality. The draft is still under consideration by the New South Wales and Victorian Governments. I have, in fact, held discussions with the relevant New South Wales and Victorian Ministers on the need for early acceptance by their governments of the preliminary draft substitute Agreement, so that discussions might be commenced as soon as possible on a new Agreement and matching legislation. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>One of the purposes of my foreshadowing, on 8 June 1978, the introduction of a foreign tax credit system for the taxation of overseas earnings of Australian companies and individuals was to elicit comment and submissions from those who might be affected by the new system. After further consideration, and in the light of the large number of submissions that the Government received-on this proposal, it was decided not to proceed with the introduction of a foreign tax credit system. </para>
            <para>While the Government acknowledges that there are significant arguments- based on the need for the tax system to be equitable and neutral in its impact- for the introduction of a foreign tax credit system, it came to the view, after a detailed examination of all the submissions, that these benefits were outweighed by certain adverse consequences. Apart from the question of equity, another argument for the introduction of a credit system was that it would reduce opportunities for tax avoidance through the diversion of income to low or no tax countries. In this context, the Government is giving close attention to further measures specifically designed to reduce the scope for avoidance under the existing rules relating to taxation of earnings from international transactions. </para>

            <para>Essentially, what the honourable senator is suggesting is an extension, through the taxation system, of benefits available under what I might broadly call the Australian social welfare system. As to that, I have on a number of occasions expressed reservations as to the appropriateness and efficacy of turning to the taxation system as a channel for providing, indirectly, social welfare benefits. While I appreciate the purpose of the question, it prompts the same reservations and I simply say that I shall bear the suggestion in mind. </para>

        <para>Australian Canned Fruits Board operates on a calendar year basis. Financial statements and annual report are presented for tabling by the Board as soon as possible after the financial statements are considered by the Auditor General. In relation to the 1977 report the financial statements were approved on 2 1 July 1 978. </para>
        <para>Australian Dried Fruits Control Board. Although financial accounts are for the 12 months to 28 February 1977, the report is for the 12 months to 30 June 1977 and was presented within four months of the close of the report period. </para>
        <para>Australian Wine Board. Interim report tabled to comply with the Act because the final report was delayed by unavailability of audited consolidated accounts for the Board and the Australian Wine Centre, London. Delay in the availability final key production statistics also contributed to the late presentation of the final report. </para>
        <para>Australian Wheat Board operates on year ending 30 November. Report for year ending 30 November 1976 was delayed whilst awaiting Auditor-General's consideration of the financial statement. Interim report for year ending 30 November 1977 was tabled 7 June 1978 because accounts have not yet been finalised. </para>
        <para>Australian Dairy Corporation. Discussions on annual accounts with Auditor-General's Office proceeded from December 1977 until late January 1978. The approved accounts were forwarded to the Corporation by the Auditor-General on 28 February 1978. Printing of the final report was not completed until the end of April, 1978. </para>
        <para>Australian Honey Board. The financial statements of the Australian Honey Board were audited by the Auditor-General at the end of October 1977 and the Board then arranged for printing of the final Report. Printing was completed mid-December but as Parliament was then in recess the final Report could not be tabled until sittings resumed in February 1978. </para>
        <para>Australian Meat Board (Now Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation). Tabling of final report delayed by audit of financial statement which was first presented to Auditor-General in July, 1977. Financial statement approved by Auditor-General on 24 November 1977. As Parliament was then in recess final report could not be tabled until after sittings resumed in February 1978. </para>
        <para>Australian Wool Corporation. Presentation of the final report with audited accounts was delayed by the need for a number of changes in the format of accounts discovered in the course of the audit. Each of these changes entailed the process of formal approval as prescribed by statute and a recalculation of the relevant segments of the accounts. In addition, numerous comparative figures for the preceding financial year had to be re-calculated to conform with changes in the presentation of data. </para>

                <para>2 ) Under section 1 6 1 ( 1 ) of the Superannuation Act 1976 the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust (which came into being on 1 July 1976) is required, as soon as practicable after each 30 June, to prepare a report on the management of the Superannuation Fund by the Trust during the year ended on that day, together with financial statements in respect of that year in such form as the Minister approves, and furnish the report and financial statements to the Commissioner for Superannuation for transmission by him to the Minister along with the report the Commissioner for Superannuation is required to furnish under section 1 62 ( 1 ) of the Act Both reports are required to be tabled within IS sitting days of their receipt by the Minister. (3), (4) and (5) No annual reports of the Trust, containing audited financial statements, have yet been presented. However, an interim report by the Trust for 1976-77 was transmitted to the Acting Minister for Finance by the Acting Commissioner for Superannuation on 2 June 1978. That report was tabled on 7 June 1978. A final report for 1976-77, containing audited financial statements, is expected to be tabled early in the Autumn Sittings. It is expected that the Trust's report for 1977-78, containing audited financial statements, will also be tabled during those sittings. </para>

The Commission submitted the form of accounts to the Department of Finance on 7 June 1977 for approval of the Treasurer. Some time after this date the Auditor-General 's Office expressed opinions concerning certain aspects of the form of the accounts.

The delay in publishing the 1975-76 report i.e. the first report of the Capital Territory Health Commission, has been primarily due to the difficulties of establishing an agreed format for the financial statements. In November 1977, the Minister for Finance approved a format for the financial statements. With the resolution of that matter, draft accounts were prepared by the Capital Territory Health Commission in the early months of 1978 and the Commission understands that the audit is near completion. On completion of the audit for the 1975-76 financial statements the Commission's financial statements for 1976-77 will be forwarded to the Auditor-General 's Office for audit. </para>

            <para>- The Minister for Transport has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question: ( 1), (2) and (3) Regular Public Transport (RPT) services are operated by the licensed airlines as well as by other organisations operating scheduled services under the provisions of Air Navigation Regulation 203. Therefore the types of aircraft operating on RPT services in Australia range from a single engine light aircraft to the Boeing 747. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Aerodromes that these aircraft operate from include Government and licensed aerodromes, and Authorised Landing Areas (ALA). There are currently some 172 licensed aerodromes throughout Australia which are neither owned by the Department of Transport nor local authorities. Eighty-nine of these have scheduled air services by RPT aircraft. ALA's are operated by a variety of organisations and private individuals. Because of the wide diversity of ownership, no complete records are maintained of the scope and cost of past development works at these licensed aerodromes and ALA's. </para>
          <para>At most aerodromes in Australia the introduction of RPT aircraft has not necessitated any upgrading works to be undertaken either by the Commonwealth or private interests. In many cases an increased standard of facilities has been provided to permit a larger category of RPT aircraft to operate on particular networks. Such works could be carried out on ALA's without the necessity of advising my Department. </para>
          <para>If the honourable <inline font-weight="bold">Senator has</inline> some particular location in mind perhaps relevant information could be obtained for him. </para>

(a) and (b) The Department of Administrative Services has advised that Ministers travelling overseas on official business are not paid a travelling or subsistence allowance as such. They are paid an advance to meet official expenditure. This advance is acquitted on return to Australia and Ministers are required to repay any unspent amount. The advance may be calculated on an 'all-inclusive' or 'incidental' rate basis. </para>

          <para>Incidental' rate:  $40  per overnight stay. This is designed to cover minor official incidental expenditure only. (Accommodation and meals are met by overseas posts). The same rate is applied irrespective of whether a Minister is accompanied by spouse or not. </para>

            <para>The question as posed is unanswerable. Although the Corporation endeavours to dispose of its stocks on a firstin/firstout basis, this is frequently not possible. Commercial prudence requires sales to be made of types or categories demanded, and sales may have to be made frequently regardless of the time wool has been held in stock. </para>

        </list>
        <para pgwide="yes">The nature of identifying records would make it impracticable to trace the requisite data in respect of much wool already sold. Nevertheless, the table below provides a dissection of the present stockholding by age. </para>

        <para>Nevertheless, it is possible to provide, on a seasonal basis, the average purchase price and the average selling price of all stock traded by the Wool Commission/Corporation from 1 970-7 1 to 1 977-78. These prices are stated below. </para>
        <para>It should be noted that the average purchase price for any given year does not necessarily cover the same mix of wools as the average selling price for that year. Thus, for example, in 1974-75 and 1975-76, the Corporation purchased predominantly better-type wools while the bulk of its sales consisted of carding and crossbred wools. Hence the average selling price in those years was lower than the average purchase price. </para>

            <para>The strategic basis for the acquisition of FFG's remains substantially the same as outlined by the then Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Barnard)</inline> when he announced the intention to procure FFG's in April 1974. The FFG has a capability for conducting prolonged, independent patrol and surveillance operations in situations of relatively low level of threat, and combined with other forces would provide a valuable contribution to both the defensive and offensive capabilities of such forces in higher level situations. FFG's form part of a viable core force against longer term uncertainties. </para>

            <para>- The Prime Minister has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:  (1), (2) and (3) I have studied the answers given to the two questions and consider them to be accurate. I took no part in arranging the meeting to which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Viner</inline> referred in his reply of 8 November to the member for Lalor. That meeting took place on 24 August 1977, and at the time Stawell was not within my electorate. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I had no contact with Stawell Timber Industries Pty Ltd until I visited Stawell during the election campaign on 17 November last year. It was subsequent to that visit that I suggested to the company that it should get in touch with the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and that, through my Electorate Secretary, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs was approached on the matter. The response from the Department indicated that because of past performance, it might be unlikely that they would get further contracts for Aboriginal housing in the near future. </para>
          <para>As I said in Parliament on 9 November, after the redistribution placed the company in my electorate, I endeavoured to extend to the company what assistance I could by enquiring whether further contracts were likely to be extended to it, and suggesting that the company approach the Australian Industry Development Corporation and the Commonwealth Development Bank. More recently, I have discussed the matter with the Stawell Town Council and provided them with such relevant information as was publicly available. </para>
          <para>At no stage has the company received 'favourable treatment' from either the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs or myself. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>Does the Minister assert that the federalism policy means a more generous financial deal for the States than under the previous Labor Government? Secondly, given the fact that total Federal payments to the States increased by more than 58 per cent in constant value dollars in the period 1972 to 1975, can he guarantee that the total payments to the States in the next 3 years will increase, also in constant value dollars, by more than 58 per cent? </para>
          </quote>
          <para>The record shows that my answers to that question and to a follow-up question from </para>
          <para class="block">
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline>on the following day were plainly in terms of the prospective gains to the States under tax sharing arrangements, which comprised the main aspect of the Federalism policy then under discussion. I pointed this out in my response to a question without notice by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> on 19 August 1976. </para>
          <para>There are considerable complexities and difficulties in making estimates in real terms of payments in past years and more particularly in relation to the current financial year which is not yet half completed. However, I am advised that, on the basis of such rough estimates as can be made, the 'real' rate of increase in the tax sharing payments to the States from 1976-77 to 1978-79 would appear to be likely to be broadly of the same order of magnitude as the 'real' rate of increase in the financial assistance grants from 1973-74 to 1975-76 (an average real rate of increase of between 7 and 8 per cent per annum). </para>
          <para>Concerning total Commonwealth budget funds to the States (and again on the basis of rough estimates, because precision in these matters is not possible), the position is that the 'real' level of funds to the States has broadly been maintained notwithstanding the difficult economic circumstances which have prevailed. </para>
          <para>I stress that the broad trends need to be seen in context. The period 1973 to 1975 was characterised by rampant inflation which had dislocating effects on the economy and on the financial arrangements of businesses and governments alike. This Government's first priority has been to reduce inflation, and this has required restraining the growth of the public sector, curbing the budget deficit, and advocating restraint in wage rises before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. The States have benefited substantially from the success which we have achieved in this regard and will continue to benefit as inflation further declines and increased levels of economic activity are achieved. </para>
          <para>The States have fared relatively well in this period of financial stringency. Despite the difficult circumstances with which the Government has had to cope, we have broadly maintained the real level of total funds to the States. Moreover, the necessary restraint on funds to the States have not been unduly harsh as evidenced by the States' financial positions and the substantial tax concessions which they have made in their budgets over the last three years. </para>
          <para>It is also relevant that we have increased the relative importance of general purpose ('untied') funds thus providing the States with more independence and flexibility in the conduct of their own affairs. Commonwealth legislation to enable the States to increase their shares of personal income tax or to provide rebates to thenresidents will further enhance that flexibility. </para>
          <para>A further important development is the recent acceptance by the Loan Council, with Commonwealth support, of the new infrastructure borrowing guidelines. At its special meeting on 6 November the Loan Council approved projects brought forward under the guidelines covering all six States and providing a total infrastructure borrowing program of $l,767m over 8 years, commencing with borrowings of $158m this financial year. </para>

            <para>As has been indicated (House of Representatives <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> pp 1491-1492), the basis of the statement that unemployment would fall from February and continue to fall was forecast and available from the National Income Forecasting Committee Report, of October 1977. The statement was also consistent with the prospects for unemployment over the course of 1978 as outlined in Statement No. 2 attached to the 1 977-78 Budget Speech. </para>
            <para>The use of the term 'registered unemployment' does indicate that the numbers referred to the Commonwealth Employment Service figures. These figures, of course, are the numbers registered for employment with the CES- they do not measure unemployment directly, but do provide an indication of movement in unemployment. Although publication of seasonally adjusted CES registrants has been discontinued because of problems with reliable seasonal factors, the Committee had made its own allowance for purely seasonal factors to give some indication of the underlying trend in unemployment. </para>
            <para>Unemployment as measured by the Australian Bureau of Statistics monthly survey has fallen in every month except August and is now some 109,000 persons below the February level. The number of CES registrants is now S 1 ,000 below the February level. </para>

            <para>On 2 4 October the Minister told the Senate that the United Nations Secretariat was reviewing the size and composition of the proposed peace-keeping force for Namibia to which Australia has been asked to contribute. I ask the Minister was there a formal invitation to the Australian Government to contribute to that force? What contribution was sought from the Australian Government? Did the Government recently consider the request? If so, what decision did it reach? </para>

            <para>The Australian Government was approached informally by the UN Secretariat to make a contribution to the logistic component of the proposed United Nations Transitional Assistance Group in Namibia (UNTAG). </para>
            <para>As previously advised by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in a statement in the House of Representatives on 23 August 1978, the UN Secretariat originally indicated that it would like Australia to provide a transport company and communications unit, a movement control unit and a postal platoon. Following the review of the Secretariat's ouline of the plan in the light of South African objections to its proposed size and composition, it has been suggested that Australia might contribute instead an engineering unit and a maintenance unit. </para>
            <para>In the light of the South African Government's objections to certain aspects of the proposals for the implementation of the UN plan, and South Africa's decision to proceed with its own elections in Namibia in December, the question of the implementation of the plan is uncertain and the subject of further discussions between the South African Government and the UN Secretary-General. Against this background, the Australian Government is keeping the matter of Australia's possible contribution to a UN peace-keeping force under review. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>Whether he is aware of the present requirement of the Australian Passport Office that married women, when applying for a passport, provide evidence of change of name, usually in the form of a marriage certificate? Does the Minister agree that this procedure may be unduly onerous, if not discriminatory, particularly in cases where previous marriages have occurred? Would the Minister consider the possibility of amending the regulations to allow the option of issuing passports in the maiden name of the female applicant? </para>

            <para>I regret that the requirement for a married woman to produce her marriage certificate when applying for an Australian passport is sometimes construed as being onerous or discriminatory, and I cannot agree with such a claim. Every applicant for an Australian passport must produce documentary evidence of Australian citizenship. Where the passport application is made in a name other than that appearing in the evidence of citizenship (which is usually in the form of a birth certificate), further evidence of the change of name must be produced, whether it has been changed by marriage, re-marriage or deed poll. </para>
            <para>The honourable senator will be pleased to know that in accordance with our policy on women 's affairs, provisions have existed since 1976 whereby a married woman may request the issue of an Australian passport in her maiden name. The option therefore already exists for a passport to be issued to a woman in her maiden name or married name, and with the prefix <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs, Miss, Ms or</inline> none at all if she so requests. </para>
