      <para>THE  PRESIDENT-  I have to inform honourable senators that today, for the first time, a shorthand writing machine will be used to report the Senate.  A  recent vacancy for a reporter on the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff was advertised and the most eligible applicant was a machine writer. He was therefore appointed and will take his place on the reporting roster in the Senate this afternoon. </para>

            <para>- My question is addressed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate and follows a series of questions that have been asked by my Leader, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt,</inline> and me in the past few days. Is it a fact that the Budget allocation for capital works in 1978-79 is down? Is it a fact that Commonwealth and State capital works represent a smaller proportion of Budget outlays than for many years, yet in the Treasurer's letter of 12 October 1978 to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> and me he accepted that Government overseas borrowings have been higher than for many years and stated that these borrowings have been used for developmental purposes? Will the Minister defend the Government's position by enlightening the Senate about the nature of the capital works that have occurred as a result of these borrowings which would not have occurred otherwise and will not occur in the future? </para>

            <para>-Senator McAuliffe has asked a question in three parts. As to the precise question: 'Is it a fact that capital works for 1978-79 are down?', I take it that he meant relative to the previous year. I will get those figures and let the honourable senator know. I do not have in my memory a clear picture of that but I will get a general statement on what the capital works have been - </para>

              <para>-I will even turn to page 199 of the Budget Papers. That is also relevant to the second question. The overall relationship between the capital works that are going on in Australia and the loan funds raised either here or overseas is one of the details I have not got in my  mind. I will refer that matter to the Treasurer. I should add that the overall picture for Australia should include the new ventures into infrastructure financing which will be pan of a Loan Council meeting, I hope within a few weeks time. </para>

            <para>- My attention has been drawn to a statement made by the Chief Magistrate reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> yesterday. I have discussed the matter with officers of my Department. First of all let me say that the allegations in the broad terms made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Kilduff</inline> appear to me to be rather exaggerated. That is not to say that there are not problems that arise from time to time as a result of staff ceilings. However, the fact is that there is sufficient staff and accommodation for the five magistrates, which is the normal number provided. There are also two special magistrates. Probably there is sufficient staff to accommodate one more special magistrate sitting at the same time. However, naturally people are sick from time to time and problems can arise when a situation like that develops. However, there are usually ways and means of overcoming a temporary problem of that kind. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>We have looked at the matter that has been raised. There has been an increase this year of two in the staff ceilings. I might say that the arrangements for each magistrate provide for three staff to be present in court. I do not think it is always necessary that there ought to be three staff in court. On many occasions, of course, it would be necessary but on other occasions it may not be necessary to have three in attendance in the court. As I said, I think there are ways and means of overcoming these problems. Arrangements exist between the Chief Magistrate and my Department for consideration of administrative problems. A First Assistant Secretary in the Department and officers of his section are concerned with the administration of the courts in the Australian Capital Territory and regular meetings take place. In addition to that, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Mahoney,</inline> the  Deputy  Secretary of the Department, is also available for discussion with the magistrates. </para>
          <para>I have asked <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Mahoney,</inline> the  Deputy  Secretary who is concerned with this area, to have discussions with the Chief Magistrate and the other magistrates to endeavour to ascertain whether changes could be made in the sitting arrangements of the magistrates and perhaps staff arrangements as well to service them. As I said, there are five magistrates and two special magistrates in the Australian Capital Territory. I have set in train the appointment of an additional special magistrate. It is a question sometimes of how many magistrates sit on a particular day. On the one hand, if one or two special magistrates sit in addition to the five magistrates of course there could be difficulties. On the other hand, magistrates do not all sit every day. I think some changes could be made, as I have said, in the sitting arrangements of the magistrates themselves. I have asked <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Mahoney</inline> to discuss these questions with the Chief Magistrate. However, as I said at the beginning of my answer, I think the problems are ones that can be overcome and I think it is exaggerating matters to say that as a result of the situation there is a decline in the quality of justice. </para>

I am not aware of any degeneration or difficulty in the relationships among South Pacific countries. I am aware that Australia's relationships with those countries in the immediate past has been excellent, and I take that from direct statements that have been made to me by leaders of those countries. Nevertheless, since the question has been raised I will invite the responsible Minister in another place to respond. </para>

I understand that this device is designed to restore engine performance which automobiles lose as the result of pollution controls and is claimed to boost engine performance by 25 per cent and petrol mileage by some 10 per cent as well as reducing automobile emission by between 50 per cent and 90 per cent. I ask the Minister whether he and his Department have investigated this device and these claims. If so, does he consider that it should be installed in all Australian vehicles to reduce the drain on our energy resources? </para>

            <para>-The statement to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Coleman</inline> has referred was, I think, a report of a speech that I made at about that time in relation to the question of the establishment of a human rights commission for Australia. The position is that earlier this year a  Deputy  Secretary in my Department, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bailey,</inline> was given the task of conducting discussions with officers in the States about the possibility of their participation in a human rights commission which would be a co-operative arrangement between the Commonwealth and the States. The Senate will recall that my predecessor introduced a Bill to set up a human rights commission which would have been confined to the Commonwealth area. When, earlier this year, I received some indication that it might be possible to involve the States in this exercise, with the concurrence of the Government I delayed proceeding with that legislation in an effort to explore fully this possibility of involving the States. The question was discussed at the last meeting of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General in Darwin. It seemed from that discussion that there was value in the discussions that were being held by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bailey</inline> and that something positive might well come out of them. I have since been advised by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bailey</inline> that his discussions have proceeded since that meeting, which was in July, and that further developments have taken place. I have received reports and had discussions with him as to what form this arrangement with the States may take. It is hoped that there will be a further meeting of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General next month, at which a special time will be set aside for a discussion on the progress in this matter. We are tentatively looking at a date about the middle of November, but I cannot be definite yet. All I can say is that these discussions have proceeded in a promising way. </para>

          <para>I cannot say with whom <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bailey</inline> has been conducting his discussions in Western Australia; but, of course, the Attorney-General for Western Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Medcalf,</inline> was at the meeting of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General in Darwin and presumably will be at the next meeting which we hope to set up next month. The probabilities are that there will be complementary legislation if this scheme eventuates; but at this stage it is really too early to give any further details to the Senate. </para>

Is the Minister aware that the current problem has its sources in a four-year ban on the export of live cattle which has been imposed by the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union? Is the Minister aware that live cattle have been loaded and shipped from Queensland recently under an arrangement reached by the AMIEU and the Cattlemen's Union? Since it is clearly possible to reach agreement with the union to ship live cattle, what action does the Government intend to take? Is the Minister aware that there is currently a 24-hour stoppage in meat works in Queensland as a result of an attempt by the livestock agent concerned to ship cattle outside the agreement, which clearly has serious implications for Queensland? In view of the importance of our beef export trade- live and otherwise- to Australia, but particularly to Queensland, and in view of the fact that this dispute is four years old, what action does the Government intend to take to try to overcome the difficulties with that union? </para>

            <para>- Actually, the question comes within the ambit of a number of Ministers, including the Minister for Transport, but I will respond in general terms and then, if it is necessary, get more specific information. I think it is reasonable to say that the relationships between the Government and the Australian Council of Trade Unions over the years have been very good indeed and that the Government would want those relationships to be good. My understanding, which is subject to correction, of the ACTU Jetset Travel Service Pty Ltd incident is that in the first instance the Minister wrote to the Managing Director or responsible officer of that calibre in the ACTU pointing out the difficulties and problems and that the subsequent procedures were in no way, in the melodramatic sense reported in the Press, a raid or anything of that nature. As far as I understand, they were the normal procedures under the regulations. A public servant and a Commonwealth police officer called to deliver some papers which asked for certain information. As I understand the position legally, these are procedural matters and are done in this way. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I stress that my advice is that there was in no sense a raid; there was in no sense a forcible entry; and there was in no sense the seizing of material in any way. Under the legal requirements-as has been done, so I am instructed, in six other instances regarding travel agencies and this kind of problem- there was the delivery of a paper which set out the information that was requested. If, when I have looked at the full substance of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop's</inline> question, there are further matters that need to be answered, I will respond. If there are any unwitting inaccuracies on my part I will happily respond. </para>

What I have said is that I believe it desirable at all times that the relationship between the Government and the Australian Council of Trade Unions be as good as possible. I am not instructed that there was any departure from that situation. If there had been any departure I have no doubt that the Minister in another place would have commented on it. However, that is not the advice I have. The advice I have is that there had been communication and that what happened was the normal process of serving a paper requesting certain information and papers. </para>

            <para>- I ask the Minister for Education: Is the basis for the abolition of fees for tertiary education at least in part a desire to make such education more accessible to the socially and economically disadvantaged? If so, is the Minister aware of a national study recently carried out which has shown that the abolition of tertiary fees has largely failed to achieve its objective? Is the Minister able to advise us what further study will be necessary and how long it might take before a reliable judgment on this matter can be made? Finally, if the study is confirmed, is he able to say whether examination of alternative propositions is anticipated which might more effectively open up to students from a wide variety of social and economic backgrounds the whole field of tertiary education? </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">- Senator Baume</inline>raises a very interesting, complex series of questions. The basic principle of this Government and, I am sure, of all governments, is to provide equality of opportunity for all. That means that one must look at the socio-economic structure of those seeking education. It is, I would imagine, part of that principle of equality of opportunity that led to the abolition of fees, that led to the development of scholarships and bursaries and then to the stucture of the Tertiary Education Assistance scheme, as such. </para>

          <para>I am aware of the report in which I think Donald Anderson had a major part. I have read the report and have put it aside for further study. On the surface, it indicates- but this is a simplistic conclusion- that in the years that followed the abolition of fees, there has been no major apparent change in the socio-economic structure of those in tertiary institutions. My own reading of the report suggested a number of things, but a rereading of it may suggest more. I think the period to which the report has been directed has been altogether too short. It will also be found that there are qualifications in the report. Therefore, I do not think the conclusion can be drawn that one should revert from the current situation because the present structure has not achieved its purpose. I think the report makes other claims. </para>
          <para>The question of achieving equality of opportunity inside education lies not only with fees or allowances: It lies also, of course, with our moving Australian families as far as we can up the socio-economic scale in terms of standards of living so that their conditions are conducive to further study for the young. That is our aim. </para>

            <para>- I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Transport. Since the presentation of the statement on Australia's 'International Civil Aviation Policy' by the Minister for Transport last week, has the Minister's attention been drawn to the following: Firstly, claims by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Freddie</inline> Laker that the Minister for Transport has deliberately distorted his Skytrain proposals; secondly, the suggestion that cheaper air fares will not be available to Australian travellers before Christmas 1979; thirdly, the possibility that airlines such as JAT, KLM and UTA will be forced off the EuropeAustralia run; fourthly, the suggestion that Australia-United Kingdom flights will be reduced from 1 7 to seven a week ex-Sydney and from 17 to five a week ex-Melbourne; and, fifthly, the generally-held editorial view that the announcement serves only to protect and to featherbed Qantas to the financial detriment of Australian travellers and potential tourists coming to Australia? In the light of these serious allegations, can the Minister say whether any of these allegations are true? To allow the Parliament to examine these matters in more detail, will the Minister press to ensure that debate on the Minister's statement is brought forward in the Parliament with the minimum degree of delay? </para>

            <para>-Although I had not seen all of the allegations which are referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Puplick</inline> in his question I had seen some of them. He did indicate to me that he wanted to get some detailed response on the matters which he had just mentioned in his question. The general answer to those questions is, I think, no, the allegations are not true. But to answer them in more detail and in accordance with information I have obtained from the Minister for Transport: Firstly, the Minister has not deliberately distorted <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Freddie</inline> Laker's proposals. In the first instance, these proposals were not for a Skytrain such as he operates between London and New York. Skytrain is a scheduled service offering one class of standby fare. The Laker Airways proposal made to the Government was for a nonscheduled or charter operation of two DC 10 services per week with advanced booking conditions. The proposal was to operate these services between London/Luxembourg and Sydney or Melbourne. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The second question related to a claim that cheaper air fares will not be available to Australian travellers before Christmas 1979. The Government is pressing ahead to have cheaper air fares introduced on as many routes as possible in the first quarter of next year, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nixon</inline> told the Parliament last week. He said he hoped to be in a position to make a further announcement by Christmas this year, not Christmas next year, but that this must necessarily depend upon the consent of other governments. The third question related to whether the Yugoslav, Netherlands and French airlines would be forced off Europe- Australia run. The Minister for Transport has said repeatedly that the intention is that discussions should be held with other countries in Europe apart from the United Kingdom, and his statement last week made it plain that it was hoped to do this quickly. Those discussions will be aimed at ways of maintaining direct air services, but also will wish to take account of the policy objectives the Government outlined last week and the Australian Government's interest in securing lower fares on those routes. </para>
          <para>The fourth question suggested that flights to the United Kingdom would be reduced from 1 7 to seven per week from Sydney and from 17 to five per week from Melbourne. This is, I am pleased to inform honourable senators, quite untrue. While discussions with the United Kingdom remain to be finalised, as the Minister for Transport made quite clear last week the discussions that have been held to date were predicated on British Airways and Qantas Airways Ltd between them providing 10 services per week from each of Melbourne and Sydney to London. The last question said that we are aiming to featherbed Qantas and this would be to the detriment of Australian travellers and potential tourists. These comments reflect little understanding of the Government's intention. Indeed, the announced indicative fare levels for London from eastern Australia indicate the very significant fare savings that we believe can be made. Secondly, and most importantly, these fare reductions are offered while at the same time regular services offering travel for those members of the public who wish to travel quickly or at short notice are retained. It is of little value to a businessman or to a person wishing to visit a sick relative in the United Kingdom to have to wait 2 1 or 45 days to get a service. The report of the review committee made very clear the interrelationship between the supply of different classes of air services. The honourable senator's attention in this respect is particularly directed to annexure E of the committee's report which attempts to quantify the scheduling implications for alternative policy course. </para>
          <para>I would draw his attention to the section in the statement appearing at page 19 which showed that the Government carefully considered whether arrangements would lead to inefficiencies in the production and distribution of air travel. In particular I would ask him to note the measures the Government has said it will take in future and importantly to note that the Government is to review its single designation policy in 1981. The principal limitation to moving away from that policy at this stage was the size of existing markets. The Government hopes that the measures it is seeking to put into effect will encourage travel growth and expand markets very rapidly. Certainly a reduction of nearly $300 in the lowest available individual fare between eastern Australia and London cannot be held to be to the detriment of Australian travellers or the attraction of tourists to Australia. Finally, I will consult the Leader of the Government in the Senate on the timetable for debate on the statement, which obviously is of considerable interest to honourable senators. </para>

            <para>- My question without notice is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I refer to the growing practice of prepared questions and answers of Government senators, which abuses the principle of questions without notice and I specifically draw the Minister's attention to the disgraceful incident on the last sitting day in the Senate last week involving the publication of a private and personal letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Everingham</inline> to the  Chairman  of the Northern Land Council, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Yunupingu,</inline> and the same incident taking place almost simultaneously in the House of Representatives, all of which showed a degree of organisation.

Will he take steps to ensure that the proper principle of questions without notice is adhered to by Government senators? Will he give an assurance that this despicable breach of principle and confidentiality is not repeated in the Senate? </para>

I for one would not object- I never do object- to an approach by any honourable senator, Labor or Government, asking sincerely for information. I think it is our job to give the information, if we can, and to give it in good detail, if we can. We will try to do so, as we have done in the past. </para>

            <para>- I understand that on 24 May the Minister for Health announced that the Commonwealth Government would negotiate with the States measures directed to achieving increased hospital productivity, efficiency and cost containment. Subsequently, with the agreement of State Health Ministers, Commonwealth and State officials have discussed these and other measures suggested by State officials. The purpose of these discussions was to have the measures and their implications fully explored. The discussions were held against the background that all Health Ministers share a concern about the growth in hospital costs. No decision in relation to the introduction of any proposals has been taken by the Government, but I anticipate that it will be considering some proposals in the near future. Until decisions are taken and announced, any reports of the kind appearing in the Hobart <inline font-style="italic">Mercury</inline> are pure conjecture. </para>

              <para>- I wish to ask a supplementary question. Will the Minister, in his research, have a look at the dialogue, as recorded in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> between <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland and me and his predecessor when that Minister gave partial promises that he would look at the matter? To me the word 'partial ' signified that the Minister was rather sympathetic to the suggestion. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Post and Telecommunications. It concerns the recent change of government in Sweden. Has the Centre Party in Sweden been thrown out of office by the Social Democrats on a pro-uranium issue? Does this mean there is now in office in Sweden a predominantly Labour government dedicated to making Sweden the world's most advanced nation in harnessing nuclear fission? Is it a fact that the Australian Broadcasting Commission has not reported any of these events? Can the Minister say whether it is true that the newscasters of the ABC and the producers of the ABC commentary sessions such as <inline font-style="italic">AM</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">PM</inline> have in fact refused to report these events? </para>

            <para>- My attention has been drawn to a recent article in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Sun News-Pictorial</inline> which does suggest that there has been a complete reversal of the policy of the Swedish Government with respect to the development of nuclear power. It is further suggested in that article that that radical turnaround has not been remarked upon by the Australian Broadcasting Commission. I am afraid that my study of what has been happening in Sweden is very small indeed and I am not in a position to confirm the facts which have been indicated by the honourable senator. I must say with some trepidation that the extent to which I listen to the ABC has become fairly limited so I cannot even confirm whether it has been covering the Swedish position. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>However, I think it is a matter of some interest. I shall make some inquiries about the matter raised by the honourable senator. I am sure that if the Swedish Government has seen fit to make such a radical change in policy it will be of interest to the Australian people and is a matter which I think they would wish to see publicised. </para>

Has the Minister's attention been drawn to reports in yesterday's Brisbane <inline font-style="italic">Telegraph</inline> that a Liberal Federal Minister and a Liberal back bench member of the House of Representatives declared a holiday for the Everton Park State Primary School in Brisbane? Has the Minister's attention also been drawn to the comment from the Queensland Education Department that Federal members of Parliament, including Cabinet Ministers, had no right to go around handing out holidays to Queensland school children? In view of the distress caused to pupils and the relief of many mothers when the holiday did not eventuate yesterday, will the Minister lay down guidelines to his Liberal colleagues in relation to the granting of such holidays? </para>

            <para>- The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, whom I represent, is aware of the matters raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen.</inline> They involve a claim by the building industry unions that their members employed by some contractors at the Altona oil refinery site of Petroleum Refineries Australia work a 35-hour week. Employees of the contractors went on strike in support of the 35-hour week. The matter was referred to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission but due to some jurisdiction limitations the Commission was prevented from arbitrating on the matter. Subsequently, several employer organisations representing other employers agreed to arrangements, which included the 35 hour week, to enable the work to resume and the job to be completed. However, Barnard Bros refused to be part of that arrangement. Those are the circumstances to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> referred. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Certainly the Government is very concerned about any sweetheart arrangements of that kind that are made in circumstances revealed by this situation. However, as I have said, the circumstances seem to be outside the jurisdiction of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. The Government believes, of course, that that is the proper forum for the consideration of claims for reduced hours of work and is opposed to attempts by industrial pressure to achieve a shorter working week outside the arbitration system. However, I will refer to the Minister the specific question raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen.</inline></para>

              <para>- At that meeting there was a considerable airing of the difficulties faced by some people living in remote areas. Although that seems to cause some hilarity opposite, for reasons I do not understand, there are in fact Australians living 20 or 30 miles from their nearest neighbour, often in quite difficult climatic conditions and of recent years in conditions of considerable economic difficulty. The fact is that the mail services available to those people have tended to diminish in recent years, in part because of the lessening population and in part, I suppose, because of the greatly increased cost of doing almost anything. I am aware that these difficulties exist. They are matters which have been the subject of representations to the Minister and they are matters which I think are currently receiving Government attention. I am not aware of any specific measures that are available to provide assistance to those families which are particularly reliant on the mails for providing education for their children. That is a matter  which I will take up with the responsible Minister, who already administers extensive programs of assistance for education in remote areas. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. Will the Primary Industry Bank of Australia Ltd be funded by $30m at 5 per cent from income equalisation deposits and $50m borrowed from the public at 10 per cent or less- that is, at an average of less than 8 per cent? Will the money be lent out at a minimum of 101/2 per cent interest? Finally, how will the Bank's profits be distributed or will the potential profit be grabbed up by the superfluous administrators and bureaucracy associated with the Bank? </para>

            <para>At a press conference in Sydney today <inline font-weight="bold">Mr John</inline> C. Frearson, General Manager of the Primary Industry Bank of Australia Limited outlined the Bank's Lending Policies. </para>

            <para>
              <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Frearson</inline>said that the Bank's funds would generally be available for the refinancing of loans to persons engaged, or intending to be engaged, in primary production including fishing and forestry operations, in Australia. He stressed that participation by lenders would be spread as widely as possible. </para>
            <para>
              <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Frearson</inline>emphasised that the Bank had been established with a view to increasing the availability of longer term loan funds for purposes of primary production. This would be accomplished initially through the banking system and later through wider financing avenues. The Commonwealth Development Bank will have early access to the refinance facilities provided. </para>
            <para>Refinance loans will be available for periods from 8 to 30 years appropriate to the life of the assets being financed in all cases. In refinancing machinery and equipment the Bank will have regard to the normal depreciation periods used by the Commissioner of Taxation. </para>
            <para>
              <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Frearson</inline>outlined some of the purposes for which Bank refinancing would be available. These include- purchase of rural land acquired for primary production; assistance in holding together a rural enterprise, e.g. where death of a proprietor creates financing difficulties; capital expenditure involving fixed and structural improvements including farm buildings, fencing and pasture improvement; recovery from flood, fire, drought, plague and any other major adversity or to mitigate the effects of future such adversities, including re-establishment of pastures and water conservation, not covered by the provision of any natural disaster recovery scheme; purchase of fishing vessels and facilities, machinery and farm equipment and stock; expansion of existing farm development and fishing projects; refinancing, in appropriate cases of existing debt (particularly short term debt), and/or the rearrangement of existing borrowings in times of special need. </para>
            <para class="block">
              <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Frearson</inline>said that for the time being minimum loan amount for refinancing by the Bank would be $ 10,000 with a preferred maximum loan of $250,000. He stated that the Bank would be prepared to consider larger loan amounts in special circumstances. </para>
            <para>In response to a question, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Frearson</inline> said that the loan repayment programme by end borrowers would commence as soon as practicable after the loan was made. But that provision was included for variation to programmes in special circumstances, e.g. during the initial non-income-earning period of a new project or to meet the genuine needs arising from adverse circumstances. He said that these cases will be considered by the Bank on an individual basis. </para>
            <para>
              <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Frearson</inline>expects that the Bank will be open to receive refinance loan applications from the banking system within the next 3 to 4 weeks. </para>
            <para>He forecast that the Bank would be seeking funds from the fixed term securities market early in the new year. This will give the public the opportunity to invest in the new Bank. </para>

            <para>- I understand that officers from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation Division of Animal Health and the Victorian Department of Agriculture laboratories at Atwood, which is very near where I live, are collaborating in a large field trial to evaluate a serological test known as the indirect haemolysis test or IHLT as the honourable senator mentions, for use in the brucellosis eradication campaign. I understand that results from the trial to date indicate that technically in Victoria the test may be as good as the accepted definitive test currently in use- that is, the complement fixation test or CFT- and that it may be more effective in differentiating animals vaccinated with brucellosis strain 19 from brucellosis infected animals. This could be of some importance as the campaign in Australia proceeds. However, I understand there is a reluctance to use the new tests in the middle of a full-scale eradication campaign. The existing CFT test has an excellent reputation. It is an excellent test which is accepted internationally and it has been proved under field conditions. Unfortunately it is a fairly intricate test and very time-consuming as the honourable senator knows. The greatest practical advantage of the new test may be its simplicity of operation and reduction in costs. At this stage IHLT has been trialled widely in only Victoria but the Queensland Department of Primary Industries also will be looking closely at the test. In summary, considerable field work under different management systems will be required before any decision can be made to replace the present CF test with the IHL test which the honourable senator mentioned. </para>

            <para>- I do not doubt that saying there has been a decline in the quality of justice is a serious charge and because that claim was made by the Chief Magistrate I made it my business to inform myself about the matter. Of course, I have discussions from time to time about these questions with officers of the Department, but having gone into the matter it seems to me that it was an exaggeration to say that there was a decline in the quality of justice because of the nature of the staffing difficulties that had arisen. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ryan</inline> has asked me about delays in the magistrates' courts. No complaints have been made to me recently about delays in the courts. I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Kilduff</inline> has said that on some occasions magistrates have not been able to sit because of the staff problems. If those problems have arisen naturally there would be delay in those cases, but when one talks about delays in court one is really talking about a much wider and more serious problem. As far as that is concerned, I have appointed a special magistrate in recent months and I have set in train the appointment of another special magistrate. I am not aware of any claim that there ought to be more magistrates. I will make inquiries to answer the question that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ryan</inline> has raised. I think that the problems that have been indicated are capable of resolution with the existing number of magistates and within the staff allocation to the magistrates 'courts. </para>

            <para>- A number of quite significant initiatives has been taken in the field of media education. I could refer at the outset to the Schools Commission which has shown an interest in a number of ways. It has shown interest in two main ways. In research in collaboration with the Australia Council it has sponsored a national study of education and the arts, including media education. The study was conducted by national and State committees and its findings are reported in a document entitled Education and the Arts. Secondly, I refer to special projects of the Schools Commission in which a number of media education projects have been funded through the Special Projects (Innovation) Program, through the Disadvantaged Schools Program and through the Disadvantaged Country Areas Program. I refer also to the Curriculum Development Centre, which is involved in a project to organise the exchange of State media materials. The CDC is beginning to catalogue all material available in the States and to co-ordinate the production and exchange of this material. The CDC also has funded two small mass media projects. One is a tape-slide set showing the importance of mass media education in schools. This has not yet been published. It was organised through the Catholic Education Office in Sydney. The other project involved teaching modules on different aspects of media education. This is being produced through the South Australian Education Technology Centre. </para>

If a decision has not yet been taken, will the Minister undertake to have discussions with the AWU in South Australia at the earliest opportunity in the interests of industrial harmony? </para>

            <para>- The Government shares the concern for lower interest rates and has directed its economic policies to lowering inflation so as to permit sustainable reductions in interest rates. This process is well under way. Decelerating inflation has been followed by lower interest rates as market conditions permit. For example, the Government long term bond rate has fallen by 1 <inline font-style="italic">Vi</inline> per cent over the last year. That is very significant. The interest rate on housing finance has fallen, giving savings of around $9 a month on an average savings bank loan. The interest rate on small trading bank loans was lowered early in the term of the Government and has stayed at a relatively low rate, in the circumstances, of 10½ per cent. The cost of borrowing from finance companies has been falling recently. The Government's policies will continue to be directed towards sustainable lower rates as circumstances permit. There is wide confidence that further progress will occur in the period ahead. </para>

          <para class="block">Sibraa asked me a question relating to the Fiji delegation to the South Pacific Conference. In fact, I had the information here and should have been able to render it. I think that it is important. My advice is that the Fiji delegation to the South Pacific Conference last week criticised Australia for not having sent, in its judgment, a sufficiently senior delegation to Noumea to enable it to take decisions without referring them back to Canberra. I am advised that in the two instances referred to by Fiji there were good reasons for referring the matters concerned back to Canberra. In the first instance, accession of any state- in this case, Tuvalu- to the Canberra agreement affects Australia's treaty relationships and is, therefore, a matter for decision by the Foreign Minister himself. In the second instance, a draft resolution on civil aviation, the subject matter was connected with a major statement on civil aviation which the Minister for Transport was to make that day in Canberra. It was necessary to ensure that the resolution which Australia was being asked to support was not inconsistent with the Minister's statement. In these circumstances the delegation was quite correct in referring the two matters back to Canberra for consideration. It did so not because the delegation was not sufficiently senior but because the particular matters needed to be considered in Canberra by relevant Ministers. </para>

          <para class="block">Dear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt,</inline></para>
          <para>I refer to your questions, asked of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> in the Senate on 27 and 28 September, concerning the amount of overseas borrowings undertaken by the Commonwealth since this Government came to office and the extent of the exchange losses incurred. </para>
          <para>Attached for your information is a table listing all Commonwealth overseas borrowings since December 1975, including relevant interest rates and periods to maturity. As you will see, the table includes a Y50 billion public issue with a maturity of 12 years and an interest rate of 6.6 per cent, undertaken in February this year, to which you specifically referred in your question. The approximate Australian dollar equivalent of the principal amount of the loan (using the exchange rate supplied by the Reserve Bank at the time proceeds were received) was $A1 84.0m. </para>
          <para>I would point out that while it is possible to make an assessment of paper exchange gains or losses at a point in time, it is of little consequence as these calculations fluctuate from day to day with movements in exchange rates. Actual loss or gain is not known until the loan is eventually repaid. </para>
          <para>In this regard, it is relevant that the present Government 's policy, as has been the policy of past Governments, is for overseas borrowings to cover a wide range of separate international capital markets. This effectively allows the Government to spread its risks across various currencies and smoothes out the possible long term effects. </para>
          <para>In a question asked of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> in a similar vein to yours, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McAuliffe</inline> was concerned with the limited recourse to borrowings in US dollars compared with other currencies. I point out here that the Commonwealth has borrowed substantially in US dollars in recent years- between June 1976 and 1978 the proportion of the Commonwealth's borrowings denominated in US dollars has risen from 4 1 per cent of outstanding debt to 5 1 per cent. </para>
          <para>In regard to the overall level of overseas borrowing undertaken by this Government, there has been a marked expansion in recent years. In 1977-78, gross overseas borrowings by the Commonwealth totalled $ 1,764m, compared with $458m in 1976-77 and $276m in 1974-75-on present indications, the level of the Commonwealth 's overseas borrowings will again be substantial in 1978-79. This increased borrowing program reflects the Commonwealth's policy of attracting sufficient overseas capital, on both private and public account, to supplement resources available to this country for development purposes and to maintain the level of international reserves. This has been an essential element in the Government's ability to maintain the value of the Australian dollar. </para>
          <para>Australia's outstanding official overseas debt is, however, still low by both historical and international standards. At 30 June 1978 (the latest date for which national income data is available), Australia's outstanding overseas debt of $3,635m represented approximately 4.0 per cent of GDP in 1977-78; our recently announced borrowings in relation to this financial year would probably increase that figure slightly. In 1966-67, the corresponding proportion was 6.5 per cent. </para>
          <para>Due regard has been paid to debt management considerations in selecting maturities for the loans undertaken, and care is taken to ensure that the pattern of repayments does not result in undue commitments in respect of any one year. </para>
          <para>I trust these comments are of benefit to you in understanding this Government's policy in respect of the Commonwealth's loan raisings. </para>
          <para>I am providing a copy of this letter to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McAuliffe</inline> for his information. Yours sincerely, </para>

The article refers to a motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ryan</inline> to disallow the Australian Capital Territory Termination of Pregnancy Ordinance and implies that the aim of this disallowance is to establish private abortion clinics. Quite apart from the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ryan's</inline> motion does not do that and is not intended to allow the establishment of such clinics, I have not expressed my views publicly or privately on this issue anywhere. Therefore, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hodgman</inline> 's statement is not based on anything he has heard or read. In fact, I am very much opposed to the establishment of such clinics in the Australian Capital Territory or anywhere else. That <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hodgman</inline> makes such claims without evidence is, I believe, understandable and occurs only too often, but that a newspaper claiming to be responsible should make such statements without checking with me or on the authenticity of the statements is unfortunate. </para>

            <para>- by leave- In August I tabled in the Senate the report prepared by the </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Schools Commission in response to the Government 's funding guidelines for the 1 979-8 1 rolling triennium which I announced on 9 June. The Commission's report contained financial recommendations for 1979 only at this stage. I am now announcing the Government's decisions on these recommendations. Decisions on funding for 1980 and 1981 will be taken by the Government following public discussion of a number of issues relating to the funding of schools. </para>
          <para>The guidelines provided by the Government asked the Commission to recommend programs in 1979 which are one per cent higher in real terms than in 1978. The entire base programs will be adjusted to price levels obtaining in December 1978. The largest component of these programs, wages and salaries, will also be fully supplemented for cost increases during 1979. The Government's expenditure program for schools in 1979 amounts to $63 1.6m in estimated December 1977 cost levels. Government schools will receive $360. 2m, and non-government schools $245.3m, while $26. lm is to be shared jointly between government and non-government sectors. Details of funding for individual programs in each State are shown in the table that follows. The Government has taken its decisions on the basis of the allocations recommended by the Schools Commission and has accepted all of the recommended allocations, with one adjustment to which I will refer later. The Government's decisions provide for the continuation of all existing programs for government and non-government schools, and of all existing joint programs. In addition, they provide for new initiatives in a number of areas. </para>
          <para>I deal first with general resources programs for government schools. The allocations the Government has approved provide $ 182.6m for general recurrent grants and $ 129.4m for capital grants for government schools in the States. These compare with amounts of $180. 7m and $139.4m in 1978. Notwithstanding the facts that most States have achieved the Karmel resource use targets ahead of schedule and that total enrolments will be falling from 1979, the Commonwealth has more than maintained, in real terms, its support for recurrent resources in government schools, while some reduction has occurred in the capital balance. It should be noted that the balance between recurrent and capital allocations recommended by the Schools Commission took account of the wishes of each of the State Governments. Since the Schools Commission's report was made public, the Queensland Government has made a supplementary request that an amount of $3. 1 m should be transferred within its allocations from general capital to general recurrent. The Government has accepted this request. Subject to this adjustment, the Government's allocations are in agreement with the Commission's recommendations. </para>
          <para>For non-government schools in the States, the Government has allocated $200. 8m for general recurrent grants and $30.4m for capital grants in 1979. These compare with allocations of $ 186.8m and $3 1.4m in 1978. The increase of $14m in general recurrent grants reflects the Government's policies of automatically linking per capita grants to non-government schools to average costs in government schools and of taking another step in raising, by 1980, the base level per capita grant to all non-government schools to 20 per cent of the cost of educating a pupil in a government school. It also demonstrates the Government's recognition of the serious needs of level 6 low resource schools reported by the Commission in its April report. The Government has provided for level 6 schools increases in grants of $5 per primary pupil and $6 per secondary pupil, in addition to the increases from the automatic linkage. Indeed, more than 70 per cent of the total increase in per capita grants to non-government schools in 1979 will go to level 6 schools. The per capita rates to apply in 1 979 together with existing 1978 grants, in estimated March 1978 prices, are shown in a table, which I seek leave to have incorporated <inline font-style="italic">in Hansard.</inline></para>

              <para>- Non-government general recurrent grants for 1979 will continue to be distributed in the same manner as in 1 978. Funding for capita] projects in non-government schools in 1979 will be $lm less than in 1978, although, as recommended by the Commission, the 1978 initiative of providing funds to assist building programs in newly expanding areas of population will be maintained. On the advice of the Commission, the Government has also decided to alter the conditions applying to short term emergency assistance grants to non-government schools catering for students from the country. In 1978 these grants were restricted to non-systemic schools on the basis that block funding arrangements for systems would provide flexibility to allow emergency situations to be met. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Situations have arisen, however, where systems have been unable to respond to an emergency in one school without serious aggravation to other schools in the system. The Government has therefore decided to amend the conditions to reinclude systemic schools in 1979. It has also extended the conditions to permit the making of grants where a school catering for country students finds itself in an emergency situation for reasons not directly related to those enrolments, but from which, if emergency assistance was not provided, there would be adverse consequences to country students at the school. The funds available for these grants will be $545,000 as in 1978. </para>
          <para>The funds which the Government is providing also include increases in programs for migrant and multi-cultural education. Earlier this year, the Government adopted the recommendations of the Galbally Committee report on post-arrival services to migrants. Flowing from this decision the Schools Commission programs for next year include increases in funding totalling Sim to government and non-government schools, mainly for the teaching of English as a second language. This is the first instalment in a program to provide an additional $ 10m over the next three years. These funds are distributed so as to reflect the needs of children of non-English speaking background in different areas. Additionally and also arising from the Galbally Report, the Government has accepted the Commission's recommendation that a new joint program should be established with funding of $5m over three years for multi-cultural education. In 1979 an amount of $500,000 will be provided, which will be concentrated mainly on stimulating the teaching of community languages in schools. An expert committee, with ethnic representation, is advising the Government, through the Commission, on how these funds should be used. </para>
          <para>The Government has decided, on the recommendation of the Commission, that the special purpose programs for special education and disadvantaged schools should continue at their present levels in 1979. The distribution of funds within the joint programs proposed by the Commission has also been accepted. These allocations mean there will be increases of $399,000 in the disadvantaged country areas program and $75,000 in the children in institutions program in 1979. The services and development program, including schools travel and exchange and education centres, will be reduced by $349,000 to $ 15.8m and the special projects, innovations, program by $525,000 to $3.4m next year. This will include $2.9m for school level projects and $500,000 for national level projects. </para>
          <para>Two new schemes will be started within the special projects program. These schemes will be for the encouragement of school level evaluation projects and for the promotion of choice within government schools. An amount of $200,000 has been provided in 1979, for each of these schemes. The Schools Commission will cooperate with education authorities and school communities in drawing up plans for the effective use of these funds.

            <para>- In the absence of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> who normally would speak on education matters, I wish to make a few comments in respect of the statement put down by the Minister for Education <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick).</inline> Firstly, I wish to say that I shall not accuse the statement of being dishonest, but I shall say it is misleading, bordering on dishonest. I say that deliberately because throughout the whole of the speech the inference is that this Government is acting on the recommendations of the Schools Commission. That is a false argument and a false impression deliberately created by this Government ever since it has been in power. I shall quote from the Schools Commission to illustrate that this Government has in fact put the Schools Commission in a strait-jacket. The Schools Commission is virtually saying that in its reports and yet this Government is creating and writing speeches which give the impression of course that it is doing as the Schools Commission requests. Let us look at the supplementary report on which this speech is based. It is important that we read the introduction by the <inline font-weight="bold">Chairman, Mr McKinnon.</inline> He pointed out that he was reporting to the Government on the basis of what the Government required. In the preface to the supplementary report which is the subject of this statement, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McKinnon</inline> states: </para>

          <para class="block">It is quite clear that the intention is to convey the impression that this Government is acting on the recommendations of the Schools Commission. The fact is, of course, that it is not. The Schools Commission is doing the best it can within the confines of the straight-jacket in which this Government has placed it. I want to refer now to the main triennium report of the Schools Commission which was tabled in April of this year. In paragraph 2.8 on page 17 the Commission had this to say about the Government's policies on education: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The assumption that real improvements in general resource standards in schools would be paid for by Commonwealth grants- increasing until the resource targets were met- has not been tenable since 1 976. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>That is what the Schools Commission has said - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Consequently the role of the Commonwealth in relation to the definition, attainment and maintenance of basic resource standards in schools requires re-examination. Such a reexamination must take into account the general pattern of Commonwealth-State financial arrangements and take into account recent statements on Commonwealth financial commitments to school-level education. Continued operation on the basis of present assumptions will in effect not raise non-government schools to minimum resource standards and, by default will gradually redefine the balance of the Commonwealth's existing role as one of reduced direct commitment to general resource standards in government schools and as one in which the needs of non-government schools for recurrent grants will inhibit the possibility of more general national educational initiatives designed to encourage improved educational processes and to underwrite the claims of target groups of students having special needs. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">How could anyone remotely interpret that statement by the Schools Commission to mean that its recommendations are in line with the policies of this Government on education? The unfortunate part, of course, is that the statement does not tell us those things. Any person reading the Minister's speech would say: 'Goodness me, what is the Opposition growling about? Obviously the Government is doing what the Commission wants it to do '. Of course, the Government is not. It takes some delving into these reports to realise how different is the education policy of the Government to what the Commission itself is indeed recommending. Take, for example, the area of capital payments for government schools which is mentioned at page 126 of the report wherein it is stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Commission felt that the total needs - </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The total needs, I emphasise-   . . were well in excess of that which could be reasonably supported during the triennium. </para>
          <para class="block">In other words, the Commission is saying that the capital grants needs of government schools in Australia is away beyond the support that they are actually getting from the Government. This next paragraph in the report deals with the capital requirements for non-government schools. The report states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The needs for non-government capital funding are also acute. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">A table at page 128 of the report sets out the various allocations for the programs of government and non-government schools and so on. Paragraph 10. 1 6 of the report states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>These amounts compared with the amounts which would be available under existing guidelines from the Government for 1979 and 1980 (there are as yet no guidelines for 1981) are shown in Table 10.2. Current guidelines for 1979 and 1980 predicted a compound growth of one per cent. There is no possibility of maintaining even existing program provisions within the guidelines. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I repeat: 'There is no possibility'. The Schools Commission is saying that there is no possibility of this Government maintaining even present standards of education in this country. Then on the following page of the report we see projections of needs which the Commission has estimated it will require to meet the needs of Australian education. It says that we will need $656m in 1979. But the guidelines tell us they will get only $63 lm, a deficit of $25m. We are also told that in 1980 the Commission estimates that $683 will be required. However, under the guidelines it will get $638m, a deficit of $45m. This is the broad picture to which the Commission itself is referring. It illustrates the degree to which the Government has allowed funding for education to decline in this country in the last three years. As the report says, we cannot make any assumptions any more from 1976 on about government support. </para>
          <para>I would like to refer quickly to one or more detailed matters. In particular I refer to the Minister's statement concerning the allocation to non-government schools. In particular I refer to the section that deals with the increase in payments to level one schools. It is important to realise that level one schools in the non-government sector are the schools with the highest resource capability. These schools include Scotch College, Melbourne Grammar and all the rest of them. We know them and we have heard of them so many times before. Under the needs principle of the Schools Commission, for years ever since the Commission was instituted by the previous Government, those schools have received a smaller per capita assistance than have what are known as level 6 schools. Level 6 schools, of course, overwhelmingly comprise the Catholic primary school sector and these are the poorer schools in the country. The Commission consistently has said that the higher one goes up the scale to level 6 the more one should get. That, of course, is common sense. </para>
          <para>But what do we find now? We find a gradual reduction in the difference being paid between the wealthier schools in this country and the poorer schools. For example, under this program where this Government is allegedly meeting the needs principle of the Schools Commission, an additional $27 a head is being given to students in level one schools. The assistance is being increased from $119 a head to $146 a head which is a difference of $27 a head. What is received by level 6, the poorer schools? They get only $27 a head also. In fact if it were not for the additional $5 a head that is tacked on they would get only $22 a head. To make the allocation look not as bad as it really is, the Government put another $5 on it to square it up. The situation is that the two highest resource level non-government schools in the country, levels 1 and 2, get increases of $27 and $30 a head respectively. When we get down to levels 5 and 6, the poorer schools, level 5 gets an increase of $18 a head and level 6 an increase of $27 a head. That is this Government's concept of a needs basis and fairness in the education system of this country. It is a continuing trend which, as has been pointed out on many occasions by the Minister, is intended; it is not an accident. The Government says: 'We are going to increase that allocation for level 1 to 20 per cent of schools' costs even though there is no justification for it', but the Schools Commission distinctly pointed out in its 1977 report that there was no justification of the steps that were being taken by the Government. </para>
          <para>I wish to refer to one other matter. It concerns the Disadvantaged Schools Program. We find on page 5 of this statement: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Government has decided, on the recommendation of the Commission, that the special purpose programs for special education and disadvantaged schools should continue at their present levels in 1 979. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">With great respect to the Minister, that is close to being a dishonest statement. As I said earlier, I am not going to say that it is dishonest but it is misleading to the point of being dishonest because the Schools Commission did not recommend that. If we refer to page 89 of the Schools Commission report of April 1978, in paragraph 7.22 the Schools Commission said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The education of country children requires a considerable mobilisation of effort in Australia, a mobilisation in which local communities should play a significant part. Funds in the program are not sufficient to be used for the large scale and expensive changes often required. These include improved teacher housing which is an urgent need in some places. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That paragraph finishes with the following words: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Commission therefore recommends that over the coming triennium the funds for the disadvantaged country areas section of the Program be doubled to $8. 48m and that it be extended to more areas. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That is not being done. The Commission did not recommend what the statement claims that it recommends. </para>
          <para>I know the time problems we have today with Estimates committees so I will not pursue the matter any more, but I think that I have said sufficient to make the Senate aware that statements such as the one we have just had, which are fairly general statements, can be misleading to anybody who is not conversant with the area and can give a false impression. But on examination we find that the claims that are made in that statement are not accurate. If the Government wishes to pursue this course of gradually destroying the needs principle of the Australian education system which was set up by the previous Government through the machinery of the Schools Commission, it had better hurry up because it has only two years left in which to do it. As is pointed out by the Commission, any attack on either the Government or the non-government sector will be to the detriment of the other. This Government has obviously adopted the principle that the Schools Commission does not know best but that the Government knows best. The total Australian education system is to suffer as a result. The Opposition, of course, stands firmly by the principle that we introduced in 1973 of allocating funds on the basis of need and being as frank and as honest to the Australian people about the education system as should be required of any government. I seek leave to continue my remarks. </para>

            <inline font-style="italic">The speech read as follows-</inline>
          </para>
          <para>This Bill gives effect to the Government's proposals for social services pensions and benefits for 1978-79. It reflects the Government's concern that assistance to those in need should be maintained notwithstanding the necessity for restraint in Government expenditure generally. The provisions of the Bill cover the following: Indexation of pensions and benefits; age pensions for persons aged 70 or more; rationalisation of payments for children; family allowances, including handicapped child's allowance and double orphan's pension; maternity allowance; and payments of benefits in respect of children living abroad. </para>
          <para class="block">Indexation of Pensions and Benefits </para>
          <para>Under the current automatic adjustment provisions of the Social Services Act, the single and married rates of pension and certain rates of unemployment and sickness benefit are adjusted in May and November each year in accordance with movements in the consumer price index. The Bill amends these provisions so that pensions and benefits will be adjusted once a year in November rather than twice a year as at present. This change has been made in the light of the significant reduction in inflation achieved by this Government. The increase in November of each year will be based on the percentage increase in the CPI over the 12 months ending with the previous June quarter. The first increase under the new arrangements will be in November 1979. The annual automatic adjustment provisions will not extend to the rate of benefit for unemployment beneficiaries without dependants or to the rate of benefit for single unemployment and sickness beneficiaries under 18 years of age. These rates will be reviewed annually in the Budget context. </para>
          <para>Under the existing indexation provisions the rates of pensions and benefits will be increased in November of this year in line with the rise in the CPI between the December 1977 and June 1978 quarters. The single rate of age, invalid and widow's pension, supporting parent's benefit, and unemployment and sickness benefit will rise from $51.45 to $53.20 a week. The combined married rate will rise from $85.80 to $88.70 a week. These increases reflect the full 3.4 per cent increase in the CPI for the first half of 1978. The Bill provides that the increases will be paid to persons aged 70 years or more only if the income test is satisfied. I will cover this in more detail shortly. </para>
          <para>Furthermore, there will be no increase in the rate of benefit paid to unemployment beneficiaries aged 18 or more who do not have dependants. They will continue to receive $5 1 .45 a week. Similarly, single unemployment and sickness beneficiaries under 18 years of age will continue to receive $36 a week. The new rates of pension and supporting parent's benefit will come into effect on payday 9 November 1978. Increases in the rates of unemployment and sickness benefits will operate in respect of payments due on and after 1 November 1978. The cost of these increases is expected to be $95. 3m in 1 978-79 and $ 145.7m in a full year. </para>
          <para>Age Pensions for Persons Aged 70 or More </para>
          <para>The single and married rates of age pension are payable free of the income test in the case of persons who have attained 70 years of age. The single rate is currently $51.45 a week and the combined married rate is $85.80 a week. Additional payments- that is, additional pension for children, guardian's allowance and supplementary (rent) assistance- are income tested. </para>
          <para>As from November 1978 pensions payable to persons aged 70 years or more will remain at their current rates, but the pensioner may qualify for the new indexed rate subject to the income test. Where no increase is payable pensions will continue to be paid at the rate in force since May 1978-that is, $51.45 or $85.80 a week. It is estimated that over 500,000 pensioners 70 years of age or over will receive the full increase payable in November 1978. Blind pensioners will continue to be paid free of income test. Many pensioners have continued to advise the Department of Social Security of their income for fringe' benefit purposes. This information, held in the Department's records, will be used to assess the entitlement, if any, of pensioners to the November 1978 pension increase without the need for further contact from the pensioners involved. </para>
          <para>Pensioners aged 70 years or over who have not advised the Department of their income should do so as soon as possible if they wish to be considered for an increase. Single pensioners 70 years or over who have income, apart from pension, between $20 a week and $23.50 a week will receive a partial increase. The corresponding figures for couples receiving the married rate of pension are $34.50 a week and $40.30 a week. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline>the following table sets out the rates of pensions which will be payable to pensioners 70 years or over as from 9 November 1 978. It will be noted that, for single persons, any income over $20 a week reduces the increase in pension by only 50c a week for each $ 1 of income over $20. In the case of a married couple the reduction is 25c a week each for every dollar of combined income in excess of $34.50. </para>

          </para>
          <para class="block">Rationalisation of Payments for Children </para>
          <para>Handicapped child's allowance of $15 a week is payable to parents or guardians in respect of a child under the age of 16 years who is cared for at home and who, because of the severity of the handicap, is in need of constant care and attention. Subject to the discretion of the Director-General, a handicapped child's allowance is also payable, wholly or in part, where a person has the custody, care and control of a substantially handicapped child and, as a consequence of continuing substantial expenditure associated with the child 's disability, the person suffers financial hardship. </para>
          <para>The Bill gives effect to the Government's decision to extend payment of handicapped child's allowance for full time students aged 16-25 years providing the child is not receiving an invalid pension. Existing provisions allow continuation of payment of handicapped child 's allowance for not more than 30 days in the case of severely handicapped children who are temporarily absent from the family home but exclude those who are not severely handicapped. The Bill gives the Director-General discretion to continue handicapped child's allowance in respect of any child during short absences from the family home. </para>
          <para>In order to make provisions regarding children uniform the Government has also decided that the upper age limit of 25 years for payment of family allowance and double orphan's pension will also apply to payment of additional pension and additional unemployment or sickness benefit for children. It has also decided to preclude payment of family allowance and double orphans pension where the child receives an invalid pension. The Bill contains savings provisions which will ensure that current pensioners and beneficiaries are not disadvantaged by these changes. </para>
          <para class="block">Family Allowances </para>
          <para>The Government will continue the new scheme of family allowances which it introduced in 1 976. These allowances will not be subject to any income test or to taxation. The Social Services Act provides that family allowance, including double orphan's pension and handicapped child's allowance shall be payable in respect of endowment periods as determined by the Director-General. A four-weekly payment cycle applies for each benefit. Payment may be made by cheque or by credit to a bank, building society or credit union account. </para>
          <para>The Bill amends the Social Services Act to provide that family allowance be paid in respect of monthly endowment periods rather than the existing four-weekly periods. The new endowment periods will commence on the fifteenth day of a calendar month and end on the fourteenth day of the next month. The rates of family allowances will accordingly be expressed in monthly amounts. However, the total amount paid to parents in a given year will not be less than the total amount now payable. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> the following table shows the present weekly rates and proposed monthly rates of family allowances: </para>
          <para class="block">
            <graphic href="079232197810172_24_6.jpg" />
          </para>
          <para>The first monthly endowment period will commence on 15 May 1979, this date being the day immediately following the end of the previous four-weekly endowment period. Thus there will be no lag between the end of the last four-weekly period and the beginning of the first monthly period. Payments on 1 5 May will be at the fourweekly rate and the first payments at the new monthly rates will be on 4 June 1 979. </para>
          <para>The Bill gives effect to the Government's decision that family allowance will no longer be paid for students receiving TEAS allowances or other related Commonwealth education allowances. In order to compensate for the loss of family allowance, the rates of TEAS and other related Commonwealth education allowances are being increased by $5.25 a week. </para>
          <para>As the Act stands at present, the Department of Social Security has been advised that it is possible for two people to be paid a full family allowance for the same child at the same time. This is clearly not the intention of the legislation. The Bill therefore proposes to remedy this deficiency by giving the Director-General discretion to apportion payments on such basis as he determines where he is satisfied that two persons are each qualified to receive payment in respect of the same child at the same time. For example, where parents living permanently apart have joint custody of, or joint access to, a child. </para>
          <para class="block">Maternity allowance </para>
          <para>Maternity allowance is payable under the provisions of the Social Services Act to mothers, irrespective of means, to help meet the expenses associated with the birth of children. There has been no change in the rates of the allowance payable since 1943. Costs associated with confinements are now largely covered by health insurance arrangements. The Bill abolishes this allowance for births occurring on or after 1 November 1978. </para>
          <para>Payment of Benefits in Respect of Children living Abroad </para>
          <para>Provisions in the Social Services Act currently enable family allowance, including handicapped child's allowance and double orphan's pension, and additional pension or supporting parent's benefit or additional unemployment or sickness benefit for children to be paid for a child living abroad. The Government believes it is inappropriate for the Australian taxpayer to contribute to the support of persons who are permanently resident overseas, who have never been resident in Australia and who may never come to Australia; the rates of family allowances and the size of the tax rebates for dependants are set in the light of Australian conditions and, in many cases, would be over-generous having regard to the cost of maintaining a dependant overseas. </para>
          <para>In the light of this the Bill provides that such payments will not in future be made for children outside Australia unless: A child is temporarily abroad; a child is living abroad pending migration to Australia within four years after the commencement of the benefit; and in respect of additional pension/benefit a child is living abroad with a person who is himself receiving an Australian pension or benefit overseas. Expenditure on pensions and benefits payable under the Social Services Act is estimated to be $6,602m for 1978-79 which will be an increase of $399m over that period in 1977-78. 1 commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

          <para>Leave granted. 77it? <inline font-style="italic">speech read as follows-</inline></para>
          <para>This Bill provides for amendments to the Repatriation Act and associated Acts to give effect to the Government's decisions covering: Nominations of persons to repatriation determining authorities by organisations representing dependants of deceased veterans and exservicewomen; the provision for pulmonary tuberculosis to be dealt with in the same way as other disabilities; automatic adjustment of the main repatriation pensions in accordance with movements in the consumer price index only once a year; the provision of an upper age limit of 25 years for student children undertaking full time education, in respect of whom service pensioners receive additional allowances to their basic service pensions; the provision for incometestfree pensions to be frozen at their present cash level and additions to income-test-free pensions to become subject to the normal income test as applied to pensioners under 70 years of age; and the removal of references to sustenance allowance. There are also a number of machinery amendments. </para>
          <para>I will now outline to the Senate the provisions of the Bill. The Government has over the years received representations from organisations representing dependants of deceased veterans and ex-servicewomen that they be able to nominate persons for appointment to the repatriation determining authorities. At present the Repatriation Act provides that only organisations representing returned soldiers may make nominations. The Government believes that, by broadening the class of organisation permitted to make these nominations, repatriation determining authorities will more accurately reflect the composition of persons in the community whose lives are affected by the repatriation system. Organisations currently entitled to nominate persons to the determining authorities will, of course, retain their right of nomination. </para>
          <para>This Bill provides for amendment to the provisions dealing with pulmonary tuberculosis. Up to the present, pulmonary tuberculosis has been treated separately from other disabilities under the legislation and those suffering from or who have suffered from the disease have occupied a privileged position in relation to other repatriation beneficiaries. A veteran who has served in a theatre of war and contracts pulmonary tuberculosis, whether as a result of his war service or otherwise, is eligible to receive benefits under the repatriation legislation. Furthermore, a tuberculosis pensioner who is no longer suffering from active tuberclosis is entitled to receive a 100 per cent general rate pension and, as a consequence, free medical and hospital care for all disabilities, irrespective of whether they are war caused or not. </para>
          <para>While recognising that pulmonary tuberculosis is a horrible disease and those who suffered from it have had to endure a great deal, the Government is firmly of the view that there is no longer any reason for these people to be in a privileged position, particularly when the disease is no longer active. In future, only service-related pulmonary tuberculosis will attract a disability pension and the amount of pension paid, as with any other illness or injury, will be determined according to the degree of" actual incapacity. Veterans in receipt of benefits for pulmonary tuberculosis at the 100 per cent general rate will not lose their pensions, but will have these pensions 'frozen' from 2 November 1978 at the May 1 978 cash level of that rate. </para>
          <para>As the recipient of a pension equivalent to 100 per cent of the general rate or greater, a veteran who has or has had TB is entitled to free medical, hospital and ancillary treatment for injuries, ailments or medical conditions irrespective of cause. Treatment covered includes optical, dental and pharmaceutical. A veteran whose pension has been frozen will not be entitled to full free repatriation medical treatment other than for TB and other associated service-related conditions. However, if he is a 1914 War veteran, an ex-prisoner-of-war or a service pensioner who qualifies for fringe benefits, he will retain full free medical treatment rights. As with other veterans assessed at less than 100 per cent, and all other Australians, he will be covered for hospital and medical care at a uniform level. The Government will pay 40 per cent of doctors' schedule fees, with a maximum payment by each person of $20 for each service. A doctor may bulk bill' for a disadvantaged person so that he will not have to pay out of his own pocket. </para>
          <para>If a veteran's pension entitlement is reassessed at 100 per cent or greater, full restoration of free medical treatment will be made together with reimbursement of all reasonable costs, including medical and hospital insurance costs borne by him from 1 November 1978 and date of reassessment. Commonwealth medical benefit will be available to those registered with a fund before 1 November 1978 or when they lodge their first claim with a fund. The normal waiting period of 2 months normally applicable to private health funds will be waived when a person lodges his claim between 1 November 1978 and 31 December 1978. The universal Commonwealth medical benefit will be available during any subsequent waiting period. If a person is satisfied with standard hospital care he need not join a fund. If he requires his own doctor in a public or private ward, it will be necessary for him to join a fund. </para>
          <para>All veterans receiving pensions for pulmonary tuberculosis are to be reviewed to determine the severity of the actual incapacity arising from their pulmonary tuberculosis and other servicerelated disabilities. If, on the extent of actual incapacity, they are found to be overassessed, pensions will continue to be paid at the May 1978 cash level- $74.40 per fortnight- until such time as the cash payment for actual incapacity as assessed exceeds this level. Those veterans whose pensions are 'frozen' from 2 November 1978 and who on subsequent review are found on actual incapacity to be entitled to a pension at the 100 per cent general rate or higher are to be entitled to arrears of pension from 2 November and reimbursement of" any medical expenses privately incurred from that date. It is considered that the changes provided for in this Bill will have only a minimal impact on future claims made for pension as, in 1 977, there were only 76 disability pensions granted in respect of pulmonary tuberculosis. Existing service pensions in respect of pulmonary tuberculosis will continue in force, but pulmonary tuberculosis will not be a special qualification for service pension for which, in future, veterans will be required to satisfy the normal conditions of age or permanent unemployability. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline>I now turn to other amendments in this Bill which will implement decisions taken by the Government in the context of the 1978-79 Budget. The Repatriation Act, as currently framed, allows for the main disability pensions, namely, the special rate- totally and permanently incapacitated- pension, intermediate rate and general rate as well as the war and defence widows' pensions and service pensions, to be adjusted automatically in May and November of each year, in accordance with movements in the consumer price index over the prior six months ended 3 1 December and 30 June respectively. In line with proposed changes to pensions paid under the Social Services Act, the main repatriation pensions will now be automatically increased once a year. Increases will apply from the first pension payday in November and will be in line with changes in the consumer price index for the 12 months ending the preceding June quarter. </para>
          <para>Provision has been made for the imposition of an upper age limit for the payment of additional pension in respect of student children who are in the care, custody and control of service pensioners. Currently, service pensioners can receive in addition to the basic service pension, additional allowances to assist support of a student 16 years of age and over undertaking full time education but no upper age limit is specified. The absence of such a limit is inconsistent with the upper age limit of 25 years applied in respect of family allowance under the Social Services Act and with the 25 years age limit included in the income tax legislation. It is the Government's view that the child of a service pensioner will have had sufficient time to embark upon and complete his full time education and attain appropriate qualifications to facilitate entry into a chosen vocation by the time he attains 25 years of age. </para>
          <para>It is now proposed that an upper disqualifying age limit of 25 years be applied in respect of the additional allowances paid to service pensioners who are supporting student children. However, allowances already in payment in respect of student children 25 years and over will continue while students are undertaking full time education. </para>
          <para>The Government has decided to make changes in the rules governing the rates of service pension payable in line with changes in social services legislation. I should explain that the service pension is a social welfare payment, broadly equivalent to the age pension under social services legislation. The basic difference is that service pensions are paid five years earlier than the age from which age pensions become available to take account of the indefinable and intangible effects of war service which could cause premature aging and a lessening of ability to earn a living. In reaching its decision, the Government considered that provisions similar to those applied to social services pensions should apply to persons receiving service pensions under repatriation legislation. - </para>
          <para>Under exising repatriation legislation, a service pension can be paid free of the income test to a person who is permanently blind or who has attained the age of 70 years. The Government has decided to modify the income-test-free provisions for persons aged 70 years and over, except for pensions paid to the permanently blind. Existing pensions will continue to be paid free of the income test at the current rate of $85.80 per fortnight each to a married couple or $102.90 per fortnight to a single pensioner. The November increase in service pension will not be paid to this group of pensioners unless they qualify under the provisions of the income test currently applicable to persons under 70 years of age. </para>
          <para>Pensioners on reaching 70 years of age or those over 70 who have not applied for service pension will automatically qualify for an incometestfree pension but it will be granted at the May 1978 rates or at such higher level as applies to them if they are able to satisfy the existing income test. </para>
          <para>The Bill also provides for an amendment to the Repatriation Act consequent upon the Government's decision to replace sustenance allowance with a more comprehensive loss of earnings allowance. Finally, there are a number of machinery amendments to bring the Act into line with current drafting practice and to provide for consequential amendments following the removal of special provisions relating to pulmonary tuberculosis. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

          <para class="block">National Health Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1978 </para>
          <para class="block">This Bill provides for amendments to the National Health Act 1953 to implement two separate decisions taken by the Government. First, provisions in the Bill together with provisions contained in the Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1978, implement the Government's changes to the health insurance arrangements to come into effect from 1 November 1978. Secondly, the Bill provides for the expansion of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme to allow dentists to prescribe certain pharmaceutical benefits for the dental treatment of their patients. </para>
          <para>In a statement in another place on 15 August 1978 explaining in detail the Government's changes to the health insurance arrangements, the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hunt)</inline> advised that a Commonwealth medical benefit would be payable to all Australian residents for medical and some optometrical expenses incurred. Persons wishing to take out additional medical benefits cover with a registered medical benefits organisation will be free to do so. Further, free standard ward treatment in recognised hospitals will continue to be available, under hospital cost-sharing agreements with States for persons who do not have hospital benefits insurance with a health insurance organisation. The principle of universal health insurance cover for all Australian residents remains. All Australians remain covered for the Commonwealth medical benefit and are entitled to standard ward accommodation in recognised hospitals at no cost to them. They will not have their doctor of choice unless they insure for a doctor of their choice. </para>
          <para>However, the Government recognises that people who now are receiving Medibank Standard medical benefits and optometrical benefits, at a level of 75 per cent of schedule fees with a maximum gap of $10 for each service, will need to insure privately to retain this level of cover after 1 November 1978. There will be little change in the hospital insurance arrangements. The abolition of the subsidy to levy payers for hospital insurance in general will mean a small increase in premiums for the continuation of this type of insurance cover. </para>
          <para>Having regard to the above position, the Government has decided to retain the concept of basic medical and hospital insurance tables in the legislation. It is to be a continued condition of registration of medical and hospital benefits organisations that contributors to the organisation be offered benefits in accordance with basic medical and hospital benefit tables. Such tables are defined in clause 3 of the Bill and, in brief, ensure that, on the basic medical benefits table, persons are able to obtain insurance benefits which, together with their Commonwealth medical benefit entitlement, provides a level of benefits equivalent to the present 75 per cent of the schedule fee with a maximum gap of $10. In relation to the basic hospital insurance, the new basic table retains the existing coverage which organisations must provide under standard hospital benefits tables. </para>
          <para>From 1 November 1978 organisations will be permitted to offer a variety of benefit tables, including tables providing deductibles. Such tables are referred to in the Bill as optional hospital or medical benefits tables, and are defined in clause 3. </para>
          <para>These optional medical and hospital benefit tables must conform with basic criteria, for example, an optional medical benefits table must relate to medical benefits for scheduled medical services. Optional hospital benefit tables must provide hospital benefits to cover shared room hospital accommodation and provide nursing home benefits. In addition to these basic criteria, optional tables must comply with guidelines determined by the Minister for Health. While these guidelines will be flexible to allow registered organisations to offer a variety of health benefit packages, the Government still considers it has a responsibility to ensure that such tables offer adequate benefits for reasonable contribution rates, and will take this into account when considering applications from registered organisations. The guidelines and conditions which could operate from 1 November 1978 are as follows: </para>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Minister for Health has asked me to make it quite clear that the benefits available for exclusions under part (iv) of the optional hospital insurance tables guidelines relate only to benefits for 'professional services' and 'outpatients services' as referred to in the basic hospital table as defined. They do not relate to exclusion of benefits for hospitalisation on account of confinements, psychiatric illness, alcoholism or other illnesses. Both basic and optional hospital tables will include the provision of nursing home benefits to maintain the new nursing home arrangements introduced by the Government last year. The Government is awaiting with interest the various benefit packages and contribution rates to be offered by organisations, once they assess the freedom and flexibility available under the new arrangements. </para>
          <para>At present organisations are subject to conditions of registration. Statutory conditions are specified in section  73BA.  It is necessary, under the new arrangements, to specify further conditions to which the registration of organisations will be subject after 1 November 1978. In addition to specifying the new conditions, the Bill incorporates them, and the statutory conditions currently contained in section  73BA,  into a Schedule to the Act. I do not propose to explain all the conditions in detail, but would like to mention specifically the following new conditions: The first is included in paragraph (g) of the Schedule which provides that a registered hospital benefits organisation can offer supplementary hospital benefits only to a person who also contributes to a basic or optional hospital benefits table. This condition, together with the condition specified in paragraph (h) of the Schedule will ensure that registered organisations continue to pay nursing home benefits for nursing home patients who are contributors to the organisation. The second condition I would like to mention concerns waiting periods. This condition is specified in paragraph (n) of the Schedule and provides that organisations shall not apply any waiting periods for persons who insure in a basic or optional benefits table before 1 January 1979. </para>
          <para>Clause 9 of the Bill amends provisions relating to hospital benefits reinsurance accounts. From 1 November 1978 registered hospital benefits organisations will be permitted to debit to those accounts hospital benefits for hospital treatment received outside Australia by contributors to the organisations. Recently the Minister for Health has been made aware of action taken to preclude a. person from becoming a contributor to an organisation where that person is a patient in an institution. Such action is considered to be a direct attempt by an organisation to abrogate its responsibility to pay nursing home benefits for such patients who are contributors to the organisation- a responsibility which was accepted readily by organisations when the new nursing home arrangements were introduced last year. Accordingly, clause 1 1 introduces a new section 73BFA. This provision enables the Minister to direct an organisation to accept a person as a contributor, to a basic table conducted by the organisation where he is satisfied that the person was not accepted as a contributor because the patient was in an institution. </para>
          <para>Under the Act a medical benefits organisation is required to offer from the basic medical benefits table, medical benefits for certain optometrical services and benefits for all other professional services. Representations have been received from organisations and individuals in the community objecting to the requirement that medical benefits be offered for all services, particularly procedures involving abortions. New section 73F, in clause 14 of the Bill, provides for the Minister for Health, upon application by a medical benefits organisation, to grant an exemption to the organisation from paying, out of its basic medical benefits table, benefits for specified professional services. However, to ensure persons are aware of the exemption, the organisation is required, by virtue of the condition of registration specified in paragraph (s) of the Schedule, to advise contributors and registered persons of the particulars of the exemption and to publish the particulars in a manner satisfactory to the Minister. </para>
          <para>Whilst there is at present no legislative requirement, it is expected that registered organisations which obtain exemptions from paying for specific medical services would ensure that arrangements are made for the transfer of dissatisfied contributors to other organisations without penalty. Equally an organisation offering a table with the specific exemption would be expected to provide that a person wishing to transfer to that organisation from another fund by reason of that exempted item would not have any waiting period applied to comparable tables. In fact, the Minister has received some assurances in that regard. For some years, organisations have accepted contributors who are financial transferring from comparable medical benefit entitlements without serving a waiting period. Most organisations have a rule to this effect. It is expected that this convention will be followed by the health funds so that persons are not disadvantaged when transferring from one fund to another fund at the same benefits levels. </para>
          <para>A significant drawback in the effective analysis of the health insurance system has been, to date, the unavailability of related and adequate information. This question has been raised with representatives of the industry at a meeting of the Health Insurance Advisory Committee where the continued difficulty of maintaining and furnishing proper information has been recognised. The Bill enables proper information to be obtained under a number of provisions. New Section 74c, clause 15, provides for the prescription by regulations of certain records to be kept by organisations. New section 74d enables the prescription of information drawn from those records to be furnished to the Director-General of Health. In addition, organisations are required, by the conditions of registration specified in paragraphs (k) and ( 1 ) of the Schedule, to maintain membership and other records of contributors and registered persons. They will also be required to furnish returns of the number of persons so enrolled and relevant financial information. </para>
          <para>I have already mentioned that this question has been discussed at meetings of the Health Insurance Advisory Committee. It is understood that registered organisations are already familiar with the nature of the information to be maintained and furnished and that the provisions on the Bill generally are in accord with the wishes of that Committee. The Bill, in clause 18, repeals divisions 1a and 2 of Part III of the Act. These relate to the subsidy paid to registered organisations for persons insured for hospital benefits only and to special account provisions which no longer operate after 30 September 1978. The amendments made by clauses 5 and 6 are consequential upon the repeal of the special account provisions. </para>
          <para>As mentioned earlier, the Bill also provides, in clauses 20 to 42, for the expansion of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme to allow dentists to prescribe certain pharmaceutical benefits for the dental treatment of their patients. Under existing State legislation dentists are permitted to prescribe medication for the dental treatment of their patients. However, at present, the National Health Act does not permit dentists to prescribe pharmaceutical benefits, so patients must pay the full cost of medication prescribed by dentists. To obtain the medication at pharmaceutical benefit rates, dentists must refer their patients to medical practitioners who then prescribe the medication. This anomalous situation will be corrected by the Bill. </para>
          <para>It is anticipated that this expansion of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme will have very little effect on expenditure. The cost of this proposal under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme will be offset to a large extent by a reduction in medical practitioner fees subsidised through the government-financed medical benefits arrangements. The same payment conditions will apply to pharmaceutical benefits prescribed by dentists as those which apply to pharmaceutical benefits prescribed by doctors; that is, pensioners with a pensioner health benefits entitlment card will receive them free of charge, while other patients will pay the normal $2.50 patient contribution. </para>
          <para>Finally, the Bill amends the definition of 'dependant' in relation to a pensioner to impose an upper age limit of 25 years on student dependent children of pensioners. This amendment ensures that the definition remains in line with corresponding definitions in social security and repatriation legislation. The amendment will maintain uniformity in the operation of the various Acts which provide 'fringe benefits' to pensioners and enable the Government's policies in relation to pensioners to be applied equally across the board. A savings provision has been included in the amendment to preserve the entitlement of a person presently qualifying as a dependant of a pensioner who otherwise would cease to be so qualified solely as a result of the amended criteria. I commend the bill to the Senate. </para>
          <para class="block">Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1978 </para>
          <para>The Bill before the Senate contains provisions which give effect to the Government's changes to the health insurance arrangements announced by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard)</inline> in the Budget. The Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hunt),</inline> in a statement in another place on 15 August 1978, explained in detail the new arrangements proposed to operate from 1 November of this year. Therefore it is not necessary to address myself to the details of the changes, but to the outline of the legislation before the Senate. </para>
          <para>I would point out to honourable senators that the proposals embodied in this legislation, and in other legislation to be considered, arise out of the Government's continuing review of the costs of health care in Australia. As health insurance has such an important influence on the costs of these services, it is vital that we continue with these reviews. In another forum, we are actively engaged with the States in discussions on the rationalisation and utilisation of hospital services. Since approximately 60 per cent of our total costs are in hospitals, cost containment and efficiency in the use of resources in the hospital sector are vital in any program to arrest the accelerating rate of health costs. </para>
          <para>While the 1 October 1976 changes to Medibank, and subsequent amendments to the health insurance arrangements effected by this Government, have resulted in a significant decline in the rate of acceleration of health costs, this rate of increase continues to be high. The new measures will, in the Government's view, continue the downward trend in the rate of acceleration of cost rises. The new arrangements which will result in the abolition of the Medibank levy and the reduction of medical insurance premiums will reduce the burden of costs to the individual. At the same time they will simplify the complex arrangements of the existing scheme. The principal provisions of the </para>
          <para class="block">Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1978 relate to payment of the new Commonwealth medical benefit. </para>
          <para>Under the new arrangements, a Commonwealth medical benefit will be payable for medical and some optometrical expenses incurred by Australian residents. As is the present position concerning the rate of medical benefits, the levels of the new Commonwealth medical benefit will be based on scheduled medical fees. Clause 9 of the Bill provides for the amounts of Commonwealth medical benefit to be: firstly, where the medical expenses relate to services rendered to eligible pensioners or their dependants, 85 per cent of the schedule fee with a maximum gap of $5 for each service; secondly, where the medical expenses relate to services rendered to a disadvantaged person, who has entered into a direct billing arrangement with his doctor, 75 per cent of the schedule fee; thirdly, where the medical expenses relate to services rendered to all other Australian residents, 40 per cent of the schedule fee with a maximum gap of $20 paid by the resident for each service. </para>
          <para>I have just mentioned direct billing arrangements to apply from 1 November 1978. This aspect of the new arrangements is authorised by clause 15 of the Bill, which is a key provision and inserts new sections 20 to 20f. New section 20a provides that direct billing arrangements may entered into only for services rendered to eligible pensioners and their dependants, or to a person who, in the opinion of the practitioner rendering the service, is a disadvantaged person or a dependant of such a person. Eligible pensioners and their dependants are able to assign their Commonwealth medical benefits to the practitioner rendering the service. While the legislation does not specify that the practitioner shall accept the benefits in full settlement of the expenses involved, the Minister for Health is confident that, in accordance with the policy of the Australian Medical Association, practitioners will continue to waive payment of any payment by the eligible pensioner or his dependant in these circumstances. </para>
          <para>In the case of a patient who is considered by the practitioner rendering the service a disadvantaged person, new section 20a provides for an agreement, between the person and the practitioner, where the person assigns his Commonwealth medical benefits to the practitioner. In such circumstances the doctor will accept the benefits in full settlement of the medical expenses involved. The specific direct billing arrangements will not apply to an eligible pensioner, or his dependant, or a disadvantaged person, who is a medically insured person with a medical benefits organisation, for such medical benefits related to schedule medical services. </para>
          <para>The amendments effected by clauses 13, 18 and 19 of the Bill also relate to direct billing procedures. These clauses extend the above principles into the approved pathology practitioner arrangements, and into undertakings given by medical practitioners and participating optometrists. </para>
          <para>Lengthy consideration has been given to the question of including in the legislation guidelines or definitions relating to disadvantaged persons. The Minister for Health also discussed the matter with the AMA. On balance it was decided not to specify such guidelines in the legislation. It is considered that the relationship between a patient and his practitioner is quite uniqueindeed quite personal. The term 'disadvantaged person' is difficult to define in legal terms, but the specification in the legislation of categories of disadvantaged persons' could introduce rigid procedures, which could be complex to administer. Such definitions may not be readily adaptable to changes in patients ' circumstances. There is also the possibility that this could lead to interference in the patient-practitioner relationship to which I have just referred. It is felt that the spirit of the Government's proposals in this area is best achieved by leaving the judgment as to whether or not a person is disadvantaged to the practitioner and patient concerned. For the information of honourable senators, the new direct billing arrangements could include persons in the following categories: </para>
          <para>Persons on low income including social security unemployment, sickness or special beneficiaries; </para>
          <para>Newly arrived migrants and some other ethnic groups; </para>
          <para>Refugees who are financially disadvantaged; </para>
          <para>Persons who suffer financial misfortune because of substantial medical expenses caused by prolonged or severe illness. </para>
          <para class="block">Let me assure honourable senators that arrangements have been made for the Department of Health to watch closely the operation of the new direct billing procedures and to review them after they have been in operation for six months. Where a practitioner classifies a patient as disadvantaged, and bulk bills accordingly, he will be required to accept the 75 per cent Commonwealth benefit in full settlement for his services. </para>
          <para class="block">Appropriate action will be taken where it is determined that provisions operating after 1 November 1978 are being breached or abused. Claims for Commonwealth medical benefits under the new arrangements will be paid through two sources. </para>
          <para>Firstly, the Commonwealth Department of Health will pay benefits direct to practitioners, for claims made under the new direct billing procedures. Although the practice under current bulk billing procedures is for the practitioner to give the patient a copy of the assignment agreement form, there is no mandatory requirement for the practitioner to provide a copy. This matter has been the subject of representations by the Australian Council of Social Service. The Bill before the Senate provides that a medical benefit will not be paid, under the new direct billing arrangements, unless a copy of the assignment or agreement form is given to the eligible pensioner or the disadvantaged person. </para>
          <para>Secondly, registered medical benefit organisations will pay claims for Commonwealth medical benefits from persons who are contributors to the organisation or who are registered with the organisation for Commonwealth medical benefit purposes only. Advances will be made by the Department of Health to registered organisations to enable them to make Commonwealth benefit payments for claims lodged by contributors and registered persons. However, the Health Insurance Commission will continue to pay claims for medical benefits for Medibank Standard persons, for services rendered prior to 1 November 1978. </para>
          <para>A person may obtain payment of Commonwealth medical benefits, from a registered organisation, without becoming a contributor to the organisation, by registering for Commonwealth medical benefit purposes. This facility will be available only through a medical benefits organisation which has entered into an appropriate agreement with the Minister for Health, on behalf of the Commonwealth, for the registration of persons for this purpose. The agreement will cover such matters as: </para>
          <para>The institution and maintenance by a registered organisation of satisfactory records and procedures; </para>
          <para>The payment by the organisation of claims for Commonwealth medical benefits; </para>
          <para>Periodical inspection of records by officers of the Department of Health; </para>
          <para>The payment by the Commonwealth of amounts towards meeting the administrative expenses incurred by an organisation in paying claims for Commonwealth medical benefits. </para>
          <para class="block">Most medical benefit organisations have advised the Department of Health of their willingness to enter into agreements to pay Commonwealth medical benefits. The only funds which have not applied are four funds which restrict membership to persons employed in certain corporations. The Bill also contains provisions relating to hospital payments. At present, payments for the operation of hospitals in the Northern Territory are made through the Department of Health. Following the achievement of self-government by the Northern Territory, the Government has decided that future Commonwealth funding of Territory hospitals should be placed on the same basis as that applicable to the States. Accordingly, clause 20 of the Bill enables a hospital cost-sharing agreement to be entered into between the Commonwealth and the Government of the Northern Territory. The agreements between the Commonwealth and the Government of the Northern Territory will be based on the heads of agreement in Schedule 2 to the Health Insurance Act, which is similar to existing agreements with the States. </para>
          <para>The second matter in the Bill concerning hospital payments is contained in clause 39 which amends heads 7, 8 and 10 of the heads of agreement in Schedule 2. These heads provide, principally, for the charging policies specified in the Commonwealth-State hospital cost-sharing agreements and, in this context, refer to the term privately insured person'. This term derives its meaning from sub-sections 3 (7), (8) and (8a)' of the Health Insurance Act 1973, and relates to a person entitled to both medical and hospital benefits in accordance with standard tables operated by medical and hospital benefits organisations. The effect of a person being deemed to be a 'privately insured person' is that such a person is exempt from payment of the health insurance levy. In accordance with the heads of agreement and the agreements with the States, such a person is also excluded from entitlement to free standard ward hospital treatment, unless an agreement provides otherwise. </para>
          <para>Since the health insurance levy is to be abolished, the term 'privately insured person' is no longer relevant in that context. It is still necessary to exclude, from free standard ward treatment under the Commonwealth-State agreements, persons who are insured for hospital benefits with a hospital benefits organisation. Accordingly, the Bill substitutes a new term, hospital insured person', in the heads of agreement for the reference to a 'privately insured person'. This new term is defined in clauses 3 and 4 of the Bill. Formal concurrence by States is being sought to the variation to the hospital costsharing agreements consequential upon the substitution of the term 'hospital insured person' in the heads of agreement. </para>
          <para>The Bill, in clauses 41 and 42, ensures that current scheduled medical fees will apply, for Commonwealth medical benefit purposes after 1 November 1978 and that outstanding claims for medical benefits received after 1 November 1978 will continue to be paid. The Bill also amends the definition of 'dependant', in relation to an eligible pensioner, to impose an upper age limit of 25 years on student dependent children of pensioners. This amendment ensures that the provisions of the Health Insurance Act remain in line with corresponding social security and repatriation legislation to maintain uniformity in the provision of 'fringe benefits' to pensioners. I would mention, for the information of honourable senators, that this Bill was amended in another place. The amendment is contained in clause 13a, and enables Commonwealth and fund medical benefits to be paid, after 1 November 1978, for charges made by family planning associations and, where applicable, other organisations receiving health program grants under the Health Insurance Act. </para>
          <para>The remaining provisions in the Bill contain amendments consequential upon: </para>
          <para>The introduction of the new Commonwealth medical benefit; </para>
          <para>The abolition of the health insurance levy; or </para>
          <para>The transfer of functions relating to the administration of certain provisions of the Act and payments under the Act, to the Department of Health from the Health Insurance Commission. </para>

          <para>The Bill may be divided into four principal parts: Firstly, the reconstitution of the Health Insurance Commission; secondly, the removal of the Medibank Standard functions and the continued operation of Medibank Private; thirdly, provisions relating to the engagement of staff by the Commission after 1 November 1978 and the terms and conditions applying to the staff; and fourthly, the transitional provisions necessary to effect the changeover to the new functions of the reconstituted Commission. </para>
          <para>Whilst the Bill does not, in any way, affect the corporate identity of the existing Health Insurance Commission, it does, by the amendments contained in clause 11, provide for the Commission to be reconstituted. The new Commission is to be constituted by up to seven commissioners, including a Chairman and the General Manager of Medibank. All commissioners, with the exception of the General Manager, will be appointed by the Governor-General on a part time basis, for a period, not exceeding five years, specified in the instrument of appointment. The abolition of Medibank Standard and the transfer to the Department of Health of the administration of various Commonwealth benefits and payments now made by the Commission mean the principal functions of the new Commission will be the management of Medibank Private and payment of the new Commonwealth medical benefit on the same basis as other registered health insurance organisations. The performance of these functions is reflected in the amendments made in clauses 7 and 8 of the Bill. Clause 10 of the Bill provides for the Commission to perform such other functions in relation to health insurance as the Minister for Health directs. This provision enables the Commission to pursue government policy objectives in health insurance where so directed. Initially, the only additional function to Medibank Private and the payment of the Commonwealth medical benefit will be the payment of medical benefits under the winding-down of the Medibank Standard functions of the Commission. The Bill provides for any direction of the Minister, relating to additional functions to be performed by the Commission, to be included in the annual report of the Commission. Further, provision is also made for the Minister for Health and the Commission to enter into an agreement for the payment to the Commission of administrative expenses arising out of the performance of functions which are the subject of a direction by the Minister for Health. </para>
          <para>In order that the Commission can compete with the private health funds on an equal footing, the Bill provides that the Commission will no longer be required to seek Public Service Board approval of its terms and conditions of employment and will be subject to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. Clauses 32 and 33 of the Bill contain transitional provisions to protect the terms and conditions of existing staff of the Commission. Any changes to the terms and conditions of existing staff will, of course, be discussed by the Commission with relevant staff associations. I should also mention that the Commission management has already agreed with the staff associations that the Compensation (Australian Government Employees) Act and the Long Service Leave (Commonwealth Government Employees) Act should continue to apply to all staff of the Commission and the Bill has been drafted to take account of this. </para>
          <para>The Bill provides that the Commission may establish and conduct its own superannuation scheme. However, the intention is that staff who are contributors to the Commonwealth superannuation scheme at the time of the introduction of the Commission's superannuation scheme, or who join the Commission thereafter and are already contributors to Commonwealth superannuation scheme, will retain such membership. Persons who join the Commission staff after the introduction of its scheme, and who are not already contributors to the Commonwealth superannuation scheme, will be able to elect to join the Commission's superannuation scheme or request to be treated under the Superannuation Act 1976. The Bill, in clauses 16, 17, 19 and Part III gives effect to the above proposals. </para>
          <para>Part IV of the Bill contains transitional provisions. It is accepted that, with the abolition of the Medibank Standard functions of the Commission, there is likely to be a significant number of surplus staff. Discussions have already been held between the relevant staff organisations, the </para>
          <para class="block">Department of Health, the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations, the Commission and the Public Service Board about this situation. In the first instance they have concentrated on the transfer of staff associated with bulk billing functions to the Department of Health. At this stage it is not possible to give any accurate indication of the number of staff who may ultimately be surplus to the requirements of the Commission as this will be dependent on the market share obtained by the Commission. However, the Bill in clause 3 1 recognises the need for action to be taken and provides for the Public Service Board to be involved in the redeployment of surplus staff. There will be continuing discussions with the staff associations on this aspect as the situation develops. </para>
          <para>The remaining provision of the Bill to which I would specifically draw the attention of honourable senators is clause 34. This provision enables a reconciliation to be effected of the assets and liabilities of the Commission as at 31 October 1978. The Bill provides for the Commonwealth to pay to the Commission an amount which represents the liabilities of the Commission, both current and contingent, which are attributable to the Medibank Standard functions of the Commission. Similarly, provision is included for the Commission to pay to the Commonwealth an amount that represents the value of the assets of the Commission acquired by the Commission in carrying out its Medibank Standard functions. The purpose of this transitional provision is to provide for a distribution of assets and liabilities which properly relate to each of the Medibank Standard and Medibank Private functions as at 31 October 1978. </para>
          <para>The remaining provisions in the Bill are consequential amendments relating to: The reconstitution of the Commission; the abolition of the Commission's Medibank Standard functions; and the inclusion in the Act of more relevant provisions, applying generally to statutory corporations, concerning borrowing and investments by the new Commission and the entering into of contracts by the Commission. I commend this Bill to the Senate. </para>

Last week, when seeking the co-operation of honourable senators in the program of legislation proposed by the Government, I mentioned that the social services Bills would be available for passage in the Senate this week. We all appreciate that the meetings of Estimates committees affect the time available for Government Business. I therefore seek the co-operation of all honourable senators in the consideration of the Social Services Amendment Bill and the Repatriation Acts Amendment Bill which the Government regards as essential for passage this week. Hopefully it will not become necessary again to use the time scheduled for Estimates committees on Thursday. </para>

            <para>- I want to speak tonight about a matter which has worried me for some time and which I believe now needs to be placed before the Senate. It relates to the circumstances surrounding the recent appointment of the Secretary-General of the National Aboriginal Conference. This important position in the community was being filled for the first time. It was a position for which nominations were called. Briefly, I want to place before the Senate the circumstances in which one important candidate for this position, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr David</inline> Anderson, has been passed over. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anderson,</inline> a </para>

He made it abundantly clear where he was living and that he sought the position. He received an acknowledgement dated 14 June of receipt of the application. He was told that his application would receive attention. The acknowledgement was signed by the Secretary of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. On 3 1 August <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anderson</inline> was at a seminar of the Aborigines Advancement League at Northcote in Victoria and there was told by a member of the executive of the Conference, <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Nessie</inline> Skuta, that he had not been appointed and that she was surprised that he was in Australia because the executive had been told that he was out of Australia. Clearly he had not been considered as an applicant and his application for appointment had not been voted on by the executive. </para>

          </continue>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Skuta</inline>had taken a tape recording of the proceedings of the executive meeting on 8 August when the decision was made. I have taken a tape recording of the relevant parts; it is not the original recording. I think it is important that we realise that in the course of making the decision statements of the nature I shall indicate to the Senate shortly were made. I will read from a transcript of the executive meeting in Adelaide on 8 August. At the beginning of the discussion on this matter a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McNamara</inline> of the Public Service Board, the officer seconded to act as secretary and to deal with the important investigations and the interviewing of applicants for this position, said that certain people had withdrawn because of their commitments. Then he said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>A couple we were disappointed because they did withdraw. One person, David Anderson, of Black Rock in Victoria, was contacted; however David is overseas and obviously, because of the terms of reference of filling the position, cannot be contacted. That was one disappointing aspect. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That, of course, is a very clear but mistaken statement. Later on he said: </para>

          <para class="block">He then discussed the various candidates- the members of the executive discussed them fullyand at a later stage but before the voting took place <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bird,</inline> a member of the executive, mentioned <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McEwen,</inline> who was the successful candidate. He said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Just about McEwen, as Greg said, we interviewed him twice, not on the same day. His reason that he didn't apply  for the top position was that he thought it should have went to an Aborigine. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>I draw attention to that because he was appointed to the top position. I understand that that was the decision which was made although at that time <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McEwen</inline> was not even an applicant for the top position. A little further on in the discussion, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Munro,</inline> another member of the executive, said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Before we vote, gentlemen, there's just one thing that Bill said, to carry on from there, about an Aboriginal in that position, I think there was one nomination, wasn't there?

          </quote>
          <para>What was said then is unclear on the tape. There was reference to another Aboriginal candidate who was not appointed. Again before the meeting voted, <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Skuta</inline> who took the recording, said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>
              <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chairman,</inline>could I just make one comment, seeing that David Anderson, you know, never came for the interview, possibly, you know, when he does come back and we know what he's up to or what he's intending to do, possibly later on he can meet with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McEwen</inline> and you know, because he is the only Aboriginal we 've got in Australia today that has got the qualifications of that top position. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>There was further discussion. Someone said: </para>

          <para class="block">Just before that statement was made they had voted in favour of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McEwen</inline> over the two other candidates who were in the final ballot. At the end of this discussion <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Skuta</inline> said: </para>

          <para class="block">I suggest that it is very clear that it was a very important discussion, that it was put before the Executive that David Anderson was overseas and not available, and that he was not chosen for those reasons.

              <para>-The position then becomes, if anything, more strange. On 13 September <inline font-weight="bold">Mr David</inline> Anderson received two identical circular letters. They are letters from the National Aboriginal Conference and are signed Gregory N. McNamara, Interim NAC Secretariat, Canberra'. Certain parts of the letter have been filled in by hand and the rest is a normal letter telling someone that he has not received the appointment to the position. The parts that have been filled in by hand seem to me to bear the same handwriting as that of the person who signed the letter, that is, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McNamara.</inline> The interesting thing about both documents is that they are dated 6 August 1978. Apparently they took five weeks to be received by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anderson;</inline> but, significantly, they are dated two days before the Executive meeting which made the decision to appoint the Secretary-General and the Director. I do not know the explanation for that. I do not think our mails are so bad that those letters would take so long to reach <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anderson.</inline> I cannot understand why they should be dated and telling a person that he was not appointed to the position two days before the appointments were actually made. </para>

It also stated that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McNamara</inline> had advised that he sent a letter to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr David</inline> Anderson on 2 1 July. But the Minister's letter did not enclose a copy of that letter. It spoke about the way in which the panel went about trying to obtain a candidate. It finished with this somewhat curious remark: </para>

          <para class="block">I presume that he means the Racial Discrimination Act. I had not at any stage made any suggestion that there had been any breach of that Act and I do not understand particularly that reference. </para>
          <para>Since then I spoke to the Minister last week at some length. I have endeavoured to get him to ascertain the facts of this matter. I have not proceeded particularly quickly with this matter. I think that I have perhaps been a little slow in proceeding with this matter, but I have endeavoured to find out by all means possible the circumstances of the matter and an explanation for them. I have endeavoured to find out why this man, who appears to be the only Aboriginal in the particular field with the qualifications, was not appointed; how statements were made that he was out of the country: how letters were sent to him which took five weeks to arrive and which were dated before the appointments were even made; and why I cannot get hold of a copy of the letter alleged to have been sent to him, and nor can the other people concerned. </para>
          <para>I think that clearly an injustice has been done. I have suggested to the Minister and I now suggest to the Senate and to the Minister for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Guilfoyle)</inline> that it is patent that any such appointment should be set aside so that there can be a reconsideration of a candidate who was passed over in these circumstances. I suggest that there needs to be an explanation as to how this set of circumstances came to pass. I therefore trust that this matter will get deep consideration by the Ministry and that in fact there will be an early answer to the matters which I have put on the record and before the Senate tonight. </para>

            <para>- I want to talk about the Ranger uranium mining problem. I want to place in their right chronological context the events that have taken place, particularly over the last few weeks. I am motivated to raise this question tonight because of recent statements by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> and in particular by the  Deputy  Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> that, regardless of the Aborigines' wishes, uranium mining will go ahead. Last Thursday in this House we saw the Minister for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Guilfoyle)</inline> read into the record a personal letter that had been written by the Opposition shadow Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Australia to </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Galarrwuy</inline>Yunupingu, the  Chairman  of the Northern Land Council. I understand that the authority that was given by the  Chairman  of the Northern Land Council to have the letter used in any way thought fit was given as a result of the exercise of white pressure on him. </para>
          <para>The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Viner)</inline> in another place also read into the record the same personal letter. I have not seen that happen in this country since the days of the famous Document 'J' in the phoney Petrov investigation. This is one of the last resorts in a political battle being fought by this Government to ensure that uranium mining is carried out at any cost, including the cost of the lives, health and everything else of the Aboriginal people. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Everingham</inline> wrote that letter. I think it was properly described by the Leader of the Opposition, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden,</inline> as a caring letter from a caring man. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Everingham</inline> followed it up with another letter which made some explanations and I will come to that in a few moments. </para>
          <para>There are a number of other things I want to say firstly because I think the morality of this Government has reached the bottom of the pit. It is scraping away at every piece of mud it can find in an effort to discredit the official Opposition of this Parliament, I have never seen it happen in my 13 years as a senator. I was amazed that the Minister for Social Security produced a copy of that letter. Obviously she was embarrassed by it. She wanted to incorporate it. If she were prepared to go that far into the political gutter obviously the only thing that the Opposition could do was to make her read it into the record. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Viner</inline> in another place was equally disturbed and if the Prime Minister, with his standover tactics, had not been sitting beside him and saying 'go on, keep reading' he also would have tried to have had the letter incorporated. Obviously both of the Ministers were carrying out a very unsavoury part of their political work that neither of them wanted to do. The place to stand up against the Prime Minister is in the party room, not to try to get things incorporated or to read a letter in either House. As I said, it will go down in history not as Document J but as document V and document G. It is a disgrace to the Parliament of this country and both Ministers will live to regret it. </para>
          <para>Galarrwuy Yunupingu has been forced to submit not by any pressure applied by the Labor Party, as the Deputy Prime Minister in particular is so fond of repeating, but because of the powerful forces within this Government and the powerful forces outside this Government. I refer in particular to the mining organisations. I asked a question in this House recently. It was quite an important question. It is recorded at page 1155 of the Senate <inline font-style="italic">Hansard for</inline> 10 October 1978. This was the question to the Minister: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I preface my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs by reminding the Minister of a statement that I made in this place on 26 September 1978 regarding pressure being applied to members of the Northern Land Council by the Prime Minister, the  Deputy  Prime Minister and the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs in order to get uranium mining under way. I also remind the Minister that the Government made a promise that the Land Council would be allowed to meet without any outsiders being present, and that there would be no coercion by it. I further remind the Minister that a Government senator sat in on a meeting of the Land Council a few days ago. I now ask the Minister: Was the Government representative <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> of Queensland? Were all proceedings of the meeting taped, except when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> was speaking, when the recording equipment was switched off? Which Minister directed <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> to attend the meeting? What instructions were given to the Government senator to pass on to the Land Council, and were instructions given to him to apply pressure for mining to commence? Finally, why did the Government break its promise to the Northern Land Council by instructing a Government senator to attend that meering, although a Government spokesman had made a public statement that no pressure or coercion would be applied to the Northern Land Council? </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Minister replied: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>When the previous statements were made in September I had some advice from the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. However, I have no information relating to meetings in recent days which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> is stated to have attended. I will seek that information from the Minister and advise <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> accordingly. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That was on 10 October- more than a week ago. Yet to date the Minister has not been able to come up with an explanation. The Minister does not know what is going on, has not been able to bring up a reply and obviously <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> is now under a cloud. I have always given <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> more credit than to have become involved in this rather underhand manner. It is of no use saying that he was not at the meeting because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bishaw-</inline> I will have more to say about him shortly- was the man who drove him to the meeting room. The facts as stated in that question are correct. Again it is a matter of using another black man for the sake of mining uranium; nothing else. It is the same as the Government using Charlie Perkins and a number of other Aborigines who are employed in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. </para>
          <para>Last night I walked into this chamber to participate in the examination of the estimates for the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. I have never been so disgusted in my life. I am not blaming the representatives of the Department at all because most of them are decent and honest people. Last night one of the senior advisers was able to make two blatant mistakes within the space of 15 minutes and I was not going to waste my time listening to untruths about what is happening in the Department. One of the senior advisers said: 'The Department has got more money now than it has ever had in the whole of its existence '. That is not true. We do not have to live in this country on a tissue of lies, misstatements and falsehoods. We do not have to live in this society in a fog of misstatements, untruths and distortions, but that is what senior representatives of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs now have to do in order to keep their place in the Department. One of the most unfortunate victims of the whole set of circumstances is Charlie Perkins. </para>

              <para>-That is not a bad sort of an interjection. Carrying the Government is enough to break anybody's back in the present circumstances, particularly in the field of Aboriginal affairs. Last night at Estimates Committee C I asked a question about a company that had been formed in my own city of Townsville to look at the possibility of fishing for beche-de-mer. The Government has wiped all responsibility. The company has gone bankrupt. It has been taken down by one of the best con men in history. He has over a period of years taken down a number of Aboriginal enterprises and the Government is not worried about it. It says: 'It is a private enterprise; we are not worried'. I was in Darwin in the last year or so and I was told by somebody working in a hardware shop that a departmental officer came in and wanted parts to repair a caravan; it was not for his caravan. He did not admit that. He wanted parts to repair a caravan that was on a particular Aboriginal settlement. When he was told that there was no caravan on that settlement he hastily departed from the store because obviously he was getting the parts to build his own caravan. There is at the moment in the Northern Territory a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Randell</inline> who has changed his whole lifestyle in order to see uranium mining go ahead. </para>

          <para>The struggle for power in all countries today is very great. I do not suppose we had ever thought that we would see come to Australia the distortion and dishonesty that we see today in government of this country. It goes back to the days when we were fighting over petrol prices to see what was going to be paid for crude oil from Bass Strait when a Prime Minister of this country disappeared in the surf off the coast of Victoria. There has been no satisfactory explanation about how that happened. When I mentioned that by way of a remark to this chamber some few weeks afterwards I was howled down as making a false accusation. Honourable senators may remember that the next Prime Minister signed an aide-memoire with a number of oil company representatives present, but not all of them- not all of those who were entitled to be in attendance at the consultations. Some of them complained to me afterwards because I was associated with a certain committee at the time that they had not been given a fair go. Now we come to uranium which is a finite energy resource anyway. It is doubtful whether it will last for 20 years. There is an unhealthy immoral attitude on the part of this Government in trying to get the uranium out of the ground. The cost is going to be very great for this country, to the countries that we sell it to and particularly to the Aboriginal people. </para>
          <para>Again I refer to the Labor Party. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> I have a number of documents which I propose to have incorporated. If I am not given permission to have them incorporated I will read them into the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> We can ask ourselves questions. We can ask who made tours overseas quite recently in an endeavour not only to sell the uranium but also to provide the background so that the uranium would be sold and mined with a minimum of inconvenience to this Government. We can ask whether a certain bank account was opened in a foreign country. As I noted in one Press statement today, we can also ask whether a knighthood is going to be given in a certain area. Not so very long ago a knighthood was given to a prominent member of the Australian Labor Party and the trade union movement. It was the end of his political and industrial career. If that knighthood is awarded in this area, it will be the end of somebody else 's career. It is very sad that this sort of incentive has to be used. </para>
          <para>We can look back into history and remember that only a few weeks prior to 1 1 October 1975 a certain international organisation was able to make a public statement that there would be a change of Government in Australia and uranium mining would go ahead. Because of the limitation of time tonight, I am not going to refer to another matter which I want to raise but which I will raise in this House in the next week or two. That is the conspiracy by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> and the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Viner)--</inline></para>

              <para>- I refer to the newsletter published by the Environment Council of the Northern Territory of recent date, September 1978. It refers to the Jabiluka project and I believe that it ought to be read out rather than just incorporated. It states: </para>

          </continue><quote>
            <para>While the signing of the agreement between the Northern Land Council and Ranger partners seems to have left the way open for Ranger to commence work soon, the same cannot be said for Pancontinental's Jabiluka project. </para>
            <para>Over the last month there have been repeated calls for a full public inquiry into Pancontinental's proposed operations. Statements on and actions connected with Pancontinental's final EIS for the Extension of the Arnhem Highway have been the catalyst for most of these calls. </para>
            <para>The Federal Labor spokesman on Urban and Regional Affairs, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Tom</inline> Uren, claims that Pancontinental had begun work on the Arnhem Highway extension before environmental approval received wide publicity. He said that Pancontinental had cleared a path much wider than that needed to survey the road and that this work continued even after the final EIS had been completed. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Uren</inline> also called for a public inquiry into the whole Jabiluka project. </para>
            <para>However, these allegations were denied by both Pancontinental and the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Groom.</inline></para>
            <para>As we mentioned in the last edition of the newsletter, many people challenged Pancontinental's assertions in its draft and final impact statement that 'no sites of significance were discovered or reported in the vicinity of the proposed route '. </para>
          </quote><para class="block">That is of the Arnhem Highway extension. The newsletter continued: </para><quote>
            <para>Apparently these challenges were strong enough to cause the Department of Aboriginal Affairs to instruct one of its officers, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ted</inline> Tonkin, to reinvestigate the matter. Pancontinental in its final EIS had repeatedly cited the original DAA investigation as proof of the absence of sacred sites along the road alignment. </para>
            <para>The new survey was carried out by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Tonkin,</inline> representatives of the NLC and traditional owners of the area. It was by no means exhaustive, covering only seven kilometres of the proposed road from Hades Flat to Jabiluka Saddle. However, contrary to Pancontinental's assertions, traditional owners pointed out seven sites of significance to Aboriginal people within this seven kilometres. </para>

          </para><quote>
            <para>A report of this survey was prepared and copies sent to the Minister and secretary of the Departments of Environment, Housing and Community Development and Aboriginal Affairs. In an accompanying press release, the acting  chairman  of the NLC, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gerry</inline> Blitner, called for a full public inquiry into the proposed Jabiluka project. </para>
            <para>
              <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline>and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Isaacs</inline> (the opposition leader in the NT) also called for public inquiries. </para>
            <para>However, on September 1, the Federal Government announced that it had given approval for a 13km extension of the Arnhem Highway and a temporary road linking the extension to the existing Oenpelli road. Approval was also given for the upgrading of pan of the Oenpelli road. The significance of this move was that alternative alignments which swing to the west of the escarpment outlier could be considered later. in spite of assurances by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Groom</inline> that the road goahead did not pre-empt the decision on the main Jabiluka operations, aborigines regarded the move as direct provocation. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Groom</inline> said that 'any road works undertaken would be entirely as the company's risk. ' </para>
            <para>The  chairman  of the NLC, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr James</inline> Yunupingu, then reported that aborigines might not sign the Ranger agreement and so a meeting was hastily convened between the Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser, Mr Yunupingu, Mr Viner</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anthony.</inline> The result of this meeting was that the Commonwealth Government reversed its decision to allow the Arnhem Highway Extension to proceed when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Yunupingu</inline> agreed to recommend that the NLC accept the draft Ranger agreement. In effect this means that the Government will consider the mine and the highway extension as one although some people have suggested that the Arnhem Highway extension was agreed to to enable <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> to have some leverage for his final negotiations with the NLC. </para>

I am not exposing private correspondence in the same way as two Ministers in this Parliament did last Thursday. I would now like to refer to a document entitled: 'Recommendations to the Council '. There has been a repudiation of the original terms of settlement. We all remember that as part of the original deal in respect of royalties to be paid to the Aboriginal people the Arnhem Highway would not go ahead. But that is not what happened when it came to talking to the  Chairman  of the Northern Land Council. This is what he said: </para><quote>
            <para>I would like to recommend to the Northern Land Council the possibility of road construction as a continuation of the Arnhem Highway to the 13 km limit as a combined effort by Pancontinental and Queensland Mines.

Here is a strong, Aboriginal leader who has backed down on the things he said only a few days before, in the same way as we saw Charles Perkins tonight in this chamber, and last night in this chamber, down on his stomach because the Government has driven him there; it is driving the Aboriginal leaders to the stage where they have nowhere else to go except on their stomachs, crawling to the Government. We saw <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner,</inline> a man who in the Aurukun and Mornington Island situations put up a strong stand. What does the Government do? The Government sends him there to pimp on its behalf and to talk to the Land Council to drive its uranium deals. Galarrwuy goes on to say: </para><quote>

            <para>I, as Chairman of the Northern Land Council, have had talks with the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, in which I have put this Council's views before the Government and have come to an agreement without prejudice. </para>

He said to Galarrwuy: 'Shut-up'. Those were the words that were publicly reported. The  Chairman  of the NLC said: </para><quote>
            <para>The Ranger Agreement is one of the first agreements negotiated with the Commonwealth and the Aboriginal people through the Northern Land Council and. therefore, having in mind that in good faith we have done what we have and shown our decision very strongly in our negotiating now we have to show a very strong decision and show our final decision in the way of meeting, approving and confirming that agreement, without showing that this Council is unworthy of negotiating with the Commonwealth and the mining companies in the future. I hope and trust that this Council will prove to the Government and the mining companies that we can come to a decision with understanding and through our political involvement, that we are reliable and trustworthy of building a future on our land which has been recognised and granted to us by the Government. </para>

              <para>- I want to quote now from some sections of the so-called simple English version of the Ranger agreement prepared by the legal officer of the Northern Land Council following the injunction preventing the signing of the uranium agreement. I want to read this into <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> because it would need a Philadelphia lawyer to understand it, yet we expect the Aboriginal people to understand some of the complex legal attitudes that the Government has used as one more of its bullying tactics. This document was left at Croker Island with the instruction that it was not to be shown to any European because it had been written in simple English especially for Aboriginal people. It was to be read only by them. The following extract is the answer to a vital question concerning whether or not the open-cut holes are to be filled up after the mine finishes. This was one of the basic demands of the traditional Aboriginal land owners and is a point of very serious discontent. Whilst the opencut holes are supposed to be refilled at the cessation of mining in that area, engineers associated with the mining companies have said that they will not do it. But what is the Government doing about it? Not a thing. The extract states: </para>

          </quote><para class="block">This is simple English- </para><quote>
            <para>The other pit (called number 3) would be about half filled by the rest of the tailings. If that was the end of the story and nothing else had to be done it could be true that a big hole is left which could fill up with water. </para>
          </quote><para class="block">That is the great fear. This is where the seepage will come out, with contamination of the water because of the residue of the uranium mining. The extract continues: </para><quote>
            <para>But that is not the end of the story. If we look at Clause 30 of the Section 4 1 authority together with Clause 5 of the Section 44 agreement of which the section 41 authority is annexed we notice that Clause S says that the miners shall observe all environmental requirements, specified in the conditions of the Section 41 authority. So we can make them do all that is in Clause 30. Clause 30 is grouped with other Clauses under the heading 'Vegetation Protection'. But that heading cannot be read so as to interpret Clause 30 (see Clause 21 (B) of the Section 44 Agreement), so Clause 30 has to be interpreted on its own words within the whole of the Section 41 Authority. This means that there is no undue emphasis on 'vegetation' in interpreting Clause 30. We are dealing with 'environment' (see Clause S Section 44 Agreement). </para>

I do not care who directed him to go there. It is not his fault that he was there, because he was bludgeoned by the Government into going there. He should never have been there, because the promise was made by the Prime Minister and by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs that no outsider would be there. It does not matter whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> is black or white. He is a supporter of a Liberal Government and he had no right to be at that meeting. Honourable senators opposite did it; that is the point. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bishaw</inline> is the man who drove him to the meeting place. I say now that if there is not an open and public inquiry this country is well on the way to a dictatorship and you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> and honourable senators on that side of the chamber will not know where <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> is leading you because he will use every possible thing to knuckle under to the great financial interests of the uranium mining companies. </para></speech>

            <para>- I am sorry that I was not in the chamber earlier, when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> started his tirade. It is a kind of unwritten law in this place that when an honourable senator is going to say something in the adjournment debate he pays those he may wish to take to task the courtesy of notifying them that he will be speaking and saying some things about them. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe,</inline> in his usual manner, did not see fit to proffer to me that kind of courtesy. Nonetheless, I forgive him. As people often say about we Aborigines, he is a victim of his circumstances and his environment. </para>

          <para>Tonight and on 10 and 12 October, as I saw from reading <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> saw fit to mention me in this chamber in my absence through illness. Twice in one evening in this chamber I have witnessed the complete hypocrisy and duplicity of some members of the Labor Party. The sheer hypocrisy of them! They pretend to be the champions of the underdog and the Aborigines. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> stood here tonight and gave us a tirade on how he was so concerned for Aborigines and their rights. Twice in this chamber tonight I have heard Aborigines attacked by members of the Labor Party- firstly by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> at an Estimates Committee meeting and later by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> who attacked me, a proud Aborigine, one of those whom he alleges to be one of the champions. That is hypocrisy of the highest- or lowest- order. </para>
          <para>On 28 September 1978 the Senate adjourned for a week's break. On 29 September I returned to my State of Queensland. On 30 September I visited Darwin in the Northern Territory on the invitation and heart rending plea of my very close and dear young friend, an Aborigine, Galarrwuy Yunupingu. He asked me to go to the Northern Territory because he wanted me to sit and talk with him about many things that were concerning him. One of the main things concerning him, in his own words to me in the quietness of his home, was what a number of people were trying to do to the Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory. He was ably supported, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> in his condemnation and criticism of some members of the Labor Party by none other than the shadow Minister for Aboriginal affairs who sits in your gallery this evening. </para>

              <para>- That is true. I was given a copy of a letter. I give all due credit to the person who wrote the letter for his feelings, understanding, sympathy and empathy with the Aboriginal people, particularly Galarrwuy Yunupingu. The letter says so. The first paragraph of that letter is very enlightening. It is more than enlightening; it is a condemnation of people like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe.</inline> I will read the first paragraph this evening because it has been read before. I would not have used the full letter myself; I would have used a paragraph. I certainly would not have named the author. The first paragraph states: </para>

          <para class="block">I emphasise the words 'most of them on the Labor side of polities'-  care more about stopping uranium mining or changing the Government in Darwin or Canberra than they do about Aborigines or land rights. </para>
          <para class="block">What a condemnation that is by one of the colleagues of honourable senators opposite of a number of members of the Australian Labor Party. That is exactly what they are doing in the Northern Territory, led by none other than a man who was mentioned in the Senate tonight by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe.</inline> I refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bob</inline> Collins. He is leading the confusion that is taking place in the Northern Territory at the moment. </para>
          <para>I answer <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> and I dare him to call me a liar. I was invited to Darwin. I was not sent by any Minister or by any member of the Government. I went up there of my own free will. I went to Darwin because of my genuine heartfelt concern for what is happening to my people- people of my blood. These are people of my skin group, people of my toten and my bigum. Does the honourable senator understand what that word bigum means? Of course, he would not. He would not know what that means. These are people of my own bigum. I did not have the ticket bought for me by the Liberal Party of Australia. I did not have a ticket bought for me by the Government. I had that ticket on the aircraft paid for by the taxpayers of this country- my constituents in Queensland who gave me the right to move around my State and around this country to look into matters of concern to me and to this nation. What is happening to the Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory is of concern to this nation. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline>accused me of being sent to Darwin by the Government. He said that I had no right to be at that meeting. I had every right in the world to be at that meeting, as did the four other Aboriginal observers who were invited to that meeting. I ask honourable senators to notice that I said 'four other Aboriginal observers'. There were a number of non-Aboriginals- a number of balanda, as the Aborigines would say in the Northern Territory, breaking their necks to get into that meeting. They were told quite firmly by the  chairman  of that meeting and by the members of the Northern Land Council that they were not welcome because they were balanda. In other words, they were white people. The members of the Council said to me: 'You are youlngoo like us. You are one of us. You can come in as an observer'. They said the same thing to the other four or five youlngoo We were invited in as observers. </para>
          <para>In my usual way, I walked in to the room very quietly and sat in a chair right at the back of the meeting. The  chairman  spoke to the councillors very quietly. He then came to me and said: Brother, you are important to us. You come up to the top table. You do not sit at the back. We want you at the top table '. They invited me to sit at the top table with the  chairman  and two other prominent members of the Council. The meeting started with the  chairman  reading out a document which was read by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> tonight and which is alleged to have come from that meeting. That is an absolute lie. That document was given to the people to read by members of the Labor Party prior to the meeting starting. The  chairman  read the first paragraph and threw it away. He said, 'We do not want that. That is from balanda. We youlngoo we make up our own minds. We talk about what we want to talk about, not that rubbish'. </para>
          <para>After that meeting, the same members of the Australian Labor Party issued that statement to the media as supposedly coming out of the meeting as the determination of the Council. That is untrue- it is not the determination of that Council at all. It is a lie. That document was prepared and handed around because I received a copy of it before the meeting started. It was not discussed and not even considered by the Council. It was thrown aside in disgust, and the members of the Council proceeded without any documents whatsoever. But after the meeting that document was mysteriously handed around to members of the media and represented as being the determination of that meeting. That is an absolute lie. </para>

I am sorry that this had to happen here this evening. It is the second occasion on which members of the Labor Party- I do not say the Labor Party as a whole because there are some very fine people in that party and I have no quarrel with themhave shown themselves to be hypocrites. There are members of the Labor Party who are certainly very hypocritical and they have shown their hypocrisy this evening on two separate occasions when two Aborigines were attacked at an Estimates Committee hearing in this chamber by those purporting to be the champions and supporters of Aborigines. They support Aborigines while Aborigines do not try to be their equals, do not try to determine their own future, and do not start to raise their heads above the crowd. This type of person cannot abide such developments and will attack viciously those Aborigines who try to equal them or even, on some occasions, better them. </para>

          <para>I categorically deny that I was asked, sent, cajoled or in any other way persuaded to go to the Northern Territory. As I said in the beginning, I went there because a young man asked me to go to discuss with him a number of issues that concerned him. The kinds of issues that concerned him were his role as Chairman of the Northern Land Council, the kind of criticism that he was receiving and Government attitudes. He wanted me to discuss with him the land rights Bill and many of its clauses because he was a little concerned about the steps that the Northern Land Council was taking. He was well aware of what was embodied in that legislation. He knew that, as always, the white man has the last say. The white man has the last say over Aboriginal land rights because the Government has the power to either put in an arbitrator or use the national interest clause. Galarrwuy was well aware of this. He wanted me to sit down and discuss these matters with him to confirm his understanding of the Bill and its implications. He felt that I, as a fellow Aborigine who is a member of this Parliament and who was present when this Bill was debated and passed through this Parliament, would have a little more understanding of the parliamentary procedures. He wanted me to sit and to talk with him. This I did willingly. </para>
          <para>On the Monday that I was there Galarrwuy did not attend the Council meeting.  His Deputy Chairman  was chairing it. I met the  Deputy Chairman  in another part of Darwin when a problem existed in relation to some of the itinerant tribal, traditional Aborigines who had come into Darwin and were living on some of the reserve lands around Darwin. The Darwin Corporation- the local council- was treating them rather shoddily and we organised for them to have a meeting with the Mayor of Darwin in order to get these problems sorted out. On both of these occasions I was with the  Deputy Chairman  who chaired that meeting. He asked me whether I would like to go around to the meeting. He said to me: 'I cannot tell you that you can come to the meeting and be present at the meeting until I get there, open the meeting and ask the members of the Council whether they will let other Aboriginal observers into the meeting'. That he did, and I stood outside the building. He then came out and said: 'Yes. There are other Aboriginal observers at the meeting and you are most welcome to come in'. That is how I came to be at that meeting. I did not go to Darwin in the first place to attend the meeting. It just happened to coincide with my visit there. Following my meeting with the  Deputy Chairman,  who chaired the meeting, I was asked by him to go along and I willingly did. As to some of the other matters mentioned, yes, the tape recorder was switched off. </para>

              <para>-While I was allowed to speak and ask questions, I was not allowed to cast a vote and, according to the Deputy Chairman, anything that I said was not to be recorded. Only what was said by the councillors was to be recorded to enable the preparation of minutes. They did not have anyone there who could take the minutes of the meeting. So they used a small tape recorder which could be taken back to their office and one of the typists would type up the transcript of the minutes of the meeting. </para>

          <para>I was not part of the meeting because I was not a councillor so anything that I had to say was not relevant to the minutes of that meeting. It was only on invitation from the  Chairman  that on occasions I, as well as other Aboriginal observers, made comments. But we were told quite categorically that we were observers, that we could speak only when we were invited to do so and that we could not vote. We were told that we were there strictly as observers. That was adhered to strictly throughout the whole meeting. On two occasions I spoke on the invitation of the  Chairman  who, without any prompting from me, switched off the tape recorder when he asked me to comment or to give some information on various points that were raised. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> the accusations made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> are nothing really to me. They are just a lot of fabrications by him. He has no knowledge of what transpired at that meeting; he was not there.

            <para>- On the same matter, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> I think that a few things need to be said after what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> has said. On this occasion I am not the arbitrator who says who is more correct, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner.</inline> But I do think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> protested too much and did his case some harm in doing so.  His  protests suggested that there might have been some guilt which he thought could be overcome by his protesting and shouting in this chamber.  His  attitude was different from the attitude of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe. Senator Bonner,</inline> in attempting to justify his actions or to give what he claimed to be an explanation, did great disservice to some who he says are his friends. Honourable senators on this side of the chamber have criticised a Minister of the Government for reading a personal letter into the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> assured us tonight that he would never mention the name of a person who wrote such a letter. So, he has disowned anyone who would read a personal letter into the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record and has made a condemnation of one of his own Ministers. </para>

          <para>He then made known publicly that, because of a remarkable series of coincidences, he was in Darwin at the time of the meeting in question and at the invitation of his great friend Galarrwuy Yunupingu. At the present time Galarrwuy </para>
          <para class="block">Yunupingu is under severe criticism, sufficiently so for the honourable member for Capricornia, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Everingham,</inline> to write to him and to try to console him somewhat. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> said that Galarrwuy Yunupingu has asked him- a senator from the Liberal-National Country Party Government, who as such is a party to the legislation under which the Aborigines may be suffering at the present time- to attend the meeting. Two issues are involved. The letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Everingham</inline> which is now public property, is possibly one of the most understanding letters that could be written by any man who has a concern for another individual who finds himself in trouble. </para>

          <para>I heard an interjection earlier stating that the letter was very revealing too. It is no secret that a big section of Australian public opinion is opposed to uranium mining. It is no secret that possibly more opposition would be found within the Labor Party than within any other group. Labor's policy is that while we are not opposed to uranium mining, we are opposed to the mining and export of uranium when we do not have sufficient knowledge about safeguards to protect the human race. It is not a question of uranium mining being placed above Aboriginal rights: It is a question of concern for all the people of the world, not just a group of Aboriginals. </para>
          <para>The question of the Northern Land Council has been a mess-up from the time it was first discussed. I know Alex Bishaw and those associated with the Northern Land Council. I do not know whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> explained the land rights legislation to them. If the traditional owners decide that the land is not to be mined it cannot be mined under any condition unless there is a declaration by the Governor-General on the recommendation of the Government that such mining is in the national interest. But the Government can never declare that this mining is in the national interest. It is not for the defence of Australia. It is not for the protection of Australia. It would be an admission that the Government's economic policy is such that it cannot continue without royalties that could be obtained from mining a dangerous material and exporting that danger to someone else overseas. The Government would never accept that. However, if the Aboriginals, the traditional owners, agree that the uranium can be mined but they cannot agree on the terms with the mining company, an arbitrator should then come in. </para>
          <para>The Northern Land Council has a statutory obligation to discuss the question with the Aboriginals living in the area and to have the consent of the tribal owners. That is a sine qua non of the whole Aboriginal land rights legislation. The Council has to have this approval. On no account was the Northern Land Council prepared to sign the agreement without the approval of the traditional owners. The Northern Land Council has accepted such approval because it is made up of delegates from each area who may or may not be traditional owners, or who may be only one of many traditional owners. But at the time the Council went to get the approval, which it has a statutory obligation to do, the traditional owners said: 'No, we are not prepared to sign the agreement'. So the Aboriginal land rights legislation has been carried out to its entirety at this stage. Whether the traditional owners are prepared to permit mining in the area under any conditions is another question. </para>
          <para>But let us not get too emotional on this question as to who is at fault and try to blame someone. Let us be realistic. The people who decide whether the land can be mined are the traditional owners of the particular area. Let us leave the matter for their consideration. This will not break the Government. Australia will not be ruined if mining does not take place for two to five years. Let us tell Galarrwuy Yunupingu, who has been a great spokesman for the Aboriginal people, that if he is in trouble because of the pressure of the Government and the mining interests to have the land in that area mined, many in the Labor Party, not only <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Everingham,</inline> will assist him. </para>
          <para>The future of this land is still unknown, but it is worth noting that Galarrwuy Yunupingu praised <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Everingham</inline> and described him as one of his greatest friends, the one white man he would trust above all others. That is an affinity, a loyalty and a service and these things must be remembered. I suppose that, being white, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Everingham</inline> could not attend the meeting, but he has a good reputation in the north of Australia as shadow Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. </para>

            <para>- I do not intend to traverse what has already been said by other speakers. I wish merely to summarise my view of the episode in Estimates Committee C. Very simply, I felt that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> was inclined to be a wet blanket as far as the expenditure by successive governments in endeavouring to alleviate the plight of Aborigines in the Territory is concerned. I said very bluntly what I felt about it. I also chastised one of the witnesses, Charlie Perkins, because I felt that nobody was defending the expenditure proposed by the Fraser Government for this year. I felt that the Northern Territory colleague of mine was implying that the money was not producing any return. I said that if only 10 Aborigines had better eyes and ears, as compared with the vast numbers who have had ailments in other years, it represented an achievement. I said that simply because I felt that the witness, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Perkins,</inline> did not sufficiently come into the play and act as militantly as he had been renowned for. That is the semblance of what I said. The Minister for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Guilfoyle)</inline> showed her usual commendable restraint, as did the <inline font-weight="bold">Chairman, Senator Walters,</inline> who was equally efficient in the way in which she handled the matter. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>For <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner's</inline> benefit let me say that I am a volatile person, but I like to believe that 1 can serve it out without being worried about a person's background or anything of that nature. I believe that if people merit criticism they should get it. I leave this thought with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner:</inline> He would know that I have done so twice across the border in Queensland. On one occasion a white town clerk at Normanton asked for it, and he got it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> would know of that situation. That person is still suffering from shock and if I ever go there again he will get another serve. </para>
          <para>The other one will be know by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner,</inline> and concerned an appointee or agent of the Whitlam Labor Government who was engaged in employment registration in the particular town in question. He spoke disparagingly of Aborigines as being non-employment statistics. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> would know that that man got a good serve, and that when I came back to Canberra I told the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs that the man was unfit to be an agent for the Government. So I can assure any honourable senator, especially <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner,</inline> that if I feel people merit criticism I am not worried about their background in giving it. I never take advantage of a witness but I think that, upon reflection, Charlie Perkins would know of my track record and of what  I  did to one or two racists in Queensland.  I  can assure honourable senators that when  I  go home to bed tonight  I  will not lose any sleep about what happened in Estimates Committee C. Politics is a robust game and if you give it out you have got to be able to take it.  I  never squeal for the Chairman's protection, although  I  do commend the Minister for Social Security for her attitude when the flak was flying around, and also <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walters</inline> who, as  Chairman  of the Committee displayed a high degree of tact. </para>

            <para>- Quite some time ago <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> raised the matter of an appointment which was sought by a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr David</inline> Anderson.  I  know that the honourable senator referred to correspondence which had been exchanged with the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Viner);</inline> that on 3 October a letter was sent to the Minister and that a reply came back a little later.  I  can only say that  I  will draw to the attention of the Minister the correspondence that was mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen,</inline> to see whether any further information or response can be given on the matter. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> this evening raised at great length many matters, and made certain substantial allegations. Those allegations, which were many and varied, and involved the tabling of certain material will be drawn to the attention of the Minister. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I  want to say that some of the statements that were made in regard to my colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> and in regard to witnesses who appeared before Senate Estimates Committee C do bear some comment from me because of my attendance at the Committee hearing.  I  feel that the statements that have been made about witnesses at the Committe hearing are to be answered by a member of the Government or by the  Chairman  of the Committee because as public servants they are unable to answer for themselves in a way that might be appropriate in any other circumstance. Having sat on Senate Estimates Committee C for the past two days, dealing with the estimates for the Department of Aboriginal Affairs,  I  must say that  I  admire the patience, knowledge and skill of the departmental officers who are in attendance. Perhaps there is a feeling of some frustration amongst members of the Committee or the honourable senators who attend from time to time when we are looking at Aboriginal programs and the achievements that may have resulted from them.  I  would only want to say that  I  believe that each government needs to build on what has been done by the government preceding it and that it is a long and continuing program that will see the benefits that we all hope to achieve in education, health, housing and generally in making Aboriginals equal members of our society. </para>
          <para>I  think that what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> referred to as an exchange- a fairly volatile one, as he expressed it- between him and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> could be regretted in some way but perhaps understood in others. The  Chairman  of the Committee was able to deal with the matter in a way that maintained the importance of the committee system by which we are able to have an exchange of views and to seek information.  I  think that any embarrassment to officers who are attending a committee hearing would need to be regretted because  I  think we are aware of their responsibilities as public servants to serve the Government and the Opposition and to give whatever information is required at Estimates committee hearings.  I  feel sure that as we proceed with the examination of the estimates for the Department of Aboriginal Affairs there will be continued interest in what is being undertaken in the various programs and through the grants that are made.  I  am sure that we all would hope that considerable achievements will result from what are in some cases attempts simply to understand the questions and to give the answers. </para>
          <para>I  would only say, in regard to the matter that was raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> and followed up by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh,</inline> that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs undoubtedly will wish to respond to the matters raised this evening. As  I  said, substantial matters were raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe.</inline> I feel sure that there is a good deal of information to be read by the Minister and  I  expect that an appropriate response will be made by him when he has had an opportunity to read the material that has been presented to the Senate this evening. </para>

The Treasurer has provided  the  following answer to the honourable senator's question: </para>

            <para>I am aware of reports to the effect that the Corporation of Insurance Brokers has a list of the kind referred by the honourable senator. </para>
            <para>Since becoming aware of these reports I have received a letter from the  President  of the Corporation of Insurance Brokers of Australia indicating that the Corporation does not hold such a list. The  President  also drew attention to the obligation resting upon all reputable brokers to exercise the utmost professional discretion in selecting underwriters with whom to place their clients' business, and explained that the way in which each Corporation member discharges this obligation, including the question whether or not the member maintains a list of underwriters with whom the broker will or will not do business, is a purely internal consideration for the individual broker concerned. </para>
            <para>While I am, for obvious reasons, unable to make any statements that could be taken as applying to particular companies, I can say that the Insurance Act 1 973 provides for a comprehensive system of supervision of general insurance companies by the Insurance Commissioner and that I am not aware of any basis for questioning the general strength and stability of the industry. </para>

            <para>-On 13 September 1978 <inline font-style="italic">(Hansard,</inline> page 527) <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> asked me, as Minister representing the Treasurer, a question without notice concerning applications by the States for loan funds. In responding to the honourable senator's question I said that it was my understanding that the matters he raised concerning States' submissions to Loan Council in respect of loan funds for infrastructure financing were under review, and I undertook to seek further information for him. The Treasurer has now provided the following information in response to the honourable senator's question: </para>

            <para>As announced in Press Release No. 52 of 23 June 1978, the Loan Council resolved at its June 1978 meeting to establish a working party of officials of all States and the Commonwealth to examine and report back to the Loan Council as soon as practicable on proposals that had been submitted by the States for consideration under the guidelines for special additions to the semi-government borrowing programs for infrastructure financing, to assist the Loan Council in its consideration of them. It was noted that the size and phasing of the program would have to be decided in the light of the assessment of the projects and national economic and monetary policy considerations. </para>
            <para>To date, officials have met on four occasions since the Loan Council meeting on 23 June, and I understand that a report by the working party has now been completed. </para>
            <para>Further process following receipt by Loan Council of the officers' report is, of course, a matter for the Council, but while the subject matter is important and complex and will require careful consideration, it is the Government's wish that the matter should be resolved as expeditiously as possible. </para>
