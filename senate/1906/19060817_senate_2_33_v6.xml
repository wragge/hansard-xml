            <para>- The question of wireless telegraphy is being dealt with by the Postmaster-General, though, of course, it has incidentally come under my notice. I believe that my honorable colleague is making the necessary inquiries into the different systems in operation, with a view to adopting one in connexion with the Post Office, and which would also help so far as defence was concerned. . He has not, I understand, arrived at any conclusion ; at' all events, he has not yet brought the subject before the Cabinet. If the honorable senator will give notice of a question, I shall ascertain exactly how the matter stands. </para>

      <para>It is extremely advisable - in fact, it is necessary - that, if possible, Parliament should be prorogued early in October, at the very latest. There is a large quantity of work to be transacted, and I am anxious to se cure sufficient time for the Senate to deal with the many measures which appear on its notice-paper, and those which will come up from another place. At the present time our notice-paper includes the Australian Industries Preservation Bill, which I hope will be read a second time to-day, the Judiciary Bill, the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Survey Bill, the Audit Bill, and a Constitution Alteration Bill, and I have obtained leave to bring in a Quarantine Bill. From the House of Representatives there will come up a Parliamentary Elections Bill, a Bounties Bill, a Postal Rates Bill, a Copyright Act Amendment Bill, and Tariff Bills, one of which- that relating to spirits - is expected to <inline font-style="italic">he</inline> here next week. Then we have to consider the Estimates of Expenditure. The Estimates relating to new works are embodied in a separate Bill, which we can amend ; but the Estimates in chief are embodied in a Bill in which we can only request amendments. It will be seen that there is a great quantity of business to be transacted. Unless we sit four days a week, I doubt whether we shall be able to close the session as early as is desirable. I therefore ask the Senate to agree to meet on Tuesday whenever it is necessary. On account of a number of honorable senators visiting certain proposed Capital sites, I do not propose to ask the Senate to meet on Tuesday next until 3.30 o'clock. </para>

          <para>- The honorable senator will not be in any worse condition than the members of another place, who took a similar journey last week-end, and yet met on Tuesday last at that hour. ' I think I have given sufficient reasons to justify the Senate in passing the motion. If I should find that the work progresses at a rate which will enable me to get the paper cleared within the time I mentioned without meeting on Tuesdays, I shall certainly not ask the Senate to meet on that day, but I have my doubts on the subject. When it is recollected that, although the second reading of the Eminent Domain. Bill was moved on the 18th July, its last stage was not reached until the 9th August, it will be seen how long it takes to deal with important Bills. </para>

        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Col. NEILD</inline>(New South Wales) [10.41]. - I rise to oppose the motion, because the Minister does not propose to take for the consideration of Government business the time which is allotted to so-called private business, though he must know, in view of what has happened in another place, that it would be perfectly useless for the Senate to deal with private business, inasmuch as it could not be dealt with there. All that could be done in that regard would be simply a sort of electioneering placard. </para>

            <para>- I was led away by an interjection, sir. It would be very much better for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> to secure for the consideration of Government business the time which is reserved for the consideration of private business, as his colleagues have done elsewhere, than to ask honorable senators to make the sacrifice of attending on an additional day. Perhaps my objection does not apply to those who live in Melbourne, and have rio engagements here, but I take it that it applies to Victorian senators who have engagements on Tuesdays. Certainly it applies to the senators from South Australia and New South Wales ; therefore one-half of the Senate is materially interested in this demand for an additional day. If we are simply to debate propositions on Thursday afternoons, when we are actually alleging that the urgency of public business requires the giving up of a further day, I do not think that it augurs very much for the commonsense of the Senate. The other House, with double our membership, and certainly with a|ri equal power of oratory, can get through with its business in four days a week, but we, with less than half its membership, were asked to devote as much time to legislative work. </para>

            <para>- If the Minister were to adopt my suggestion, it would be very much more to the public interest as it would provide for the .continuity of Government business on three days a week, and avoid having a paltry attendance on the Tuesday, and an interruption in the middle of the week for the discussion of academical propositions. For those reasons, I oppose the motion*. </para>

        <para class="block">The intention of my amendment is to make compulsory the holding of four sittings per week. I believe that it is absolutely necessary, if the business of this Parliament is to be done, that we should sit as often as the other House. I was extremely surprised to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild's</inline> remarks with reference to private business. There is no member of the Senate who monopolizes so much of the business-paper as he does. I "have now come to the deliberate conclusion that he has merely been guided by advertising motives. But there are some honorable senators who are anxious to pass Bills and take in hand matters which the Government has refused to deal with. Why should any obstruction be placed in their path? It appears to me that the attitude of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> and other honorable senators in this respect is not only belittling to themselves, but to the Senate. We ought not to hand over our responsibilities to a select section of members of this Parliament. We are responsible to the public, and, if we believe that certain measures are necessary in the public interest, it is our duty to bring them forward. If we do not sit four days a week, the Government will at the first opportunity snip away the whole of the time allotted for private business. There is a vast amount of business to be done before the session closes. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> has enumerated a number of measures, in addition to which, I suppose, we shall have the Tariff amendments before us soon. Of course, I am aware that a number of senators go home to New South Wales and South Australia every week-end, and probably only the most insignificant members will be left to do the work on Tuesdays. The big guns will not come along until Wednesday. But they should not on that account prevent the little pistols from being fired off. </para>

          <para>. - - If we adopt the motion of the Minister, we shall merely be following a precedent which has been set on former occasions. It appears to me to be absurd for some honorable senators to have so much regard for their own interests, as opposed to the interests of the public, when we remember that throughout the session the members of another place have been sitting four days a week, whilst we have sat only three, and have had an adjournment for three weeks. There seems to be not the slightest doubt that we shall have sufficient business to keep us occupied four days a week until the end of the session. In addition to the business already on the notice-paper, several measures are in an advanced stage in another place, and will soon be ready to be dealt with by us. I trust that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild's</inline> suggestion that private business should be abandoned will not be entertained at present. No doubt, as the session advances, the time for private business will have to be absorbed by the Government ; but I hope that for a short time longer that will not be necessary.

The responsibility is upon the Government to proceed with business, and to ask the Senate for such time as is considered necessary to enable that business to be dealt with satisfactorily. But I wish to ask honorable senators to consent to alter the motion so as to provide that we shall not sit until 3 o'clock on Tuesday. I am satisfied that there is no desire on the part of any one to inconvenience those who take advantage of the week-end to return home. Meeting at half -past 2 on Tuesdays will be inconvenient to a number of us. We arrive at the railway station at about half- past 1, and it will be recognised that the hour which elapses between that time and the hour of meeting is insufficient to enable one to attend to the little personal comforts which, of course, suggest themselves. I therefore ask the Minister to agree to an alteration to the effect that we shall <inline font-style="italic">pot</inline> meet until 3 o'clock on Tuesdays. Half-an-hour will not make a material  difference, whilst the convenience to honorable senators will be considerable. </para>

            <para>.- The Minister of Defence, in moving the second reading, dealt with the prevalence of trusts, pools, and combines in the United States, laid before us the dictionary definitions of the various terms applied to this large-scale business, and added the definitions supplied by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tregear,</inline> the Secretary of Labour in New Zealand. The Minister's speech dealt largely with generalities, and, so far as I was able to follow him, there was an entire absence of any reference to the existence of trusts or combines within the Commonwealth. It was only towards the conclusion of his speech, when he referred, to dumping, that his remarks had any local application. " Dumping " is a word that conveys many meanings. During my stay in the East last year, I visited Hong Kong, and there I heard and read a good deal about " dumping." A few years ago, it appears, plague, in a very serious form, took possession of a portion of the city ; not that Hong Kong is ever free from plague; but, on that occasion, hundreds of Chinese and many whites lost their lives. The British authorities, in their extreme anxiety to get the plague under control, resorted to drastic measures. A number of Chinese habitations were destroyed, and those that were left, together with the goods and chattels, were fumigated in a way they had never been fumigated before. This, of course, meant a serious loss to the Chinese merchants, and the result was that, if the death of a Chinaman was attributed to plague, the owner of the house where it occurred, threw, or what was called in the East " dumped," the body into the street. It was no uncommon thing, when I was in Hong Kong, to find the morning newspapers contain startling headlines, such as " More Dumping," " Two More Cases of Dumping," and so forth. </para>

              <para>- No, in the English newspapers; and very creditable productions they are. Then we have heard of " wool dumping," which I understand to' mean a process of compressing and binding bales of wool for export. I do not suppose that such " dumping " would come within the meaning of the Bill. Another illustration of "dumping" was afforded by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kirwan,</inline> the representative of the Cigarmakers' Union, who, in giving evidence before the Tariff Commission, strongly and justly complained about what is called the " dumping " of inferior machine-made cigars by a local octopus, the tentacles of which are stretching throughout the world. This dumping, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kirwan</inline> pointed out, is a detriment to the local trade and a serious injury to cigar operatives, who were fully employed before the introduction of the monopolistic machine. The Minister, in introducing the Bill, had nothing to say in regard to .this machine, or the evils created here by the monopoly I have indicated. Is this Bill intended to defeat the object the Labour Party has in view, namely, the nationalization of such industries ? Or is the Bill a sop to those gigantic trusts? The promoters of the Tobacco Trust have no doubt been laughing up their sleeves at the possibility of the passing of this measure, because they know, by experience of similar legislation in America, that they can ride the proverbial coach and four through such, enactments. The Tobacco Trust is a menace to the operatives engaged in the manufacture of cigars. The monopolistic machine turns . out cigars at a cost of <inline font-style="italic">66.</inline> per  100,  whereas the cost by hand labour is 2s. 6d. per 100.' There <inline font-style="italic">a.te</inline> now a few small manufacturers! by hand who conduct business on a <inline font-style="italic">£5</inline> licencefee, and they find it almost impossible to make a living, owing to the competition of the machine. Further, the Tobacco Trust has the consumers within its grip, and the growers of tobacco are at its mercy, owing to there being only one buyer for, leaf. To this trust, it is a matter of indifference whether there be a high Tariff or a low Tariff. </para>

              <para>- Not at all. The trust has an almost entire monopoly of locally-produced tobaccos and cigars ; and if the Tariff were altered to-morrow, the trust, with its additional monopoly of importation, would be able to charge consumers whatever prices it liked. True, the Tobacco Trust has made no move up to the present time; and th'e reason is that public attention has been so focussed on this subject by the proceedings of the Tobacco Commission, and by the numerous addresses delivered bv advocates of collectivism, that any procedure likely to raise the* opposition or hostility of the general public, would create a demand for nationalization forthwith. When this trust began to feel its way in New Zealand it did so rather gingerly. Eventually, however, it got possession of about 95 per cent, of the trade, and then it proposed to increase the price of tobacco by 2d. per lb. At this point, however, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Seddon</inline> said, " I am watching the operation of the tobacco combine, and if there is to be a monopoly the State is most entitled to it." </para>

              <para>- A newspaper with' a certain influence, a certain atmosphere, and a certain cover. I will now leave the tobacco business for a few moments in order to say something with respect to dumping. I am inclined to believe, from what I have heard and read, that there is no doubt whatever that this Bill would never have seen the light of day if it had not been for the agitation conducted .by certain people interested in the manufacture of a certain kind of harvester. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith,</inline> perhaps deservedly, paid a high compliment to the energy, push, and perseverance of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> as an inventor. I think that we can also compliment <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> on being a persevering, pushful man, alive to the advantages of a full measure of protection for one section of the community, and on being a patriotic protectionist in his own interests. He would, as I would if I had the power, build a big wall round the Commonwealth to prevent the importation of goods which can be made in this country ; but, side by side with that protection, I should insist on the fullest measure of protection to all employed in the protected industries. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> would not do anything of the kind. He believes in free-trade in labour. In this respect he is not unlike other men, some of whom are parading around the Commonwealth now as patriotic protectionists, and one of whom is touring abroad on behalf of the Commonwealth. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Charles</inline> Atkins, who, according to newspaper reports, is announced as a candidate for the Senate at the ensuing elections as a protectionist Liberal, said last year, as F resident of the Chamber of Manufactures, in delivering his annual address: "Our cry should be: Fight for the Tariff and freedom of contract." What he advocates is a high Tariff, and all the protection possible for the so-called captains of industry ; but for the men who are asked to help in securing that measure of protection he asks freedom of contract- the non-recognition of trade unionism. That is a fine doctrine to be preached in this enlightened day - freedom of contract, and the nonrecognition of the principles of trade unionism, the minimum wage, Conciliation and Arbitration Acts, and so on. He is not likely to secure the support of any working man with a policy of that kind. Then there is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale,</inline> the ex-President of the Sydney Chamber of Manufactures, who has, I understand, a commission from the Commonwealth, and has been sending long reports more or less interesting for publication in our newspapers. When President of the Chamber of Manufactures he said in Sydney something to this effect - " Fight all you know how for high protection, but we must not have it at the expense of labour legislation." The members of the party to which I belong, free-traders and protectionists alike, will be no party to secure for manufacturers high protection, unless the workers get a share of the benefits derived from it. Then we have <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hugh</inline> McKay and his brother. Honorable senators who have followed the history of factories legislation in Victoria are aware that it is a notorious fact that for a long period of time the most sweated trades in this State were the most' highly protected trades. I was a member of the Trades Hall Council of Victoria at the time the agitation in .. support of factories legislation and Wages Boards was at its height, and at considerable expense and effort that council endeavoured to rivet the attention of the community on the damnable sweating conditions existing in many trades that were highly protected. There was bitter opposition to the reform we advocated, namely, the establishment of Wages Boards. After a time we were successful in securing the recognition of our principles by legislative enactment. In order to extend that measure of beneficial reform in the interests of the masses in Victoria, we desired that the agricultural implement making industry should be brought under the provisions of the factories law. In 1 901 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Laidlaw,</inline> a representative of the Agricultural Implement Makers' Union, visited Ballarat, and talked to the men in the Sunshine Harvester works, of which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> V. McKay and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. G.</inline> McKay are the principals. It was decided, after an informal chat, that the employes, together with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Laidlaw,</inline> as representative of the Agricultural Implement Makers' Union, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> V. McKay, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. G.</inline> McKay, should meet to discuss the matter. They met in the Trades Hall at Ballarat, to consider the advisability of the industry being brought under the Wages Board provisions of the Factories Act of Victoria. After <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Laidlaw</inline> had addressed the men in terms of high commendation of factories legislation and Wages Boards, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> V. McKay said - </para>

              <para>- In all probability, they did not. There are some employers who in case of sickness or distress - so far as youths are concerned, at any rate - pay a full week's wage. There are other kinds of employers, who, in such cases, are known to make small deductions from boys' wages. They even go into fractions in order to ascertain the exact amount to be deducted.

We are all right as we are." By the Lord Harry ! this Commonwealth would be a beautiful place to live in if all men engaged in protected industries were of that mind !

              <para>- They complained about what they called the unfair competition of the importers at a time when they were parties to an agreement with the importers ; and they asked for a fixed duty of ^25 on each harvester imported. They received a sympathetic reply. ' The International people then said in effect, " These manufacturers have broken away from the agreement they have made with us." It appears that the local manufacturers promised that if they could get the measure of protection that they asked for, they would, in the first year, reduce the price of their harvesters by <inline font-style="italic">£5,</inline> and in the second year, would make a reduction of <inline font-style="italic">£10.</inline> Immediately that decision was made known, the International Harvester Company decided' to reduce the price of its machines. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> last night endeavoured to show that the price at which the International Company was now selling was below that at which harvesters could be manufactured and sold in Australia. Strange to say, however, I am credibly informed that one of the local manufacturers, a party to the agreement, is to-day selling a machine at <inline font-style="italic">£68</inline> 5s., which, while the agreement was in operation, he was selling for <inline font-style="italic">£81</inline> The International Company is selling »t ,£70. </para>

          </continue><para class="block">It is said that its machines at one time came in invoiced at <inline font-style="italic">£26.</inline> I have been searching, and cannot verify that statement. It is true, however, that -the International Company imported harvesters invoiced at £31 5s., while the Massey-Harris Company imported them at ^38. But at that time, the machines of the International Company were of a lighter make and of a different type from those which the Massey-Harris Company were importing. After the Minister decided to increase the valuation of the International Company's machines to the invoice price of the Massey-Harris machines, £38, trie International people commenced to make a heavier machine. I am informed, and I think correctly, that those machines can be made for between .£30 and £35. If there is any truth in the contention that a huge company with a large capital can afford to manufacture cheaper than a small man, it stands to reason that the International Company can make harvesters cheaper than the local manufacturers. </para><interjection>

              <para>- Yes. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> moved from Ballarat to Braybrook he got within a mile of other manufacturers in the same business, who were bound by an Act of Parliament to observe the conditions to which I have alluded. Braybrook is about ten miles from Melbourne. At places like Spotswood, Newport, and Footscray, although these are, so to speak, within a stone's throw of Braybrook, manufacturers have to observe conditions from which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> is exempt. As a matter of fact, I have very little consideration for or approval of the importation of goods which can be manufactured in Australia, and I desire that to be clearly understood. But, as a protectionist who wishes to see the establishment of industries, I "Have no desire for the perpetuation of an evil introduced by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> in connexion with an important industry. If an industry cannot extend reasonable conditions to those it employs, it ought not to survive. </para>

              <para>- The Chief Secretary and his departmental officers, while no doubt desirous that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay's</inline> works should be carried on under the conditions imposed by the. Factories' Act and the Wages Boards, were probably influenced to a considerable extent by the petition of the men to be exempt. But there is not the shadow of doubt in the minds of those capable of judging that, to use a colloquialism, the petition was hawked round. I cannot think for a moment that any body of workmen, of their own volition, without the exercise of influence in a certain way,' would sign a petition to be exempt from conditions beneficial to themselves. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Play-</inline> ford, in introducing the Bill, said that we were told that the United States is cursed with trusts because it is a protectionist country. But I assert that fiscalism has little, if anything, to do with the creation of trusts and combinations, which are the inevitable result of the capitalistic-competitive system. The old theory that competition is the life of trade has long since been exploded. If competition is the life of trade, it is the death of businesses. Trusts are an economic development ; they exist in every country throughout the world. There are some trusts that are perfect typhoons in the sea of competition. They absorb everything that comes within their influence; and as the result of typhoonic trusts, human wrecks can be seen in almost every part of the world. The capitalistic-competitive system is just about a century old, but I venture to say that it is doomed not to see another hundredth birthday. Condemn these trusts as we. may, we must recognise them as an economic development, which may, after all, prove only a blessing in disguise. They demonstrate as clearly as the noonday sun that the position taken up by the advocates of collectivism is indisputable. By complete organization, and with the aid of immense capital, trusts are able to introduce the latest and most scientific methods of production, and to effect immense economies. With these concrete examples before us in the form of privately-owned trusts, we can readily see what a manifold advantage it would be if industries of the kind were under the control of the State - if they were not conducted on a system which creates a few millionaires on the one hand and countless mendicants on the other. I hold that all privately-owned trusts are inimical to a nation's progress. I hold further that, notwithstanding what anti- Socialists may say, competition has succeeded only by what I call a process of commercial cannibalism - that is, the eating up of small businesses by large ones, and large businesses by still larger. Let us view the position of working men in America in regard to these trusts. When there is a combination of firms, the workmen or workwomen have only one employer ; and that is the case in many lines of industry in America. </para>

There were periods, prior to the expansion of the competitive system, when a man with small capital, and endowed with energy and intelligence, could start on his own account, and probably become very successful in business. But in the United States of America to-day what hope has a small man of starting successfully in any line of business in opposition to the huge trusts ? </para>

              <para>- I never knew a self-made man in any country on earth. No man can, by his individual efforts or enterprise, become wealthy, but men may, and frequently do, become wealthy by the united efforts and industry of those who work on their behalf. Very often those who pass as self-made men owe little or nothing to their own ability, their wealth having been won for them by subordinates, who, in some cases, have received very small remuneration for their services. What is the position of the working men under some of the combines in America ? We often hear people talk about the tyranny of trades unionism, when some trades unionists conscientiously refuse to work with non-unionists, who have done nothing to advance the. interests of the working classes, or of human kind. That is said to be tyranny of the worst description; but it is nothing of the kind. On the other hand, what is the tyranny exercised over the workers employed by the huge combines of the United States ?

I have said that all privately-owned combines and trusts are inimical to a nation's progress; because they, so to speak, have the community in the hollow of their hand. Some of these trusts in America silence newspaper criticism. I can quote a case in point, and I think I shall be able to show, after quoting it, that it has some local application. There is .in America a patent medicine trust with a capital of £50,000,000. The retail price of the cure-alls sold by this patent medicine trust in the United States in one year is estimated, according to a writer in <inline font-style="italic">The World's Work and Play,</inline> at £20,000,000, of which sum £8,000.000 is spent in newspaper advertising, with the object of silencing any agitation which may be got up to condemn these quack medicines. I have here the issue of <inline font-style="italic">The World's Work and Play,</inline> for June, 1906, in which I find the statement made that the President of the Patent Medicine Association, in addressing the members of that Association quite recently, said - " The twenty thousand newspapers of the United States make more money from advertising the proprietary medicines than do the proprietors of the medicines themselves. Of their receipts, one-third to one-half goes for advertising." </para>

              <para>- I am referring now only to the advertising of patent medicines. There is a certain patent medicine called "Peruna." Honorable senators will have noticed in various newspapers published throughout the Commonwealth that it is very extensively advertised, in quarter-page and half-page advertisements. It is highly recommended by an ex-senator of the United States of America, and it appeals, to everybody with any kind of complaint. They will sell you a bottle for 5s., and if" that does not cure you, they advise you to&gt; buy six bottles for 25s., and you will be all right. This Peruna contains as much alcohol as does whisky, brandy, or rum. It contains from 40 to 50 per cent, of alcohol, as has been proved by analysis made by the Customs Department here. </para>

              <para>- I was going to deal with that. It is a remarkable thing that, although a certain firm was fined in Brisbane for selling this " disguised booze," only one newspaper in Australia published the details of the case. That is not my statement, but a statement appearing in the <inline font-style="italic">Journal of Pharmacy,</inline> and this is attributed to the fact that the newspapers throughout Australia received large sums of money for advertisements of this patent medicine. </para>

              <para>- I do not care whether they do or not. I have the greatest respect Tor and confidence in the men who do the work of journalism in the Commonwealth, but I am aware that there are literary surgeons in the editorial sanctums who use the knife freely. I worked as a compositor for many years, and if there was one thing more than another that hurried on my desire for democracy and fair play, it was my knowledge of the unfairness of the proprietors of newspapers that howled for democracy and fair play but did not practise what they preached. The article to which I have been referring says with respect to Peruna: - </para>

          </continue><quote>
            <para>Any one wishing to make Peruna for home consumption may do so by mixing half-a-pint of cologne spirits, ninety proof, with a pint and a half of water, adding thereto a little cubebs for flavour, and a little burnt sugar for colour. It will cost in small quantities perhaps 3½d. or 4d. a quart. Manufactured in bulk its cost, including bottle and wrapper, is about 4½d. . . . "A compound of seven drugs with cologne spirits " is the authenticated formulae of Peruna, but the total of the seven drugs is less than one-half of one per cent, of the product, and cologne spirits is the commercial term for alcohol. What makes it a curse to the community is the fact that the minimum dose first ceases to satisfy, then the moderate dose, and finally the maximum dose; and the unsuspecting patron who began it as a medicine goes on to use it as a beverage, and finally to be enslaved by it as a habit. The American Government forbids the sale of this " medicine " to Indians, because, says the Treasury department, " it leads to intoxication." A druggist in a southern "nolicence " town remarks upon the large sale of Peruna there. </para>
            <para>I have seen persons thoroughly intoxicated from taking Peruna. The common remark in this place when a drunken party is particularly obstreperous is that he is on a " Peruna drunk." It is a notorious fact that a great many do use Peruna to get the alcoholic effects, and they do get it good and strong. </para>

              <para>- I am referring to some of the operations of the patent medicine trust of the United States who are introducing this nostrum to Australia to the serious injury of the health of the people. It is recommended as a cure-all for 'adults, and also strongly recommended as a cure-all for infantile complaints. An infant is supposed to take a spoonful of Peruna before each meal, and if that is continued for a week or two there will probably be very little of the infant left. I know that there is extreme anxiety that the debate should close, and I desire to say in conclusion that this measure has been enthusiastically approved by a number of Government supporters, whilst it has been severely condemned by other honorable senators. Speaking personally, it is not a Bill over which I can enthuse. I will admit that it has been framed bv a skilful mind. Perhaps it is the very embodiment of the wisdom of the wise, but I cannot bring myself' to believe that it will realize the expectations formed of it by the framers. I am satisfied that no system other than 'that of collectivism will be a cure-all for trusts. The anti-socialistic - individualistic - capitalistic system has had a long and varied trial. It is going to decay. I hope the time will soon arrive when there will be substituted for it some more scientific system. Like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> I am extremely desirous- to hasten that -time, but I am prepared to give this Bill a trial, and if it realizes the anticipations of its framers, no one will be more surprised than those who think with me ii» regard to the present system of society. </para>
