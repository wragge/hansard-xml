          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lt.-Col.</inline>GOULD (New South Wales) &#91;3.8&#93;. - The Senate is not by any means confined to the report of the Tariff Commission in dealing with the question of the spirit duties, for some years ago the House of Commons appointed a Select Committee - to consider, amongst other things, whether, on grounds of public health, it is desirable that certain classes of spirits, British and foreign, should be kept in bond for a definite period before they are allowed to pass into consumption, and to inquire into the system of blending British and foreign spirits in or out of bond, and into the propriety of applying the Sale of Food and Drugs Act and the Merchandise Marks Act to the case. of British and foreign spirits and mixtures of British and foreign spirits, and also into the sale of ether as an intoxicant. </para>
                <para class="block">It will be seen by honorable senators that the scope of the inquiry was very, extensive. In its report, the Select Committee says - </para>

                </quote>
                <para class="block">The duty of the Select Committee was also, amongst other things, to ascertain when the sale of the articles was deleterious. It consisted of well-known men possessing very great skill and ability. Besides the <inline font-weight="bold">Chairman, Sir Lyon</inline> Playfair, it included ten members. It took evidence in 1890 and 1891. During the course of the investigation, it became necessary to obtain evidence from well-known chemists as to the effect of spirits, and also to . take a large body of evidence as to how far it would be justified in recommending any change which might tend to harass or interfere with trade. At a later stage, I shall allude to the report, and I shall be able to show by extracts that there was a general conclusion arrived at to the effect that it was very undesirable and unnecessary to impose any time restriction upon the bonding of any spirits, whether distilled by patent still or by pot still. It was shown by the evidence that it was unnecessary in that country to take any of the precautions which are proposed to be taken in this Bill. I take it that the object of the Government in requiring the maturing of spirits in, bond for a period of at least two years is to meet the requirements of the public from the health point of view, and not to harass or interfere with trade generally. In his speech on Friday, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> stated that, from the revenue stand-point, the proposed change is very important, and that, although a deficiency of , &#163;80,000 or &#163;90,000, as estimated by the Government, might result during the first year, yet the loss would gradually increase until it amounted to &#163;200,000 or &#163;300,000 a year. I desire to reiterate that statement. I am quite sure that honorable senators do not want to be reminded of the fact that the expenditure of the Commonwealth is increasing year by year, that there are many additional services which have yet to be taken over, and that when the transfer is made we shall be confronted, at a very early date, with the alternative of either materially reducing expenditure or materially increasing taxation. It would be utterly useless for the Commonwealth to take over those services unless it intended to deal with them efficiently. The difference between the Excise duty and the Customs duty is so great that there can be no question but that the revenue would suffer materially, especially if, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joshua</inline> anticipates, his firm should distil 2,000,000 gallons of grain spirit in each year, and thus overtake the present consumption of imported whisky. We are all perfectly willing, I take it, to give fair and reasonable assistance to the distillers in the community, but not to such an extent that it would practically wipe out the revenue from the Customs, and leave the Commonwealth de- pendent solely upon the revenue from Excise duty. As honorable senators are aware, there is a difference of 3s. or 4s. a gallon between the Customs duty and the Excise duty ; and while the Government propose to give this great advantage to the local distillers, it is markedly given in favour of grain distillation in lieu of distillation from molasses. </para>

                        <para>- We are not raising the question of free-trade at the present time. We recognise that certain principles of government have been laid down for the Commonwealth, and while they remain in existence we are prepared to do what is fair and reasonable as between the various parties. I trust, however, that honorable senators will be able to see their way to alter the rate of Excise duty. When they bear in mind that the introduction of whisky into this State through the Customs represents 60 or 6 1 per cent, of the total quantity of spirits introduced, they will see how very seriously the revenue will be affected by the distillation of grain spirit. While it was shown the other day by the figures how distillation had grown in the Commonwealth since 1901, I do not think that special allusion was made to the way in which brandy distillation had increased in South Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> pointed out that while the distillation of spirits in Victoria in 1899 had amounted to 470,000 gallons, in 1905 it had fallen to 163,000 gallons. On the other hand, within the years from 1889 to 1905, the production of molasses spirit in New South Wales increased to 655,500 gallons; and in Queensland the distillation of the same class of spirits increased from 143,000 gallons to 390,000 gallons. These increases were pointed out as a counterbalance to the decrease in Victoria. But when we carry the case still further, we find that in South Australia, the brandy distillation in 1901 amounted to 172,000 gallons, as compared with 296,000 gallons in 1005. It is abundantly manifest that the distillation from wine and from molasses increased by leaps and bounds. While it is true that the distillation in Victoria decreased, it is equally true that in the Commonwealth, as a whole, there has been a more than commensurate increase. When these matters were mentioned the other day, an honorable senator interjected that Victoria had been contributing very freely to Queensland in connexion with the sugar duties. I have a memorandum here which will show what has been the facts in this connexion, so far as the revenue is concerned. Honorable senators must bear in mind that the duty is payable to the States, in accordance with the quantity of the article consumed within each State. Where in a State a larger amount is collected front Customs duties than from Excise duties, naturally there is a larger amount from the former source to 20 to the benefit of the State. </para>

                        <para>- Such are the conditions of trade, that Victoria will be slower in beginning to consume the locally-produced sugar than the other States. The effect of the position is very curious. I find that during the years1 902-3 to 1905-6, Victoria received .,&#163;173,800 more than she would have been entitled to on a population basis. That, no doubt, is due, as I have already said, to the larger importation, into Victoria of foreign-made sugar than of sugar made within the Commonwealth. While Victoria received the amount named in excess of what would have been her population proportion, New South Wales received ;&#163;i 58,000 less, and Queensland, ,&#163;54,000 less on the same basis. I quote this to show that whatever operations may take place within the Commonwealth, the revenue, or benefits derivable, will not be&#39; exactly equivalent for many years to come. This is, I think, a reply to the interjection, to which I have referred, that Victoria has contributed towards the bounty paid on sugar produced in Queensland. The fact just mentioned should not be taken as an argument for undue consideration being given to any industry that may be located in one State, as against an industry in another State. Where there are natural opportunities and advantages for any particular class of production or manufacture, the Commonwealth Parliament has no right to disregard the general prosperity, in order to add to the prosperity of any one State to the disadvantage of another. If honorable senators will refer to the Distillation Bill, they will find that distillation from grain is put in a far better position than distillation from grape wine, a.nd we may justifiably ask why this should be. We know that, while, there is a fair amount of production of wine, in Victoria, the great bulk of Australian wine is produced in New South Wales and South Australia, where the natural advantages are such as to lead to that result. If honorable senators will turn to the schedule attached to the Excise Tariff Bill, they will find an anomaly. Brandy distilled wholly from grape wine by a pot still or similar process, at a strength not exceeding 40 per cent, overproof, matured by storage in wood for a period of not less &#34;than two years, and certified by an .officer to be pure brandy, will bear a duty of 10s. per gallon. Then, whisky distilled wholly from barley malt by a not still or similar process, at a strength not exceeding 45 per cent, overproof, matured by storage in wood for a period of not less than two years, and certified bv an officer to &#39;be pine malt whisky, will also bear a duty of 10s. per proof gallon. In these two cases the Excise is equal. But we find that blended spirits distilled partly from grape wine and partly from grain, will bear a dutv of 12s. per proof rail nr : while blended whisky, distilled partly from barley malt and partly from other grain, will bear ai duty of us. It will be seen that there is a difference in the dutv of is. per gallon in the case of the two products last mentioned. How can the Government regard that as fair dealing with the wine growing industry of the country ? </para>

                        <para>- But the Government, and not the Tariff Commission, are responsible for the Bill, and have taken it on themselves to depart from the recommendations of the Commission in several respects. Under the circumstances the Government cannot turn round and disclaim their responsibility ; and I do not think that the proposals correspond exactly with the recommendations of the Tariff Commission i in this regard. In any case, the responsibility is with the Government ; and if the Government desire to deal justly as between the wine grower and the producer of grain spirits, the one and only course to adopt is to put them in exactly the same position in regard to quality as compared with those who produce other distillations. I recognise at once that distillation from molasses is much less expensive - the whole of the evidence clearly points to that conclusion - and there may be some justification for making the difference between the Excise charged on that class of distillation, as compared with the distillation from the grape or from grain. But there ought not to be so great a discrepancy as I have pointed out. Then I desire to direct the attention of honorable senators to the fact that there is a very unfair differentiation in regard to the ageing of spirits. Clause 10 of the Spirits Bill provides that after the 28th February, 1907, no imported spirits shall be delivered from the Customs for human consumption unless the Collector of Customs is satisfied that the spirits have been, matured by storage in wood for a period of not less tha two years. On the other hand, clause 11 provides that spirits distilled&#34; in Australia shall not be delivered from the Customs for human consumption unless they have been matured by storage in wood for a period of not less than two years, providing that the clause shall not come into operation until the 1st January, 1908. </para>

                        <para>- According to this clause, an extended period is granted in which Australian spirits under the age of two years may be put into consumption. It may be said by the Government in reply that there is a comparatively small quantity of Australian spirits to be obtained, and that it is, therefore, desirable that a longer period should be allowed in order to comply with the requirements of the Bill. But if the matter be regarded from the health point of view, I contend that there is a much better opportunity to obtain matured imported spirits than there is to obtain matured spirits produced locally. Spirits, before they are sent out from England or elsewhere, are fit, or presumably fit, for human consumption, and, in addition, there is the time occupied on the voyage, and the detention in bond. Under these circumstances, imported spirits ought to be very much more matured than would be the bulk of Australian spirits produced at any time between now and the 1st January, 1908. In any case, the Government have taken care to provide in the Bill against immature or unfit spirit going into human consumption. Clause 12 provides that if a Commonwealth analyst, after examining a sample of any spirits subject to the control of the Customs, certifies that the spirits are of bad or inferior quality and unsuitable for human consumption, the Minister may Order that they shall not be delivered until they have been methylated, and that thereupon the spirits shall be methylated before they are delivered. In the case of imported spirits, the clause provides that the Minister may permit the spirits to be exported or to be redistilled in Australia. With a provision like that, it is absolutely unnecessary, from a health point of view, to have clauses 10 and 11. I will show honorable senators later on that in Great Britain there is no time limit, under the law, for the maturing of any spirit. Of course, if any attempt were made to put into consumption a spirit unfit for human use, other laws would no doubt operate. There has been some discussion as to the effect of placing gin, Geneva, schnapps, Hollands, and such spirits in wood for the purpose of maturing. It is claimed that this is entirely unnecessary, and that such spirit matured in wood will become deteriorated by discolouration, and unsaleable. This matter was referred to the Minister of </para>

They represented, in the first place, that these spirits are absolutely fit to go into consumption as soon as they are placed on the market, that if they are kept in wood for a period of two years they will become discoloured, and almost unsaleable, and that possibly the quality of the spirit will be deteriorated. Their view is that the only way in which they are being met by the Minister is that, so far as they are concerned, the evil day is being put off for a further period of ten months by the following proviso to clause 10 of the Spirits Bill: - </para>

                <para class="block">There must be some reason for this proviso. The quantity of these spirits imported is small&#39; in comparison with the quantity of other spirits imported. From a return I have I find that during the past year the revenue derived from importations of gin, Geneva, Hollands, schnapps, and liqueurs was only 18 per cent.; as against 61 per cent, represented by importations of whisky. If, as is contended by wine and spirit merchants, it is unnecessary, from a health point of view, to mature these spirits in wood, and they will become deteriorated in appearance and, possibly, in quality if they are so matured, as a matter of fairness and common justice, I believe the Senate will be prepared to make some amendment in the Bill. The Minister, in dealing with this subject, produced two samples of gin in order to satisfy honorable senators that the maturing of gin in wood had no effect upon the spirit so far as its colour is concerned. </para>

                        <para>.- The Minister must be as well aware as I. am that a man who buys gin expects it to look as clear as water, and if he notices any discolouration at all he becomes doubtful as to its quality and value. I am in a position to produce two samples of gin which were handed tq <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> at a meeting which the honorable senator and I attended. They are samples of spirit imported into this State two years ago. Some of the spirit was racked off at once, and through some unforeseen circumstances a quantity was left in wood. I produce a sample of that which was racked off at once, and honorable senators will see that it is perfectly clear; and another sample of the spirit which was allowed to remain in the wood for a period of twelve months or mo:e. and it will be seen that it has become discoloured, and has the appearance of whisky rather than gin. The discolouration of the second sample is clue to the fact that the spirit was allowed to remain in the wood. If it could be shown that it is necessary in the interests of the public health that spirits of this kind should be matured in wood there could be no objection to the provision made in the Spirits Bill, but if it can be shown that this is not necessary in the interests of the public health there is, therefore, no reason why the Senate should pass a provision requiring these liquors to be kept in wood after the 1st January, 1908, for a period of two years. I am satisfied that the public who are gin drinkers would prefer a pure clear gin or schnapps to a spirit which has the appearance of whisky. In dealing with this matter I may refer to the Minister of Defence as one witness who supports my contention. The honorable senator pointed out that where spirits are highly rectified, practically all by-products and impurities are eliminated, and the spirits become colourless, neutral, and without any special characteristic. Gin, Geneva, and such spirits ate the product of this highly rectified spirit, with the necessary flavouring to produce the article of commerce. If that be the case. I contend we have no right whatever to do anything which would place any restriction on the trade. In the House of Commons report of 1901, to which I&#39; have previously referred, I find this statement with regard to patent spirits - </para>

                    <para>Is it not a fact that the spirits for making gin remain in bond only about one month ? - They vary. For instance, I have samples here where the length of time is thirteen days, eighty-four days, twelve months, tWo months, three months, and so on. I take it that it is the convenience of the market that is considered only. </para>
                    <para>In a communication which you sent to me, I see you mentioned the time as from one month to four years, according to the demands of trade? - Yes, I believe it is the demands of trade that govern it. I do not say that old gin is not considered rather finer than the other, but I do not believe it is really more wholesome. </para>

                        <para>.- That is the only place to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> can refer in support of the Government proposal, but in Canada it is not required that these spirits shall be matured in wood. The whole of the evidence given to the House of Commons Committee goes to show that this silent spirit, from which all by-products have been eliminated, is an absolutely pure spirit. When it is utilized&#39; to make any of the white spirits of commerce they are absolutely chemically pure and are not dangerous to public health. An honorable senator has asked me whether I am in favour of doing away with the time limit. I reply that, in the first place, the Government is unable to point to any country in the world except Canada where it is necessary to mature spirits for any time. But Canada is not a country in which white spirits are produced. Whisky is the spirit that is principally produced there; but while I admit that the ageing of whisky improves it, I still contend that there are other reasons that would induce persons to mature their whisky apart from any legislation we may pass. Not a word is said in the Canadian Act about spirit being matured in wood or otherwise. I have looked up the Act to make sure on the point. The whole question was considered by the English Committee, which says in its report - </para>

                <quote>
                    <para>Your Committee, with the consent of the Treasury, deemed it to be advisable to ask two of the highest authorities in dietetics, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Pavy,</inline> F.R.S., and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Lauder</inline> Bruton, F.R.S., to consider the whole evidence existing in this country, and abroad, in order to give their professional opinions for the guidance of the Committee. Their opinions coincide with those of the public, that old mellowed spirits are less irritating to the stomach than newly-distilled spirits. It is possible, as <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Lauder</inline> Bruton  suggests, that some new bodies hitherto unrecognised by chemical analysis may explain the fact that old spirits are more wholesome than new, but on this point we are in the region of conjecture, and not of established truth. Our present knowledge is insufficient to justify your Committee in recommending that all pot-still whiskies should be kept in bond for a definite period of time until the byproducts contained in them become mellowed by age, for it is only in pot-still whiskies that they occur in marked quantity, while their retention in bond would give an unfair advantage to the patent-still whisky made in Ireland and Scotland, as well as the chemically purer spirits made in England or imported abroad. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>It is perhaps rather a shock to honorable senators to learn that a great deal of the whisky imported from Scotland and Ireland is patent-still whisky. </para>
                <para>Both the medical men referred to hold the opinion that old spirits were more wholesome than new, though they did not think that there was sufficient justification for inflicting this hardship upon the distillers of pot-still whiskies. It is true that Canada has passed an Act to compel compulsory bonding of whisky for two years, but ,your Committee do not consider that it would be desirable to follow this example. </para>
                <para>Then the Committee says - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>The conclusion of your Committee is that, as the public show a marked preference for old spirits, which the trade find more profitable, and as the practice has arisen of blending whiskies with patent spirit, to fit them for earlier consumption, it is not desirable to pass any compulsory law in regard to age, especially as the general feeling of the trade is that such an obligation would harass commerce, and be an unfair burden on particular classes of spirits. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>I think that that evidence may be taken as a satisfactory answer to the question whether we should insist upon keeping all spirits in bond for a definite period. Again, the Committee says - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>Our general conclusion from the evidence submitted to us is, that compulsory bonding of all spirits for a certain period is unnecessary, and would harass trade. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">There are many other passages in the Committee&#39;s report indicating that what is now proposed would harass trade, and that there is every incentive on the part of the seller of whisky - and I presume that the same would apply to the seller of brandy - to produce a good article for the purpose of sale. I venture to say that no evidence whatever has been given before the Commonwealth Tariff Commission that counterbalances the evidence given before the English Committee. It is not as though the Committee reported without making full, complete, and ample investigation. It had certain duties to perform, and undoubtedly pursued its investigations conscientiously. It came to the conclusion that it was wrong to insist on maturity in bond, because it would harass trade, that there was no necessity to compel people who were producing pot-stilled whiskies to mature their spirits in bond, and that they themselves might be trusted to see that their whiskies were mellowed by age before being placed on the market. In any case, if this Bill be passed with clause 12 in it, ample protection will be provided for the general consumer. Under that clause, if an officer of the Commonwealth certifies that amy spirit subject to the control of the Customs is of&#34; Bad or inferior quality, and unsuitable for &#39;human consumption, the Minister may order that the spirits shall not be delivered until they have been methylated, or, in &#34;the case of imported spirits, permit their re-exportation or distillation in Australia. While I recognise the desirableness of maturity in the case of grain and grape spirits, I contend that, so far as concerns other spirits, what is proposed is absolutely unnecessary, would&#39; be unfair, would harass trade, and would treat importers improperly and unreasonably. Allusion has also been made to rum or molasses spirit. Some honorable senators are probably under the impression that it is necessary that rum should attain a certain age before it goes into&#39; consumption. But if rum is distilled at a low percentage of alcohol, it becomes an unsaleable production. I believe the technical term used in the trade is that it &#34; stinks,&#34; and is unfit for use. When it is distilled at a high rate it becomes saleable. </para>

                        <para>.- And here is a sample of gin which has been kept in wood for that period, and has lost its colour. I would impress upon honorable senators the necessity to deal with this matter on a clear and fair basis, and, while taking great care to safeguard the revenue, to do nothing which would interfere with commerce or harass trade, as the Select Committee of the House of Commons reported that a restriction of that kind would do. If an arrangement could be made for the acceptance of a certificate sent out by the exporters, or a declaration by the importers) that the whisky and brandy were of the full age of two years, there might not be much objection to the provision in the Bill, because we all recognise that those spirits are improved by that treatment. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that there are very good reasons why that should not be done, but I do not intend to go into them now, because that course is not proposed. When, the report was first presented, .there was a large number who desired to make the difference between the Excise duty and the import du&#39;tv is. per gallon less than is now proposed. I desire to increase the Excise duty in order to deal more justly with the revenue, and also more fairly between the States, and thus prevent an undue advantage from being given to one State. With regard to storage, I trust that the Senate will see its way to so modify the Bill as to provide that clause 10 shall not apply to gin, Geneva, Hollands, schnapps, or liqueurs, so that without a limitation as to time, those spirits may be introduced under fair and reasonable conditions. If we were to insist upon rum being matured in wood for two years, it would mean that the price to the consumer would be materially increased; in fact, we should be without a supply of the spirit for a considerable period after 28th February next. No doubt all the stocks would have been cleared out by that date, and then there would be none coming into the Commonwealth for a considerable period, because it would be utterly impossible for an importer to obtain any certificate or any evidence as to the rum being of the full age of two years. I do not suppose that it would be practicable to get other than the very much more expensive quality. </para>

                        <para>.- In approaching this question, the Senate is, I think, fortunate in having had the advantage of the investigation conducted by the Tariff Commission, and conducted with a. conscientiousness and a care which are highly commendable. So far as I have been able to judge, the evidence is of a valuable character, and will largely assist honorable senators to come to what I hope will be a just determination. When we find that there is a conjunction of free-traders and protectionists for the purpose of making a joint recommendation to the Parliament, I do not think that, we can attach too much importance to that extraordinary fact. I was almost under the impression that it was impossible for free-traders and protectionists to come to an agreement on a fiscal subject, but, in this case, after a full and lengthy investigation the representative free-traders and protectionists on the Commission&#39; found that so serious a wrong was being done to the distilling industry, that they were irresistibly driven to make a recommendation for its rectification. I anticipated that the Senate would attach so much importance to the recommendation as to follow the example of another place, and to practically accept it with little or no discussion. </para>

                            <para>- I do not care when the signature of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> was appended to the report. I know that it was appended, and that it covers the conclusions and recommendations to which I am going to refer. Under those circumstances, I do attach very great weight to the recommendations, and I think that the Senate should hesitate before attempting to treat them lightly. I cannot, however, shut my eyes to the fact that on the other side there seems, at least, to be a disposition to depart from the recommendations ; indeed, an anxiety on the part of some honorable friends to increase the Excise duties with but one object, and that is to continue the destruction of the distilling industry. I recognise that while <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> did not indicate his intention to depart from his signature, yet his unconscious bias led him to deal with a certain phase of the question in a way which left it open to some of the newspapers to say that the major portion of his speech consisted of an attack upon Messrs. Joshua Brothers, and I hope to show that some of his statements are very conclusively answered by the evidence and the findings. I shall endeavour not to travel outside that limitation. I regret that I have no <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report of the speeches made on the other side; but the reports in the press, necessarily condensed, will, to some extent, answer my purpose. In one part of his speech. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> said that the distilling industry &#34; was fairly and safely established now,&#34; and later on he said that - without one jot or tittle of protection the local distillery industry could hold its own against that of any part of the world. </para>

                    <para>The Commission go on to set out the disadvantages under which local distillers are placed. The first finding is an extraordinary verification of what appeared in the press when the Tariff was before the Parliament. Perhaps honorable senators will remember an interesting case in which a man named Fox sought to recover the sum of &#163;110 for conducting an agitation and writing a pamphlet. It was stated by the defendants that his remuneration for the agitation was to be the sum of fifty guineas; but, .apparently, they, did not assess his services at the same value as he did. The object of the importers who employed him was, of course, to secure the highest Excise- duty, and the lowest import duty. During the case, there came out some correspondence which I shall quote from the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of the 15th November, 1902. In the course of a letter addressed to, I think, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Burke, Mr. Fox</inline> says - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>It concerns me very seriously to find such a poor, and, I regret to say, humiliating, value put upon services as I conceive faithfully rendered, and embodying the use of special knowledge secured by me when holding a position of responsibility. . . . The agitation has been successful beyond our best hopes, so that distilleries are irretrievably crippled, and every one knows it. Surely results so patent and affecting importing interests so favorably from one end of Australia to another - interests represented by spirit imports of close on 000,000 annually - will be considered as meriting more than a beggarly pittance in favour of one whose labours and special qualifications were given freely and unstintedly. </para>

                            <para>- That, of course, was part of the purpose for which he was employed. It seems strange that, although protectionist representatives freely asserted at the time what was going on, the information was scouted by gentlemen on the other side. But now here, on the part of protectionists and free-traders alike on the Tariff Commission, we have an absolute and complete confirmation. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> then went on to say that the highest quality of whisky  came from malt, but that, from the point of view of wholesomeness, rectified spirit was as good as any. Molasses spirit, which, is the spirit to which considerable attention has been paid, is rectified to1 a degree of something like 67 or 68 overproof, when it becomes a neutral spirit or spirits of wine. If it can be proved* that this neutral spirit 1 is  equal  to grain spirit, then the report of the Tariff Commission may be thrown into the waste-paper basket as absolutely useless. This contention was advanced by several honorable senators, and emphasized by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake;</inline> and, as I say, if it can be shown that molasses spirit, which can be produced at a price ranging from 6d. to, say, is. per gallon., is equal to, and answers the purposes of, grain spirit, which costs 3s 6d. or 4s. per gallon, and, in particular, that it can be used for the making of whisky, the report of the Tariff Commission is so much waste paper. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake,</inline> after quoting from the evidence of the Tariff Commission, with a view to showing that silent spirit is quite wholesome whether made from grain or molasses, went on to say that the object of the Bill was to shut out from Victoria spirits distilled from molasses in New South Wales and Queensland, in order to restore the distilling industry in Victoria, and, practically, to kill, or very much depress, that industry so far as the two northern States are concerned. I desire to assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> that, so far as I have read the evidence and the report, neither bears such a construction. The proposals of the Tariff Commission are intended to encourage the production of molasses spirit, which has its own, and a great, sphere of utility. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> seems to narrowly think that all that is necessary is to obtain molasses spirit, and add a little flavouring when, hey, presto ! there was the whisky of commerce. The honorable senator never made a greater mistake in all his life; because, as a matter of fact, no one would purchase such a whisky. That spirit, though it may be wholesome, is not whisky, and certainly should not be sold as whisky ; and I say that the evidence and the report of the Commission clearly prove that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> is altogether wrong in his view. It is desirable to encourage the distillation of the .spirit to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> referred ; and nothing contained in the report of the Tariff&#39; Commission is intended to injure that industry in the slightest degree. The particular industry which the Tariff Commission suggests should be encouraged is the distillation of grain spirit; and this is a different class of industry altogether - the two have no connexion. I omitted to. mention, in reference to the addition of flavouring referred to bv <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake,</inline> that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilkinson,</inline> the analyst, expresses the opinion that flavouring essences are more injurious than alcohol itself. That opinion was expressed in the course of his evidence, and may be found referred to on page <inline font-style="italic">16</inline> of No. 2 report. I repeat that there is nothing in the report of the Tariff Commission to suggest injury to this industry in New South Wales and Queensland - an industry on the prosperity of which those States may be congratulated. At the same time, I desire to show that the Tariff Commission has most wisely differentiated and made it absolutely clear that it is the production of grain spirit they are anxious to encourage.

                        <para>That, in order to equalize the conditions of competition in the struggle between the better qualities of Australian spirit and inferior imported spirit, it is necessary that there should be a substantial difference between the Customs duty on the imported article and the Excise duty on the local article ; that, at the same time there should be relative equality of opportunity and competition among Australian products and that cheaply produced spirits should not be allowed to supersede superior high-class spirits. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">It will be seen that the Tariff Commission had this matter specially under their consideration, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> and the other members recommended that cheaply produced spirits should not be allowed to supersede superior high-class spirits, but - that cheaply produced spirits should pay a higher Excise duty than more expensive spirits : that spirits produced from molasses at gd. and is. per gallon should not be allowed to kill out the distillation of whisky from barley malt, which costs from 3s. 6d. to 4s. per gallon ; and that the consumption of cheap and inferior spirits should not be encouraged at the expense and sacrifice of spirits of higher grade, quality, and price. </para>
                    <para class="block">The other conclusions which deal with this particular question, but which I shall not read, are Nos. 12, 13, 17, and 18. All these conclusions represent the compromise, by which I apprehend all the signatories to the report will loyally abide. The confessed object of the report is to differentiate between molasses spirit and grain spirit. Messrs. Joshua Brothers, ora whom this attack was made, possess one of the finest distilleries in the world - a distillery specially designed for the production of malt and grain whisky and wine brandy. That firm has dealt with molasses spirit to a trifling degree, but it is not at all in their line, and was never intended to have been dealt with bv them until the Commonwealth Tariff forced them to distil a second-class brandy in order to compete with brandies of similar quality admitted into Australia. </para>

                            <para>- I shall very conclusively deal with that point later on. At present I am saying that Messrs. Joshua Brothers were forced by the Commonwealth to deal with molasses spirit to a small extent. The aim of the report of the Tariff Commission is to alter the present state of affairs, and bring about the production of the acknowledged whisky of commerce. Let me give an illustration. We have had the question of margarine before us on several occasions ; and margarine is simply mutton fat boiled .down and flavoured. Whilst this product is perfectly wholesome, it is not butter; and it is a gross injustice to our dairy producers and dealers in butter that this inferior article should be sold as butter. Hence the Legislature has come to the rescue and declared that if people desire to sell margarine it must be sold as margarine. And so with molasses spirits. If a bottle were labelled &#34; Molasses spirit with whisky flavouring,&#34; can it be suggested for a moment that there would be any purchasers? For the protection of the public it is essential that when they ask for whisky they should get what is known as genuine whisky, arid as the whisky of commerce. I think it was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fowler,</inline> a member of the Tariff Commission, who made a very apt analogy, when he compared rectified spirit with distilled water. That gentleman pointed out that while distilled water is scientifically pure, no one cares to drink it because we all prefer natural water with the so-called impurities&#39; of lime, salts, and so forth. We now come to the most dramatic portion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons&#39;</inline> remarks. The honorable senator, as reported, said that, in justice to Joshua Brothers, he believed that a small proportion of the silent spirit obtained by that firm was used in methylation, but that he had been unable to discover how much. I .asked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> what means he had taken to discover how much ; and the honorable senator said that when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joshua</inline> was before the Tariff Commission, the members did not realize the important bearing of the molasses spirit. The fact remains, however, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joshua</inline> was never recalled, and that no letter was afterwards sent to him requesting this information. Fortunately, I am in a position to favour the Senate with the information so anxiouslysought. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> went on to say that nothing would give him greater pleasure than to have a statement as to how much of this silent spirit this firm obtained, and what proportion of it was used for human consumption. Probably <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> did not intend to convey -the impression that Messrs. Joshua Brothers were withholding information ; but the fact remains that such ah. impression was created. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Saul</inline> Joshua, a member of the firm, was examined and cross-examined for, I believe, the better, part of three days ; and he said, &#34; My books are open to you, and I ask you to verify everything I have said by inspecting my books.&#34; If I remember rightly, in answer to question 806, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joshua</inline> said. &#34; 1 implore you to look at my books.&#34; </para>

Some of it was rum, some of it was spirits of wine supplied to manufacturers; and a small quantity was tried in the manufacturing of cheap liquor. For instance, we were trying to make an article by adulterating the whisky with some of this molasses spirit, and selling it very cheap; but it was no good. Nobody would have it. </para>

                            <para>- I agree with the honorable senator, but, unfortunately, they have been introduced, and I am answering the challenge to produce a statement as to what Joshua Brothers did with the 182.000 gallons of molasses spirits received by them in 1903. I have supplied the information asked for. I wish honorable senators to realize my main contention, and that of the Tariff Commission, which is that grain spirit is not rectified to the same extent as molasses spirit. Grain spirit is rectified to something like 45 overproof. It must be so distilled that it retains its character, which is distinctly different from that of molasses spirit. </para>

                            <para>- That is what we are going to encourage, and that is the object of the Tariff Commission report. But my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline> did not happen to be in the Chamber on Friday when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> in his very able speech, was dealing with the point that vast quantities of molasses spirit came into Victoria from Queensland and New South Wales. The impression conveyed was that whisky, could be made from it. I do not wonder that my honorable friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> shrugged his shoulders because that contention is utterly untenable. My point is that the public will not buy the particular class of. spirit referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake,</inline> because it is not whisky. If we attempted to label the bottles with the true character of their contents - namely, &#34;molasses spirit with whisky flavouring&#34; - it would mean disaster to any tradesman attempting to sell such a product. On the other hand, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> would he the last to suggest that the bottles should be labelled &#34; whisky &#34; when they contained a spirit made from molasses. The whole current of British and European legislation has been that the public must not be deceived, and that we shall, so far as we can, insist upon the contents of a package or bottle being truly described. </para>

                            <para>- Of course it is an improvement. The Tariff Commission made a mistake in that respect, and when it was pointed out in another place it was at once rectified. Now we have to inquire - what is whisky? If. there is any doubt <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> the mind of any honorable senator, the opinions of the leading whisky distillers of the world should place the matter beyond question. There was a case before the Courts in England some time ago. when it was decided that, first of all, whisky must be distilled from grain, and, secondly, it must be made in a pot still. I believe that there was an appeal from that decision, but I do not know whether it has yet been decided. Many of us may dissent from the opinion that whisky must be made in a pot still, because undoubtedly the patent still will do the same work. </para>

                        <para>S06. Are you willing to allow the Commission &#34;to test your figures by examining your books with the assistance of an expert? - I implore you to do so. 807. While the distilling business was a going concern, what labour did you employ ? - Give us the figures for both the Victorian industry and your own business? - I understand that in 1900 there were 143 men employed in Victoria in distilling. In 1901 the number was 137; in 1902, 73, and in 1903, 34. In our own. business, prior to Federation we employed in 1898, on the average, 58-1 men - in &#39;1899, 57.1, and in 1900, 64. In 1901 we employed 65.4. After the Federal Tariff was imposed we employed on the average in 1902, 33.4 men ; in 1903, 22.7, and in 1904. 20.5. Furthermore, an immense amount of indirect employment was given. </para>

                    <para class="block">That evidence is conclusive, so far as Victoria is concerned. In 1900, 440,000 gallons of spirit were produced. To produce it there were employed 143 men. </para>

                            <para>- If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> intended to convey that 150 men could produce all the molasses spirit required for consumption, in Australia he certainly was above the mark. I should be. prepared to believe that 150 men1 could produce sufficient molasses spirit to supply half the world. But there is a vast difference between the production of molasses spirit and the production of grain spirit. I have made inquiries, and am told that to produce the whisky consumed in Victoria - 1,500,000 gallons - it would take over 400 men to do the malting alone, quite irrespective of the distilling. The labour employed by Messrs. Joshua Brothers, who were attacked in this connexion, is set out in the evidence - </para>

                        <para>Si 1. In your letter to the Commission you say that between &#163;30,000 and &#163;40,000 per annum was disbursed for labour ? - That, is directly and indirectly. 812.

How much of that &#163;30,000 and &#163;40,000 was spent by your firm ? - Our labour bill was about &#163;100 per week. Then- we probably paid &#163;2,000 or &#163;3,000 a year to the bottle-makers, of which about <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2,000</inline> went in labour. 815.

When it is borne in mind that 2,561,000 gallons of spirits are imported, that in 1905 1,500,000 gallons were locally distilled, that the annual consumption of spirits in the Commonwealth is about 3,000,000 gallons, and that the production of 440,000 gallons of whisky and brandy employs the amount of labour I have stated, my. honorable friends will recognise that the production of the total quantity consumed would mean the employment of an enormous amount of labour. </para>

                            <para>- No; but that point can be better dealt with in Committee. What I am now dealing with is the general impression that 150 men could do practically all the work connected with the production of the whisky required for consumption in Australia.. I have pointed out that if it refers to the mere distillation alone it does not include the large number of men who would be required to malt for the purpose of that distillation, or the enormous number who would be otherwise employed. In one industry alone 143 men are employed at an annual expenditure of &#39; .-&#163;30,000 or &#163;40,000. If that is.; multiplied by six or seven in contemplation of a period which, I believe, is not very remote, when we shall produce all the whisky required fi&#39;r local consumption- </para>

                            <para>- In some cases in Ame-&#39; rica the Excise dutv exceeds the import dutv by twenty times. I believe that as good and pure a spirit can be produced in Australia as can be distilled abroad. When that time arrived, the increased output would certainly mean the employment of a very large number of men, and the expenditure of an enormous sum. Perhaps ,&#163;180,000 per annum would be spent upon labour and raw material in the production of sufficient spirit to supply the requirements of the Commonwealth. That money, of course, would be distributed amongst coopers, case-makers, bottle - makers, printers, carriers, seamen, coal miners. The question of the farmer has also been mentioned. On page 21 of the second report of the Commission I find a letter which bears eloquent testimony to the value of the distilling industry to the formers. In his evidence, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joshua</inline> said - </para>

                        <para>When before the last Tariff Commission, I was asked if our business was of any importance to the farming industry, and I said not much ; but the question caused me to look into the matter, and I have since ascertained that our operations <inline font-style="italic">do</inline> affect the grain market. In this connexion, I would like to read the following &#39;letter which we received on the 13th November, 1901, from our grain-brokers, Messrs. H. R. Carter and Co. : - &#34; In reply to your inquiry as to the. average price of F.A.Q. maize and thin English barley suitable for malting during the last six years, we beg to advise that the average price for maize for the last six years has been as. 10&#188;d., and barley for the last six years 2s. 2$d. This average has been carefully made up from Messrs. Dalgety and Co.&#39;s weekly report, which they guarantee to be correct, and we are prepared to substantiate this if challenged. We may state, as representing a very large number of small sellers in the country, that your purchases of barley for distilling have been of <inline font-style="italic">great assistance to the farmers,</inline> often sustaining a falling market and helping to steady the price. This was proved last year, when there was a considerable quantity of thin barley carried over from the previous year, which caused a considerable accumulation of stock. Had you not taken the 7,000 or 8,000 bags of barley off the market as you did, we have no hesitation m saying that there would have been a complete collapse in the market.&#34; </para>

                            <para>- My honorable friend&#39;s figures are wrong. I have already dealt with this question at length. The point I am dealing with now is that, according to the evidence, on the purchase of raw material alone, Joshua Brothers spend between ,&#163;15,000 and &#163;20,000 in one industry. The value of wheat, of course, may be fixed in the markets of the world; but the distillers cannot import their barley, maize, rye, or wine, because the Tariff stands in their way. All those materials have to be purchased in the local market. Is this attack made on Joshua Brothers because, under the operation of the Tariff, they have lost &#163;60,000? According to sworn evidence, their industry has .practically been dead since the Tariff came into force. </para>

                            <para>- It makes a very substantial difference, because the importation of rum has largely decreased. I would impress upon my honorable friends that the recommendation of the Commission in this direction was unanimous, and that therefore it ought to carry weight with them. Its very design was the rehabilitation of the industry, the protection of the health of the public, and the provision of the best spirits which could be obtained. Suppose that it was rejected, what would take place? Joshua Brothers, with the other distillers in Australia, would be consigned to the production of the second-rate and inferior spirit in which they have been obliged, to a limited extent, to deal during the last three years. </para>

                            <para>- That would be the inevitable result of the rejection of the proposal of the Commission. I cannot too strongly impress upon the Senate that molasses spirit distillation and grain spirit distillation are two different industries, and that in respect of each industry there is a great opportunity for development. From the industrial stand-point, the molasses spirit industry has enormous prospects. The distillation- of spirit from grain and wine brandy offers such a wide field for operations that it ought to be encouraged. The value of the spirits imported in 1905 was &#163;950,000, representing 2,560,813 proof &#39; gallons. Therefore, I say that the case made out on behalf of the industry must have been irresistible to have secured the conjunction of free-trade and protectionist members of the Tariff Commission. </para>

                            <para>- I have said the same thing twenty times, over in the course of my remarks. My contention is that this spirit is not the whisky which the public require. If a bottle were labelled &#34; Molasses spirit flavoured with whisky &#34; the public would not buv it; and if, on the other hand, it were labelled &#34; whisky,&#34; a fraud would be committed on the public. Under all the circumstances, the Senate is justified in regarding the recommendations of the Tariff Commission as well founded, and as truly setting forth the conditions which have been brought about because of an unreasonable, and what I call an unfair Commonwealth Tariff. I admit that the loss of revenue is a serious matter, and I am free to say that as soon as the local industry develops, a re-adjustment will become essential. What I contend is that we should endeavour to produce in Australia the whole of the spirits we require. I do not for one moment advocate that any of the taxation which at present attaches to spirits should be removed; but that, following the example of other countries, there should be a re-adjustment - that the import duties should be transferred to the Excise. We&#34; should then have the advantage of a possible expenditure in the country of something like ,&#163;160,000 to &#163;180,000 per annum, in the manufacture of spirits under our own immediate supervision, and, at the same time, there would be fair and reasonable taxation, certainly not less than that which is at present levied on spirits through the Customs and Excise. I urge that the recommendations of the Tariff Commission, as embodied in the Bill, should be accepted, and I do so with the greatest confidence, because I believe the facts as disclosed by the evidence would justify such a course. </para>

                        <para>. - While the import duty is 14s. per gallon on all spirits, the proposed Excise gives a. clear preference of 2s. per gallon to grain and grape spirit over molasses spirit. There is no evidence, so far as I can follow the report of the Tariff Commission, that molasses spirit is unwholesome, though the arguments of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> and of other honorable senators, would lead one to suppose that it is deleterious. </para>

                            <para>- Pure spirit is neither whisky nor brandy; &#34;whisky&#34; and &#34; brandy &#34; are distinguished by the flavourings, and not the spirit. If molasses spirit is wholesome, why should we differentiate? The truth is that molasses spirit is an article cheaply and easily produced, and there is a popular belief that such articles are of very little value. I am very much afraid that molasses spirit is getting a bad name simply because it is cheaply and easily produced. </para>

                            <para>- I shall not say that. But molasses spirit is driving out a great deal of the grain spirit, and, therefore, the production of the latter is to be bolstered up at the expense of the production of the former. It has been contended by very many eminent medical men, and, so far as I can see, not contradicted, that one spirit is as wholesome as the other. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Fiaschi,</inline> one of the most eminent medical authorities in Sydney, has said, in effect, that he can say nothing against molasses spirit, that brandy must be made from the grape, and that all spirits for consumption ought to be ten years in the wood. This gentleman has also said that he does not complain of spirit being made from molasses, but that good spirits must be made, and that if it be matured for so many years, its wholesomeness is increased. </para>

                            <para>- The words of Di. Fiaschi, as given in the Tariff Report are - 21186. Speaking generally with reference to the secondary products of spirits, you think that they should be left in a true brandy or a true whisky after the process of distillation ; not that they should be rectified out of the spirit, and afterwards added again. You do not believe in the doctoring up of spirit? - I do not. I believe in getting the best spirit by means of the pot still, and then ageing it. </para>

                            <para>- Well, so-called impurities. I take it that the whisky and brandy made by Messrs. Joshua Brothers were not appreciated by the public because, being made out of molasses spirit, the production did not contain the proper impurities - it was not because the spirit was not right, but because the impurities were not there to give the flavouring which the public desired. As to revenue, it seems to me that&#34; we ought to raise the Excise so as to decrease the prospective loss. In Canada, a difference of 2s. per gallon between Customs duty and Excise, has proved sufficient to secure the whole of the trade to the local distillers. Why. then, should there be a difference of 4s. allowed to the distillers of grape or pure malt spirit? I shall be glad in. Committee to support any proposal to increase the Excise dutv. I hope, also, that methylated spirit will not be so handicapped as to interfere with its consumption. I think it was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knox</inline> who, in his evidence stated that if spirits are methylated with certain substances, their lighting, explosive, or propulsive power was decreased. We are looking forward to the time when, as in America, methylated spirits will be used in hundreds of ways for the propulsion of machinery and vehicles, and when we shall not have to endure the unpleasant odour which motor cars now leave behind them. </para>

                        <para>. - There is only one point on which I desire to offer a few remarks. I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> takes up the position that the two classes of spirit are not suitable for the same purpose - that molasses spirit cannot be used and placed on the market as whisky. In support of that contention, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> brought forward some very incomplete evidence submitted by Messrs. Joshua Brothers, to the effect that they had made the experiment, and that it had failed. </para>

If it be a fact that molasses spirit does not enter into competition with the other spirit - if it is not possible for molasses spirit to enter into competition with the spirit manufactured bv Joshua Brothers - what are Joshua Brothers afraid of ? What does it matter to Messrs. Joshua Brothers whether there is, or is not, any Excise duty on molasses spirit? </para>

If, however, we have a. differential duty which will handicap the production of one State as against the production of another, we shall have a reversion to the old principle of Inter-State Tariffs. </para>

                            <para>- No; but where a differentiation is made in the case of a product which is more largely grown in one State than in another, it. becomes in essence and in practice ,a differentiation between State and State. It does not matter whether molasses spirit can be produced here or not ; the fact remains that Queensland is the largest producer of the article, and New South Wales produces it in a minor degree. I may be told that Victoria, if she pleases, can produce molasses spirit; but the fact is that she does not. Similarly, grain might be grown in large quantities on the Darling Downs ;&#39; but for some reason or another it is not. and we have to take the facts as they are. We find one State producing an enormous quantity of one form of raw material from which spirits are made. Another State produces none of that raw material, but produces spirit from some of her substance ; and then I say that, if we impose differential duties with respect to spirit produced from these two forms of raw material, to all intents and purposes we re-erect the internal barriers which were supposed to have been removed bv Federation, and confer a favour upon one State while we handicap the other. I come again to the point from which I started, and on which I lay particular emphasis in my answer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best,</inline> because of the time the honorable senator has devoted to the matter. The honorable senator&#39;s contention was that there is no conflict between the two forms of alcohol, one produced from molasses and the other from&#39; grain, for the simple reason that it is impossible to substitute the one for the other. If that be so, it should make no difference whether these prohibitive duties are imposed in the case of spirits made from molasses or not. If molasses spirit can in no sense come into competition1 with grain1 spirit, it cannot matter to the producers of grain spirit whether there is a differential duty imposed on molasses spirit or not. This argument is the more conclusive if I can accept <inline font-weight="bold">Senator -Best&#39;s</inline> full assurance that there can be no competition between the two forms of spirit, for the simple reason that the public will not consume whisky or brandy made from molasses spirt. If the public will not consume them, what can it matter to those who are producing spirits made from grain spirit whether the duty on molasses spirit is higher or lower? In the circumstances, I may well ask: Why this keen anxiety on the part of those interested in grain spirit to put an additional impost on liquors produced from molasses spirit? The reason is obvious that molasses spirit can be, is being, and will be, used for making whisky in spite of the evidence presented to the Senate and to the Tariff Commission. </para>

                            <para>- Absolutely nothing. Without wishing to be offensive to my Victorian friends, I say that the whole matter comes to this : that in this particular instance they take a purely local view of the question. They say that, as a result of the Federal Tariff, certain Victorian industries have been injured, to the advantage of corresponding industries elsewhere. That is exactly what was to be expected. The reverse has happened in the case of the ordinary manufacturing industries, and Victoria has been the greatest gainer from Federation, whilst New South Wales has also gained to some extent. To my mind, this proposal is absolutely destructive of all we understand by Federation and the Federal spirit. Whenever we find that as a result of Federation certain industries have been transferred from Victoria, to another State, Victorians apparently are prepared to say, &#34; We desire Federation, and its consequences, so long as they will benefit this State, but the moment the benefit goes to another State we should by some artificial legislative construction re-erect the original barriers, the effect of which will be to enable us to retain all that we have, and to get as much more as we can.&#34; </para>

                            <para>- No ; as a member of the Federal Parliament. The allegation has been made that this Bill is introduced in order to restore a Victorian industry, and the inference has been conveyed that if it had not been a Victorian industry that was to be restored, this action would not be taken at this time. To start with, the Bill does not deal with&#39; any particular spot , in Australia, but with the whole of the Commonwealth. It happens just now that sugar is made in Queensland and New South Wales, and not in the other States. That is merely an accident. </para>

                            <para>- Perhaps the honorable senator will answer this question : I understand that his contention is that as duties are levied on articles without reference to locality, my argument therefore fails. Will he say that, although in the imposition of the duty no reference is made to Queensland, the duty imposed on sugar is not a distinct aid to that State? </para>

                            <para>- I rose to show why there should be such a differentiation. This Bill is to protect the production of spirits in Australia, and protection, is introduced, if at all, because it is necessary. That will, I think, be assumed. It has been shown indisputably that molasses spirit does not require the protection .that is required for grain, malt, and wine spirits. </para>

I am, however, dealing with the Bill as it is presented to us, and I feel certain that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> will not support a reduction of the proposed Excise dutv on molasses, though he would like to increase the Excise dutv .on other spirits. If there is any need for this Bill, it is to protect, and it has been proved indisputably that spirit produced from molasses does not require the protection which is required by spirit produced from malt and wine. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator forgets my first proposition - that if molasses spirit is as good as any other for all purposes for which spirit is used, there is no need for differentiation. I propose to snow that it is not as good. Before you can put grain spirit on the same footing as molasses spirit, you must distil it up to a very high percentage of alcoholic strength, when it will have lost all the properties which make it valuable for whisky production. That is to say, you1 can. by distillation, make grain spirit as bad as molasses spirit. But that is no reason why we should make it as bad. </para>

At Mount Lyell, they mine for copper, and they find that the copper is impregnated with impurities which have to be removed. Those impurities are gold and silver. Experts take the precaution to refer to them as .&#34; so-called impurities.&#34; You can get pure alcohol, but pure alcohol is not whisky. </para>

                            <para>- You make it less valuable, though not less valuable as copper, I admit. We are dealing with the production of spirits which go into human consumption. .Without arguing whether whisky is a good thing or a bad thing, there is a large number of persons who require it and who are prepared to pay for it. When we are legislating with respect to the means by which they shall be furnished with it, we should take every precaution to see that they get what they pay for. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> gave the illustration of butter and margarine. It is as wrong to give a person butter who asks for margarine as it&#39; would be to give him margarine if he asked for butter. People are deceived and defrauded if they do not get what they ask and pay for. What this Bill provides is that those persons who like pure whisky, brandy, and rum shall have the means of obtaining those commodities as produced in Australia; and that those people who like blended brandy and whisky, shall be able to obtain those commodities also. I fail to see how the persons now engaged in the production of molasses spirit will be injured unless, as has been insinuated, it enters into a commodity that is sold for what it is not. </para>

True whisky, the experts say, is made from malted grain. But a large number of people do not like pure whisky. They like a blend made from malted barley and grain. If they gel what they ask for there is no fraud. </para>

I think it can easily be shown that the molasses spirit is likely to fulfil its proper mission in becoming an article of industrial consumption. There is an enormous field for development in that respect. We have seen that an enormous quantity of molasses spirit purchased by Joshua Brothers has been sold as methylated spirit. </para>

                            <para>- It rests with the honorable senator to show what has become of it. The point - 1 urge is that molasses spirit receives under this Bill ..such an additional protection as under existing circumstances is shown by the evidence to be adequate. Grain spirits also get an additional protection ; not as much as molasses spirit, but sufficient to reestablish the production cf grain spirits in Australia instead of our importing them from abroad. The spirits that we are now getting from abroad are to a large extent cheap and inferior. The probability is that this Bill will lead to&#39; the production of better Australian spirits. The people who consume brandy and whisky will get what they ask for instead of getting adulterated stuff. What is distilled in Australia will be made under Customs supervision, and therefore the consumer who is now being badly treated, and is probably being injured in his health, will have an assurance that such will no longer be the case. </para>

                            <para>- We make provision for labelling under Government supervision, and we. may depend upon it that when that supervision exists people will not buy the stuff that is not. properly labelled. Therefore we do get an assurance that the consumers of these articles will not be treated in future as they are treated now. In addition, the Bill tends to develop an industry that has, immense possibilities, not merely in the production of whisky and brandy for drinking purposes, but in the production of alcohol as an article of fuel. </para>

                            <para>- I believe that the whisky we get at present makes a good many fellows ill, but the whisky they will get under this Bill will make fewer ill. The world is looking forward to obtaining a more convenient and readily-appliable fuel, and the production of alcohol from such material as molasses, corncobs, and other things that in themselves are a nuisance, will lead to profit and to expansion of trade in these directions. Formerly the material from which molasses spirit was made was a source of trouble and a cause of loss. That is to say, it had to be disposed of by the expenditure of labour. It was a. trouble to the sugar refiners. Now that it is being turned into spirit it is yielding a fairly good profit, because it can be produced for 6d., and is sold for 9d. per gallon. It is converted into a source of profit and usefulness instead of being, as it was, a nuisance and source of trouble. The Bill will probably lead to the development of the distilling industry throughout Australia, and to an anxious quest for other such waste material which may be converted into useful commercial products. I look forward to a very much larger development in distilling in the not distant future in the direction of industrial alcohol. </para>

                            <para>-It will be made, I believe, from maize cob, which, I am told, is very rich in alcohol. At the present time, it is a very great trouble to the raisers of maize, because it is difficult to burn, and is absolutely useless as manure. But it is quite possible that if we develop, by further protection, the distilling industry, we may have in that and other directions an increased source of profit and an increased power of development in other departments of industry. Therefore, I hope that the Bill will be carried. I trust that the difference of 4s. per gallon between the highest class of locally made spirit and the imported spirit will be maintained. I am not particularly wedded to the difference of only 2s. between the lowest class of locally made spirit and the imported spirit, but I would urge upon those who are afraid that we shall lose revenue by the Bill as it is, that it would be a greater departure to go still further and lose 2s. more on each gallon of molasses spirit distilled, as we would require to do in order to remove the differentiation without injuring the protection on the other spirits that are admitted by all the experts to be necessary to meet the wants of the people. So far as I can see, all the experts agree that in order to make whisky or brandy, the distiller must have malt, grain, or wine, that no matter how he may try, it cannot be made from silent spirit; and even if it could be so made, I go the length of stating that if there were still some persons who wanted the other, we would have no right to force upon them the product of silent spirit. The question of whether it is wholesome or not has been raised. Tomatoes are probably as wholesome as raspberries. It is said sometimes that raspberry jam is made from tomatoes. But any person who sold as raspberry jam the product of tomatoes would leave himself liable to a prosecution for fraud, and properly so, too, because, although they may be as wholesome - perhaps more wholesome - tomatoes are not raspberries. In the same way, silent spirit is not whisky. It is absurd, therefore, to say that the Bill is introduced merely to bolster up a Victorian or other State industry. It applies to the whole of Australia. </para>

All I am urging is that a duty of 4s. per gallon appears to be necessary to protect wine and malt distillation, that a duty of 3s. per gallon appears to be necessary to protect grain distillation, and that a duty of 2s. per gallon has been proved to be ample to protect molasses distillation. </para>

                            <para>- I am dealing with the case presented by the honorable senator, namely, that there is no need to differentiate, because the two things are alike. I contend that they are not alike. Of course, they can be made alike by incurring unnecessary expense in connexion with distilling spirits from malt, wine, and grain. By the expenditure of more money it would be possible to make those spirits as little valuable as molasses spirit, but in the condition in which they are ordinarily placed on the market they are more valuable commercially, and they are not at all like molasses spirit, rectified up to 67 or 68 overproof. Therefore, there is no argument that the two things should be dealt with alike. The strongest argument of all is that, with a protection of is., the molasses spirit industry has developed enormously. It is now proposed to increase the protection to 2s. per gallon, and yet it is said that the Bill is taking away some of the protection. That is so utterly illogical, and, to my mind, absurd, that it ought not to require any argument to refute it. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Col. NEILD</inline>(New South Wales) &#91;6.13&#93;. - After listening to the pathetic appeals which have been made on behalf of legislation in the interests of a firm who have given to the world manifest evidence of their inability to conduct their business on, I shall not say sound lines, but in accordance with its interests, I desire to say a few words before a division is taken. It is notorious that, if Joshua Brothers had succeeded in flavoring their output so that persons would have bought it for whisky, we should not have heard of this proposal. It is based on the failure of that firm to flavour their whisky properly. &#39; I have never heard before of a Ministry trying to force through Parliament a Bill - or, rather, the fragments of a Bill - to benefit one firm, because we know that the whole object for which it was introduced was destroyed by a vote somewhere else. The fragments have been gathered up . and put before us in the interests of Joshua Brothers. It is well known that it is possible to go to almost any wholesale drug store or drysalter and obtain the necessary ingredients to make a liquor with a specified flavour. Yet Joshua Brothers did not seem to know that. First of all, they put upon the market something which was called brandy, but which every one knows does not taste like brandy ; and it did not go down, notwithstanding the fact that 65,000 gallons of Queensland molasses spirit were used in its concoction. Having failed to place this concocted brandy, we find that a concocted whisky is put on the market, and we have a Bill brought in which only requires 25 per cent, of grain spirit to be used by the firm, and the balance can still continue to be spirit distilled from Queensland molasses. </para>

In any case, the honorable senator was as pathetic in his appeal on behalf of Messrs. Joshua&#39;s whisky, as was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best.</inline></para>

                            <para>- Certainly a very large proportion. The molasses spirit is bought for about 9d. per gallon, and sold for as many shillings per gallon. This is very profitable ; but it does not seem to satisfy the craving for inordinate returns, and we are asked bv legislation to make those profits larger. I imagine that Messrs. Joshua Brothers have got a bit of a scare since the passing of the Trade Marks Act. and that they are afraid of turning out an v more second-class whisky made from Queensland molasses spirits. The Government are, therefore, moved to bring in a Bill to do exactly what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> said- - to differentiate between the product of one State and the product of another State. If there ever was a Bill introduced into this Legislature which aimed distinctly at establishing such a differentiation, it is this Bill. I was not an enthusiastic supporter of Federation, and I opposed the Commonwealth Constitution Bill in- the form in which it was placed before the electors. </para>

                            <para>- That was by distilling from grain of some sort or another; because it is evident that Messrs. Joshua Brothers cannot have lost money by buying molasses spirit at 9d. per gallon, and selling it at 7s. per gallon. They have been making a &#34; pot of money,&#34; but they are not content, and are harking after the old dodge of making money two ways. They are not satisfied, but now desire legislative enactment, not only to enable them to make larger profits, but in order that other traders may be injured. In my opinion, that is not fair. We have adopted the present form of Federation, and, as I have already said, it is our duty to equalize the conditions of manufacture throughout the Commonwealth, and not to set up new artificial barriers as a stumbling-block in the growth of that &#34; Federal spirit &#34; of which we have heard so much, and of which so little exists:, and of which we shall see still less if this Bill be passed. This Bill is distinctly aimed at Queensland, and, inferentially, at a small corner of New South Wales, though the latter is scarcely worth mentioning. The Bill is eminently designed to further the interests of a single firm in Victoria. That fact is evidenced by the last interjection from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith.</inline> Whose business is being ruined ?  It is the business of one firm; and this is a one-firm Bill. I was not elected on behalf of a great State, in order to pass legislation for the benefit of a single firm at the expense of a State and the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- The Hunter River Distillery Company has not, I think, asked for anything at the hands of this Parliament. That company turns out an excellent brandy distilled from the grape - a brandy which any honorable senator, for either hospitable or .medicinal purposes, might well be satisfied to keep on his premises. I have a bottle at home now, and it is a good brandy. If I am induced to make remarks in this connexion, it is because of the apposite interjection of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs.</inline></para>

Why is it that all the arguments this afternoon have had refer,ence to Joshua&#39;s whisky? What about Joshua&#39;s brandy? The brandy of the firm could not be touched upon, because it is notorious that it has been largely made out of the very molasses spirit which it is now sought to veto. </para>

                            <para>- If Joshua Brothers had only had sufficient &#34; save &#34; to &#39;flavour their liquors rightly, we should not have heard of this Bill. I do not think that it is the duty of the Commonwealth to set up one State against another, and particularly it is not our duty to set up the interests of one firm, or even of two firms, against the interests of one of the great national industries of Australia. If the sugar industry, with all its ramifications, were taken out of Queensland, there would be created an industrial gap which nothing would fill for many years to come. </para>

                            <para>- Another little &#34; sop to Cerberus &#34;--keeping things going by playing off one industry against another. I suppose that next session we shall have another Bill of shreds and patches, the object of which will be to benefit some industry which has been injured by the Bill now before us. This measure is the most eminent example we could have of the mischief of tampering by legislation with the details of commerce and manufacture. The more we so tamper, the more difficulties we create; the result is inevitable. As I said before, this Bill is an outcome of the Trade Marks Act. </para>

I am happy in having received some very valuable information from the Minister in charge of the Bill on a point which I proposed to discuss. My. mind being now at ease on the matter, it is not necessary for me to occupy the time of the Senate any longer. I have to thank the Minister for the information accorded to me, which has rendered any continuation of my remarks unnecessary. </para>

                        <para>- -I move - That the Bill be now read a second time. In submitting this motion, I wish to explain why I have adopted the course which has been pursued on this occasion. Honorable senators understand that the Excise Tariff Bill is really the more important of the two Bills now before the Senate. It provides for the Excise duties, whilst the Spirits Bill is merely a machinery Bill, and depends to a certain extent on the form in which this Bill is passed as to the provisions which it shall contain. I propose now to go on with the second reading of the Bill, to take it into Committee, and to get honorable senators to assist me in passing it through Committee as quickly as possible. It is not necessary to discuss it at length, because I dealt with the whole of the proposed duties in moving the second reading of the Spirits Bill. Honorable senators have done the same, as they have recognised that the two Bills are so intimately connected that it was more convenient to discuss them together. I wish to indicate two alterations which I intend to propose in the schedule, but before I do so I may answer a question which was raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> on the second reading of the Spirits Bill. The honorable senator asked how it &#39;was that &#34; spirits, n.e.i. &#34; were not to be kept in wood for two&#39; years and matured. I point out that these spirits might be used for purposes other than human consumption, but if they are used for human consumption, then, in common with all other spirits used for that purpose, they must be matured in wood for two years under clause n of the Spirits Bill, which reads - </para>

                    <para class="block">With regard to spirits used for fortifying Australian wine, honorable senators will find that, under the existing &#39;Excise Act, spirits used &#34; for fortifying Australian wine or for making vinegar&#34; have an Excise duty of is. per gallon imposed upon them. It is proposed that that duty shall, in accordance with the recommendation of the Tariff Commission, &#34;be reduced to 6d. per gallon. We ha&#60;ve in this Bill provided for a duty of 6d. per proof gallon on - </para>

                        <para>Spirits for fortifying Australian wine subject to regulations. leaving out the words &#34; and for making vinegar&#34; as used in the existing Excise Act. We think that it is better to follow the wording of the corresponding item in the schedule to the existing Act. It is, therefore, mv intention, in Committee, to propose the amendment of the schedule by inserting after the word &#34;wine,&#34; in item n, &#34;or for making, vinegar.&#34; Our attention has been called to the fact that we have made no provision for the manufacture of scents and toilet preparations. The manufacturers of these preparations, as honorable senators can imagine, desire that spirits used for such purposes shall be free. At present the import duty on perfume spirits is 25s. per liquid gallon, and .manufacturers of toilet preparations, if spirits were free, would have the whole of that amount as a protection for their manufactures. The Excise duty on rectified spirits is 13s. per proof gallon, which, at 60 overproof, the strength at which they are used for the manufacture of toilet preparations, is equal to 21s. per liquid gallon. So that the duty we propose of 10s. per liquid gallon will give a margin of 15s. per liquid gallon. </para>

                        <para>. - I wish to make a few remarks with regard to the matter of revenue. To my mind, this is a subject of very great importance. It is high time that the Senate took cognizance of the way in which revenue is being given up. I have no intention to consider the matter from the aspect of free-trade and protection. I am quite willing to allow the arrangement arrived at in 1901-2 to stand, and for the full amount of protection which was then given to remain, and even to be increased in certain directions- But it is the bounden duty of the Senate to give close scrutiny to matters which arise relating to the revenue of the country. We are giving up money very easily. At the end of last year we surrendered between &#163;60,000 and &#163;70,000 for conscience sake in the matter of opium. That was justifiable, but still that revenue was dropped. Then I notice that we are spending a great deal of money to help the wine industry. The money collected under the duty of is. per gallon on spirit for fortifying wines reached, last year, &#163;13,737. There is no Excise duty on wines, which are allowed to go into consumption free of charge. They compete not only with imported wines, but with other classes of stimulants, and people are enabled in this, way to consume a large amount of brandy without the payment of duty. The quantity of spirit used in the fortification of wines at the import rate of 14s. per gallon would have yielded over &#163;&#39;190,000. Instead of receiving that amount, however, we collected &#163;13.737) showing that nearly&#163;180,000 is given to the wine industry to assist in fortifying wines which are used to deplete the revenue derived from stimulants generally. We are producing at present about 6,000,000 gallons of wine, of which about 1,000,000 gallons are exported, leaving 5,000,000 as part of the ordinary consumption of wine in Australia. That quantity of wine is delivered to consumers . absolutely free of Excise, and it includes an enormous quantity of spirit. Then, as I pointed out last week, the proposals embodied in the Excise Bill before us must, if carried out. ultimately mean a loss to the revenue of at least &#163;300,000. The question arises : Are we justified in throwing money away in this wholesale manner? Is there anything in the matter of labour from the protectionist point of view to justify it? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> said this afternoon that, instead of the small number of hands that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> has referred to, there must be at least 1,000 hands employed in producing spirits for consumption in Australia. Suppose, there were t.000 hands in the industry, and that each of them received an average of , &#163;100 per annum, making &#163;100,000. Are we justified, even from the protectionist point of view, in throwing away at least three times that amount in </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">Customs revenue in addition to other moneys that are surrendered? That is a point of view that is very little considered, and certainly no honorable senator has yet attempted to make any reply to it. I submit that it is a point of view that those who are anxious about the finances of their States must of necessity consider. Then, with regard to expenditure, the very next item on our business-paper is a Bill for the payment of bounties, which calls upon the Commonwealth for an expenditure of &#163;500,000 in sums not to exceed &#163;75,000 per annum. There we are again. When we find expenditure increasing in this way we ought to be additionally wary as , to the way in which we surrender revenue. &#91; find in the Bounties Bill itself reasons for apprehending still further attacks upon our funds. There are proposals in it for increasing the production of certain articles which now yield revenue to the Customs. I will refer to one, namely, coffee. It is said that we ought to be able to produce as much coffee as Australia requires. Very well ; suppose we do that. It is put in a very neat way, but what does it mean? It means a loss of . &#163;20,000 or &#163;30,000 per annum to the revenue. It is the easiest thing in the world to lose money. We have another measure which is promised - I was about to say threatened - for the making of a treaty with New . Zealand, under which a good deal of revenue will be surrendered. Goods which now pay duty are to be admitted free. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator requires to have a good deal of light thrown upon the question I think. I have already referred to wines. I find that in the year 1890, the Customs revenue received in the six States of the Commonwealth amounted to &#163;133,000. In the year 1903 the Commonwealth collected &#163;55,000 from wines. In 1904 we collected &#163;50,000. Last year we collected &#163;47,000. In this way the revenue of Australia on these items, which are so highly protected, is gradually slipping away. Last week I drew attention! to the fact that in 1874 New Zealand, alarmed at the ravages made upon her revenue by the local spirit industry, decided that she would close all the distilleries. She paid compensation to the owners, and closed all her distilleries; so that from 3874 to 1906, in spite of the fact that New Zealand is keenly protectionist, and has had protectionist Premiers, there has been no attempt to undo the policy then decided upon. On Friday I drew attention to the fact that of all the spirits now imported, whisky pays duty to the extent of no less than 61 per cent, of the -whole. We are collecting about &#163;1,100,000 in Customs duties on whisky. It is this special item of revenue which will be depleted under the measure before us. I have pointed out before, and it is well worthy of note, that the development of the brandy industry has gone practically as far as it can go in Australia, and that future markets must be found abroad. The position of the brandy trade is practically assured in that respect. I should imagine that the keenest protectionist in Australia realizes that fact. Now we have a measure before us that will undoubtedly tend to build up a whisky industry which must deplete importation, and gradually take away a very large amount of revenue that is now collected. </para>

                            <para>- But the result is happening every day. No one supposes that the .&#163;300,000 will be thrown away the moment the Bill passes. The loss will begin to accrue. I think the estimate of the Government is, that in the first year there will be a loss of from ,&#163;75,000 to &#163;90,000. I do not think that any estimate is given for succeeding years. I think that they estimate a loss of from &#163;75,000 to &#163;90,000, and, undoubtedly, that loss will be continued. Canada has a difference of only half-a-dollar - 2s. id. - per gallon between her import and Excise duties. Yet, with that amount of protection, it has annexed the major portion of the spirit trade. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator, I am sure, can readily see that if a difference of- 2s. id. per gallon will secure to Canada - a country much nearer to England than Australia is - the bulk of that industry, it does not need a difference of 3s. or 4s. per gallon to secure a similar result in Australia. When I suggest that a difference of 2s. per gallon is ample to meet that purpose, I think that he might be prepared to support me. </para>

                            <para>- On referring to the returns of the British exports, I find that to Australia, last year, the export of British and Irish spirits totalled 1,600,000 gallons, whilst the export to Canada, with its much larger population, amounted to only. 600,000 gallons, again affording conclusive proof that, with the advantage of 2s. per gallon, Canada has been able to practically annex the industry. Therefore, I suggest to honorable senators that there is no occasion to throw away money which is needed, even to secure the object they have in view. The proposals embodied in the Bill give .more protection than even the Tariff Commission recommended. That is an important point. The four free-trade Commissioners were prepared to reduce the Customs duty on pure spirits by is. per gallon, while two protectionist Commissioners - Senators Higgs and McGregor - were prepared to go half way. So that six Commissioners are pledged to a policy reducing the proposed protection by 6d. per gallon, while the other two are prepared to increase the difference by another 6d. I do not think that any member of the Commission who has a seat in the Chamber will wish to go back upon that. Further, there is a recommendation embodied in the report that, if the arrangement general.lv suggested were made, pure spirit should be admitted and underproof allowed for. </para>

                            <para>- I am not doing anything of the sort, but trying to take care of the revenue. I am pointing out what members of the Commission were prepared to do as to the amount of protection. The position could be met either by reducing the Customs duty or by raising the Excise duty, but, as regards the protection, either means would bring about the same result. To reduce the import duty clearly means to lower the revenue, but to raise the&#34; Excise duty means to protect the revenue, and, at the same time, to put the amount of protection given to the industry on those more moderate lines which commended themselves to the Commission. When we are in Committee I shall, with every confidence, suggest that the various items should be increased by, I will say, an all-round rate of is. per gallon, and, perhaps, in one or two cases, by is. 6d. per gallon. </para>

                        <para>. - A loss of revenue to the extent of from ^60,000 to &#163;80,000 a year - the estimate made -by the Government - is certainly not a matter to be lightly regarded. It would fall particularly heavily upon Queensland and Tasmania - probably the States least able to afford it - for this reason, that they, to a greater extent than the others, take Australian-made goods in place of imported goods which they purchased prior to Federation. That is seen in the InterState trade returns. It is shown by the extent to which people in Queensland, and also in Tasmania, I think, obtain their supplies through, and from, Victoria. I contend that any change in the Tariff that would increase the production of the local article as against the imported article would fall more heavily on those two States than on any others, and, by a coincidence, these are the two States, which, perhaps, are least able to afford any loss of revenue at the present time. Through you, sir, I wish to say to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs,</inline> who made a chaffing remark the other day, that I am not talking in the interest of any particular distillery. I have the ordinary literature which has been supplied to every honorable senator, including a typewritten letter from a firm in Brisbane with regard to the duty on rum, which has not been touched upon yet. The particular subject I wish to draw attention to - the differentiation in the case of rectified or silent spirit, as against Queensland - was not suggested to me by any human being. I simply read the report of the Commission in order to find out what was the object of the proposal of the Government. I was then struck by the fact that the Bill would do an injury to the industry of distilling, as it exists in Queensland, and that caused me to bring the matter before the Senate on a previous occasion. In reading the _report, I was struck first of all by the consideration that, whereas this is recommended to us as a Bill to aid distilling in the Commonwealth, it appears from appendix B that from 1899 and 1905 inclusive, the production of spirits in the several States has more than doubled. In 1899, the quantity produced was 737,200 gallons ; in 1900, it was 743, 703 gallons; while in 1905, it was I&#39;5o6)339 gallons. Here is an industry which has doubled its output under the present Tariff, and that is the one which we are told is to be legislated for. What have been the other results with regard to the operation of the Tariff? On turning to page 15 of the report, I find this statement - </para>

It has been suggested recently that a great proportion of this spirit may have been methylated. In reply to my question this afternoon, the Minister of Defence gave the quantity of spirits, including naphtha, which has been methylated in Victoria during a period of five years. In 1889 the quantity amounted to 57,658 gallons; in 1900, 65,023 gallons; in 1901, 64,048 gallons; in 1902, 34,323 gallons; in 1903, 73,510 gallons; in 1904, 68,198 gallons; and in 1905, 49.530 gallons. &#39;The years 1903-4-5 have been quoted most often, and these were the years during which the spirit was coming in large quantities from Queensland. In 1903 there were 182,012 gallons brought into Victoria, 73,510 of which were methylated, leaving 109,000 not methylated ; in 1904 there were 172,709 gallons brought in, of which 68,198 were methylated, leaving 104,000 gallons not methylated ; in 1905 there were 182, 853 gallons brought in, of which 49,530 were methylated, leaving 133.000 unmethylated. In the three years 346,336 gallons of spirits were brought into Victoria, and not methylated. </para>

If that be so, and this measure is going to give relief to the Victorian industry, it must be by reversing the process - by causing the spirit to be distilled in Victoria from grain, instead of being distilled in the northern State from molasses. I have never taken up the position that molasses spirit is unwholesome ; and I have not censured any&#39; firm in Victoria for using that spirit instead of any other. It is those who are supporting the Bill who seem to have taken up that position. </para>

                            <para>- A great deal has been said about unwholesomeness. The contention is that the blended spirits of commerce are made, to a certain extent, of highly rectified spirit, from which the distinctive characteristics of the materials used have been eliminated ; and so long as spirit of that kind is allowed, we ought not to discriminate against the !spirit made from molasses, in face of the fact that all experts state that one spirit is just as good as the other. Grape wine may be distilled into brandy, malt into whisky, and molasses into rum ; and each is equally wholesome. When grape wine reaches a certain point of distillation, all the so-called impurities are eliminated, and there remains a spirit exactly like the highly rectified spirit from any other material, one spirit being as good as the other. </para>

                            <para>- I am not now dealing with that point. It seems to me that the evidence given by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Fiaschi</inline> goes right to the merits of the case, with regard to the distinction between spirits made at a low strength, and spirits made at a high strength. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Fiaschi</inline> says that pure grape wine brandy contains certain esters, and the latter is the material which is taken out of the spirit when it is distilled to a high strength. Experts call these esters impurities, but <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Fiaschi</inline> says that when he gives brandy to his patients medicinally he gives them brandy which contains those elements, because he desires to stimulate the heart, as well as. the nervous system. Doctors give all sorts of drugs to their patients, even, at times, poisons in small quantities, and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Fiaschi</inline> advises the administering of brandy because it contains not only alcohol, but also those particular esters which experts call impurities. The same remarks apply to whisky. Evidently, with the use of the pot still, those materials are retained which give the particular flavour that some whisky drinkers like very much. I may say that I am not an. expert in these matters ; I am only repeating what I have read. We have had so many authorities quoted on one side, that it is just as well to hear the other side with regard to the product of the pot still as contrasted with the product of the patent still. I have here a reprint pf an article from <inline font-style="italic">Faulding&#39; s Medical and Home Journal</inline> for September, 1906. </para>

                        <para>The product of the pot still contains about 380 parts of impurities to every 100,000 parts of absolute alcohol. The early whiskies, made from malt, it may readily be understood, contained every possible by-product or impurity, since the people engaged in the manufacture did not understand enough about the purification of spirit to separate the good elements from the bad ones. People living in those days acquired a taste for whisky with impurities, and would! no doubt, have considered a pure or patent still whisky (namely, one free from any impurities, and really more wholesome), a very weak article. Also, because it would not have the intoxicating effect of the pot still whisky with its impurities, they might designate it as rubbish. </para>
                        <para>Whisky made in a patent still, at one operation, contains fewer impurities than a similar product distilled three times in a pot still. All the leading brands of whisky on the market are blends of the products of both the pot still &#34; and the patent still. People who live city lives are unable to drink the pot still whiskies of the Highlands, as they find that these spirits give them &#34;a liver,&#34; whereas the patent still whisky can be taken in reasonable quantities without any deleterious effects. </para>
                        <para>It is a question for the public to decide. If they want flavour in a whisky, which may have been kept in wood for two or more years, it means a&#34; fat head &#34; in the morning. If they drink a mild-flavoured spirit, it will do them less injury, even if it has not been kept two hours in wood. As we know that patent still whisky is usually free from impurities, but that during its purification it is also deprived of its flavour, we suggest that the pure spirit produced by the patent still should be re-distilled in a pot still over malted grain or other materials necessary for producing the desired flavour in whisky, brandy, or rum. </para>
                        <para>The sale for human consumption of spirits made from wine, molasses, &#38;c, in a pot still, whether kept for two or more years in wood or otherwise, ought, for the sake of the health of the community, to be absolutely prohibited. </para>

                            <para>- We do not say so Senator DRAKE. - That is exactly the point. However the facts may be twisted, my contention is that if distillers are allowed to use silent spirit, we should not discriminate as to the materials from which the silent spirit is made, because it is perfectly &#39; clear, from the evidence of experts, that it does- not matter whether it is distilled from grape wine malt, or molasses. Therefore I say- that if we allow one we should allow the other. I have a little evidence to which I should like to refer on the question of the wholesomeness of molasses spirit. At page 8 of the digest of the evidence given before the Tariff Commission, honorable senators will find this evidence on the subject from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joshua</inline> himself </para>

As the item stands, 75. per cent, of the blended spirit may -be a spirit distilled from any low-class, damaged grain, rice, or anything else. It might be produced from any sort of grain, and all the evidence is absolutely overwhelming that spirit distilled from grain is indistinguishable from spirit distilled from molasses. In making the alteration to which 1 have referred, the Government have distinctly differentiated to the disadvantage of a raw material produced in Northern New South Wales and Queensland. Exactly the same remark applies to item 5. The item reads - </para>

                    <para class="block">Again, it is perfectly clear that the blended whisky referred to in item 5 is to contain 25 per cent, of spirit distilled from barley malt by a particular process, but with regard to the other 75&#39; per cent, it may be a spirit distilled from any material and in any way. There is only the limitation that it must be from grain, and there is here again a clear discrimination, with regard to the 75 per cent, of blended spirit, against the spirit which is the product of molasses, and which has been so largely manufactured in northern New South Wales and Queensland within the last few years. I shall ask the Senate to consider that matter very carefully, and, in justice to the industry carried on in those States, to alter the schedule to the form in which the items I have referred to appear in the recommendations of the Tariff Commission. I hope that in discussing the matter we shall not deal with any false issues. I am not raising any question of comparison between this silent spirit and spirit distilled at a low strength from grape wine, malt, or barley. I say, however, that all the evidence is to the effect that silent spirit made from one material is indistinguishable from silent spirit made from another, and there should, therefore, be no discrimination. </para>

                            <para>- Then I hope that honorable senators who are members of the Tariff Commission will assist me to have the alteration I have suggested made. If silent spirit is to be used at all, I say that the distillers should be allowed to use it whether it is made from the one material or from the other. All arguments used with respect to the cost of production are entirely by the way. It is absurd to suppose that we are going to have a protective system graded according to the difficulty of producing an article from certain raw materials. Some one might attempt to distil spirit from some material even less productive than grain, and he might then claim that he should get special protection on account of the advantages enjoyed by distillers carrying on their operations in a State producing in abundance a raw material from which spirits could be much more easily and cheaply produced. The fact that molasses spirit can be cheaply produced does not in anyway indicate that it is inferior. It is as wholesome as silent spirit produced from other materials, and it is the good fortune of Queensland and northern New South Wales that they should have in abundance the raw material from which spirit can be so advantageously produced. </para>

                    <para class="block">The local distillers are to be granted a large measure of protection. If we have regard to the difference that obtains now between Excise and Customs duties, and the proposals of the Bill, we shall see to what extent the additional protection extends. In respect of brandy distilled wholly from grape wine, the local manufacturers at present have to pay an Excise duty of us. per gallon, giving them an advantage of 3s. per . gallon over the imported article. Under this Bill the Excise duty will give the local manufacturers an advantage of 4s. In the case of blended brandy, under the existing Excise Tariff, the local manufacturers are paying 13s. -per gallon, and under this measure they will pay 11s., giving them an advantage of 3s. as against is. previously. In regard to blended spirits, the present duty is 13s., and the proposed duty is 12s., giving the local manufacturers an advantage of 2s. as compared with is. With regard to whisky, the present duty is 13s. per gallon ; the proposed duty is 10s., giving the local manufacturers a protection of 4s. per gallon, as compared with is. as at present.

                            <para>- If the honorable senator would consent to leave the matter to those who have had some experience of Wages Boards, we should have no difficulty in fixing a fair and reasonable wage. There is no need for me to appeal to the protectionists to support the principle of my amendment, whilst those who are freetraders, and who contend that the advantages derived by the local manufacturers is too great, should vote for it in order that a share of the advantage may go to the workmen. An additional reason for this request is furnished by some remarks made at a meeting of the Chamber of Manufactures last night by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> M. Joshua, who is largely interested in the spirit business. He said - </para>

                        <para>I believe that a great deal more training should be given to the boys by the State, and then the employers would not be bothered with lads for live years. If the boys were given two or three years&#39; training in technical schools, they could then learn the rest of their trade in two years. </para>

                    <para class="block">According, to this, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joshua</inline> believed that the State should be saddled with the expense of training boys in various trades and occupations, and that the employers should be freed from the responsibility or obligation of training their own boys. They would thus be advantaged by the instruction given to the boys at the expense of the whole people. He went on to say that, if the boys were instructed by the State, two years would be quite sufficient for them to become thoroughly conversant with any trade or occupation. Carrying that argument to a conclusion, it would mean that the State would be called upon to pay for&#39; the instruction of boys for the advantage of employers, and that after two or three years, and before the youths reached the age of manhood, they would be competent to do the work of men. Of course it is not expected that they would receive men&#39;s wages. Such a system is hardly likely to be approved by honorable senators, but I draw attention to the remark, because it shows the direction in which certain employers would be willing to go. I do not know that there can be any satisfactory grounds for opposing my request. </para>

                        <para>- - I ask the honorable senator not to press his request. I suppose that we are all extremely desirous that every employer should pay a fair rate of wages ; but does not <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> see the impossibility of inserting such a proposal in a Bill of this character? He does not define what a reasonable rate of wages is. What might be reasonable in one part of the Commonwealth, where provisions were cheap and house rent was low, might be far otherwise in another part, where the conditions were entirely different. Then, in regard to the employment of boys, he does not define what he means by ; a &#34;due proportion.&#34; But there is an even more fatal objection, and that is, as pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake,</inline> that it would penalize the whole of the distillers in the Commonwealth if one happened to pay an unfair rate of wages, or to employ an undue number of boy&#39;s. Would that be fair? Another objection to it arises under the Constitution. It is quite clear that, if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley&#39;s</inline> request were embodied in the Bill, it would be a dead letter. Section 55 of the Constitution provides that - </para>

                    <para>In face of that, it is useless to discuss the request. If it were inserted in the Bill it would have no effect. The object is a good one - that, where additional protection is given, the least employers can do is to pay fair wages. We all agree with that.

                        <para>- - I am afraid that the section of the Constitution that has been quoted is fatal to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley&#39;s</inline> proposal. I an&#93; sorry, because I am heartily in accord with it. I believe that, nowadays, every one has come to see the reasonableness of the proposition that when protection is being granted to an industry, it should be shared by all the employes in that industry. But, inasmuch as the Constitution confines taxation Bills to taxation proposals, I am afraid that there is nothing for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> to do but to withdraw his request. It has been argued that if, because one distiller was not paying a reasonable wage, the Excise duty were increased in order to punish that person, all the other distillers would suffer equally. That objection, I think, could be easily overcome by providing that the additional duty should be placed on only the commodity coming from his establishment. </para>

I think that we are all in accord with the honorable senator on that point. Whether free-traders or protectionists we do not care to give a special advantage to a manufacturer unless he is willing to grant a fair proportion of the advantage to his. employes. But the honorable senator must see that no matter how he may exercise his ingenuity, he cannot, by a process such as he has suggested, determine what would be the proper rate of- wages to pay to the men, or what would be a due proportion of boys to men engaged in an industry. If that is desired, it will be necessary to adopt, as in Victoria, a system of Wages Boards, or as in other States, an Arbitration Court. If each House of the Parliament were called upon .to consider whether distillers were paying their employes a fair and reasonable &#39;rate pf wages .per week oft forty-eight hours, it would open up an interminable debate. Although the Minister would be responsible for introducing the joint address, it would be open to discussion by every member of each House. </para>

                            <para>.- A Wages Board comprises only a few persons who hear the evidence and determine the matter, but Parliament would have no opportunity to hear evidence, and consider it as judicially as a Wages Board or Arbitration Court could do. Again, who would have to determine when a manufacturer was employing more than a due proportion of boys to men engaged in the industry? Would seventy-five men in one House and thirty-six men in the other House have to sit down and consider whether there should be one b&#39;oy to every two or five men engaged in the industry ? Surely the honorable senator will see what a field for5 discussion his proposal would create. From a speech by a Victorian manufacturer, he quoted a recommendation that the State Government should take the responsibility of educating the boys in the various trades, and that when they had been educated up to a certain standard the boys should pass over to private employment. Surely the honorable senator can see that that would cast upon the State Government a burden which is not reasonable. </para>

                            <para>- I am very glad to hear that statement. It should be remembered that while in some industries there is a large number of apprentices, in certain industries there are not enough, and, instead of having expert tradesmen by-and-by, we shall have a few men who have been fairly trained, and a large number of men who will possess only a smattering of knowledge of their craft. I would put it to my honorable friends who support a system under which I believe one boy to every five men is supposed to be employed, that it would be just as well to consider the question of allowing a great many more boys to be trained as their forefathers were. The amendment, if adopted, would be detrimental, not only to individuals, but to the community generally. In its present form, it would be absolutely impracticable. I think that it had better be withdrawn. </para>

                            <para>- That section was inserted in the Constitution in order to prevent &#34;tacking.&#34; The request deals undoubtedly with a matter of taxation. Clause 2 of the Bill does not deal with taxation, but relates to a matter of taxation, because it provides that brandy which has been in bond for a year may be cleared without paying the additional duties. The object of section 55 was to prevent a Government from bringing forward; as a taxation measure, a Bill which the Senate could not amend, and smuggling into it a provision which otherwise it could amend. But I am not prepared to admit that in a Bill imposing taxation we cannot insert any provisions we like in connexion with that taxation. For instance, suppose that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> were to leave out the introductory part of his amendment - that is -the affirmation of a principle - and to merely propose that - </para>

                        <para class="block">The Governor-General may, in pursuance of a joint address by the Senate and House of Representatives, impose an additional Excise duty of is. per gallon on each of the items mentioned in the schedule - would it not relate to a matter of pure taxation? The introductory part of the amendment is merely the condition upon which the honorable senator says that the additional duty may be imposed. But it is clear that if only the second part were enacted, and he considered that proper wages were not being paid in an industry, he could come down here and submit a motion for a joint address to the Governor-General on the subject. That would clearly be the better way to proceed, because it would be free from the objections so strongly urged to the request. As the proposal stands, it may be the affirmation of a principle, but, on account of its vagueness, it is nothing more. There is also the great objection, which I endeavoured to point out by way of interjection, that the distillers might be scattered all over the States, and if one committed a breach of the provision the Excise duty would have to be raised by is. all over Australia, and those who were observing what were deemed to be fair and reasonable conditions would thus be penalized. I have not seen legislation like this before, but, no doubt, the Excise duty would have to be raised on account of a joint address. I am not prepared to assent to the dictum of the Minister of Defence that the proposed amendment is unconstitutional, as repugnant to section 55 of the Constitution ; but a&#39; tax Bill must deal with a matter of taxation only. - if it relates to Customs taxation, it must not introduce Excise taxation, and <inline font-style="italic">vice versa.</inline></para>

A catch vote might be taken in each House, and then the Governor-General - which, of course, means the Government of the dav - would have the power, as I say, to decrease the protection afforded to distillers. However, I do not think that this is the sort of trap into which the Senate is likely to be led. </para>

I am afraid, however, that the proposal, if carried as presented, would not attain the honorable senator&#39;s object, which is that unscrupulous or inconsiderate employers shall be compelled to afford fair and reasonable treatment to their , employes. Assuming that there were 100 distillers in Australia, and that ninety-nine of them were paying reasonable wages and observing conditions to which no exception could be taken, while one was violating the conditions now proposed; under such circumstances, the only possible action under the proposed amendment would be to increase the Excise duty, and thereby injure the ninety-nine just employers. And the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake,</inline> while admissible under conditions that are possible, would, if carried out, have exactly the same effect. Having affirmed the principle that protection is a proper policy, I can see no objection to providing that, on a joint address from both Houses, the Excise duty &#39;might be either decreased or increased. </para>

The present proposal, however, would give power only to decrease the protection by raising the Excise duty. Parliament is to be given power to&#39; legislate by resolution, not for the advancement of Australian industries, but for their destruction or extinction. That is a proposal to which no protectionist could agree. As I have said, I cannot suggest any means by which, under our powers, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley&#39;s</inline> desire may be carried out ; and, under the circumstances, I urge him to withdraw the request. </para>

                        <para>- As bearing out the view which I laid before honorable senators just now. I refer to page 678 of Quick and Garran&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Annotated Constitution -</inline> &#34;One subject of taxation only.&#34; - By the first paragraph of the section, laws imposing taxation must deal only with the imposition of taxation. If the section contained no other limitation regulating and restricting the exercising of the taxing power, there would be nothing <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> prevent the House of Representatives from sending to the Senate a Bill containing a number of separate and independent taxes. The section, however, goes on to enact that laws imposing taxation shall, with the exception of those relating to Customs and Excise, deal with one subject of taxation only. It is necessary to explain the object of this limitation. By the second paragraph of section 53, the Senate is deprived of the power to amend tax bills, but it may constitutionally reject them. In order to maintain its right to veto, in detail, each specific tax to which it objects, without thereby involving the rejection of other taxes, of which it approves, the Constitution prohibits the combination of taxation proposals; it requires each proposed tax to be submitted by the House of Representatives to the Senate, in a separate Bill. This procedure being followed, the Senate can exercise its discretion with respect to each tax, without being coerced to pass a tax to which it objects, in order to carry a tax which it desires. In this respect the Senate will have greater control over taxation than the House of Lords enjoys. </para>

                        <para>. - It appears to me that the proposed amendment is unconstitutional, would be unworkable, and would lead to a great deal of trouble. I think it ought to be withdrawn. 1 understand the very object of protection to be to provide work at fair wages for the workmen engaged in the protected industries. Every one desires that where protection is afforded to an industry the workmen engaged in it shall get their fair share of the advantage afforded. But we cannot drag a question of wages into this Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> made a very cunning proposal to strike out all the reason given for the proposed amendment, and leave in only the last part of it. It appears to me that in doing that we should be violating the ordinary practice in dealing with Customs and Excise taxation. We are all aware that when Customs and Excise duties are to be imposed, no one knows anything about them until they are submitted to Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- I believe that in most instances no one does know, and certainly Ministers will not properly exercise their responsibility if any knowledge with respect to the duties to be imposed is allowed to leak out. But under a provision of this sort every one would know. If it were found that some distiller in a small way was not paying his men sufficient wages, every one would know that a proposal would be made to bring this provision into force for raising the Excise duties. One distiller would inform another, and we should have those who deal in liquor buying up all the spirits they could lay their hands- on, in anticipation of the increase in the duties. It is not possible to suppose that, because low wages are paid by distillers in two or three corners of the Commonwealth, the Excise duties shall be raised against distillers throughout the Commonwealth. The provision is absolutely unworkable, and let me point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> that I think it is also quite unnecessary. There is not throughout the evidence given to the Tariff Commission a single suggestion that distillers in Australia are not paving fair wages. In Victoria Wages Boards can be appointed to deal with the wages to be paid in this industry. </para>

                            <para>- In two of the other States Arbitration Acts have been passed, and the Arbitration Courts in those States can decide what are fair wages in the industry. I point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, who reminds me that we have no Arbitration Court or Wages Board in Tasmania, that a little dispute between a distiller and his workmen in New South Wales would lead to the fixing of wages in the industry bv an Arbitration Court, and if they were fixed at a rate considerably higher than the wages paid in the industry in Tasmania it would then be seen that fair wages were riot being paid in the latter State. But in such an event would any Government or Parliament dare to put this provision into force? It would be impossible to work it, and I believe that the Minister of Defence is quite right in saying that the proposed amendment is unconstitutional. </para>

                        <para>. - It is quite wonderful to notice the unanimity amongst honorable senators who do not belong to the Labour Party when any provision is introduced for the protection of workmen. They are prepared to defeat the provision suggested by a side-wind, and quite apart from its merits. The honorable senator who has raised the constitutional objection to the request is the member of the Government who leads the Senate at the present time, and he has altogether forgotten that the Government, of which he is a member, has introduced a similar provision in a similar Bill dealt with in another place. In the Bill introduced in connexion with the imposition of certain duties of Customs on harvesters there is a provision that the manufacturers must sell their machines under certain conditions at a certain price. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley&#39;s</inline> proposal is unconstitutional, then undoubtedly the Government, of , which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> isa member, have been guilty of submitting a similarly unconstitutional proposal. But the unconstitutional act committed in connexion with the Bill imposing duties on harvesters is committed on behalf of men of property, who can afford to purchase harvesters, whilst <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley&#39;s</inline> socalled unconstitutional provision is designed to benefit the unfortunate workers in an industry. It is therefore to get no sympathy from a Government kept in power by the Labour Party. I say that the members of the Labour Party will very soon get tired of supporting a Government which has no sympathy with the workers, and that is prepared by a side-wind to defeat a provision intended to secure to the workers the proportion of the protection proposed to which they are justly entitled. I feel indignant that every attempt made to ameliorate the conditions of the workers should be opposed on technical grounds, where it is not opposed straight out. </para>

                            <para>- Honorable senators opposite have assisted to carry the proposals of the Government more than once, and they saved the Government on a recent occasion, which must be fresh in the minds of the Committee. I do not agree with the proposed amendment, because I think it is too vague and indefinite. It does not indicate what is a reasonable wage, or how- it is to be arrived at. It provides that there shall be only a &#34; due proportion &#34; of boys employed, but there will be a hundred different definitions as to what a &#34; &#39;due proportion &#34; is. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> might say that two boys to five men would be a fair proportion ; I might say that the proportion should be one boy to five men ; and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> might say that one boy to ten men would be a fair proportion. </para>

It is quite evident that the present Government is not governed by caucus, and that its members do not consult together on measures to be submitted to Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- Every one knows that it is a fact that under a measure introduced by the Government in another place harvesters, after a certain time, must be sold at a certain price. That condition has been put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford&#39;s</inline> colleagues as one of the chief justifications for the measure. I wish to know how this request, moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> imposing a condition on behalf of the workers, can be any more unconstitutional than the imposition of a similar condition in a measure introduced in another place for the benefit of those who use harvesters? I object to this discrimination between different classes of the public. The workers are to be considered as outcasts and pariahs, whilst other people are to receive all sorts of consideration from the Government. </para>

                        <para>9-571- - I am rather surprised at the tone of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens&#39;</inline> remarks. He has been chiding, not only the Government, but the Opposition, because they are not prepared to support the proposed amendment which he has himself declared to be vague and undesirable. He has objected to the action of the leader of the Government in the Senate in Quoting the Constitution, but I should think that if any honorable senator believed a request made to be unconstitutional, it would be his simple duty to say so. </para>

I judge from, the honorable and learned senator&#39;s remarks that he does not think the request unconstitutional, but for certain reasons undesirable. If honorable senators believe that the amendment might be brought into conformity with the Constitution by the omission of paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">b,</inline> why do they not adopt that suggestion. If they are so anxious to insert a provision insuring that the employes in the industry shall receive a fair rate of wage, why do they not propose a request which will have that effect? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles</inline> tells us that he is very much in favour of assisting workmen, but he will not support a request of this character. Why? Because he alleges that it might be the means of increasing and not decreasing the Excise duties. But it is a reasonable thing, if honorable senators believe in any particular proposal or principle, and the amendment submitted will not carry it out, that they should propose something else which will give effect to what they desire. </para>

                            <para>- I desire to raise a point of order. The Minister of Defence has pointed out that under section 55 of the Constitution, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley&#39;s</inline> request would be inoperative, even if it were inserted in the Bill. The section provides that laws imposing taxation shall deal only with the imposition of taxation, and that any other provision shall be of no effect. I therefore urge that we are absolutely precluded from inserting in this Bill any other provision, than relates to the imposition of taxation. What <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> proposes does not deal with duties of Excise in any way whatever. Another objection to the request is that it is not within the title or scope of the Bill. The Bill is entitled- </para>

The second ground on which the point of order is taken is that the amendment is not relevant to the subject-matter of the Bill. The object of the Bill is to impose certain duties, and the object of the amendment is to add a proviso that the duties shall only be imposed under certain conditions.

I cannot see how it can possibly be laid down that on an occasion when a matter is stated to be so clear and distinct, that there can be no difficulty whatever in arriving at a&#39; conclusion, the President is to give a ruling, but that he is not to be called on to give a ruling when there is some difficulty. I am not going to give from the Chair any opinion on the point raised. The Committee is quite able to decide it, and it seems to me, as has been stated, to be perfectly clear; but what that clearness is, I shall not further say. The other question is as to whether the amendment it is proposed to request is relevant to the subject-matter of the Bill.

                    <para class="block">That is not die test laid down bv the Standing Orders. That was the test in force at one time in the House of Commons, but it was found to be too restrictive, and was altered. The test is that provided by standing order No. 79. which declares that any amendment to a Bill in Committee must be relevant to the subject-matter of the Bill, and standing order No. 24 r. which lays it down that the Committee shall not consider any matter which has not been referred to it. These are the standing orders which have to be construed in arriving at a decision. As I have stated repeatedly, it is merely a question of opinion on every particular occasion as to whether an amendment is, or is not, relevant to the subject-matter of the Bill. No rule can be laid down, because each particular set of circumstances varies - the subject-matter of the Bill is different, and the proposed amendment is different. I have already stated that I do not think it is my duty to dissent from the ruling of the Chairman, unless I am quite sure that he is wrong. I am not sure that the Chairman is wrong in this case, and therefore I uphold his ruling. </para>

In the first place, it is quite a surprise to me that this Bill should have been taken into Committee. I quite understood that after the second reading we were to proceed with the Spirits Bill. On that distinct understanding a number of pairs have been arranged,, and several honorable senators have gone away, quite expecting that the Spirits Bill only would be dealt with to-night. If the Minister of Defence thinks we ought to sit longer I must ask him, in view of the understanding arrived at, to report progress, and to proceed with the Spirits Bill. Then, in view of the fact that we have to meet again within the next twelve hours on the important occasion of a call of the Senate. I think I am. amply justified in suggesting that we should now adjourn. </para>

I am always quite willing to accede to the wishes of honorable senators on either side of the chamber, if I find it possible to do so. To-night <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> suggested to me that as the Spirits Bill was a machinery Bill, it would be better to proceed with the Excise Tariff Bill, which was the most important, and get that finished first. I told <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> that it was perfectly immaterial to me which Bill was proceeded with first ; and, regarding him as representing gentlemen opposite, I acted upon his suggestion. The result is that we are now engaged on the Excise Tariff Bill ; and I ask honorable senators to sit here until we have seen it through Committee. </para>

There would have been no discussion on the second reading of the Excise Tariff Bill if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> had not repeated the speech he made on the Spirits Bill. Indeed, it was understood that we were dealing with the two Bills as one, and that the second-reading speeches should serve for both. I find, however, that I have &#34; fallen in &#34; in regard to the position of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> who appears to be repudiated as the acting leader of the. Opposition. Am I to understand that gentlemen opposite have no leader in the absence of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> but are a disjointed lot? If so, then it appears to me that after the manner in which I have been treated, the better course would be to pay not the slightest attention to any honorable senator opposite in these matters in the absence of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon.</inline></para>

Speaking personally, I am not aware of any arrangement having been made with the honorable senator. In saying so, I think I am voicing the opinions of honorable senators on this side generally. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> will be able to speak for himself on the subject to-morrow. It would be very much, better if the Minister, instead of himself nominating some one to represent the Opposition, would permit honorable senators in opposition to suggest one of their number who should be authorized to speak for them. However, I think the Minister might agree to report progress after we have dealt with the clauses of the Bill, and leave the consideration of the schedule until to-morrow. </para>

It would not be fair to members of the Labour Party, who help to keep a quorum, so that the Government might carry on their business. We know that it is the object of the Opposition to prevent the Government from doing their business. I wish to see the measures now before the Senate passed into law. and we know that other Bills have vet to come before us. I understand that . we have only this week and next week within which to do all the business. If that be so, we cannot be running away at 11 o&#39;clock at night, but must be prepared to sit until 2, 3, or 4 o&#39;clock in the morning, if necessary. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> agrees to the request for an adjournment, I cannot (guarantee to assist him to&#39; keep a quorum to enable members of the Opposition to talk against time until  11  o&#39;clock at night, and then approach the Government for an adjournment. If honorable senators in Opposition must talk, we should be prepared to give them the whole night for talking, and if that were done I think that business would be transacted in very quick time. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator DE</inline>LARGIE (Western Australia &#91;10.48&#93;. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has just given honorable senators in Opposition some advice. I do not know exactly whether he is supposed to be a supporter of the Opposition or of the Government, but I have a vivid recollection that only a few days ago he was himself building up a stone-wall against a Government proposal. I think that this is a reasonable hour to adjourn, and that the Government have made very fair progress. I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart&#39;s</inline> advice will be taken only for what it is worth, and remembering his attitude of a few days ago, I should say it is not worth very much. </para>

I am prepared to give the Government reasonable support, and to assist in keeping a quorum, but I am not such a whale for work as to desire to be here night after night. I recognise that it is a reasonable thing for a man to be able to get to his bed about midnight, and the man who does not want to be in bed at midnight ought to be in gaol. </para>
