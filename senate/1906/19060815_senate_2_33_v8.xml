                        <para>- My attention was called to this matter when I first became Minister of Defence, but it has not been brought under my notice since that time. Certainly it has not been under my consideration of late. In the press I have seen a notice to the effect that a camp would be held at Albury, but I am not responsible for what appears in the newspapers. When I looked into the proposal twelve months ago, I found that the suggestion had been made &#39; to previous Ministers, hut that the cost was prohibitive, and that therefore the idea could not be considered. </para>

                    <para>.- I think that the Senate is indebted to Senators Symon, Millen, and Gould for their drastic criticism of the Bill and the searching analyses to which they subjected its provisions, to say nothing of its indebtedness to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> for his vigorous defence of it. I had not the privilege of being present whilst he was speaking, but I learn that such was the case. If the interpretation which my honorable friends on this side choose to put upon certain provisions were justified, then the Senate would have but one duty to perform, and that would be to reject the measure. Since the adjournment on Friday, I have had the opportunity of devoting a few hours to the study of its provisions, and I must confess that I see nothing which would justify such doleful apprehensions of disaster as my three honorable friends saw fit to express. The fundamental principle of the rpm is self-defence, and. its object is&#39; to insure fair competition in trade. A sum of ,&#163;700,000 &#39; a year is annually spent in preparing to defend our shores against aggression. We recognise as a first principle at all times that if we want to avoid aggression we must prepare for war. So it is in the industrial sphere. We have built up some valuable and important industries mainly, if not wholly, by the fostering influence of a system of protection. To show their extent, I shall quote a few figures which have been supplied to me by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Drake,</inline> the Government Statist showing the average number of hands employed and the value of the output of the manufactories of the Commonwealth. In 1904, the average number of hands employed was 203,213; the value of the raw material used was &#163;42,500,000; the added value in process of manufacture was upwards of &#163;29,199,298; and the total value of the output was &#163;71,699,298. In that year, the value of the machinery a,nd plant was ,&#163;21,971,512 ; and of land and buildings, nearly &#163;20,000,000; the total being ,&#163;41, 702.509. The industries which have been established are of such gigantic proportions that at least we are justified in taking strong measures to see to their efficient protection. All that the Bill seeks to do in this connexion is to give some assurance that colossal and wealthy corporations, such as exist in America, shall not be permitted to swoop down upon the young and struggling industries of Australia. In other words, we seek to raise a peaceful legislative barrier against all those gigantic monopolistic concerns which may have the intent of destroying our industries. </para>

                        <para>- I am only stating that we are seeking to protect ourselves against any effort on the part of wealthy American or other combinations to destroy our industries. That is the purpose of the T3ill. As from time to time the question has been asked what is the necessity for the measure. I would urge that, by making it known to such vast combinations that we have made legislative provision against any attempt on their part to crush our industries, as they have successfully done in regard to smaller industries within America, we shall prevent aggression on their part. From that stand-point I urge that the measure is one of a prudential character, and wise in its conception. It is one to which, in my judgment, neither free-trader nor protectionist can reasonably object. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. I have had an opportunity to look through the only speech against the measure which I believe has been circulated in print, .namely, that of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> and I was present for a time whilst Senators Millen and Gould contributed vigorous onslaughts upon it. I shall try to deal with some of the principal arguments urged by those honorable senators. At the outset, I totally differ from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> when he says of the measure that it is - crude, ill thought out, and in its provisions it will not carry out what ought to be the intent tion, namely, to prevent restraints in trade. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable senator1 will allow me, I would say that in America there are three Acts dealing with the objects covered by this Bill. The first is the Sherman Act dealing with trade within the limits of America and with freetrade conditions, the second the Wilson Act. which deals with importations, and the third the Elkin Act, dealing, if I remember rightly, with both internal and external trade. This Bill is founded on those measures. </para>

                        <para>- I beg the honorable senator&#39;s pardon. I was under the impression that &#39;he suggested that I had stated something, wrongly. I intended afterwards coming to the other two Acts. There are certain objectionable features in the Sherman Act opposed to the general principles of English law, and this Bill eliminates those objectionable American features, and seeks to adopt the principles of English law. It is very important also to&#39; remember that this Bill is framed with special regard to our jurisdiction and constitutional powers. Where any of its provisions might be the subject of doubt, honorable senators will find that the very words of our Constitution are used. I therefore congratulate the Attorney-General, the draftsman of the measure, on the legal skill and acumen which he has brought to bear upon it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> went on to say, with reference to the Bill - </para>

I om not saying that they are justified by the evidence, but the fact remains that in connexion with this particular industry there are causes of complaint and grievances. I need not refer to other combines that are perfectly well known to honorable senators. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator ^McGregor</inline> specially mentioned the monopoly connected with the sugar industry, and we know that there are shipping rings and other combines which have already been referred to. The fact remains that, even in view of our present conditions,&#39; it is essential that we should have a law of this kind on our statute-book, to check at the very outset their baneful influence.

                <para class="block">The honorable and learned senator gave us to understand that this Bill would have the effect of annulling existing contracts for the leasing of boot manufacturing machinery, and that prosecutions might take place as the result. I think that the honorable and learned senator was in error in those conclusions. I say so, of course, with the greatest respect for my honorable and learned friend. I understand that his reference was to the&#39; Goodyear bootmaking machines. In connexion with this machinery there are throughout Australia various contracts in force with boot manufacturers. They provide for the payment of royalties, and, as I gather, the boot manufacturer is obliged to take from the proprietor of the machines certain material, and the price to be paid for that material is, I understand, 5 per cent, more than the prevailing market price. </para>

                        <para>- He would be at perfect liberty to enter into any agreement or contract of a beneficial nature; the only contracts or agreements which may not be entered into are such as would be detrimental to the public. Clause 4 mentions any &#34; person or agent &#34; who &#34; makes or enters into any contract&#34;; and I say that these words iri themselves imply the future, and have no reference to the past. That clause goes on to speak of persons who enter into such contracts or agreements &#34; with intent &#34; to restrain trade or commerce to the detriment of the public. If a man innocently entered into such a contract before the passage of this Bill, he could not possibly have done so with: the intent to restrain trade under the terms of a measure that was not in existence. Subclause 2 provides that every contract made or entered into in contravention of the terms of the Bill shall be absolutely illegal and void. Honorable * senators will see, therefore, that the Bill cannot have any possible reference to existing contracts. </para>

                        <para>- At present I am merely contending, that the Bill cannot be retrospective, and, consequently, does not affect, existing contracts, which are a source of such apprehension on the part of the honorable senators with whose arguments I am at present dealing. In other words, the Bill says that a crime is not to be made retrospective; and it is a well known and acknowledged principle that no legislation must make a crime retrospective. I go further, and say that if contracts are beneficial - if they are not to the detriment of the public, and are not made to restrain trade or commerce to t&#39;he detriment of the public, or with intent to destroy or injure by means of unfair competition, any Australian industry, the preservation of which is advantageous to the Commonwealth, having regard to the interests of producers, workers, and consumers - they- may be entered into the day after this Bill lias passed. There is nothing in the terms of this measure that would prevent such a state of affairs eventuating. But I may be referred to the clause which deals with any person who is at present, or continues to be, a member of, or engages in, any combination. That, however, is. not the sort of contract with which I am now dealing. There is an offence mentioned in clause 4 of continuing to be a member of, or engaging in, any combination with intent to restrain trade to the detriment of the public, and with intent to destroy an Australian industry which is worth preserving. The Bill provides that any persons who enter into a conspiracy of that kind shall be guilty of an offence. Could anything be more fair or reasonable? That offence is not retrospective, because the Bill provides that if a person continues to be a member of a nefarious combination, such as is contemplated, there shall be an offence, and that practically means an offence after the measure has been passed. In other words, if a person continues to be a member of a nefarious combination, he is to be treated as though&#39; he had freshly joined after the passage of the Bill. Tha&#39;t is obviously the position ; and, consequently, if a person continues to be a member of a conspiracy against Australian industries, an offence will be created under the Bill, and there will be a liability to prosecution, as for any other criminal offence. Reference has been made to the Sherman Act; and so far as I could gather from the remarks of the three honorable senators who adversely criticised the Bill, they regard that Act with approval. I do not know whether I am doing <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> an injustice when, trusting to memory, I say that I understood him to tell us that if we had the Sherman Act he would be quite satisfied. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> is not prepared to say that he would be satisfied with the Sherman Act - though I understood from the general remarks of three honorable senators on this side that that Act met with their approval - and he now contends that the Bill does not discriminate between good trusts and bad trusts. If these are the views of my honorable friends on this side, I can only say that they cannot have given the Sherman Act, or the decisions under its provisions, their thoughtful and careful consideration. I undertook at the outset to prove, as far as I could, that this Bill eliminates what we conceive, according to our English ideas, to be the harsh and rather unfair provisions of the Sherman Act. I now propose to contrast the two measures. The first section of the Sherman Act is as follows: - </para>

                <quote>
                    <para>Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise,- or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is hereby declared to be illegal. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">That is .to say, it is a misdemeanour to so contract. </para>
                <para>Every person who shall make any such contract or engage in any such combination or conspiracy, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanour, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by a fine not exceeding $5,000, or by imprisonment not exceeding one year, or by both said punishments, in the discretion of the Court. </para>
                <para class="block">I desire now to show how the provisions in this Bill are more just. According to the terms of the measure before us, a man cannot be convicted of a crime unless he commits it with intent to do wrong ; whereas under the Sherman Act the most innocent of men may commit a crime unwittingly. In other words, an unfortunate man may. by some inadvertent act on his part, render himself liable to serious penalties. The Bill, in contrast to the Sherman Act, is a guarantee that an innocent man shall not be made a criminal. Under it it has to be proved, not only that the agreement is in restraint of trade, but further that it is detrimental to the public ; whereas under the Sherman Act, all that has to be proved is that the combination is in restraint of trade. The third distinction is that under the Bill it has further to be proved that the intention is to destroy or injure, by means of unfair competition, some Australian industry that is worth preserving. It will be seen that there is a vast difference between the Bill and the Sherman Act. </para>

I promised honorable senators that I would point out the English principles upon which this Bill is founded. I have shown that under American law any contract in restraint of trade, whether beneficial or &#39;injurious, is bad. As regards English law, the principle is laid down in the case of <inline font-style="italic">Nordenfelt</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Maxim,</inline> reported on page 549 of the Appeal Cases of 1894.

Tindal, C. j., said: &#34;We do not see how a better test can be applied to the question, whether reasonable or not, than by considering whether the restraint is such only as to afford a fair protection to the interests of the party in favour of whom it is given, and not so large as to interfere with the interests of the public.&#34; </para>

                <para>So that the British principle is that a. restraint in trade may be reasonable or it may be unreasonable. If it is fair and reasonable, that restraint in trade is good,, according to British law. If it is unfair or unreasonable it is bad. And it is so under the terms of this Bill. It is only in cases where there is, with intent, restraint of trade to the detriment of the public, or where an offence is committed, or a man enters into a contract, or continues in a combination, with intent to destroy or injure by means of unfair competition any Australian industry, the preservation of which is advantageous to. the Commonwealth, having due regard to the interests of producers, workers, and consumers - whose interests are so exclusively looked after by my honorable friends who oppose this Bill - that the action is illegal. This measure, therefore, is founded on British principles. There is another important matter to which I have been asked to make reference, and which requires a great deal of attention. That is the question of our power to interfere with persons who confine themselves to trading simply within the limits of a particular State. The question is : What are &#39;the powers of the Commonwealth in regard to to those persons ; and, also, what are the powers of the Commonwealth in relation to foreign corporations that attempt to trade within the Commonwealth? The difficulty will, no doubt, appear to some honorable senators to be more of less intensified when I say at once that I differ from the view of my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon.</inline> I should say, however, in justice to him, that I believe that if he had not overlooked the matter to which I am about to refer, he and I would probably be in complete agreement. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> said in the course of his speech - </para>

                <para class="block">In clauses 5 and 8 there is no such limita-&#39; tion as in clauses 4 and 7. In other words,, the Bill seeks to control the trade or commerce of the corporation referred to, even, if confined to the limits of a State; and,, according to my view, paragraph xx. of! section 51 gives us full power to do so.. So that the constitutional position appears, to be that we, as a Commonwealth, have no power to deal with or control any trade carried om by an individual within the limits, of a State. If, however, he attempts, to deal with other States, or with&#39; trade and commerce beyond the Commonwealth, we have full constitutional power to control him in the terms of clauses 4- and 6 of this Bill. But let us now take the other contingency. In regard to foreign corporations, I contend we have complete and unlimited control. If a. foreign corporation chooses to establish itself in a State of the Commonwealth, even if it confines its trade to the limits of that State, we have complete control over it. </para>

                        <para>- By the combination of paragraphs 1 and 20 of section 51 we have complete control over foreign corporations, whether they confine their business within the limits of a State or not. My view is that each of the paragraphs in section 51 is covered by the opening words of the section giving Parliament power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth ; that each paragraph confers jurisdiction as to the subject to which it refers; that each can be read independently almost as though the other thirty-eight paragraphs were absent ; and what is most important, that the &#34;words or phrases of each paragraph are to be given their fullest meaning, and are to be construed in their widest sense. These are the principles followed in the interpretation of the American Constitution. </para>

                <para>American Sugar Refining Co. (N. J. Corp), by buying up four Philadelphia corporations, acquired practical monopoly of manufacture. Manufacture is &#39;not commerce. Transaction bore no direct relation to Inter-State commerce. </para>
                <para>That means to say that those engaged in manufacture are not engaged in trade and commerce. But then there are certain other cases.

So that &#34; service &#34; in clause 7, being part of the trade and commerce, means transportation, and, according to my view, cannot have any regard to the labour engaged. I wish to attack another matter of which my honorable friends have made much. They have objected that this Bill is a mere scheme and pretence for further protection, and inquired why do not the Government boldly and honestly introduce Tariff proposals for increased duties. </para>

                        <para>- That may be ; but I wish to answer the objection just mentioned. Protection is very important. The object of Tariff proposals is to equalize conditions. We take our industrial conditions and star dard of life, and then we raise a barrier, so as to give our own people a fair show. </para>

                        <para>- No; that is exactly what it does, not mean, and that is what my honorable friend is disappointed to learn. Its design is to provide for emergencies as they arise, and -under circumstances mentioned in the Bill to prohibit. Tariff proposals are of general application. This Bill is of special application, and is only intended to meet emergencies. Tariff proposals deal only with normal conditions. This Bill seeks to deal with abnormal conditions. Tariff proposals, to a . greater or less extent, encourage trade on fair conditions. This is a Bill to prevent trade on unfair conditions; in other words, it is intended as an emergency measure, with the view that, if Messrs. Rockefeller, or other unscrupulous multi-millionaires of his type, attempt to swoop down upon our industries, we shall have at hand legislation to enable us to cope with them. (Personally, I do not hesitate to say that I object to a prohibitive Tariff. At the same lime, as a protectionist, what I seek to achieve is fair play for our own industries. If we attempted by means of the Tariff to secure what is aimed at by this Bill, we 1 should require to have a general prohibitive Tariff, under which unfair combinations, seeking to do injury to our industries, would be treated only in the same way as the fair trader. Such a thing we do not desire. We desire to encourage, trade on fair conditions, but we will not submit to colossal combinations or trusts bringing goods here- with the object of crushing our industries. According to honorable senators in opposition, in honesty this should only be done by a prohibitive Tariff. But, as we object to a prohibitive Tariff, which would punish the fair and the unfair traders alike, we prefer to resort to the means provided by this Bill. The contingencies proposed to be dealt with are well illustrated by what has taken place within our own experience. I ask honorable senators what it is that the International Harvester Company have attempted to do? I have had put into my hands one or two letters, to which the attention of the Senate might well be directed. Honorable senators are aware that some time ago the International Harvester Company boasted that they controlled 90 per cent, of the trade in agricultural implements. </para>

                    <para>Now that we have not only the most complete but no doubt the best line of harvesting and seeding machinery in Australia, .we would ask you to discontinue McKay harvesters, as we are positive you could do .much better if you handled our goods exclusively. The inducement we offer you in the way of commission and competent salesmen and experts should be an incentive to you to stand by the company, that is not only in a position to give you the largest line of goods to which they are adding every year, 1 but are ever ready and willing to treat fairly with you in assisting you in every way possible to make a success. </para>
                    <para>You are no doubt aware that the International . Harvester Company of America manufacture and sell 90 per cent, of the world&#39;s output of harvesting machinery, and it goes without saying that this company will continue to grow, and under such circumstances we are sure you would prefer to be identified with a company that will be . the most .useful to you from a remunerative stand-point. </para>
                    <para>There is also another advantage for you particularly to note, viz., a&#39; very considerable saving of your time and horse flesh in being able to take care of the whole of your machine business during one visit, with the one salesman of proved ability and experience. There will be a saving of your valuable time on sales and keeping accounts and in correspondence. </para>
                    <para>We feel that our full line should be distinctly represented by each and every agent with whom we contract, and when one of our agents handles other lines of goods that are in direct competition. with ours or part of ours, we feel that our business suffers thereby to a certain extent, and we are therefore inclined to the opinion that should we be obliged to transfer the agency on this account, even if the new agent were unable the first year to sell as many machines of a certain kind as the former agent did, that in the aggregate he would do a better business for us than the agent who sells only certain lines of our goods to the exclusion of the balance. </para>
                    <para>We are placing this matter fairly before you in order that you may see it from our view point, and we trust that this letter will be the means of securing to us an exclusive contract with you for the McCormick line. </para>

                    <para>Dear sir, </para>
                    <para> I have been offered&#163;70 cash on starting for a Sunshine harvester. Kindly inform&#39; me if you will accept it, it is going into a new district, and my client has been offered good terms by the International, and intends going for one if you cannot do a Sunshine at this price offered. </para>
                    <para>I was present when the International representative offered the following terms, viz. : - 1. or 2 machines at... ...&#163;60 cash. 3 machines at ......&#163;150cash. </para>
                    <para class="block">So you can see what is being done. He sold two at&#163;120 to one man. Of course, I could not go near him at your prices. Early reply will oblige. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">That is important, because when the Minister of Trade and Customs raised the valuation of these machines for Customs duty to &#163;65, there was a great outcry against his action. I understand that these people set to work to secure the trade by reducing their prices, although at one time they represented that, in view of the cost of &#34;manufacture and expensive sale, they could not sell at a reasonable profit below &#163;81. </para>

                        <para>- McKay said the same. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator BEST.</inline> - Notwithstanding that fact, we have it recorded in the letter I have read that they not only attempted to sell, but actually did sell, one of their machines at &#163;60, and three others for &#163;150,or&#163;50 each. What is the object of this? This indicates in a small way what we have reason to expect will develop. </para>

                        <para>- Very likely he did, and 1 remind honorable senators that the object of this Bill is not merely to regulate the International Harvester Company, but likewise <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay. Mr. McKay&#39;s</inline> trade is not confined to one State. It extends throughout the States, and he has also an export trade. Consequently if he transgresses in any way the provisions of this Bill, he will be liable to the punishment provided for offences against the measure. The law is that, if persons conspire for the purpose of committing a criminal offence upon an individual, they will be liable to punishment, and if they conspire for the purpose of injuring any Australian industry, they will, under this Bill, be guilty of a criminal offence, and liable in that case to punishment also. According to my view, the Bill is one which should be supported by free-traders and protectionists alike. I will take, for example, the instance of an industry in New South Wales-if it is possible that any industries have been established there under free-trade, and I do not know whether there have been any. </para>

I ask honorable senators whether they would quietly stand by and see aru industry, which had been established in New South Wales, wiped out by a nefarious combination such as that to which I have referred ? 1 say that it would be unpatriotic on their part to do so. I desire to emphasize the fact that the Sherman Act is designed primarily to meet free-trade conditions, and to urge that free-traders ought to support this Bill. As I say, the object of the Sherman Act is to provide against monopolies under the free-trade which exists throughout the United States. Let us assume that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr,.

                            or &#39;anybody else, set to work with the determination to wipe out all opposition and capture the whole of the trade of Australia im any particular department of trade - say agricultural implements, by way of example. Let us suppose that such combination or monopoly, seeing sufficient field for their labours, decided to confine their trade to the Commonwealth alone. Under these circumstances, what would be the value of a prohibitive Tariff?

                        <para>- The Tariff suggestion is a mere bogy. The object of the Bill is clearly defined - namely, to prevent any deliberate effort to injure our Australian industries.

                <para class="block">American procedure to combat them. At first, the combination or trust was simply brought about by an agreement to regulate trade and prices. That agreement was held by the Courts to be in restraint of trade, and fundamentally wrong, and, consequently, it was declared to be illegal. In order to, elude that decision, the next step was taken of vesting the stock in trustees, which it was thought, in the absence of an agreement, would not be a combine. The trustees were empowered to declare how they would hold the stock, and by this means they managed to regulate trade. The Courts, however, again decided that this procedure was in restraint of trade, and therefore illegal. The next step was to form a new company, the business of which it was to hold the stock of other companies ; but the final blow was struck even at this device. It was held, in what is known as the &#34; Northern Securities case,&#34; that such a holding company was in restraint of trade, and illegal. What I have indicated are the policy, experience, and decisions under American legislation. We have to remember how relentlessly the United States Courts have pursued trusts and combinations, in spite of all the ingenuity and skill of the greatest commercial intellects in the world. It is true that the American Courts have only been able to discount that ingenuity ; but that is no reason why we at the outset of our career, and before combinations and trusts have secured a grasp of the Commonwealth trade, should not take every possible precaution to secure ourselves against the dire contingencies to which I have referred. If we do not curtail the powers and influence of combinations and trusts at the very beginning, they will ultimately become so tyrannical and intolerable as to be an alarming menace to the community. </para>

                        <para>- The Bill has been framed with care, with a view to nullifying, all unreasonable restraints, and unreasonable restraints only, on trade and commerce. The suggestion that it may become an engine of oppression, and may inflict all sorts of cruelties, at the hands&#34; of the Protectionist Party, is unjust criticism-. I should now like to deal with certain other objections which have been raised during the course of my remarks. I desire to show&#39; exactly what would have to take place in a prosecution under this Bill - the proofs necessary before a conviction could be obtained under clause 4. Let us take the case of a man who was charged with making or entering into a contract, or, if honorable senators like, with continuing to be a member of. or engaging in, a combination. The first thing that would have to be proved* would be that the contract had been entered into. I desire honorable senators to follow me, because I propose to show where presumptions would come in. Then it would have to be proved that the contract had been made with intent to restrain trade or commerce to the detriment of the public On this point, there would have to be distinct proof - no presumption. In other words, there should be no presumption- in criminal cases. </para>

                        <para>- It may be, as the honorable senator suggests, an industry employing either ten hands or 10,000 hands. What I am pointing out now is what would have to be distinctly proved in a prosecution. Further proof would have to be forthcoming that the industry threatened was one worth preserving, or, to repeat an expression I used in 1896, not a &#34; polar tear industry.&#34; In&#39; determining whether the competition was unfair, due regard would, under the Bill, have to be paid to the efficiency of the management, the processes, the plant, and the machinery employed or adopted in the Australian industry. We have now reached the stage at which presumptions would take place. The onus would now be thrown on the defendant of proving, say, that he was not a member of a commercial trust. He would also have to prove that the competition would not probably, or in fact, result in inadequate remuneration of labour in the Australian industry, or create substantia&#93; disorganization and throw workers out of employment. </para>

                        <para>- If the Judge is satisfied that the restraint of trade is detrimental to the interests of the Australian public, and that the effect is to destroy by unfair competition an Australian industry worth preserving - that is to say, if he is satisfied in the language of paragraph- <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> of clause 10 that the action is - in restraint of trade or commerce to the detriment of the public - arid if he is satisfied, moreover, that the action is, as a matter of fact - destructive or injurious by means of unfair competition to a-&#62;y Australian industry, the preservation of which is advantageous to the Commonwealth, having regard to the interests of producers, .workers, and consumers - then the Judge of the High Court, after judicial inquiry, can issue an injunction. I do not propose to deal at length with an amendment which I intend to propose later on; but I think an amendment should be made to meet certain improper practices in connexion with the system of granting rebates. I will show that there is a definite public opinion on this subject.

                    <para>The notorious Standard Oil Trust evidently means to fight the Commonwealth Government on the Anti-Trust Bill. A few weeks ago it announced the withdrawal of the rebate it gives distributors, provided they make a declaration they have not handled or sold any other oil but the Trust&#39;s. This rebate has again been resumed, and officers of the Trust openly jeer at the ability of the Government to suppress illegal monopolistic practices. The Standard Oil Trust is the parent of the evil brood of Trusts now affecting the world. The Harvester Trust is its progeny, and the Deakin Government would become a laughing stock if it allowed its laws to be so openly defied by this monopoly. </para>

                <para class="block">There is an improper practice existing by means of which the Standard Oil Trust insists upon the whole of a man&#39;s trade being confined to it, and, in the event of that trade being so confined, certain rebates are paid to him. I shall move an amendment upon this point in Committee, to the effect that these practices shall be regarded as <inline font-style="italic">prima facie</inline> unfair competition. I shall confine mv further remarks to the clauses relating to dumping. They &#39; are contained in part 3 of the Bill. I point out at the beginning .that rio criminal liability attaches as regards dumping. We have been told during the debate that the effect of the clauses would be to rob consumers of the cheap goods and bargains which hitherto have been a feature of some forms of trading. In my view importers can trade under these clauses just as freely as at present, provided that they do not so trade with the deliberate intention of crushing local industry. Ordinary normal trading, including the selling of cheap goods and bargains subject to the Tariff, may go on precisely the same i,ri future as in the past. </para>

The next point is that if the importer wishes to have his good&#39;s he can give a bond. Then he can continue his trade as hitherto. I point out. further, that the Judge is to be guided by - . - good conscience and the substantial merits of the case without recourse to legal forms &#34;and technicalities, or whether the evidence before him is in accordance with the law of evidence or not. </para>

If we are ready to commit to our Courts the decision! of our various differences on other business matters, and if we have confidence in their justice, why cannot we trust them to say whether these goods are being imported with the view of injuring any Australian industry, or not? Surely the decision of the Court on a matter of that kind may be reasonably and fairly accepted.

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline>
                    himself ultimately put through this Legislature. In section 23 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, those very words are used -

                <para class="block">So that when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> takes exception to the words used in the Bill before us, it is a fair retort that he is at least equally responsible for the same words being used in this Act. </para>

                        <para>- In concluding. I simply point out that, as the result of investigation and careful thought, I have come to the conclusion that this is not a measure from which the disasters that have been predicted will accrue, but that it is a fair and .reasonable precautionary measure, which it is wise that we should adopt. It is complementary to the system of protection that already exists in the Commonwealth. According to my view, it is therefore wise and prudent to thus further protect our industries, and I think that, with possibly a few verbal exceptions, the Bill can be commended as one which is in the best interests of the Commonwealth. </para>

It has attracted a great deal of attention, not only in Great Britain and Australia, but also in. and perhaps principally in, the United States of America.. But even there, although they have had three Acts on the subject, they have not yet arrived at a true solution of the difficulty. They have only succeeded in a verv partial manner in interfering with the operations of the trusts and combines in that country. </para>

                        <para>- What the Socialists desire is to nationalize the monopolies held by the great trusts, because they say that then they would be carried on in the interests of the public only. The opinion which is held by the President of the. Republic, and I believe by very many of the earnest thinkers in the United States, is that, while it seems to be almost impossible to overcome the operations of these trusts, if they cannot be abolished they can be controlled by law, and that will be, I think, the true solution. This question has naturally engaged the attention of the Commonwealth Government, almost from the first, and a great deal of attention was drawn to it &#39;at the time when the Tariff was passing through Parliament. It was argued frequently by those who were opposed to protective duties that, under the operation of protection, rings and trusts would be formed, which would have a tendency to raise prices to the consumer, and various suggestions were made as to the means which might be taken to overcome any such tendency. There is one remedy which appears at first sight to be almost obvious, but when it is looked into it is found to be attended by such disadvantages that it has to be put on one side. It has been pointed out that under the operation of a high protective Tariff manufacturers or producers might combine together and raise the prices of articles right up to the limit at which they could be imported. And it has been urged that the natural remedy in that case would be, either by Act of Parliament or by Executive action under the authority of an Act of Parliament, to lower the duty until the operations of the combination had been met - that is to say, to compel a reduction to lower prices to the consumer by allowing the goods to come in at- a reduced duty. That looks like an obvious remedy. But it is open to two almost insuperable objections. One objection is that, in endeavouring to defeat the operations of a ring by that means, we should be destroying smaller men in the same trade, who, perhaps, were being equally crushed by the ring; and the second objection is that if we succeeded in defeating the ring, we should probably be injuring our own producers and manufacturers bv admitting importations which were the produce of a big ring outside. I believe that no means have yet been devised to meet rings operating in that way to the disadvantage of the consumer. If they have been devised, I should very much like to know what they are. These are the rings and combinations which, it seems to me, we should be most earnest and anxious to endeavour to defeat, if possible. I shall show directly that they are not dealt with in any efficient manner in the Bill.&#39; and perhaps we have not power to do it. When I was in England, thirteen or fourteen years ago, there was brought under mv personal notice an instance of the operation of one of these rings or combines, such as I think ought to be dealt with in some way. In the depth of winter, when the thermometer fell 20 degrees below freezing point, the price of coal suddenly went up, owing, I was told - and I do not doubt the statement - to a combination on the part of the coal merchants when it was in &#39;great demand. I saw the carts going about the streets of London, and selling coal in sixpenny worths and threepenny worths to poor people. In that- way the price of coal .was raised to the poorest of the poor at the very time when the severe cold was compelling them to part with almost their last pence in order to purchase fuel. That- is the sort of combine upon which I think all the resources of civilization should be brought to bear. </para>

                        <para>- Combinations, I have no doubt, are formed in the same way in regard to wheat, some of them so large that perhaps they would not be touched under the Bill. I do not know whether they would or would not be. Any combination to raise the price of the necessaries of life would not be met by the Bill, for this reason : that its operations would always be confined within a State. Where the object was to raise the price in, a retail market it would not be a matter of a combine extending from State to State. It would be a combine within a State, and would not be dealt with under the measure. </para>

                        <para>- The Bill purports to give power to deal with a case like that, if the operations are being carried on bv a foreign corporation, and not by a British corporation. I wish to make it perfectly clear that the combinations I have referred to cannot be dealt with under the Bill, because they would be operating within a State. Let me now deal with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best&#39;s</inline> point about the Constitution. The Government and the draftsman of the Bill must have taken the view that is taken by the honorable and learned senator with regard to the power given to us in the Constitution to deal with foreign corporations. Section 51 tells us what our powers are. It says - </para>

                <para>I contend that in this paragraph are included the whole of our powers to deal with trade and commerce with other countries and among the States. If it were otherwise, the framers of the Constitution would have extended the paragraph, and made the limitation less severe. They would have told us what other powers of trade and commerce we had. But as they give in that paragraph no powers in regard to trade or commerce, except with other countries and among the States, I contend that those are all the powers we have. Of course, I quite agree that if we found any subsequent provision in the Constitution which clearly contradicted that, and gave us any other power with regard to trade and commerce, then,- following the well-known rule of interpretation, the latter would prevail, and our power would be increased. But we are not to assume, when we find a subsequent provision which may be. regarded as somewhat ambiguous, that the intention of the framers of the Constitution was to extend the powers given in paragraph 1. of section 51. I now come to paragraph xx. of that section, under which we have the right- </para>

                        <para>- My interpretation of the paragraph is that it gives all1 the necessary power to make laws corresponding with the Companies Acts which have been passed in the various States, and which contain provisions regarding the formation of corporations, the way in which the shares shall* be held, the number of officers who shall be appointed, whether there shall be a registered office, and all those other provisions; which are necessary to identify a corporation, and make it a corporate body which can sue and be sued. Foreign corporations are mentioned specially, as well as trading and financial institutions, -which are British institutions, because it is well known that in the case of&#34; foreign corporations it is necessary to have some different provision, in consequence of the fact that the bulk of their capital is; held outside of Australia. </para>

That is unthinkable. When in the Constitution, from first to last, we draw so clear a dividing line between Commonwealth and States interests, and endeavour, wherever possible, to leave States interests to the States Governments, it is unthinkable that, while preventing us from making any difference between a British and a foreign trader within a State, it should give us the power to discriminate between a British corporation and a foreign corporation within the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- -I beg the honorable and learned senator&#39;s pardon. I misunderstood his objection. &#34;Foreign&#34; means &#34; non-Australian.&#34; certainly. As I read the paragraph, it refers to all those matters which are dealt with in the Companies Acts which have been passed in the various States. The matter is not being, discussed now for the first time. My contention is that, under paragraph i of section 51, our powers with respect to trade and commerce are limited to trade and commerce with other countries and among the States, and paragraph xx. does not give us any additional power with regard to trade and commerce. It does -not involve any alteration of the limitation of our powers with respect to trade and commerce, but simply provides for legislation with respect to those matters already embodied in the companies laws of the States. Paragraph xx. provides that we may deal with foreign corporations and trading or financial corporations in the way in which they are dealt with in the Companies Acts of the various States. In Queensland we have Companies Acts and British Companies Acts, and I suppose the same may be said of Victoria. Only a few years ago an Act was passed in Queensland amending the British Companies Act, and making some alterations with regard to the status of such companies. The view I take is that this simply refers to the status of these particular corporations. </para>

I think that, if it had been intended that trade and commerce, as referred to in section 51, should not be limited1 to trade and commerce between the States and with foreign countries, that would have been stated. It has not been so stated. However, there is little use in talking at length on this matter. We might talk for a month on this, particular question without agreement, and the High Court will eventually have to decide it. </para>

                        <para>- I have no desire to interrupt the honorable senator, but he will allow me to say something by way of illustration. It was only a very few years before the Commonwealth came into existence that we began to legislate in the States in anyway with regard to a director&#39;s personal liability. It might be that in the next ten or fifteen years some alteration of companies legislation of that character might be necessary. Does the honorable and learned senator contend that we could not introduce that legislation? </para>

                        <para>- I hope that I have made it clear that this Bill does not deal with the particular kind of combination which I think is most objectionable. But all through the measure it is very clear that there is an effort made to prevent combinations from reducing prices to the consumer. Remembering, the discussions which have taken place here with respect to harvesters and such things, there can be no doubt that the main object of .the Bill is to prevent combinations which would reduce prices in such a way as would compel local competitors to reduce their prices also, and render them unable to pay the rate of wages and to comply with the conditions we require for our Australian workers. It cannot be doubted that that is the main object df the Bill. We are seeking to repress combinations in restraint of trade, and behind the Bill there seems to be a combination between the workers in certain specific trades and the capitalists carrying on those trades, to raise prices to the consumer, and to share the profits between them. </para>

                        <para>- It is not likely that any such reduction as that would be brought about to any considerable extent by a combination within the Commonwealth. It is more likely that the lowering of prices to the consumer, which would affect Australian industries injuriously, as contemplated by the Bill, would arise from importation. Therefore, we have to look more particularly to what are called the &#34;dumping&#34; clauses of the Bill. Dumping may be of two kinds. There is the dumping which consists in the practice generally adopted by manufacturers of sending their surplus products to some other country, and selling them- there at the highest price they can get, and if they cannot get the price they desire, at whatever they will fetch. That is the form of dumping which is carried on very -largely by ourselves in our butter and meat exporting industries. In the course of the debate we have heard a great deal about manufacturing industries, harvesters&#39;, and so on, and suppose, for a change, we turn our attention to mutton and beef. These are the particular articles in which my constituents are more directly interested. We send our meat to the English market, and sell it for what it will fetch. </para>

                        <para>- &#34; Dumped,&#34; if the honorable senator pleases. If honorable senators will look at the trade circulars they will see that the prices realized are sometimes very low indeed. We do not like that, but we accept it as in the natural order of things. I do not know whether the people engaged in the cattle industry in the United Kingdom like the importation of our meat in large quantities, but they do not appear to complain of it. We have been very anxious to find a market for our meat on the Continent of Europe, and we have considered ourselves very harshly treated by France, Austria, and Germany, because we have been practically kept out of their markets by means of their hostile tariffs. I have no doubt that we should be very pleased if representations were made to&#34; the Governments of those countries asking them not to interfere with our practice of dumping meat in foreign markets. It would certainly look strange if we were to make such a request, and accompany it with this Bill. . </para>

                        <para>- None whatever; but we have been dumping our produce, and this must be against the interests of the people engaged in the old country in these particular trades. .But, supposing the people at Home did raise some objection) what should we be able to say then, in view of this Bill ? I have not the slightest doubt that if we took the opinion of the people of Australia generally, as to whether they were in favour of an International law against dumping, it would prove to be an adverse opinion. They would say that they preferred to keep the power to dump their produce wherever they chose ; and certainly the interests of our people, in connexion with this power or permission to sell their produce in any market for what it will fetch, are much larger than the interests sought to be considered by the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- I do not make any such admission. What we send to the old country is our surplus, and we sell it for what is will fetch in competition with the beef and mutton producers there. If a man engaged in this particular industry at Home, went to Smithfield and saw his produce selling at id. per lb. less than it would have brought had he had possession of the whole market, could we not understand him using the same arguments that are advanced in support of this Bill ? Could that man not say that the dumping of produce on the market reduced the value of his productions, and prevented him from paying wages and complying with the conditions of labour he would like to observe? </para>

                        <para>- We have seen the time when free-trade was so worshipped in Great Britain that a man scarcely dared acknowledge himself a protectionist. Evidently the tide has now absolutely turned ; and the people of England may yet be asaidently protectionists as they were free-traders when I was a young man. Events march rapidly nowadays, and it is not at all impossible that five, .ten, or twenty years hence, when this Bill is in operation, the men engaged in the grazing industry in England, mav complain about the dumping of our beef and mutton on their market? </para>

                        <para>- T shall not discuss that point. It is nearly a year since the cry was raised about the &#34; strangled industries &#39; &#39; of Victoria, and we were told that measures were necessary for their rescue. The Bill before us is, I think, intended to come to the relief of some industry, which is said to be not so prosperous as those engaged in it would like it to be, but which is certainly not in an unprosperous condition. One honorable senator, in the course of the debate, has quoted statistics showing the increased number of hands employed in the factories of Victoria since Federation. I am very glad to hear off that success, because it affords a justification of our Federal conditions, and the Tariff we all assisted to pass. But it must be remembered that this great prosperity in Victoria has to a great extent been obtained at the cost of some of the other States. I have not the figures here, but there has been a continual falling off in the number of hands employed in manufacturing; in Queensland from the time of Federation. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so; and the result in Queensland has been that the importations from the south, more particularly from Victoria, have taken the place of goods which previously were imported from oversea. This hits Queensland in two ways. In the first place, it restricts our manufacturing operations and closes our factories ; and, in the second place, it deprives the State Treasurer of the revenue which formerly resulted from the duties on the imported goods. I am not stating these facts by way of complaint, and I do&#39; not believe that my constituents would complain, because what is disclosed is the natural operation of a uniform Tariff. We consented to that Tariff for the benefit of the whole of Australia, without taking into consideration the effect it might have in Queensland. But is it not strange that, under these circumstances, the State that has derived most advantage from the Tariff should now be crying, out about strangled industries,&#34; and urging for a Bill of this kind, which confers such extraordinary powers? This is a Bill which ostensibly has a general application, but which is clearly intended to have a partial one. </para>

I have no desire to discuss fiscalism more than I can help, but I must say that this Bill means prohibition if it means anything; if it operates at all, it must operate by prohibition. I do not quite appreciate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best&#39;s</inline> nice distinction between stopping an article and preventing it from passing the Customs until security has been given for the whole of its value. </para>

                        <para>- It is of no use to interrupt me by saying that the Justice may find that it is not &#34; unfair competition. Now, I want to say something on the question of protection. I have always held that protection means the adoption of a scale of duties that will insure fair competition, having regard to the rate of wages that we pay and our standard of living. But I have never understood protection to mean such duties as will absolutely exclude competition from outside. That is a very important point. I think that protectionists in supporting a measure of this kind are giving up one of the most powerful arguments they have. If one reads <inline font-style="italic">Carey,</inline> who is the most philosophical writer on protection that America has produced - though he is now considered, perhaps, a little out of date - one finds that he, and almost all the other, writers of his school, argue that protection does not raise prices to the consumer. I dare say that my honorable friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> has often used that argument. </para>

                        <para>- I differ from the honorable senator, and the great protectionist writers differ from him also in that respect. Their argument is that the competition which insures cheapness for the consumer is that which arises between the goods manufactured&#39; outside and the goods locally produced. It is that competition which insures that prices will not be unduly raised to the consumer. This Bill, so far as it operates at all, will deprive us of that advantage altogether. The protectionists are losing the very argument that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> and others have often put before the public to convince them of the soundness of their policy. The Bill means keeping foreign goods out of the country altogether when they appear to injure an internal industry. That means, consequently, doing away with the competition upon which the consumer has mainly to depend to insure that prices will not be unduly raised against him. I should like to point out that sub-clause 3 of clause 18 is distinctly ambiguous. I was very doubtful as to its meaning when I first read it, and I notice that some speakers have interpreted it in one way and some in another. The subclause reads - </para>

                <para class="block">I understand that the position of the Government is that that provision means that it shall not be deemed that there is &#34;unfair competition &#34; if the local factories are not up-to-date,. If that is what the clause is intended to convey the meaning should be made clear. It is so ambiguous in its present form that it might be read to mean that especial tenderness is to be shown to an industry that is working under very different conditions. </para>

                        <para>- It is a question for Committee : but we range through a Bill on the motion for the second reading, and generally direct attention to matters that are not clear. It seems to me that the subclause ought to be made to read that there shall be no unfair competition unless the industry is carried on under the most modern conditions. If that is what is really meant, I have no objection&#39; to the subclause. Otherwise, the prohibition spoken of in the Bill would be most injurious. It would be running protection up to the extreme of prohibition in such a way as to enable a local factory to be carried on under conditions that -were out-of-date. Protection should never be carried to that extent, or a distinct premium would be given to factories to work with old machinery, and to use out-of-date processes. No nation at the present day can afford to do that. The world is growing smaller and smaller, and we should soon drop behind entirely in the race if we did not adopt the most modern appliances and the most up-to-date machinery. The provision will operate most unfairly, if it operates at all, in regard to a State like Queensland. Suppose that we wanted foreign coffee to be prohibited for the benefit of a small coffee industry in Queensland. </para>

Yet this is a Bill to suppress monopolies ! If that&#34; be so, my objection to the Bill is even stronger than ever. Let me show how it will operate. Take the case of galvanized iron. I believe that there is a galvanized iron-making industry in New South Wales. There may be such an industry in Victoria.

                        <para>- We will suppose that the Bill is intended to assist concerns that are small at. the present time, but which may grow until they are able to supply the wants of all Australia. Galvanized iron is an article that is largely used as a roofing material in Northern Queensland. Suppose that the people engaged in making galvanized iron complained to the Minister that the importations were preventing them from carrying on their industry at the rate of wages they were paying, and under the conditions they were maintaining; and suppose that they asked the Minister to prohibit those importations. If the Minister took any action he would have to put a notice in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette.</inline> From the time it was inserted the importation of galvanized iron would be practically stopped. It could only go into consumption if the person importing gave security practically to the value of his importations. What that amounts to is this : The factory that is manufacturing galvanized iron is not able at present to supply the whole of Australia. It merely hopes to be able to do so, if it gets a monopoly. But the people in Northern Queensland want this material for building purposes. They have entered into building contracts. They want roofs to cover their heads. They, however, cannot get the material they require, because a little factory, say in Victoria, finds that it cannot stand the competition from outside, and has .asked the Minister to put this Bill into operation. The Minister cannot put it into operation partially and stop the importation of galvanized iron into Victoria, so as to give the Victorian factory a start at the expense of the people of this State. If he acts at all, he has to prohibit the importation into the whole Commonwealth . </para>

                        <para>- What are the consumers&#39; interests? According to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith,</inline> galvanized iron would become cheaper if the one factory secured a monopoly of the trade. The argument of those interested in the industry would be, &#34; Give us prohibition now, and eventually our article will be cheaper to the consumer than it is at present.&#34; The point which I &#39; am dealing with is : What is going to happen after the notification is put in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette?</inline> Will the one factory be able to supply all the demands of the States? Certainly it will not be able to supply them except at prohibitive rates for a long time. In the meantime the people will be put to the greatest possible inconvenience. If that is the way the Bill is to operate it is not fair, equitable, and reasonable to all the States of the Commonwealth, and, seeing that Victoria, of all the States, has benefited most from our protective Tariff, I think it comes with a very bad grace that she should ask for a Bill that gives her absolute prohibition. It is a very unfortunate thing from the protectionist point of view that this should be done. If there were a particular reason for prohibiting the importation of an article the matter could certainLy be dealt with by Parliament. There is the case of the Harvester Trust, which has been before the country for twelve months, and Parliament is now in session- The second part of my definition of dumping is, where a big ring or organization outside deliberately sets itself to destroy an industry, and to do that sends in its goods, probably at less than cost price ; and then, having obtained a command of the market- </para>

The managers of the biggest organization which could be named could not, by sending in one, two, three, or four shipments, crush a local industry. They have a capital amounting to millions sterling. They know that they would have to carry on the business of sending in their goods at a lower price for, perhaps, three or four years before they could destroy a local industry. If so, why cannot a case of that kind be dealt with by Parliament? </para>

                        <para>- No; it will allow the Minister and a Judge to deal with such a case, and that is where the mischief comes in. If the Government could come down and prove that such an attempt was being made, Parliament could, if it liked, deal with the case efficiently. The reason why the subject is dealt with in the form of a Bill is because the protectionists think that by that means they will be able to get the Minister to do what Parliament itself would not do. </para>

                        <para>- I think that, in the interests of the Commonwealth as a whole, the prohibition of goods should be left to Parliament, and . not in any case to the Minister of Trade and Customs. Only one case, and that a hypothetical case, has been brought before Parliament; and there is no reason why it should not say exactly what course it considers justifiable. If it can be shown that there is an effort on the part of manufacturers in any country to deliberately destroy one of our industries, then it should be met by the ordinary method of increasing the protective duty. I see no reason to provide for prohibition of imports. I have given a reason which I think will justify me in voting against the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- Not within a State. I have gone all through the Bill. A combination to raise prices to the consumers in the retail market must almost of necessity be formed within a State. It is almost impossible to conceive of a case of merchants or owners in more States than one coming together to raise prices to the consumers. In every case where an effort was made to raise prices, it would be made by a local combination acting on a local market. </para>

Because, if the law could touch men in several States who combined together, we may be perfectly sure that they would not form a combination which would bring them under its provisions. </para>

                        <para>- A combination formed within a State to raise the prices of articles, especially, necessaries of life, to the consumer, would certainly be operative however injurious it might be. These are the combinations which I want to see touched by the Bill. There is a further reason why I should vote against its second reading, but it does not apply to honorable senators generally. When the first Deakin Government went to the country at the end of 1903 we did so on a policy of fiscal peace. I addressed perhaps a dozen meetings, more particularly in New South Wales, at which I advocated fiscal peace. I do not know whether I went beyond the views of the Government, but I told the audiences that fiscal peace meant a period of rest from fiscal toil for the duration of the Parliament then about to be. elected. </para>

                        <para>- The object of the three years of fiscal peace was to make inquiries as to the effect of the Tariff, and to find out whether there were any anomalies and hardships which ought to be dealt with. But whatever the late or any other Government may or may not have done, it will not alter the effect of what was promised to the constituents. I told the electors that &#34; fiscal peace &#34; meant that for a period of three years the Tariff would not be disturbed ;in other words, &#39; that it would not be disturbed until the time came for the members of the other House to go before the electors again and ask them what was their will as to the future. It seems to me, therefore, that to consent to that which is not a protectionist measure, but which apparently is designed to carry out the purpose of protection in another way, as I think the Minister of Defence himself said- </para>

                        <para>- It goes further than protection, because it really authorizes prohibition, and in that respect. I think, it cannot be said to be in accordance with the promise of fiscal peace. For these reasons, I think that I for one would not be justified, during the continuance of this Parliament, in voting for any measure which would disturb the promised fiscal peace. I do not say that it is for that reason only that I shall vote against the second reading of the Bill, because there are other reasons which I have given, perhaps at somewhat too great length. If I felt that I could pass over my first reason for objecting to the Bill. I should still feel some doubt as to whether I ought to vote for the second reading ; but I have no doubt on any ground as to my duty to vote against the motion. </para>

                    <para>- - I think I can safely say that if the Parliament had not been sitting in Melbourne, this Bill would not have been seen. I feel sure that it is an evidence of the preponderating influence which the political atmosphere of this State has over our deliberations, especially when it is remembered that the agitation which has led up to the introduction of the measure has been purely local, that outside Melbourne there has been no demand for the Bill, and that no cases have been cited in support of its enactment. That is not an argument against the Bill, because if it could be shown to be necessary for one State or city. that would be a good reason for passing it.

                        <para>-- Outside any State capital, where the influence of each State would be equal so far as its deliberations were concerned. In view of the importance of the agitation, and the facts which have been brought forward to back it up, I do not think that any other State would have been so fortunate as to get a similar Bill put through the other House on such a slender foundation. I occupy a very peculiar position. I am not in the slightest degree, enthusiastic about the Bill. I look upon it as a mere trifling with a disease - which is certainly present and which will become accentuated as time goes on - and I feel sure that it will be ineffective. The criticism which has been directed against the Bill makes me think that possibly we are dealing with the subject in a way which may lead to some of the consequences which have been foreshadowed. It: does seem to me that it contains provisions which, so far from curing the evils at which they are aimed, will give rise to greater evils bv injuring legitimate trade within the Commonwealth. The first part of the measure is ostensibly aimed at monopolies both local and foreign, and the second part is aimed at dumping. Most of the criticism in connexion with monopolies has been grounded on a knowledge of similar legislation in the United States. There is one thing which we should always remember in dealing with a question in connexion with which an analogous condition of things is assumed to exist in the United States, and that is that in Australia we have the one great protecting power against monopolies, and it is the only effective power so far discovered, and that it is absent from the United States. In the United States there is a condition existing which vitally affects commerce and trade, and which does not exist in Australia. This difference of conditions is emphasized when we remember that almost all the cases which have been tried in the United States have hinged largely on a condition existing there which does not find a parallel in Australia. That is to say, that in the United States, the railways are privately owned, mrt. in many cases, by the trusts, whilst in Australia, they are owned bv the people, and trusts have no control ever them. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator is wrong. If he will refer to <inline font-style="italic">Snyder&#39;s</inline><inline font-style="italic">Annotated</inline><inline font-style="italic">Trust Laws of the United States,</inline> which can be obtained from the Library, he will find that there have been fourteen or sixteen trust laws passed bv Congress. For many years Congress passed them at the rate of one each year, so rapidly did they discover loop-holes in previous legislation. They passed an antitrust law in one year, and in the following, year had to pass another to remedy some defect discovered in it. </para>

                        <para>- My authority is the work to which I have referred the honorable senator, and he will find that my statement is borne out. The great trusts in manufacture and production in the United States have been enabled to successfully exercise their powers very largely, because of the fact that they have been in a position to secure a controlling influence in the management of the railways leading to the places at which their manufacture or production is carried on. </para>

                        <para>- If we take the instance of the Coal Trust we shall find that to-day that trust practically dominates the railways in the Pennsylvania district. Having a dominating influence in the management of those railways, and the area of coal production in their hands, they are able to command the whole of the coal trade of the United States. Such a condition of affairs could never arise in Australia. It is impossible to imagine a coal trust in Australia owning the coal area, and also &#39;the lines of communication leading to it. We are, therefore, in Australia in a far more favorable position, in which to cope with trusts, than are the people of America, because we hold the principal means of transportation. In the United States, notwithstanding all their activity in passing this legislation, and the tremendous public opinion behind the Legislature and the Judicature - because these trusts have public opinion in the United States very strongly against them - the trusts continue to exist to-day as strong as ever they were, and I shall prove before I sit down that in the very case quoted bv the Minister in introducing the Bill the trust referred to continues to flourish, notwithstanding the injunctions of .the Court. In this connexion the thought has occurred to me that whilst the United States have tried to gi apple with trusts bv the methods proposed in this Bill, in Australia we have been able to deprive them of one of their greatest power by the adoption of a certain method which would appear to be the only method yet discovered to cope with them, and that is the ownership of the industries themselves. That is proved conclusively with respect to railways. In Australia, bv the State ownership of the railways, we have not only done nothing to injure the people, but have aided beneficently every industry in the country, and have stimulated the production of wealth. </para>

                        <para>- At any rate a <inline font-style="italic">prima facie</inline> case is made out for considering whether the same means should not be adopted to cope with trusts when they have reached the stage they have reached in America in many instances, and are rapidly reaching in Australia. I shall return again to the question of monopolies later cm; but I should like to say now with regard to the dumping provisions of the Bill that they appeal to me more strongly than does the first portion of the measure. That may seem somewhat singular to those who know that on questions of fiscalism mv views are in the direction of free-trade. I think it as well to be frank in these matters, and I wish to say that when I consider the question of dumping, I have to admit that there is no weapon in the free-trade arsenal that can effectually deal with that condition of things. Where it is a question of the production of wealth, I believe it is possible to prove that you can have just as great a production of wealth under free-trade as under protection. Otherwise, I should not have been a free-trader. But when we are dealing with dumping we are dealing not with a normal condition of affairs, and real !v not with trade at all. So far from being trade it is Letter designated as war or murder. Therefore, while one set of conditions might be applied to trade carried on under normal and fair conditions, it would be unwise to apply the same conditions to trade which is not normal, and which is unfair. I recognise that freetrade, when faced with this question of dumping, provided that it is proved to exist or is possible, leaves a country defenceless. It is on that account that 1 am inclined to view the second part of this Bill with more favour than the first part. </para>

                        <para>- I shall come to that later. The second part of this Bill contains provisions which do not, in my opinion, interfere with trade, so long as it is fair, and is conducted on normal lines. They will be put into operation only when fair and normal lines are departed from. It is difficult to define &#34; dumpking,&#34; because there is some legitimate trade which in its effect is the same as dumping, but which is not the same in intention. Dump- : ing I take to be the action of a foreign firm in sending into this country manufactures or productions, and selling them in our market at below cost price for the purpose of destroying a local industry. </para>

                        <para>- I point out that a special Bill would be altogether too cumbrous a weapon for the purpose. We must have some weapon ready loaded, to be discharged at the proper moment. To be effective it must be discharged before the local industry is destroyed. If we had to depend on the passing of a special measure to deal with dumping, the local market might be captured, and the injury done before the legislation necessary to prevent it had been passed. Whilst giving mv interpretation of dumping, I admit that there are many difficulties in the way as to when and where it should be applied. For instance, an Australian merchant goes into a foreign market, and, by the possession of keen business ability, is able to buv goods at great advantage, and to sell them in our market at below the cost price of those goods manufactured in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. I have some consolation in this matter from the fact that under this Bill when a charge of dumping is made, it must be proved to the satisfaction of an impartial court. A court that is not interested in trade, and of which the interested parties are not members, will determine the question whether what is complained of is legitimate trade or dumping. I think that we can certainly trust such a court to deal with the matter. I do not believe that the Minister of Defence quite grasped the meaning of the Bill when he said that it would not apply, except where a manufacturer was in a position to supply the whole of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- We might have manufacturers carrying on an industry in the Commonwealth on which other industries were vitally dependent. One of those manufacturers might take action, and if the Attorney-General took up his case, and instituted a prosecution, the importation of those manufactures would be immediately prohibited. The local manufacturers would be unable to supply the demand, and the dependent industries would suffer. In such a case the consequence would be that an infinitely larger number of people would be injured by the action taken under the Bill than would be benefited bv the prohibition of the importation of the goods. </para>

                        <para>- As I read the Bill, when a prosecution is commenced, the importation must stop, or, if <inline font-style="italic">it</inline> continues, it must be under a bond. While a case is being heard the particular trade is at a stand-still; and when we remember the ramifications of commercial life, and how industries inter-depend, we may easily conceive of numbers of cases in which infinite harm might be caused. And who has the key to the problem? The importer of the particular goods; and unless he takes the personal risk of giving a bond, importation must cease. </para>

                        <para>- Whether there be a test case or not, it would be serious for trade if the importation of a particular article had to be absolutely prohibited pending the decision of the Court. The Government ought to seriously consider whether some method cannot be devised to allow a trade, under the circumstances, to continue, subject, it might be, to certain restrictions. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake,</inline> I think, put his finger on a weak spot when he said that we have a limited power, in that we can deal only with trade between States and oversea trade. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best&#39;s</inline> argument that we have power to apply the Bill to foreign trading corporations formed within the Commonwealth seems to me somewhat weak. If we have power so to apply this Bill, which deals with methods of sale, and incidentally regulates those methods according to the&#39; industrial conditions under which industries are carried on, I am satisfied that we have full and ample power to deal with the industrial laws of the Commonwealth. In my opinion, it would be desirable to have that power, and I only hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> is right ; but I am somewhat afraid that the honorable and learned senator would not himself be prepared to go so far. To me, as a layman, however, that seems to be the logical outcome of the honorable senator&#39;s arguments. If we have power to say to a trader in a State that he shall not sell goods in that State at certain prices, because thereby he is monopolizing trade - that such a trader shall not carry on a system of rebates - then we have also power to say to him that he shall not employ his men during certain hours and at certain wages because in another State other employers are paying higher wages and affording more favorable conditions. </para>

                            must remember that the power we have relating to arbitration is a special power as to trade disputes. The Bill does not deal with trade disputes between one employer and another as to the conditions of trade, but it may deal with a case in which all the employers except one are satisfied with the conditions. Let me cite a case in point. I was asked to submit an amendment to the Bill, but I declined, on the ground that we have not the power to make such a provision as was desired. In Victoria a certain manufacturer of self-raising flour issues a coupon with each packet, and &#39; I was asked to submit an amendment by another employer, who stated that he could just make a fair profit by selling at the same price as his rival, and without issuing any coupons. I may explain that purchasers who collect the coupons are allowed a rebate of so much on returning them to the manufacturer. The amendment I was asked to submit would, if carried, have had the effect of making this coupon system illegal ; and undoubtedly
                            <inline font-style="italic">\t</inline>
                            is a system of rebate.

                        <para>- I told the manufacturer that, according to my limited legal knowledge, it would be impossible for the Federal Parliament to deal with such a case. To return to the main question, my opinion is that trusts, combines, and monopolies are not the creation of political conditions such as those brought about by freetrade or protection. It is often said that trusts are the result of protective Tariffs. I believe that a protective country is more congenial soil for trusts ; but it is too sweeping an assertion to say that they are the result of protective Tariffs.&#39; We find trusts in freetrade, as well as in protective, countries. </para>

Trusts are the outcome of economic conditions, and they can only be checked or altered by the alteration of the economic system. </para>

                        <para>- I say that other economic conditions are growing up - that the &#39; capitalistic system itself, apart and independent altogether of any political conditions, is bringing about a system of Socialism. It may be that political action will be needed to transfer the ownership of that system from the few to the many ; but political action never could create the system, and, therefore, cannot stop it. The only thing that political action can do is to decide the question whether we are to have capitalistic Socialism or collective or State Socialism. In view of the fact that I hold such views, honorable senators will not wonder when I say that I am altogether sceptical - altogether an unbeliever - as to the first portion of the Bill. In my opinion, the conditions which this Bill proposes to regulate are altogether beyond the power of this or any other Parliament, and that any action on our part in that direction would be futile. Even the trusts themselves are helpless in the grip of circumstances. The owners of the industries involved in the trusts have been forced into their present position, in many cases against their own free will, by the economic conditions. It was either trusts or extinction. </para>

                    <para>Philadelphia, 25th May. - Alexander J. Cassatt was boldly charged by a once wealthy coal producer, testifying at the Inter-State Commerce Investigation of Pennsylvania Railroad Graft, and alleged blackmailing methods to-day, with being, not only the author of his woes, but as having issued orders to grafting subordinates which have driven scores of independent operators to the verge of ruin. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>Another sensational feature of the probing today was sworn testimony by Chief Engineer Joseph \V. Crawford, of the Pennsylvania Railroad, that his partners in the ownership of a 60,000 acre tract of coal and lumber land in West Virginia were Vice-President Rea, of the Pennsylvania, and Effingham B. Morris, a Pennsylvania director. </para>
                <para>Amazing as it may appear, Effingham B. Morris was yesterday chosen one of a committee of five Pennsylvania directors to investigate the accused corporation. </para>
                <para>Asked by the Commission why his business has slumped from an output of 125,000 tons in 1 goo to less than 17,000 tons last year, the witness exclaimed dramatically - &#34; The Pennsylvania Railroad put me out of business. I was deliberately frozen out through orders. Somebody way up gave those orders, which were obeyed implicitly all down the line.&#34; &#34; You believe, then, that high executives of the road gave these orders?&#34; asked Government counsel. &#34; High executioners, not merely executives,&#34; was the angry correction. &#34; I believe Alexander J. Cassatt is the man responsible. I also believe he controls the Reading, the Baltimore and Ohio, the Chesapeake and Ohio, and the Norfolk and Western Railroads, through the community of interest plan. That pernicious combination is what has enabled a few favoured companies to prosper enormously, and crush out scores of independent operators.&#34; </para>
                <para>Pent-up indignation, caused by years of oppression on the part of the vast Pennsylvania system, struggled for expression as the speaker went on to tell how his three collieries - the Lorraine, Reakirt, and Penn - had been running at a disheartening loss for thirty-six months. </para>
                <para>Because of merciless discrimination shown by the Pennsylvania, one of the results was, he said, that large quantities of coal which he had contracted to sell at $1.12 and $1.15 cost him $1.48 a ton to deliver. He added, with a show of feeling, that he had remained in business, hoping against hope that some remedy would eventuate and save the wreck of his camp. </para>
                <para class="block">Here was a man who was forced to become a victim of the very system which he was partly condemning. Now I will come to the Standard Oil Company, which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> seemed to think was a beneficent trust. I have shown that when an organization of this kind secures a monopoly, or practically a monopoly, it is able to force even an unwilling person to become a member. The Standard Oil Company had a small beginning and we all know what it has become. The following extract is taken from the <inline font-style="italic">New York World,</inline> and is dated 25th May, of this year : - </para>

                    <para>The Standard Oil Company has its own telegraph system, leased or owned, extending to nearly every part of the country, was the one revelation out of the ordinary at to-day&#39;s session of the Inter-State Commerce Commission. The rest of the testimony had to do with the Oil Trust&#39;s characteristic tricks, such as giving oil away, compelling merchants to sell Standard products under threats of ruining their business, sending boys on bicycles to &#34;spot&#34; deliveries by the independents&#39; waggons, underbilling of freight, and so on down the Standard&#39;s category of business morals. </para>
                    <para>George L. Lane, of Mansfield, O., who was employed by the Standard for fourteen months in 1901-2 for the purpose of driving independents out of business, was a most entertaining witness - excepting for the trust lawyers. He said he was employed by C. M. Lyons, of the Cleveland office of the Standard to go to certain designated places and use every means, fair or foul, to force the independents to quit. </para>

                        <para>- No. The evidence was taken by a Commission presided over by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Garfield,</inline> a son of President Garfield. The quotation continues - &#34;My instructions,&#34; Lane said, &#34;were to kill them, and 1 was told that if I could not do the job somebody else would be sent to take my place. In all of the towns, with the exception of Youngstown, the independent peddlers were forced to abandon their business. In Youngstown a man named William H. Vahey was encountered, and despite everything we could do, he held his trade. We gave oil away by the barrel and tank load, but it did no good. Vahey&#39;s customers threw it away. &#34; Of course we could not give a preacher money, but we gave him oil. When we started to give oil away, we gave first one gallon, then two, if it was &#39; all right,&#39; and increased it up to 100 gallons if necessary. We judged the ability of our 1 spotters &#39; by the number of gallons they gave away. At one time, taking al&#93; expenses into account, it cost $6 a gallon to give the oil away. &#34; Our rivals were followed during their distribution by boys on bicycles or men on foot. Spotters were also sent secretly from Cleveland, and if I did not find all the independent customers I got called down.&#34; </para>

                <para>When he entered the independent field, Lane said, &#34; Standard Oil men told him they would give away groceries if necessary to kill him off. He charged that a system of rebating to consumers was put into operation, and that the practice continues even now in certain parts of north-western Ohio. They told me they would not let me live,&#34; said Lane, &#34; and they have been trying to starve me ever since, but I am still alive.&#34; </para>

                    <para>It does not seem to matter whether you are a rich owner of 60,000 of coal land or a poor owner of only an oil peddler's cart, you are -a marked man unless you wear the trust collar. The beauty of it all is that the monopolist is in the same boat as his victim, forced to do as he does, or be a victim himself. The clerk of the Standard Oil will be fined if he does not exterminate the peddler who peddles &#34; independent &#34; oil in his district. It&#39;s diamond cut diamond ; if he does not starve the peddler then the peddler starves him. Again, if the Standard Oil does not extermine its competitors when they are weak they may grow up to be strong and extermiruite it. </para>
                    <para class="block">That is the problem we have set ourselves to deal with in this Bill. And how do we propose to deal with it? We propose to drive the trusts back again into the state of competition and the condition of affairs from which they originated. We have just as much chance of making the earth stand still as carrying out that idea. That is why I am sceptical as to the success of this Bill. I now come to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford&#39;s</inline> statement that the Sherman Act in America has &#34;teen successful. He said that the authorities had been successful in getting an injunction under it. As a matter of fact, the trusts continue to laugh at the authorities in spite of a hundred injunctions. They defy the courts, they defy the United States Government, and they continue in spite of the Sherman Act. The Coal Trust and the Beef Trust, which the honorable senator quoted as victims of the anti-trust law of the United States, are flourishing to-day, and are as powerful as ever they were. </para>

                    Roosevelt and his Attorney-General have suffered a serious reverse in their campaign against the great combinations commonly called trusts, and it is due in part to the President&#39;s own extraordinary published argument of some months ago in defence of his friend Paul Morion, at the time when the latter withdrew from the Cabinet to become president (by the act of Thomas J. Ryan) of the Equitable Life Assurance Society. Our great beef companies (the Armours, Swifts, Cudahys, Morrises, and one or two other concerns) have for a long time done business in accordance with a private combination agreement, thus maintaining what is practically a monopoly, and squeezing the public at both ends of the trade by keeping down the price of cattle and holding up the price of meat. Such combinations are forbidden by law unless they exist under a single corporate charter.
                </para>
                <para>Three years ago the Government procured injunctions restraining the companies from acting in combination. This was a beginning. Two years ago, at the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Roosevelt,</inline> Congress created the Bureau of Corporations, headed by a commissioner empowered to obtain, for the President&#39;s use, information from the great corporations as to their affairs. Over this bureau the President placed a young lawyer, James R. Garfield, son of the President of the same name who was assassinated in 1881 by Guitean. Garfield and his agents began to collect information by personal application to the corporations. Under instructions from Congress they got a lot of it from the beef companies, with the understanding that a part of it should be held in confidence. They published a report which was quite favorable to the trust. But a part of their information was not printed. </para>
                <para>The Government resorted to the Courts, and procured the indictment of the Armours, Swifts, Cudahys, and Morrises for violation of the antitrust law of 1890. There were sixteen of these accused men, representing the greatest incorporated beef and packing industries in the world, at Chicago, Omaha, Kansas City, and other places. At the outset they interposed the plea that under the constitution they were entitled to immunity, because they had been required by Garfield to give testimony against themselves. He had promised, as they proved, that their testimony should not be used against them, but it had been so used in procuring the indictments. </para>
                <para class="block">The letter goes on to say - </para>
                <para>Great efforts were made by the Government to save itself from defeat at the hearking in Chicago on this plea for immunity. Attorney-General Moody himself went to that city, and argued strenuously in Court for two days, say-&#39; ing that if the accused men should escape trial it would be a calamity to the Government and the country. But all in vain. Three days ago Judge Humphrey, of the Federal Court, accepted the defendants&#39; plea, gave them immunity, and discharged all of them. </para>

                    ought not to complain, for in preventing the prosecution of his friend Morton he (and Attorney-General Moody) argued that it was the corporations, rather than their responsible officers, that should be prosecuted and punished.

                        <para>- The case which the honorable senator cited applied to a small coal trust which had been formed in that State ; but the great coal-bearing, State of America is not Tennessee, but Pennsylvania. In 1890 the latter State produced over 90 per cent, of the total output of coal in the United States, and the Pennsylvania Trust has never been broken up. Presently I shall quote some facts from an American journal proving that it is not only in existence, but is pursuing its nefarious career as a vampire towards the other industries of the country. But, first of all, as the Minister quoted a number of cases which he seemed to think proved the efficacy of the law, I wish to show that the Sherman Act - the most stringent of all the American Acts - has on several occasions failed where, prosecutions have been instituted under its provisions. For instance, in 1894, an action was taken against the Sugar Trust, and although it was proved that it controlled 98 per cent, of the trade, the prosecution failed. The case is reported on page 253 of the <inline font-style="italic">Annotated Inter-State Commerce Act.</inline> Again, in October, 1898, the &#39;Beef Trust was charged&#39; before the Circuit Court of the United States with being an illegal combination. The Circuit Court gave am injunction, but that was afterwards reversed by the Supreme Court. I have already dealt with the case which was instituted subsequently, and which the Minister traced up to a certain stage as having succeeded, but which actually failed on a very vital point. As regards the two cases which I have just quoted, their failure arose from this fact - that, while it was proved up to the hilt that there was a restraint of trade, it was a restraint of trade within a State. The prosecution was unable to prove restraint of trade between the States, and therefore a conviction could not be secured. As regards the Coal Trust of Pennsylvania, the American <inline font-style="italic">Review of Reviews</inline> for June, 1906, contains an article, from which I make this short extract - </para>

He brought about a general recognition of the Reading interests ; organized a&#39; holding company, which owns the stock of the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad, the Central Railroad of New Jersey, the Philadelphia and Reading Iron and Coal Company, and. various other affiliated concerns: and made himself president, not only of the parent company, but of the stronger subsidiary ones. Remember that the&#39; Reading Company owns sixty-three per cent, of all the unmined hard coal in the world, and that ever since Franklin B. Gowen unmercifully thrashed the Pennsylvania Railroad in a legal battle in r8/g, the latter has acted in concert with the Reading in all hard-coal matters. </para>

                        <para>- The fact that the trust controls railroads gives it an enormous power which no trust in Australia could secure. I propose to quote certain extracts, because I desire to show honorable senators that in Australia there is &#39;a trust which, so far as it is able, is acting on precisely similar lines. A man named Baer took a prominent part in the formation of the Beef Trust, and his part in the transaction is described in the following manner : - &#39; </para>
                    </talk.start>
                </continue>
                <para>Directly the trust, now a tangible thing, was in working order, Baer set about securing control of the selling machinery, which was in the hands of powerful wholesalers, or sales agents. (Remember, in this connexion, that the strength of the Beef Trust and of Standard Oil rests almost wholly upon their control of the selling machinery.) The railroads organized sales departments of their own, or made contracts which placed the wholesalers under their direction; and the rule was established - and it is enforced relentlessly - of cutting off the supply of any dealer, wholesaler or retailer, who should depart from the schedule of prices fixed by the trust. So far as the railroads in the trust were concerned, the outward semblance of independent action was carefully maintained, as it is now. For instance, President Baer, President Truesdale, President Thomas, and others would meet, quite by accident of course, in the Lawyers&#39; Club, in New York, for luncheon. They talked about business - men of affairs always do that - and it was pure chance that the coal price-lists issued by each railroad after these luncheons were exactly the same. It was merely a general understanding. Here you have the &#34; gentlemen&#39;s agreement &#34; in its perfected, purified form. </para>
                <para>There, again, we see the absolute impotence of this legislation to reach an agreement such as that. It would be necessary to put the men in the witness-box, and compel them to convict themselves before it would be possible to break up the trust, or prevent it from crushing out all its rivals in the country. </para>

                    <para>Is this advance which the trust has made warranted by conditions? Is the price we are paying now a fair price? Let us consider some figures. There has been an increase in the cost of mining, due to higher wages and physical difficulties in working lower levels. Evidence before the InterState Commerce Commission showed that the cost of taking the coal from the mine increased from $1.43 a ton in 1900 to $1.96 in 1903. In that time the price of coal increased a dollar a ton, nearly double the increase in cost. </para>

                <para class="block">The significant fact is that these trusts, by eliminating competition without increasing prices, are able to enormously increase their profits, and where they find it safe to do so, as in this case, they do not hesitate to increase their prices. I make that statement, .because it is claimed on behalf of one trust in Australia that, so far, it has not increased its prices. But the saving which has accrued to it as the result of the elimination of competition, the centralization of its factories and working staff, and the doing away with needless advertising and staffs of commercial travellers which were necessary while competition existed represents to them a profit which is greater than a substantial increase in the price of the article produced. </para>

                    <para>The Coal Trust is a typical instance of what we can see going on about us in every direction : the organization of the productive resources of the country and the centralization in a few hands of their direction and control. This trust is an especially interesting and a specially dangerous example, because of the perfection of its organization, and its success in taking advantage of the law. </para>
                    <para>Is there any justification for this centralization of vast power? Does the community in any way benefit from it? Undoubtedly in that it introduces order, economy, and system in place of confusion, waste, and individual caprice. </para>
                    <para>Is it dangerous? Yes, because it places a vast power in the hands of a few irresponsible individuals, giving them the privilege of imposing on the public an enormous tax in the form of profits out of all ratio to the service they perform. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">In that last sentence lies the answer* to the objection raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy.</inline> It is shown that the profits they make by the saving due to cooperation are out of all &#39; proportion to the services they render to the community. The first part of the quotation I have made constitutes the defence of the Government in introducing this Bill, but it lies with Ministers to do more than defend the introduction of &#34;the measure. They must prove that it will do what it aims at. The question has been raised whether in Australia we require to deal with these trusts in the manner proposed by this Bill, or by nationalization because some doubt is expressed as to their existence. It has been my privilege to act as Chairman of&#34; the Select Committee and Royal Commission recently engaged in inquiring into the existence of one alleged trust in Australia. Reading these articles, and then looking over the evidence given before that Commission, one cannot but be struck with the absolute similarity of the methods adopter! by the Tobacco Trust in Australia and the Coal Trust in America. There is, of* course, the difference which is due to the fact that in Australia it has not been possible for the Tobacco Trust to secure control of any of the railways, whereas in America the Coal Trust has been able to secure such control. I direct the attention of honorable senators to the history of the formation of the Tobacco Trust ifrAustralia as given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Louis</inline> P. Jacobs,, one of the directors of the trust, in evidence taken by the Commission. At page 57 of the Minutes of Evidence, given before the Tobacco Commission, in answer to question 555, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jacobs</inline> traces the formation of the agreement, as he called it, between the various manufacturing firms. He said : - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>An arrangement has been concluded between certain firms in the tobacco trade, some of which are Australian and one English, a list of which is given herewith. Under this arrangement, each of the manufacturing companies holds a proprietary interest in every other such company. Every one of the companies concerned, however, carries on its business separately from the other. These manufacturing companies have purchased an interest in the distributing house of Kronheimer Limited, and have appointed&#34; this firm the &#39; sole distributing agent for their products to wholesale houses, for which service they receive a commission. Kronheimer Limited, however, also do a wholesale business themselves, <inline font-style="italic">i&#39;.e.,</inline> they supply retail tobacconists in competition with the other wholesale houses. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">Honorable senators will remember that one of the essential points laid down by the man who organized the Coal Trust in America was that they should get control of the wholesale distribution of their goods. Here we have the Tobacco Trust in Australia doing precisely the same thing - forming a holding company in which each - of the manufacturing companies holds an equal interest, the holding company being responsible for the wholesale distribution of the goods of the manufacturers. Every pound of tobacco, every cigar, and every cigarette made in the factories represented in the Tobacco Trust must go through the holding firm of Kronheimer Limited. No man in Australia engaged in the wholesale or retail sale of tobacco, cigars, and cigarettes, can go to any of the factories represented in the trust, and purchase a pound of tobacco, a cigar, or cigarette there. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jacobs</inline> went on to say: - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>It will thus be seen that while the British company obtains a share in the profits made from locally-produced tobacco, the Australian companies likewise obtain a share in the profit made from the sale in Australia of the tobacco of this same company. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>He went on then to give the reasons which induced the manufacturers to form the trust, pointing out that prior to its formation there had been unrestricted competition, which had forced down profits and caused tremendous waste in production. He showed that, by coming together, they were able to avoid that waste and enhance their profits, and that altogether the industry, as the result of the co-operation of the manufacturers, was in a far better position than it was formerly under unrestricted competition. The Bill is aimed against combinations of that kind. This combination is undoubtedly in restraint of trade, because it is practically impossible for any manufacturer in Australia to produce tobacco successfully in competition with the combine. </para>

                        <para>- He must. The point arises here that as, with the exception of a few lines, the trust has not raised the price of its productions to the public, it is claimed that it has not therefore injuriously affected the public. But are we to admit that the prices ruling for tobacco, cigars, and cigarettes prior to the formation of this combine must for all time endure; that, no matter what savings in production and distribution may be introduced, they must never be passed on to the consumer? The defence of those who say that this trust- does not injure the public is that the price of tobacco, cigars, and cigarettes has not been raised. I say that if there has been, by the use of improved machinery or improved business methods in this industry, a great saving in production, the public have a right to a portion of that saving, and if they do not get it the public are injured to that extent, and this Bill; in theory, should break up the combine. </para>

                        <para>- If this Bill is effective, the consumer cannot get it. The saving has been gained by eliminating the element of wasteful competition, which the effective operation of the Bill would reintroduce. Honorable senators will not in these times find the enormous hoardings at various railway stations covered with beautiful advertisements recommending the use of certain tobaccoes, cigars, and cigarettes. At one time one could scarcely look out of the window of a railway carriage without seeing such advertisements. </para>

                        <para>- It certainly is. I ask honorable senators to note the judicious way in which the trust advertises to-day. We do not find large advertisements from the trust in every newspaper. It is only in certain influential newspapers, and especially those which used to attack the tobacco combine and write of the operations of the &#34; tobacco octopus,&#34; that we now fin&#39;d full-page advertisements of the products of the trust. The little uninfluential newspapers that used to get an occasional advertisement from the manufacturers of tobacco get none to-day. I say that, if this Bill is effective in dealing with this trust, it will confer no benefit upon the public, . who will have to pay the same price, and perhaps a higher price, for tobacco, cigars, and cigarettes. </para>

                        <para>- We had one witness before the Tobacco Commission who, when he was asked why the trust did not raise prices, very naively said, &#34; You do not suppose that we are going to raise prices while the Labour Party are conducting this campaign for the nationalization of the industry? You surely do not think that we are going to give them an argument to use throughout the Commonwealth? We are not , so simple.&#34; For that reason, I think it is likely that for some time they will not use their power to raise prices. I say that if the Tobacco Trust is broken up by the operation of this Bill, no benefit will . be conferred on the consumers. It would1 not be in the interest of the consumer to break up the trust if we are to go back to the conditions prevailing when a number of small factories were producing inferior tobacco, and competing in a ruinous way with each other, which led to no adequate profits to the manufacturers or any benefit to the public. That is one reason why I do not desire that the Bill should be applied to that particular trust. Now I come to the Sugar Trust. So far as manufacture is concerned, the operations of the Sugar Trust are confined to Australia and Fiji. The Colonial Sugar&#39; Refining Company is undoubtedly a commercial trust within the meaning of this Bill, but it is not a complete monopoly. I think there are two other little refining companies which do about5 per cent. of the trade. What would be the effect of this Bill on the Sugar Trust? </para>

                        <para>- The Colonial Sugar Refining Company have undoubtedly adopted the rebate system in all its worst features. Grocers who take sugar from them are given a rebate under a written agreement that they will take the sugar of this company only. If they break that agreement they will lose their rebates. I am very doubtful whether this Bill could be used successfully to interfere with the Sugar Trust. Does this measure give us the power to fix a selling price ? We have a Tariff against sugar coming into the Commonwealth, and so long as it continues in force the Colonial Sugar Refining Company can fix the price of sugar in Australia, even without their present agreements with their customers. I fail to see how we would benefit the consumers by breaking up the Sugar . Trust. I believe that if we did so the position would be exactly what it is to-day ; the trust would continue to exist in spite of us, and to fix the price of sugar in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- In any case I do not see how the Bill could deal with that particular industry. I should like to refer to the kerosene industry, which has. spread from America to Australia, and I hope the Bill may do something to regulate it. The Standard Oil Company to-day compels its customers to bind themselves to take no other oil. In Australia there is another oil company called the Borneo Company, and I have it on the best authority that it is being crushed out of existence by the Standard Oil Company. If a grocer purchases any oil from the Borneo Company the Standard Oil Company may refuse to supply him with any of their product. </para>

                        <para>- It would have to be proved that the consumer was being injuriously affected. There is some hope, , 1 think, that the Bill may have the effect of bringing about fair conditions in the oil trade in Australia. Now I come to another industry, and. the most important of all, in my opinion, to which this Bill should apply, if to any. I allude to the Inter-State1 shipping industry, which today is undoubtedly carried on by a trust. I am confident that the industry is controlled by a board on which the various shipping companies in Australia, with the exception of one, are represented. Fares and freights are fixed, and a general agreement is entered into; but what I wish to point our is that the agreement is an open one, there being no attempt at concealment. What would be the effect of this Bill ? It would be to drive the combination .underground, and, instead of an open agreement, we should have a &#34;gentlemen&#39;s agreement,&#34; like that of the Coal Trust. We should then be powerless to sheet home a conviction under this Bill. All that the shipping companies would have to do would be to make an agreement of honour in regard to fares and freights. Some sceptics may say that members of the trust would soOn, break away from such an agreement. But without a written agreement there would be the most powerful compelling force to obedience. Any company in Australia who tried to compete with the combine would have a very hot time. If any of the parties were to break away from the agreement, the other companies could run the recalcitrant one off the coast of Australia, and practically ruin him. Where is the inducement for a steam-ship company to break away from such an agreement? Under the terms of the arrangement the profits are greater than ever before, and interest on debentures and shares is assured. If a shipping company were to revert to the old system of competition, interest and dividends would become uncertain. All the tendency is to abide by the agreement, and endeavour to carry it out to the utmost of their power. This Bill does not hold out a scintilla of hope to the people of Australia, so far as the shipping combine is concerned. </para>

                        <para>- I am certain that it is detrimental to the public in its effects. The combine could be made of great service to the public, but, unlike the tobacco combine, it has undoubtedly used its powers. The people of Western Australia are absolutely dependent on sea carriage for their goods from the eastern States, and they consume in that State more foodstuffs than they produce. What happens is that the shipping companies, by reason of their combine, are able to take tribute from the grower of the foodstuffs and also from the consumer in Western Australia; and the freights charged are altogether out of proportion to the services performed. Such a system is unjust, not only to the consumers in the West, but also to the producers in the East. </para>

                        <para>- If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> considers the dividends paid by those companies he will see that the combine is a most profitable investment. This is a sample of local trusts which, it seems to me, the Bill will be powerless to effectively deal with. There is another phase of the Bill to which I desire to call attention, and which came under my notice as a member of the Royal Commission on the Tobacco Monopoly. There is an agreement in the tobacco trade very similar to that referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> as existing in the bootmaking trade. The States Tobacco Company, which is the cigar branch of the Tobacco Trust, have in their possession a number of cigar-making machines, by arrangement with the American trust? To show honorable senators the value of these machines, I shall read some evidence given before the Royal Commission to which I have referred. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Arthur</inline> Hirschman, a cigar manufacturer in Sydney&#62; gave the following evidence: - 7091. Where are those machines used? - In Melbourne, in the States Tobacco Company. I produce, for the information of the Commission, what is styled the bunch before becoming a cigar. It is made by hand, or by block. The ten machines would turn out 30,000 bunches a day, which would be at the rate of 150,000 per week. A boy or girl is employed on each machine, and is paid, at most, 15s. per week to work it. That shows the cost of making the quantity I have named in a week would be <inline font-style="italic">&#163;7 10s.</inline> The  cigarmakers  of this city have lately had a case before the Arbitration Court, and from the particulars given there, it is seen that the very  lowest  at which I could make the cheapest cigar would be 2s. 6d. per 100 ; that is, to finish it right out. The rolling means putting on the covers after the bunches are made, and whether they be Sumatra, Havanna, or Mexican, the cost is is. -8d., or two-thirds for rolling, and iod., or one-third, for making the bunches. So that to manufacture 150,000 by hand at iod. per 100 would mean <inline font-style="italic">&#163;62</inline> 10s., as against the cost by machinery of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;7</inline> 10s. The rate I have mentioned is as fixed by the Arbitration Court, and is the same as in Victoria for block-work cigars. If taken on the basis of 50 working weeks in a year, it would mean a total wage of ^3,125, as against machinery wage of ^375, giving the trust an advantage of ^2,750 per annum. </para>

                        <para>- A witness named Solomon J. de Beer, who was examined in Melbourne, gave evidence as follows : - 6447. Have you made any inquiry as to the possibility of getting those machines? - Yes, and I find there is no chance whatever of getting them. The States Tobacco Company has a monopoly of the only good cigar-making machine in creation. There are other machines to be had which will work what we call &#34; scraps,&#34; but those are, in addition, &#34; bunch &#34; machines. The machines used by the States Tobacco Company are the only ones that actually do the work. 6448. How did they get a monopoly? - I think they pay a royalty rate. 6449. How did you find out you could not get the machines? - I had information from Home that we could not get the machines. My brother inquired into the matter there. 6450. Did he tell you you would have to get them from the States Tobacco Company ? - The reply I got was - &#34; They are not to be had.&#34; 6451. The States Tobacco Company have got them ? - That he did not say. Since the States Tobacco Company have the machines working, 1 have come to the conclusion that they hold the right to the use of those machines. </para>

                        <para>- It seems to me that this is a monopoly which the Bill might very well be used to rectify, by compelling the owners to allow the use of the machines on conditions. If the case of the boot manufacturers is a hard one, how much harder is that of the cigar manufacturers, who are subject to an enormous handicap by reason of having to use hand labour. This is the kind of monopoly at which the Bill should aim. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator may not know it, but monopolies of the kind he mentions have been broken down bv law. I intend to support the second reading of the Bill, notwithstanding my criticism, because I recognise that these trusts must be dealt with. There is in existence in Australia a party known as the Liberal Party, who say that we can control and regulate trusts. We Socialists &#34;say that such trusts are beyond our control and regulation. The Government, who represent the Liberal Party in Australia, submit this Bill as a proposal to regulate industries, and I am prepared to allow them to try their regulating measure. I believe the Bill will fail. I have no faith in the first part of the Bill, because I feel sure it will not have the effect anticipated, but I am prepared to allow the Government to try to regulate trusts. As I said before, I support the dumping provisions, because if there be dumping those provisions will be useful. Although there may be some danger in the measure, still I feel justified in voting for the second reading, in the hope that in Committee the particular provisions to which I refer may be safeguarded in such a way that they will not be used to the detriment of Australian industries. </para>

                    <para>- In any case, it seems to me that this Bill has a wrong title, and that it should be called the Anti-Commerce Bill. There are several blots upon the measure that ought to be removed if it is to become law. The first great blot in it is contained in clauses 6 and 18, under which a defendant is considered to be guilty until he is proved innocent. How honorable senators opposite can support a provision of that kind I can hardly understand. It seems to me to be inconceivable that Ministers should propose that the old English law, that every man shall be held to be innocent until proved to be guilty, should be turned upside down in this way. </para>

                        <para>- I allude to the provision with regard to wages and conditions of employment. This Bill will not restrain monopolies, and if it is to restrain dumping, it certainly ought to say so plainly. It has been asserted more than once that it is intended to prohibit dumping. Yet there is no proper definition of dumping in the Bill. I will read one which seems to me to be very clear. The Chairman of the Tariff Commission, in speaking on this matter not very long ago, expressed his disappointment that Part III. of the Bill was not to be postponed, and said that there was no evidence of dumping in this country </para>

                        <para>- Well, I may give this as my own opinion. Dumping may be defined to be the export of surplus stock from one country to another, offered for sale at a lower rate than that ruling in the country of origin. Dumping is not importing goods into this country and selling them at a lower price than that at which they are sold in another country, but it is selling them at a price lower than the cost of production. It is quite clear that there is no evidence of such dumping in Australia. If we attempt to stop importations, we shall be entering very treacherous waters. The new duties imposed by many of the provisions of the Bill are likely to take up a great deal of the time of the Comptroller-General. That is another reason why I regard it as faulty in construction. If we intend to prohibit goods, it is better to say so plainly, and to achieve our end through the Customs. Unfair competition is characterized as competition! with intent to secure a monopoly. But any person in business may desire to get a monopoly of his own trade if he can. He need not wish to injure his neighbour, but he wishes to get all the business for himself. </para>

                <para>The Colonial Sugar Kenning Company was formed in 1855 with an unlimited liability of shareholders, and was so worked until 1887, when it was registered with limited liability under the Companies Act of New South Wales. In that year, the Victoria Sugar Company, which had lost very heavily in the crisis in the sugar industry in 1884, was amalgamated with the older company, the proprietors receiving shares and debentures in the latter for their interest ; and in 1888 the New Zealand Sugar Company was brought under the same control, as the Colonial Sugar Refining Company already owned two-thirds of its stock. The properties of the new company then consisted of three refineries in Sydney, Melbourne, and Auckland, and eight sugar mills in New South Wales, Queensland, and Fiji. Since then two refineries have been established in Adelaide and Brisbane, and live mills in Queensland and Fiji. The sugar business is divided into two parts, the refining branch and the manufacture of raw sugar from the cane ; and as to the first it may be said : - The refiner has no protection on his sugar, which is refined in bond, full duty being paid on it when it leaves the factory. In addition to our refineries, there is one in Melbourne and another in Bundaberg, while a third is now in course of erection in Sydney. In none of these concerns has this company any interest whatever, and it has not now nor ever had any understanding or agreement with the other refineries with regard <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> the selling price of sugar, as has been alleged by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson</inline> and other members of the Labour Party. The large refineries in Hong Kong, which are worked under great advantages in the matter of the cost of the sugar, of labour, and of supplies (there being no Customs duties or Government taxation in that port), also compete for a share of the sugar trade of Australia. </para>

                <para>The raw sugars required by the local refineries are either imported from Java or other countries, or supplied by the Queensland and New South Wales sugar mills. If produced from the imported sugar, the refined article is subject to a duty of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;6</inline> per ton ; if from the home-grown the Excise is <inline font-style="italic">&#163;3</inline> per ton ; but the difference between the two duties is added to the prices paid for the home-grown product, so that it is quite immaterial to the refiner - provided the bonded price is the same relatively in both cases - whether he imports or buys locally the raw material required for his business ; and of the two competing refineries above referred to, one works Queensland sugars only, while the supplies of the other are altogether the produce of Java. </para>
                <para class="block">That is irrespective of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company altogether, and shows that there is no monopoly. </para>
                <para>The position of the raw sugar production may be stated as follows :- This branch of the sugar industry receives at present a protection of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;3</inline> per ton, which will be reduced to <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> from the 1st January, 1907, but this will disappear if the production should exceed the consumption, when the protective duty becomes inoperative. For the sugar purchased&#39; by us we pay a price fixed on a sliding scale according to the market value of the refined product, such price including the whole advantage derived from the protective tariff. The margin of profit thus secured to us is, notwithstanding wild statements &#39; to the contrary, only a moderate one, and we are prepared, if it be necessary, to prove the truth of this statement. It should be noted in this connexion that our purchases of Commonwealth sugar during the past few years have cost 12s. to 16s. per ton more than Java sugars, which have been used exclusively by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Poolman,</inline> the Melbourne refiner, who no doubt for this reason has always found it to his advantage to import his supplies rather than contract for the local products. The sugar produced at our own mills is almost entirely made from cane grown by farmers who, since the protection was given under the federal Tariff, have received 3s. rod. per ton of cane more than before, and the balance of the protection has so far been retained by us to provide against the loss which we will sustain if the withdrawal of colored labour compels us, as we believe it eventually will, to close our factories in tropical Queensland. In proof of the fair treatment which the farmers have received at our hands, it is interesting to note that the price which we have, paid for the cane supplied to our mills in Queensland has, since the advent of Federation, been higher than that given by the Central Mills, whose capital has been provided at a low rate of interest by the Queensland Government. </para>
                <para class="block">That .is a very important point, when we hear so much talk of the evils connected with a lar.ge company. This company has given a higher price to the farmers since Federation than has been given by the Government mills. </para>
                <para>From the yearly reports of the Auditor-General of Queensland, it can be ascertained that, during the seasons 1901^904 inclusive, the Central. Mills crushed 1,237,690 tons of cane at a cost of &#163;961,433, or 15s. 6.43d. per ton delivered at the mills; while our books show that 1,154,713 tons were crushed at this company&#39;s mills at a cost of ,&#163;910,488, or 15s. 9.24(1. per ton, an advantage of &#163;13,520, or nearly 3d. per ton, to the farmers who sold their cane to this company. The difference is actually somewhat greater, because the cost of transporting the cane to our mills is less than to the Central Mills, but accurate figures under this head cannot be obtained. The fact remains, however, that the accusation which has frequently been levied against us, that the farmers do not receive a fair price for their cane, cannot be sustained, if it be considered that the Central Mills, some of which are worked under direct Government control, have paid less than the company for the cane supplied by the farmers. The Auditor-General&#39;s report for the 1905 season not being yet available, a comparison of the prices paid for cane cannot at present be made for that year. To those farmers who employ white labour a bonus is paid under the scheme adopte&#39;d bv the Federal Parliament, but this is given direct to the farmers bv the Government, and the mill-owner has no share in such payments. From the foregoing facts it will be seen that we have no monopoly of the sugar trade of Australia, and indeed no monopoly could be created in this trade under present Tariff conditions, for we, in common wilh other local refiners, not only do not receive any protection, but, by reason of the high wages current here, and the heavy duties on machinery and other material used in the manufacture, have to compete on unequal terms with foreign refiners, while our prices must be fixed according to those ruling in the world&#39;s markets. As raw sugar manufacturers, we enjoy a certain measure of protection which&#39;, however, must be set against the loss of capital that will be the sequence of the withdrawal of coloured labour from North Queensland. </para>
                <para>With regard to the ownership of the shares in the company, the following analysis is worthy of note : - There are now some 1,300 shareholders, of whom 700, representing half the stock, are trustees, executors, single women, widows, and wives jointly with their husbands ; 3t are employes of the. company, while 1,430 members of the staff and wage earners are interested in the employes provident fund, which holds over 3,000 shares; 113 are professional men ; 375 are traders and men actively engaged in &#39;business ; and 65 are so-called capitalists, holding altogether 23 per cent, of the stock. Of these shareholders, 8 per cent, reside outside Australasia (nearly all Australians who have gone to England to live), but the percentage of such holdings to the total capital is constantly being reduced, as the board have for a long time been unwilling that any <inline font-style="italic">stock in</inline> the company should be acquired by those living on the other side of the world while all its interests are here. In conclusion, I would point out that it is generally overlooked by our critics that, besides our investments in Australia, we have important interests in Fiji and New Zealand. </para>

                    <para>.- I think that some of the strongest arguments which have been advanced both for and against the Bill could very well be used by the members of the Labour F arty in favour of the nationalization of monopolies as soon as they became injurious to the general welfare of the community. This afternoon, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best,</inline> in a most exhaustive and interesting speech - one which was warmly commendatory of the Bill, which he said he intended to support almost as it is - advanced a number of very strong arguments in favour of the representatives of the people taking hold of a monopoly when it became injurious, as in America trusts have become. While he eloquently advocated the claims of the Bill, he freely admitted that there were enormous difficulties in the way. Its warmest advocates admit that the difficulties might be almost insuperable. As one of those who believe that the best interests of the community as a whole would be served by giving the people, through their representatives, control of industries, Or monopolies, or trusts, or combines, as soon as ever they became injurious to the general welfare, I am not sorry that this Bill has been introduced because, while I do not expect it to do a great deal of good, I believe that it will achieve some good. I shall not put myself in the position of rejecting a crust because I cannot get a loaf at once. Some opponents of the Bill - for instance. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake,</inline> this afternoon, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> in a very destructive criticism, extending to three hours. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> in another able and also destructive speech, and other honorable senators on that side - have admitted that there are known evils to be dealt with, and that if they could grapple with them in any way they would. They have based their objection to the measure, and stated their intention of voting against its second reading. purely on the ground that in their opinion it would?1 be ineffective. If they admit that in other countries evils have grown up under the operation of enormous combines ; if some of them have admitted that there are known to be such evils here, though, perhaps, in almost an infantile stage, and if others have admitted that if the evils are not here now, they are likely to arise perhaps in the near future - if they believe all these things, and? consider that no great harm- would be done by the passing of the measure, but that it would tend to check some of the evils which are here now, or which may arise by-and-by,. why should they not be prepared. to give it a chance ? I do not believe that it would&#34; be found effective for a great length of time in dealing with trusts and combines which are going to be injurious, and which, in my opinion, are injurious now in checking that proper growth of Australian industries which we all would&#39; like to see take place. But if there is a chance, as I believe there is, of the Bill being an; instrument to control the trusts in some respects, to check even in the slightest degree their operations, while the people are being educated to the idea that the most effective way to deal with them is to own them,, and regulate them through their representatives, the measure may effect some good, and that is why I intend to vote for its&#39; second reading. It was interesting to watch the constitutional differences between the two lawyers who spoke this afternoon. The contest between <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> only serves .to show what an elastic instrument the Constitution is when two legal luminaries, who are both protectionists, and who, therefore, I should say, are both anxious to do what they can reasonably to help Australian industries hold opinions so radically opposed&#39; to each other regarding the reading of two of its provisions. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> argued that the Bill could be made to apply to such a case as was seen by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> in London. When the latter drew a harrowing picture of the price of coal being raised in the severest weather to the poorest of the poor, and when he affirmed&#39; that, in his opinion, such a case, if it happened in Melbourne, could not be dealt with under the measure, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> took an entirely opposite opinion. I as a layman am with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> in his reading of the- provision, perhaps because the wish is .father to the thought. I sincerely hope that, if the point is ever contested, a sufficiently broad construction will be placed upon the provision by the High Court to allow such a case as that cited by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> to be dealt with under the measure. It seems to me that there is a very strong probability that the High Court would read into the provisions a broader construction than that of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake.</inline> That is an additional reason why I shall support the Bill, purely as an instalment of the&#39; legislation which is coming every day faster and faster, and which must come, in response to the opinion of the people at large, as the kind of legislation which in the end can be the only method to deal effectively with trusts as we desire them to be dealt with. I shall not be able to personally record my vote for the second reading of the Bill, because I have paired with an honorable senator who will be unable to be present during this week. I hope that if the Bill gets into Committee honorable senators on both sides will assist its progress; that those who are opposed to the second reading will then join with those who are in favour of the measure in making it as effective an instrument for the accomplishment of the purpose in view as it can be made. </para>

                    <para>.- Many objections have been taken to the Bill, which, in my opinion, should have been deferred until we reached the Committee stage. Most of the arguments adduced have not been against the principle of the Bill, but against clauses which, if unsatisfactory, as possibly they may be, can easily &#39;be altered in Committee. In discussing the second reading what we have to consider is whether it is desirable to introduce legislation to prevent trusts or corporations carrying on business with intent to injure Australian industries. That is the principle we have tq discuss. If-it is not desirable to introduce &#34;such legislation the second reading of this Bill should not be carried ; but if it is desirable that combinations or trusts, carrying on trade with the design to injure or destroy Australian industries, should be restricted then the second reading should&#39; be carried. Some objection has been taken to the phraseology of the measure, because it provides that before an offender can be punished for an offence, there must be proof of intent. Surely that is eminently in the interests of fair play? Indeed, it would be monstrous to assume that we would accept legislation that would render it possible to make a person punishable for an act committed innocently, and without any intention of wrongdoing. That would be contrary to the spirit of all British law. This Bill provides that the making of a contract with the design of destroying an Australian industry shall be punishable by fine or imprisonment. It further provides that such a contract being made in contravention of the provision dealing with that offence shall be null and void. There are some persons who, while they offer no objection to the spirit of the law proposed, as applied to future undertakings, are afraid that this provision will be retrospective in its operation, and will affect agreements which have already been entered into. Speaking for myself, I have no doubt at all on the subject. lt is perfectly clear to me that under no circumstances can this Bill affect agreements entered into before it is passed. It is quite impossible that such agreements could have been made in contravention of a section of an Act which had no existence. Still I think the Minister of Defence would be wise if, bv some statement or other, he were to make that perfectly clear to the public mind, so that those who are now nervous on the matter shall be reassured. </para>

                        <para>- I think that the Minister of Defence should state it also in the Senate, and in terms as definite as they can possibly be made. It cannot be made too clear. Many persons are nervous and anxious on the subject, and it is as well that their minds should be relieved. I think it is perfectly clear that there is no intention to deal in the way of punishment with persons who have offended against the principle of this measure before it was introduced, because in clause 4, what is distinctly described as the offence is the making of a contract with intent. If such, an offence is committed in contravention of this Bill punishment will follow, and by a natural and proper sequence it will follow also that a contract so made will become null and void. This can have no reference to&#39; contracts made prior to the passing of the Bill. There has been some effort to prove that the words &#34; continuing in &#34; refer in some way to the contract, but obviously they refer to individuals who continue, after the passing of this measure, in combinations at variance with the spirit of the law, or in contravention of its provisions. </para>

                        <para>- That may be so, but individuals who make contracts with corporations do sometimes die. I am not now endeavouring so much to reply to objections raised in the Senate, as to remove anxiety which I know to exist in the minds of individuals outside with reference to the possible operation of this measure. I shall not proceed further on the lines of criticism adopted by other honorable senators, and which I have myself followed so far, because I do not think that is the proper course to take. The proper course on a second reading is to discuss the principles of the Bill, and perhaps incidentally to indicate some amendments which mav be sought in Committee. It is certainly not the proper course to object to the second reading of a Bill because the machinery clauses are insufficient or incomplete to give effect to its principle. </para>

                        <para>- Just so. A point has been raised which, it seems to me, does not deal with the clauses of the Bill, but rather with our powers in connexion with such a measure. I refer to the constitutional question raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> : the question as to whether we have power, under the Constitution, to make laws dealing with the subject involved in this Bill, other than mere machinery laws for the continuing in existence of a company. In order to arrive at some idea of the true position with reference to our Constitutional powers, I purpose reading from the Constitution in this connexion. First of all. we have to remember that our powers under the Constitution are contained in a section of the Constitution Act which contains thirty-nine distinct paragraphs - each one of which, I venture to say, is independent of the others, and of everything but the covering portion of the section which provides that - </para>

                <para class="block">I venture, as a layman, to say that, though of course, with very great diffidence. I have not so much hesitation in making the statement as I should have, were it not for the fact that lawyers in the Senate differ very much on the subject. I venture an opinion based, I think, on commonsense, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best&#39;s</inline> reading^ and the reading I have just given of our powers under the Constitution are the correct reading. I am, of course, supported in that view by the fact that, obviously, the same reading is followed by an extremely astute and careful lawyer in the person of the Attorney-General. It has been urged, first of all, that this Bill will be of no use, or that it will not accomplish the object Ministers have, in view ; and in some measure I am bound to endorse the latter portion of that view. I arn afraid that it would be very difficult indeed to frame any law sufficient to cope with the genius and lack of scruple exercised by commercial people. Unfortunately all our experience in dealing with commercial men, and in investigating their methods, leads us to the conclusion that to successfully cope with the accomplishment of making profit there must be a very strong, very careful, and very comprehensive law. But I think that this Bill aims at restricting, retarding, and preventing an. extremely baneful form of commerce. If it fails in its object, that is no argument against it, except as showing that it is not strong enough. It must be remembered that one of the arguments urged against the Bill is that it is, stronger, more drastic, and more far-reaching in its provisions than the American laws, on which it is said to be founded. </para>

                        <para>- Surely that is an argument in favour of the Bill ? American laws, obviously have failed ; and their design was largely the design we have in our minds. To make a law exactly like the American laws that have failed would be extremely stupid, but to take the laws that have failed as a basis for laws that we hope will succeed, is by no means stupid. We have seen the points on which the American laws have failed, and we are trying in this Bill to build more perfectly, and make a law more efficient on the basis that has been presented bv our American cousins. Failure anywhere, if we are wise, is, not complete failure. Every failure is an indi cation of the road to success, just as navigation is made more secure and certain for the future by every wreck on a previously uncharted rock. A wreck, of course, is a failure in a particular instance of navigation, but a wreck on a rock not previously charted is a success in that it points to the means of avoiding similar wrecks in the future. To that extent the American efforts to control monopoly are not a complete failure, because they are enabling the American people, I hope, to discover some means by which they can completely achieve what they have sought to achieve in the past, and what, unfortunately, they have only partially succeeded in achieving. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> spent a good deal of time in urging that no necessity or demand had been proved for the Bill, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> in some degree, followed in the same direction. I venture to say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> and others have given very strong evidence that, whether there is power to control trusts - whether there is power to check and retard their baneful operations - there is no doubt as to the necessity. Trusts exist in a form that is extremely injurious to the whole human family. In America the trust in its various forms - and I believe, in most instances, consisting of the same individuals - has taken control of the American people, and is imposing- on them disabilities and taxes of a most monstrous character. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Charles</inline> Edward Russell, a writer who may be known to honorable senators, has recently published a most striking book on what he describes as the greatest trust in the world. The general impression is that there is only one greatest trust in the world, and that that is the trust which embraces all the trusts in the United States - that they are not separate institutions.,&#39; <inline font-style="italic">hut</inline> one institution under several names. That is the trust with which, before I have concluded, I shall show we have been threatened in a <inline font-style="italic">most</inline> flagrant, and, <inline font-style="italic">unless</inline> we take some steps, extremely dangerous, manner. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Russell</inline> says in most striking words at the opening of his book - </para>

                        <para>- His influence was sufficient to prevent his being looked for. I am pointing out the awful power of these combinations. However, there was no trouble at all in finding <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rockefeller</inline> when it was decided that his evidence could be dispensed with. I refer to those baneful organizations in America to show the necessity for this Bill. It may be said that the facts disclose a reason why something more should be done in America, but that we have no trusts in Australia. Suppose, for argument sake, that that were true, it would not be a reason against the Bill. Legislation is ineffective in America largely because it comes too late. Those trusts had attained such a position, and such power, that legislation has proved ineffective to follow them. Legislation might easily have checked the trusts if it had been in advance, but it has proved ineffective to follow. I venture to say, however, that we have trusts in Australia in active operation, and I shall endeavour to show the method by which they work. It has been frequently declared during this discussion that this Bill is the result of the energy and activity of a single individual, who has been described in various terms of opprobrium as &#34;Hugh Victorious&#34; McKay, &#34;Greddy &#34; McKay, &#34; Mean, Grabbing,, and Grasping&#34; McKay. </para>

                        <para>- I do; I &#39;know most of the manufacturers of Victoria very well indeed. I know a good many of the manufacturers of Australia. There are, indeed, many of them who are my own friends, and whom I have known for long. I made it an object of consideration for many years how best we could assist by legislative action to develop the manufacturing industries of Australia. I do not know that it is any reproach to know manufacturers. I know both them and their workmen very well indeed; and in connexion with this industry, since the present difficulty has arisen, I have been in communication with several thousands of people. Touching this particular individual, it appears, in the opinion of some people, to be an offence that he is now doing pretty well. I am inclined to believe, and certainly I hope, that he is doing well. &#34; </para>

                        <para>- It was about twenty years ago. I have known him so long. I know of his struggles of long ago, and am well aware that he had to contend against the most adverse circumstances in the beginning. The invention of which he had possession, partly acquired and partly the result of his own genius, was them imperfect. He had to make trial after trial to get over the difficulties in connexion with it. After he had developed it, and had created a machine that was really effective, he had to contend with the natural conservatism of people who were afraid to risk a large sum of money in what might turn out to be a failure. Although <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> has been struggling along and doing some business during the last twenty-four or twenty-five years, it is really only six or seven years since this particular machine took hold, and it can only be within that time that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay,</inline> or any one else in this country, has been doing well out of the industry. But honorable senators do not get up and fume with wrath when they hear of some person who, by reason of his inventive genius, is doing well out of some other industry. It is, for instance, a matter of common knowledge that the inventor of a little instrument that will go into one&#39;s waistcoat pocket, and the useful service of which is merely to prick the end of a cigar, has made a large fortune out of it. I do not hear of any one getting very wrath about that. It should not be a matter for condemnation, nor for the use of foul epithets and offensive names, that an Australian citizen has had the indomitable perseverance to stick to his work _ to hold on in the face of difficulties under which many men would have gone down. I should think that it is rather a matter for approbation and approval - a matter about which we ought rather to be proud - certainly not a matter about which terms like &#34;greedy&#34; and &#34;grasping&#34; should be used. It has been said that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> is making .&#163;30,000 a year. I do not know whether that be so. I hope that he is. But. if we remember that, throughout the whole of the early period of his manufacturing career, he was often in serious financial straits, and if we consider his period of well-doing in connexion with the whole extent of his operations, it would not appear to be a very large sum, after all. I merely mention that because I think it is due to ourselves that we should not look upon it as a matter for reprehension that an Australian citizen- </para>

                        <para>- Of course, he did rot do it out of pure patriotism. He did it as a business venture. But the result is that he has conferred an enormous benefit upon the arid portions of this Commonwealth, because he has enabled thosed&#39;ry areas to be profitably devoted to wheat-growing, which could not have been done with ar.v reasonable prospect of success, except for the introduction of the harvester or a similar machine. I remember hearing a member of another place, speaking, not in Parliament itself, upon this question, declare as an agriculturist, that it was due almost entirely to the pluck, energy, and invention of the agricultural implement makers of Australia that&#34; wheat-growing in our great northern areas has been rendered possible. That opinion was &#39;expressed by the Honorable Thomas Kennedy. Even if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> McKay is now beginning to reap the fruits of &#34;his life&#39;swork, no one ought to complain, and he certainly has the right to try to prevent- his labours being nullified and frustrated... </para>

                        <para>- My honorable friend is quite right, but <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McKay has been the only man who has been singled out for attack. The manufacturers as a body have made an appeal. Here are some of the names upon it : T. Robinson and Company, H. V. McKay and Company, Beard and Sisson, the Clyde Engineering Works, New South Wales, Meadow Bank Works, New South Wales, Thomas Martin and Company, Gawler, May Brothers, Gawler, Hawke and Company, Kapunda, Rollin and Company, Nicholson and Morrow, and a number of others. These firms have r.ot been referred to; and that is why I have occupied time in calling attention to what seems to me to be the undue vilification of Mr. McKay in the course of this debate. There is another danger in connexion with trusts which it seems to me we have to consider. Senator Symon says that there are none in this country. Singularly enough, however, he himself has offered strong evidence of the danger. If honorable senators will bear with me for a moment, I will read an extract from his argument, in which he gave very strong evidence of that which he denied. Of course, Senator Symon adopted the attitude of an advocate. It is very Hard, I suppose, to a person who is continually engaged in. the legal profession to escape from the atmosphere of the Courts.</inline></para>

                        <para>- Yes, and so did the Australians, but the fact is that after three years&#39; operation, these people have obtained very nearly half the trade in stripper harvesters. What the Australian manufacturers declare is that there is a very great danger of this Australian industry being entirely crushed out. Surely these figures indicate that that apprehension is not unfounded, and that is the justification for the Bill. </para>

It happens that lawyers, doctors., clergymen, and some other persons are non-producers - of course, it is not an offence to be a non-producer. In the Commonwealth there are very few non-producers, and therefore when we. consider the interests of the producers, we also consider the interests of the consumers. </para>

                        <para>- I. would rather pursue the argument on my own lines ; in fact. I do not want to have attributed to me thoughts which are not in my mind.&#39; It will generally be admitted that a producer, who, of course, is also a consumer, has interests both as a producer and as a consumer, but it will be admitted at once, I think, that the former are very much greater than the latter, because every producer produces in order to acquire from &#39; day to day what is necessary for him to consume, and, in addition, to put by some money for a rainy day, or to enable him to consume more liberally in times that are to come. Suppose that the accusation is true that in the Bill we are considering merely the interests of the producer. I reply that we are considering the interests of the consumer at the same time. But the statement is not true. The object of the Bill is to liberate the consumer from the machinations of persons who happen to be enthralled, enslaved, and taxed. In reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> the other evening, I interjected that cheapness is often the prelude to dearness. Cheapness is not necessarily an advantage, and it certainly is a disadvantage if the object of the present cheapness is to bring about a period of continued and extended dearness. There are numerous instances where combinations have resorted to cheapness in order to create dearness to be of an Increasing and enduring character. In his book, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Russell</inline> says at page 177 - </para>

                    <para>The city butchers were solidly united, determined, and ably led. The public was aroused ; its sympathies were wholly on the side of the butchers. The people of San Francisco have convictions in favour of transacting their own business in their own way, and they seem to entertain much doubt as to the essential benevolence of monopolies. P.Iain intimations were made that if the trust attempted in San Francisco the methods it had pursued elsewhere, results (I translate freely) might follow inimical to the highest physical welfare of the trust gentlemen. </para>

                <para class="block">In their own interest, the people of San Francisco threatened physical violence against a proposed cheapness of the trust which was designed to kill existing competition, with a view subsequently to create dearness, and a recorded instance is given where, in Chicago, a butcher who resisted their efforts, had a shop started next door to him, where meat was given away. That is what my honorable friends opposite are looking for - something extremely cheap. Why did the trust give away the meat? That is what we have to consider, and that consideration underlies the Bill. Its object is to prevent baneful cheapness, initiated with the design of creating a monopoly, that is intended to bring about dearness extremely prejudicial to the well-being of the consumer and the producer. I propose to show very briefly some of the methods which the combination is adopting 5n Australia, as evidence that there is a very grave danger. In a statutory declaration made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Moore,</inline> of T. Robinson and Company, he affirmed that the representative of the American trust said to him, 41 We have 90 per cent, of the world&#39;s trade in harvesters, and we are going to have the other tenth, whatever it costs.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- No, if it were not part of a chain of evidence; but I shall show presently that there is every justification for believing the statement, from the fact that operations have been entered into in the direction of obtaining at verv great cost the trade of Australia. The statutory declaration is some justification for believing that the statement is truthful. If that were all, I should not attach a great deal of importance to it. But what are the methods adopted? We have also evidence that these companies, in order to sell their goods in our market - a very proper thing to do - have resorted to extraordinary means. They have endeavoured at some cost to belittle the Australian product. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> V. McKay gave evidence on oath that they purchased some of his machines at a cost of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;90</inline> each, and sold them for ^75 each. There must be some other cause for losing ^15 on a machine than merely belittling the product of an opponent. How did this operate ? &#34; Can I sell you a McCormick or a Deering stripper-harvester?&#34; &#34;Oh, no ; I prefer a Sunshine harvester.&#34; &#34; Oh, do you? Well, I am astonished to hear that.

He declares, and his evidence was given on oath, that on the back of their conditions of contract they have a provision that if purchasers do not like the &#34; Superior &#34; they can change it for a &#34; Mitchell &#34; drill.

He hears that there are two on the market, one selling at -^80 or &#163;81, and the other at &#163;75, and being anxious to have the best he would very likely do as people often do, and as I frequently do myself, when I go to purchase anything of which I have no particular knowledge, and that is, assume that the best is the higher-priced machine. </para>

It appears to me that these two statements cannot both be true, though both may be&#39; untrue, and subsequent statements of the company lead us to the conclusion that possibly they are both untrue. They give in the circular a number of figures, and they say - and hence reduce our profit as shown above to 5s. 9d. gd. </para>

I am in a position to say in answer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> that there is very serious complaint from the manufacturers of South Australia. I have a letter from Messrs. May Brothers, who assure me that their output this year is more than 50 per cent. less than it was last year, and this they attribute to the operations of American competitors - the foreign trust. Messrs. McKay recently, at a reunion of their work-people at Ballarat, declared that they have made 350 fewer machines this year than last, and this they also attribute entirely to the action of the Harvester Company. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator cannot make that statement on the figures which are available. The importation of harvesters in 1904 was between 400 and 500, while, according to a return presented to the House of Representatives, it had increased in 1905 to 1,700. I have not the figures for this year, but those I have quoted show a very alarming increase. Honorable senators say that, if we check the importation, we shall injure or ruin the farmer, and that, after all, we must consider our great producing industries. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> urged that the producing, industries are much more important than are the manufacturing industries, and that, whatever we do, we should be careful in fostering the one not to injure the other. I quite agree that in fostering the one we ought to be careful not to injure the other ; but I contend that in fostering the one we are advancing the interests of the other. There is no doubt that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> was wrong when he said that the agricultural, pastoral, and dairying industries together were more important than the manufacturing industries, measured by the magnitude of the output. The honorable senator was wrong, not only in reference to the whole Commonwealth, but in reference to his own State, which is amongst the least developed in manufacturing production. </para>

                        <para>- Does not the honorable senator take the original cost of raw material into account in estimating the yield of the pastoral and dairying industries? There cannot be an output from pastoral pursuits and agriculture without land and stock, and the cost of this raw material must be taken into account. In giving aggregate returns, I adopt a course that is equitable, whereas <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> does not show a fair comparison. Further, in reference to the argument that if we are not careful we shall injure the producer, I desire to point out that in the States where this kind of interference has been greatest, agriculture has been developed to the largest extent. The most highly developed agricultural State in Australia is Victoria, where there have been more restrictions of the character referred to than in any of the other States. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> when arguing the other evening that we should be careful in imposing such&#39; restrictions, proved at the same time that where they have been most resorted to the people have been the most prosperous. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> declared that the prosperity of Victoria is the greatest in the world, and, in proof, showed that the earning power in Canada is <inline font-style="italic">&#163;16</inline> 5 s. per head, <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> the United States &#163;14 14s. per head, in the United Kingdom <inline font-style="italic">&#163;7</inline> 18s. fid. per head, and in Victoria .&#163;27 19s. 6d. Surely we ought not to be afraid of passing this Bill because it might mean some apparent restriction, and thus injure the farmer. As a matter of fact, Victoria, compared with New South Wales, has many disadvantages as a farming country. Victoria has about one-third the area, and is something like half the age of New South Wales, and yet the former State, has over 1, 000,000 acres more under cultivation. At the same time, the average yield per acre is of more value in New South Wales than it .is in Victoria. The only reason why Victoria is so advanced is that she has had a different kind&#39; of legislation in which so-called restriction has been a large element. There is another very interesting comparison between New South Wales and Victoria that may be very proper! v given without any reflection on either State. The Savings Bank returns may he said to be an index to the diffusion of prosperity amongst the people. They are an index of the power of the poorer section of the community to out bv something for a rainy day. Although New </para>

As a matter of fact, the New South Wales Savings Bank gives a higher percentage of interest, and gives interest upon larger amounts, than the Victorian Savings Bank does.

                        <para>- There is another point. <inline font-style="italic">Coghlan</inline> points out by referring to the probate duties how wealth is distributed amongst the people. He gives a return showing how many persons in each hundred who die leave over ,&#163;100 to be administered by the Probate Office. He finds that in New South Wales 16.65 per cent, of those who die leave over &#163;100. In Victoria, the percentage is 24.18. That shows a very general &#39;diffusion of wealth in this State. What we are seeking is not the aggregation of wealth in a few hands. One of the charges against legislation such as I support is that it will make a few manufacturers wealthy. I point to these figures as showing that the State in which the people have been able to save the! most, as shown by the records, is that State in which legislation has been most in accordance with the ideas which I advocate. <inline font-style="italic">Coghlan</inline> goes on to say - </para>

                <para>These figures show a distribution of property not to be paralleled in any other part of the world ; and in a country where so much is said about the poor growing poorer and the rich richer, it is pleasing to find that in the whole population one in six is the possessor of property, and that the ratio of distribution has been increasing with fair regularity in every province of the group. Victoria has the widest diffusion of wealth of the individual States ; South Australia comes next to Victoria; then comes New Zealand. </para>
