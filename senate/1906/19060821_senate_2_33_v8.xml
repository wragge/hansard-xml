                        <para>. - I think it will be admitted that the subject-matter of the Bill is well calculated to cause an interesting debate. It will also be acknowledged that, so far, we have nothing to complain of in that regard, because the speeches have been very able and very interesting, and I think fairly descriptive of the attitude taken up by various parties here on questions such as the Bill is supposed to deal with. It clearly sets out the Government policy. At all events, if we remember the pronouncement of the- Prime Minister at Adelaide, when he declared for legislation for the controlling of trusts, the policy may be briefly described as one to allow trusts or monopolies to remain in the hands of private monopolists whilst bringing forward legislation for the control of trusts. While the Labour Party are quite prepared to go the whole way with the Government, and assist them in passing legislation of that kind, we are also prepared to go much further. At the same dme. when, it is remembered that very important trusts or monopolies are in the hands of private persons, it must be recognised that legislation of this kind is an absolute necessity. I believe that the Bill is merely the forerunner of much legislation of a similar kind which will be forced upon the attention of Parliament. At all events, that has been the experience of the United States, and I think it will be the experience of Australia. Just as our industries develop into trusts, industrial life has developed from the competitive stage to a much less severe competitive stage, and capital has been concentrated into bigger and still bigger concerns. I believe, therefore, that legislation of this* kind will be forced upon Parliament from time to time. Just as we have had in the past, and, I think, will have in the future, labour legislation, to make the present state of affairs tolerable- </para>

                            <para>- I am not referring to it as a labour Bill. I am saying that in the present state of affairs labour and anti-trust legislation will be forced upon Parliament in order to control those monopolies which have fallen into the hands of private capital in contradiction to the policy of both the Labour Party and the Government. We recognise that this tinkering measure does not provide for anything like a radical cure. We hold that the root of this economic disease must be touched before anything like a complete cure is provided. I look upon this mea- &gt; sure just as I regard the application of ointment to the surface of a sore; it may ease the trouble for the time being, but it will by no means effect a cure of the disease. But in direct contradiction to the policy of the Labour Party, and that of the Government as manifested in the Bill, we have <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> as leader of the Free-trade Party, rising and declaring for no kind of interference by means of legislation to control trusts while they are in the hands of private companies, and at the same time dissenting from the Labour Party's much more advanced and drastic proposals for the nationalization of the industries when they have reached the stage of private monopolies. True to his freetrade ideas of no control of trusts by legislation ; true to the old let-alone policy so characteristic of the Manchester school of politicians, he affirms that in such matters the Government should not interfere iri1 any way. He also declared that the Bill would only be applicable in regard to the free competition of trade in Australia. He even went further than that, and said that in Australia we had no trusts to control. I think I shall be able to show that iri' Australia we have not only trusts, but trusts which are injurious to other sections of industry, and which are preventing legitimate competition. The Constitution provides a very good precedent for this kind of legislation. Its framers foresaw the necessity of giving power to this Parliament, if need be, to interfere with Government monopolies. - to interfere with the Government railways of the various States if it were found that they were acting unfairly as between State and State. Section 98 says - </para>

                            <para>- I admit that various views may be taken as to the scope and purpose of the Bill. But if it can be made more stringent in order to deal' with existing trusts, let that be done. All I am now contending for is that in our midst we have private monopolies, and that it is a proper thing for this measure -to be passed. In my opinion, the most injurious monopoly we have is the shipping ring, because it practically controls the whole of the shipping on the coast of Australia. Amongst other things, the Navigation Commission discovered that the tonnage on the Australian coast comprised 188,000 tons, and that out of that tonnage less than 10,000 tons were outside the shipping ring. In America, the land of trusts, possession as to the means of transportation, in the shape of railways, gives trusts enormous power, but we in Australia, owning our railways, have to a considerable extent been free from that exercise of power. But the means of transportation between Tasmania or Western Australia and the other States is in the hands of private monopolists, who are known as the Ship-owners' Federation, and I believe I am amply justified' in saying that they have used that power very unscrupulously, and in a way unfair to the merchants of Australia, to the employes engaged by them in some regards, and to other ship-owners. </para>

                            <para>- Not only does the shipping ring control the coastal trade, so far as -.transportation is concerned, but its ramifications extend into the coal trade. Some years ago a friend of mine desired to open a coal trade in Western Australia. At that time the coal trade in that State was a very good one for those who were engaged in it. An independent colliery proprietor in Newcastle, who was not connected with the shipping companies, asked me to obtain certain information in connexion with the coal trade of Western Australia, which I did. Afterwards he told me that he had found that, while the market in the State was a. good one - much better than he could obtain elsewhere - the freight was in the hands of the shipping ring, and he was excluded from entering the market. It will be seen, therefore, that the power in the hands of the ring at the present time is very great indeed. </para>

                            <para>- There is one company outside the ring that is carrying coal, but it does a very small trade in Western Australia. The principal coal merchants there get their coal from the Adelaide Shipping Company, and from Mcllwraith, McEacharn, and Company, which are members of the ring. When the Navigation Commission was engaged in taking evidence, the witnesses sent by the Chambers of Commerce spoke more strongly than any other witnesses with, regard to the action of the shipping ring. I have here an extract from a letter sent to the Prime Minister by the Melbourne Chamber of Commerce. It is dated 9th November, 1904, and is as follows: - </para>

                        <para>I am directed by my council to bring under your notice a most pernicious system that has grown up in shipping circles, under the name of freight rebates. These rebates, in fair and honest trading, are absolutely unnecessary, and in many instances are a gross injustice to consignees. Where goods are sent by a producer, who is some distance from the seaboard, to be shipped by an agent at the shipping port, these rebates too often take the form of a secret commission; and where the rebate is allowed to a shipper direct, it is granted only on the understanding that he confines his business to certain companies within the shipping ring, or trust, the conditions under which this rebate is allowed are that the company, whilst collecting the freight on a cash basis, when the goods are shipped, will only return the percentage, after twelve months, and during that time the shipper must confine his shipments to the ring;. </para>

                        has declared that this Bill will prevent competition. I hold that we have not got competition in Australia now. As far as the coastal trade is concerned, the shipping ring prevents it. The Bill, in my opinion, will not be found to be drastic enough for its purpose. We shall require a measure somewhat like the Elkin Act of the United States, which makes it a penal offence for any transportation company to give any rebate. Respecting the treatment of the merchants of Australia by the shipping ring, I should like to quote the evidence of

Suddenly one of the Inter-State companies put on another boat in opposition, and at the same time issued a rebate circular which had the effect of stopping all shipments in my vessel by local merchants, because they were threatened if they shipped with me, not only would they lose their rebates on cargo shipped at Bunbury and the Vasse, but on the cargo shipped to or from the eastern States. This had the effect of taking all the trade from me, and I had to pay off the crew, and laid up the vessel, and she has been laid up ever since. </para>

If it were done by a trade union secretary, the press of Australia would be howling its loudest, but not a word was said about these practises. Not a word appeared in the capitalistic press in reference to them.

Will any man dare to say that this shipping trust is not injurious to the other ship-owners and collier-owners who come into competition with its vessels, seeing that it can simply cause the newspapers to close their columns against any outcry when it so unscrupulously deals with other ship-owners? I think there can be no possible doubt about that. </para>

                            <para>- I have indicated the treatment meted out to the opponents of the shipping ring, both in the coal and the transport trades. I should also like to point out briefly the treatment that is meted out to the officers on the vessels owned by the shipping ring, the hours of labour worked, and the wages paid. I have here the evidence of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dakin,</inline> which indicates that exceedingly long hours are worked on- these vessels by officers when in port, and dealing with cargo. He shows that officers are on duty from twenty to thirty-five hours at a stretch, and that the moment they go to sea after finishing with the cargo, these officers! have to go on the bridge and take their watch, although they may be more fit to go to their berths and sleep. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dakin</inline> was asked why it was, if this treatment was meted out to master mariners, they did not form an association to protect their interests. He replied that they had tried to do so, but that their efforts were very quickly squelched; whilst those who took a leading part were blacklisted, and kept out of employment. As the shipping ring had control of the trade of Australia, these men would have to go out of the country to get a living. </para>

                            <para>- If the argument is out of order, I shall not persist in it, but I think I have sufficiently proved that the snipping ring is of an injurious character, and that we are justified in passing legislation to control it. Of course, I admit that it will be very difficult for us to get at the responsible people. Legislation of a similar kind in the United States has undoubtedly failed to effect any think like a radical amendment. The power of the "boss" is very great, and these people have enormous capital at hand. They can undoubtedly make use of their capital to safeguard themselves from the effect of any legislation we mav pass. </para>

I should like to lay before honorable senators the opinion of the President of the United States, only recently expressed, as to the power of the trusts- over lawyers. We know the power. of the trusts in various directions ; we know that they have practically captured the Senate of America, and have such a. controlling effect in Congress that they can defeat or get past almost every kind of law. </para>

                            <para>- No; he does it according to the article I am about to read. But President Roosevelt charges the Bar of America with being in the pay of trusts for the one purpose of defeating the laws passed by Congress. It is well known that the trusts of America have got such a pull on the Senate that, as I say, they can pass or defeat any law they wish. That is so well known to the readers of trust literature that it is scarcely necessary for me to make the statement. </para>

President Roosevelt's opinion is given in an article in the <inline font-style="italic">North American Review,</inline> under the heading " Lawyers and Trusts." I am sorry that the legal members of the Senate have taken flight for the time -being, because I think that what I am about to read would be of some interest to them. The article is written by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Frank</inline> Gavlord Cook, and commences as follows : - </para>

                            Roosevelt, in his address at the Harvard Commencement last year, made a grave charge against members of the legal profession. "We all know that, as things actually are, many of the most influential and most highly remunerated members of the Bar in every centre of wealth," he declared, " make it their special task to work out bold and ingenious schemes by which their wealthy clients, individual or corporate, can evade the laws which were made to regulate, in the interests of the public, the uses of great wealth." Coming, as it does, from such a conspicuous source, on such a prominent occasion, and with such earnest emphasis, this charge should receive the serious attention of the community and of the Bar. It deeply concerns the community, because, if true, it points to a combination of wealth and legal skill - little short of a conspiracy - against the public welfare, a scheme to defraud and despoil the public for private gain, and in defiance and contempt of the law. And it vitally concerns the Bar, because such employment by its members compromises its honour, reputation, and usefulness.

                    <para>These are very strong statements made on the authority of the President of the "United States, and it does not require me to further labour the point. This all goes to show that the power of capital in the United States is such that it has been able so far to defeat any great alterations being brought about by anti-trust legislation. Whether our experience in Australia will be different or more successful than in America time alone can tell. However, I think that in Australia we have an advantage. Fortunately for this country, the Labour Party has obtained a footing in the various Legislatures, and that is more than can be said for the democracy of the "United States. The consequence is that the power of the trusts is much greater in America than I hope it will ever be in Australia. </para>

                            <para>- I might return the compliment. I set myself the task of proving the existence of a shipping trust in Australia, and I think I have done so by the evidence I have quoted. I have proved that the operations of this trust are of a highly injurious character, so far as concerns other sections of the community, and, consequently, we have every right to legislate so as to minimize the evil effects of such a combination as far as possible. We have certainly got rid of the competitive system in the coastal trade, but the benefits so far have only reached the employers. By this combination the ship-owners have managed, up to the present, to reap all the advantages from the concentration of the trade with the Employers' Federation. </para>

We had evidence before the Navigation Commission that the rebate system has, to a great extent, been broken down in America by means of that law, and if we can follow the example thus set, we shall get rid, I hope, of a very injurious system. </para>

Whilst in place of the old competition we have got the evil of private monopoly, I do not think that even if we get rid of the latter, we shall go back to the former system ; indeed, I feel sure we shall do nothing of the kind.

We are too civilized now to suffer the evils of competition. </para>

                            <para>- If the Bill had that effect well and good, but so far as the old competitive system is concerned, with its accompanying waste in every trade, it must be regarded as a thing of the past. My remedy for the whole situation, in order that the benefits of the abolition of competition may be justly distributed, is the nationalization, of trusts, because that is the only remedy which would go to the root of the matter. So long as private companies and capitalists have the controlling power, the united profits of the concentration of capital will undoubtedly accrue to them instead pf to the people at large. Of course, we , naturally expect <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> to dissent from such. a view, but ultimately we shall be forced to nationalize trusts or the trusts will control the whole of us. Trusts are gradually extending their power in the richest country in the world. </para>

                            <para>- I think the Labour Party may fairly and reasonably claim' to be the national party. However,. I agree that there is no course open to us at this stage but to follow the course indicated by the Bill. I quite recognise that Australia is not prepared to go the length of nationalization; and that being so, we must make the best of the present position. This Bill undoubtedly gives us_the power, to some extent, to control the trusts now in existence. I should like, in conclusion, to repeat the words of John Stuart Mill, that no Government can divest itself of the duty to control monopolies for the public good. </para>

                        <para>.- I am inclined to think that the importance of the Bill has been somewhat exaggerated, but no words can over-estimate the complexity of the problem with which we have to deal. As I have thought on many occasions, we do not adopt the right mode of making laws for the Commonwealth. It appears to me that our system is not the one best calculated to insure wise laws, nor to make the most of such ability and experience as members of the two Chambers possess. The Bill is eminently one which might with great advantage have been referred to a Committee. I do not mean a Select Committee, but a Committee of the Senate composed of members of varied experience, who, sitting round a table, with authorities, precedents, and histories before them, would have been able to prepare a report most helpful in dealing with this complex problem, and in framing such laws as would bring about the result we all desire. That result is that trusts shall be fairly regulated, and dumping of an injurious kind shall to some extent be prevented. I quite admit that the evils of trusts in Australia have hardly yet appeared. The reasons I have for voting for the second reading, and thus getting the Bill into Committee, are two. First, I agree with the closing remark of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford,</inline> that, having an Act to deal with trusts and their regulation and control, we could to a very great extent prevent the mischief showing its head here; and, secondly, I am influenced by the statement of Professor Ely in his admirable book on the question, namely, that because we cannot see our way to do everything we might desire in the regulation of trusts so as not to injure our trade and commerce, is no reason for our not attempting to do something. For those two reasons I shall vote for the second reading of the Bill, but I am not prepared to vote for every clause. It is quite certain that there are beneficent trusts, and trusts which have injurious effects. Some writers tell us that trusts were created to put a stop to the waste of competition, it being seen that, by large organizations of capital and industry, economies might be effected which could not be brought about by single individuals. I think, however, that it will be found that human nature is at the bottom of most trusts, which really are formed and continued for the purpose of preventing competition. The Meat Trust, for instance, is one which appears to be based on selfishness and on virtual tyranny ; the members have done everything that dishonorable men - :for that I call them - with brains could do. They depreciated or appreciated the price of cattle) as suited their purpose, and tried to limit the output and regulate prices - in short, they acted in every way in restraint of trade in order to do away with what we call fair competition. Then the American Sugar Trust agreement is such that it is difficult to find a clause in it of which it can be said that it is illegal or ought to be made illegal. That trust was formed for a beneficent purpose, but at bottom there was a desire to get rid of competition. I have been rather amused by the utterances of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, and I think that when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> interjected the former gentleman found himself in rather an awkward position. We find the Labour Party supporting a Bill, the object of which is to do away with unfair competition and bring about fair competition - to base the industries of this Commonwealth on a fair standup fight between man and man. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie must see that, in supporting this Bill, he is absolutely inconsistent in view of the principles he advocates. </para>

I do not think that the United States could hold anything like the position in the. world it does to-day - that it could not possibly have attained to the position of one of the first industrial nations of the world - unless there had been large organizations of capital. Such organizations are absolutely necessary to the progress, and nothing that we can do will ever stop them. All that we can attempt to do is to try and regulate them. I am quite sure that both <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie have been studying some of the excellent books in the Library, and that they must have come across passages which set forth in better language than I can command, the fact I am now trying to establish, namely that those large organizations are simply the result of the evolution of commercial and industrial life. </para>

He is speaking as if everything were done by labour - as if there were not such a thing as skill, as efficient labour as against inefficient labour, or any variability in human nature. This capital is not simply stored-up labour. On this point, I should like to read an extract from a book, <inline font-style="italic">Commercial Trusts,</inline> written by John R. Dos Passos, of the New York Bar, as follows: - </para>

                        <para>It is a cruel mistake, not to say blunder, to discuss these questions upon the lines of wiping out capital and exterminating it. It is as senseless as '-impossible. One more thought, and I shall close. In connexion with this crusade against aggregated capital, it is fashionable to cry out against individual wealth. There is not in the political history_ of this country any appeal so demagogic, unnatural, unfounded, and unsustainable, as that which is made against wealth. The instinct of envy, or the worst passions of prejudice, or demagogism and ignorance, lie at the base of such appeals. That you and I have not been fortunate enough to accumulate wealth, is no reason why we should undertake to criticise, and fmd fault with, those who have gotten it legitimately, much less to seek to deprive them of it. </para>

                    <para>I should 'say that if  we do anything which unfairly or unwisely restrains trade or competition, the result must be very disastrous. Our object should be to arrive at the point where competition is fair and .where it is unfair. I think that another reason for trying to deal with this complicated matter is that if any party in the Commonwealth say that it is quite impossible to control trusts the Labour- Party will have a stronger ground for asking - " Why not nationalize all monopolies ?" I have not yet heard a clear statement of what might be expected to happen when monopolies were nationalized. I attended the debate on free-trade or protection between <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Scott Bennett and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Max</inline> Hirsch,, and I was never more surprised in my . life than when I heard the former declare that he had ' not considered how the nationalization of industries would operate, how the men working under a social <inline font-style="italic">regime</inline> would have to be paid, or in what proportions they would be paid. It appears to me that the Labour Party have not considered those points, because, under their policy,, it is almost impossible to arrive at any scheme which would do justice between man and. man, or which would not end in perfect chaos before the nationalization of industries had been in force" two or three months. </para>

                            <para>- My honorable friends cannot get out of the dilemma by arguing in that way. The only argument they have to fall back upon is, " Look at the post-offices .and railways." I am speaking of industries which have never, been managed by the Government, but which ought to be, and must be, carried on by private enterprise. I am not going to allow my honorable friends to force down my throat the argument about the railways and post-office's. Those institutions are carried on for the benefit of every class in the community; therefore, they ought to be under the control of the Government. My honorable friends might nationalize one industry, and not be able to observe the defects of the system, except in the creation of a few more public servants. If we nationalize all industries which are monopolies, or if we nationalized all the means of production, distribution, and exchange, it would create disaster, and that is the policy of the Labour Party. There are a great many precedents, however, to justify us in trying to regulate trusts. I find that in Austria, so long ago as 1870, it was illegal to raise prices above the market value; that in America there are sixteen States where it is a criminal offence to regulate prices, six States where it is a crime for two or more persons to enter into an agreement whereby full and free competition is prohibited, and one State - Nebraska - where it is an offence for two or more persons to agree to suspend the sale of a product. We know that since the passing of the Sherman Act fifteen Acts have been passed in the United States to regulate trusts and monopolies. Therefore, we are quite justified in doing what we cao to pass a Bill to suit Australian conditions. In the first place, the Bill bristles with legal points; and I believe that two clauses are <inline font-style="italic">ultra aires.</inline> It will be observed that the following words in sub-clause 1 df clause 4 - in relation to trade or commerce with other countries or among the States - are left out of the first sub-clause of clause 5. That is done because the latter deals with foreign corporations. It is contended" that, because the phrase " foreign corporations " is used in paragraph xx. of section 51 of the Constitution, Parliament' has power to deal with foreign corporations in any way it likes, and that,' although we can, only regulate trade and commerce between the States, we can regulate trade and commerce under foreign corporations in one State only. That is, I think, illegal. I do not conceive that that was the purpose for which that power was taken in section 51. I am inclined -to agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> that in legislating with regard to foreign corporations, we have to deal with such questions as their formation, their capital, and so forth, The same argument arises in connexion with clause 6. It says - </para>

                            <para>- My honorable friend is taking a very shortcut in order to get out of a difficulty. I quite agree with him that when certain things were done and there was a natural, clear result flowing from the act, the Court would deem that to be evidence of the intent, tout it would be necessary to prove that result. I do not mean to suggest that it would be necessary to stand up like the International Harvester Trust, and say that, having got 90 per cent, of the world's trade, it was going to get the other 10 per cent. But if the importation of the goods and the competition which was brought about was unfair, and certain other consequences followed, the intent would be assumed. But that would have to be proved according to the law of evidence. Clause 6 goes on to say - </para>

                        dealt with that part of the clause. I am sure that he feels, as I do, that here we are touching upon very delicate ground. It has been understood all along that the Commonwealth has nothing; to do with the industrial life of the people of the States, that all legislation as to factories is left to each State, and that even if we desired, we could not possibly have a uniform industrial law.

                            <para>- I do not think that it can be done there. In dealing with the question of dumping, we are venturing upon more delicate and dangerous ground than ever. According to my reading, the United States have a magnificent home market of 80,000,000 persons, and it is protected with the highest Tariff wall in the world. The manufacturers keep their factories and men working at full speed from' the 1st January to the 31st December. They make such an enormous profit in their protected and .magnificent home market that they can afford to dump their surplus down in other countries, and1 take almost any price for it. That is the kind of dumping- which I think we ought to try to prevent. When Australians go to England or maintain there smart agents who understand what our markets are, and buy the surplus of the season's goods in London and ship them out at a very low price, I do not call that dumping, but competition - the very competition which the Bill is meant to create and put on, a firm basis. I admit that it is almost impossible to draw the line between unfair and fair dumping, and there comes in the complexity of the problem with which we have to deal. I am very much interested in the amendment of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has given notice, because, as I understand, he proposes to except the importation of goods from Great Britain^, <inline font-style="italic">I do</inline> not know what course the Government intend to take. </para>

                            <para>- To some extent it would give a preference to Great Britain. No one can contend that the dangers arising from., and the illegalities of, the trusts in Great Britain aTe a thousandth-part of those of the trusts in America. Is not that a reason for making an exception in favour of Great Britain? I defy honorable senators to draw a comparison between the importation of a quantity of last season's London goods at cheap rates and dumping, because countries like America make goods to sell at an absolute loss. We know that in almost every case they take less for the goods they export than, notwithstanding the cost of transport, they can get in the home market. The latter is the kind of dumping which we ought to try to regulate or exclude if possible. On this subject <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> pointed out a matter which I think very much ' detracts from the usefulness of the Bill, and that is that ive cannot discriminate between State and State. If it be found that goods are being dumped into the Commonwealth, their importation must be prohibited. The Justice or the Government might consider only the circumstances of the State in which the dumping occurred, consequently the Minister might prohibit the importation into the Commonwealth of goods which two or three States most urgently required. He might prohibit the manufacturers in those States from getting, perhaps, some of their raw material in the shape of partly madeup goods, and thereby do infinite harm to the trade of the Commonwealth. I am at " a loss to understand how we are to frame clauses which would do exactly what we desire. The progress of the Commonwealth must depend upon the free play of competition, with very few exceptions. It must depend upon every man being allowed to do the best he can for himself, and to use has brains and capital in the best possible way, and the exceptions must be when unfairness has crept into the competition. The difficulty, however, is to say how the unfairness is to be determined, and to discriminate between it and what is really fair competition and fair trade. </para>

                            <para>- Nothing of the kind. It must be borne in mind that there are scores of things which create hardship. If, however, we attempted to regulate those things, we should stop the progress of mankind. We all know what great suffering was brought about by the introduction of machinery. On the whole, sewing and other machines have done good to the world, but at the same time they have caused infinite suffering to hundreds, nay, thousands of men and women. In the same way, on the whole the aggregation of capital in large trusts has its good, as well as its bad side. Too much time is, I think, being devoted to the debate on the second reading of this Bill, but if it gets into Committee I shall be prepared to do my share of the work in dealing with its various clauses. </para>

                        <para>. - I join with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie in congratulating the Senate upon the highly intelligent and learned way in which the subject-matter of the Bill has been discussed. We are dealing with a most complex question, and it will be no reflection upon the Senate, I think; if I suggest- that it is being dealt with in a most complex way. The most able speeches which have been made have certainly been against the Bill. Only Senators Trenwith, McGregor, and Best have really spoken in its favour. The able speeches have been made by those who are strongly opposed to the Bill, and who do not believe that it will do any good, but who are, all the same, going to vote for it. It seems to me that it would be just what one might expect from the tone of the debate, and the action of honorable senators, if Senators Millen and Pulsford were to vote for the Bill, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline> who has just condemned it right and left, has announced his intention to do. I do not propose to support the Bill, because I do not believe that it would accomplish what most of us desire. While I give the Government credit for anticipating a state of things which might arise - not so badly in Australia as perhaps in other countries - I do not think that this Bill would accomplish the purpose for which it has been framed. </para>

                            <para>- In addition to being an anti-monopolist, I am also a protectionist. I believe in doing all that we can by legislative means to encourage production and manufacture in this great country. The possession of a country with such an enormous territory, such varieties of climate, and such vast resources, warrants us in doing everything possible to make it self-contained and self-supporting, providing all that we need within our own borders. There are various ways of accomplishing that purpose. The method that I prefer is the honest and straightforward one of imposing Customs duties on goods such as we can manufacture for ourselves. </para>

                            <para>- No, I mean a reasonable Tariff that will give the Australian manufacturers a fair "show" against outside competition. It may be that high duties will be necessary at the start to enable manufacturers to overcome the initial difficulties. But if the goods came in we should derive revenue from them, and they would be imported in decreasing proportions if we had reasonable protection. Although a protectionist, I am not a prohibitionist ; I am a believer in protection on common-sense lines. I do riot believe in protecting small and insignificant industries. We should deal with the matter in a statesmanlike way, selecting those large industries that will give employment to hundreds and thousands of people, and which are worthy of consideration by Parliament by reason of producing a raw material from the use of which will spring larger manufactures. For that reason I am in favour of protection for the purpose of establishing the iron industry on a firm foundation. I have already said that the Bill is very complex. It is complex because it tries to deal with two things, one of which is really opposed to the other. Strange to say, however, one is very often the result of the other. By means of this: Bill we are going to try by the one measure to kill competition and monopoly. Can we do that by one Act of Parliament? I intend to deal with the measure as a business man who knows something about importing, and to point cut. the difficulties that we have to face. Here I may say that there has been a tendency in our recent "legislation to try to do things that are difficult of accomplishment, and at the same time to hand over too much arbitrary power to the Minister. That practice should be guarded against, and when the Minister is endowed with large powers, as he must be under such a, measure as the Customs Act, he should be scrupulous in exercising them with discretion. Under various Acts, we have given enormous powers to make regulations. The worst feature of this procedure is that there seems to be a disposition to abuse those powers, even to the extent of providing by regulation for something that is unconstitutional, or, at any rate, for something that seems to me to come very near to the border line of unconstitutionality. I am not accustomed to make charges against the Labour Party, but in this respect I must say that there is from time to time a tendency manifested on their part to try to exercise powers which the Constitution has not conferred upon us. When I was speaking in favour of Federation before my constituents in Tasmania, I told them that in everything which was not handed over to the Commonwealth the sovereignty of the States would be preserved. When I see this disposition to assume powers not given to us by the Constitution - as, for instance, when it is proposed by the Labour Party to impose a land tax in order to break up large estates- </para>

                            <para>- The Bill has been drafted by a very astute lawyer, and it seems to me, speaking as a layman, that he has tried to get outside the boundaries of the Constitution in an indirect manner. I totally disapprove of, and shall vote against, any such proposal. When we are dealing with Bills of this character, and representations are made to us by bodies such as Chambers of Commerce, or associations or merchants, we are, I am afraid, apt to treat them very lightly. </para>

We should not assume that every man in trade, every importer, every merchant, belongs to a dishonest class, if indeed he is not personally dishonest. We should listen with the greatest respect when men of known integrity, whose characters are above reproach, meet as members of Chambers of Commerce, and make representations to us. I have tried to obtain the opinion of one or two business men regarding this Bill, and wish to read a short extract from a letter from one of the largest warehousemen in this city - a man whose record is absolutely above reproach, a law-abiding, good specimen of the British merchant.

                        <para>In order to understand the effect of this Bill, two of its terms need to be clearly defined without any vagueness or ambiguity, namely, the words "restraint of trade" and "detriment of the public." If it is to the detriment of the public to pay a higher price than could otherwise be charged, then this Bill, by destroying competition, compels traders to trade to the detriment of the public. We are on the one hand compelled to have regard to the interests of the buying public, but in doing so, any common agreement between two or more separate traders to sell at such a price as will give reasonable remuneration to all concerned in the production and distribution of the goods, becomes an indictable offence under the Bill. </para>

                            <para>- I do not intend to deal fully just now with many matters which can be more properly discussed in Committee. I should like, however, to say a few words on the question of dumping. First, I desire to know whether it is intended to apply the restrictions laid down in the Bill to all varieties of imports, or whether certain imports are to be selected, and, if so, on what principle the selection will be made? There seems to be some difference of opinion as to what constitutes dumping. According to the Bill, the importation of any goods which have been bought at a price under the cost of manufacture is to constitute dumping.'' Apparently, it does not matter under what circumstances such materials or goods are bought - if they are bought at a price which is under the cost of manufacture, their importation will constitute dumping. The Bill provides that the competition shall be unfair - </para>

                    <para>If that provision is given effect to it will practically stop the importation of a vast quantity of goods which it is very desirable that we should have. I have the strongest objection to Ministers informing us, either in Parliament or by means of some publication, that Bills we pass are not going to be administered in a certain way. Here, for instance, is a statement, published by the authority of the present Minister of ' Trade and Customs, relating to the Commerce Act - </para>

                        <para>With reference to paragraph 3 above, and similar paragraphs in other sections, it may be observed that it is always the practice of the Department to take a lenient view of any case, and that the Minister would not sanction any attempt to unduly enforce the law to the disadvantage or loss of innocent importers. The surrounding circumstances will always be taken into consideration, and only such evidence will be required as to want of knowledge or intent as should satisfy any reasonable man. It is hoped that it will seldom be found necessary to enforce forfeiture or to prosecute for fine. </para>

                            <para>- It is quite imaginable that a certain <inline font-weight="bold">Mr,. McKay,</inline> who is a maker of harvesters, might become a politician, and hold the office of Minister of Trade and Customs, and he might be found to possess very strong views with regard to the importation of certain goods. We know that in business it is the practice, at the end of the season in the old country, to clear out large stocks of goods at low prices. Our season and that of Europe fit in so nicely one with the other that we here are able to make use of stocks which otherwise might prove of great disadvantage to manufacturers, merchants, and tradesmen at home. This is particularly the case in regard to fashionable goods, prepared, it may be, for a summer which turns out to be of a severe nature, or goods may have been manufactured for a certain fashion which has not caught on." This presents an opportunity, which is very properly taken advantage of by business men, bearing in view the fact that the fashions in Europe are the basis of our fashions in Australia. </para>

                            <para>- It will be a long time before Australia gets ahead of Europe in the matter of fashions; as a matter of fact, even the fashions in the United States are entirely based on those of Europe. Such goods as I have indicated are sometimes bought in very large quantities, and at very low cost, at the end of a season, and one purchaser may be more lucky than another in securing a considerable stock. Under the Bill, however, a lucky buyer of the kind would, on importing the goods to Australia, be liable to have a complaint made against him under the Bill, on the ground that he had purchased the goods at a price greatly below their ordinary cost of production, or below the market price in the country of origin. In some cases, the market price may be 100 per cent., or even 150 per cent., higher than that paid by the representative of the importer; but under the Bill the goods could not be sent to Australia without the risk of punishment at the instance of dissatisfied competitors. </para>

                            <para>- And so they will be considered. The manufacturers themselves are often importers too, and introduce goods to copy the patterns and fashions, and sometimes, under the circumstances, they find it better to bring them in and sell them. On the question of intent, the lawyers have taken opposite views. To me, there is no doubt that " unfair competition " has, in all cases, reference to an Australian industry, the preservation of which may be deemed to be advantageous to the Commonwealth; and in the clause I have already read, we are told that competition shall be deemed to be unfair if the imported goods have been purchased at a price below the ordinary cost of production, and so forth. </para>

                            <para>- If a man has been fortunate enough to buy at a low price a large stock of jackets or mantles in the old country; and he imports them to Australia, will he not be guilty of unfair competition with intent, in the event of his being able to compete successfully against other traders in Australia? Surely, if a man is proved guilty of unfair competition, it will be assumed that he had the intent to unfairly compete. </para>

                            <para>- That is a point on which the Minister, I Rave no doubt, will presently have to render an account. I intend to vote against the Bill, for the reasons I have indicated. We have already placed very heavy obligations on importers, who have to instruct their Home buyers to describe a large amount, of the goods sent out. If the buyer at Home desires to know what sort of description he shall send, the importer is not able to tell him; it is an absolute truth that the importer cannot inform his buyer or agent what he is expected to describe, or how he is to describe it. </para>

                        <para>- I regret that I have not been able to attend and listen to the speakers who have preceded me; but I can say that I have carefully read most of the speeches. I twice read the speech of the Minister of Defence in introducing the Bill, believing that he, at all events, would do his best to place clearly before honorable senators the object of the proposed legislation. I confess, however, that I got no satisfaction from the speech of the honorable gentleman; I got no knowledge from his utterances as to the reason why this Bill has been introduced. I regard this as one of the most important measures ever submitted to the Senate, because it introduces a new principle into Australian business, as that business has been conducted for the last 100 years. I had thought that a measure of such far-reaching consequences, and involving so great a departure from commercial practice, would have had very strong reasons behind it ; but I find no reasons beyond the action of some American or Canadian agricultural implement importers. This afternoon we have had an explanation from the Minister, by way of interjection - an explanation which, I am sure, will be read with surprise throughout Australia - to the effect that this Bill has been introduced in the belief that it will prevent future attempts at the nationalization of industries. </para>

                            <para>- The real reason for the introduction of the Bill was that the Minister of Trade and Customs had poured into his ear, by a local manufacturer of agricultural implements, a tale of woe. I venture to say that the statements which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> made to the Minister of Trade and Customs, and which I believe were the principal cause of the introduction of the Bill, were absolutely untrue, and absolutely deceitful. My leader, in the course of this debate, said that he believed that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> only did what other people would have done; but I can scarcely think that is the construction which he would like to have placed upon his words. In my opinion, the manufacturers of Australia are above doing what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> did. Whether free-traders or protectionists, they will fight as hard as they can in the interests of their own particular business and of the Commonwealth; but they will not "hit below the belt." When the Minister found' out that he had been deceived by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> he should have done justice to business men who, far away from Australia, had had their characters impeached. I believe that the Minister of Defence said here that Massey Harris and Company should have every opportunity afforded to them to defend the position which they have taken up. </para>

                            <para>- I apologize to the honorable senator, who, I understood, had made that statement. At all events, the Minister of Trade and Customs, who introduced the Bill into the other House, made that statement, but to this day he has not given the company a chance of vindicating its character or justifying its statements. When the company took the matter to a Court, he pleaded a technical point that as Minister of Trade and' Customs he could do just as he liked. But I am very glad to say that the point was overruled. If a firm were to do in its business capacity what 'that Minister has done in connexion with the Massey-Harris Company, I venture to say that . <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> would use very strong language indeed, in regard to the firm which had caused all the hubbub', which by its action was seeking to change the conditions of trade and commerce in Australia, and, so far as it could, attempting to stop the importation of other manufactures by getting placed upon the Tariff a duty which would be absolutely prohibitive. </para>

                            <para>- From beginning to end the Bill is really a prohibitive Tariff. Although the Minister of Trade and Customs knew that a report from the Tariff Commission - a body composed of expert, able men, who have done credit to themselves and to the Commonwealth - would be forthcoming in the course of a week or two, still he went behind its back and brought in this Bill. I cannot understand the reason which actuated Ministers in taking that course, unless they wish to use it as a propaganda, cry, this being, in my opinion, one of the worst symptoms which have been developed in Australian industrial and commercial life. I allude to the cry of " Australia for the Australians." </para>

                            <para>- I am only pointing out that forty years ago the condition of America was practically as bad as it is to-day. We all know that the Tammany Ring in New York is the most unblushing and corrupt municipal body on the face of the earth. We know that even in saintly Boston and in San Francisco there has been municipal corruption. We are also aware that in some cases the State Legislature lias been anything but what we should expect a State Parliament in Australia to be. The fact that legislation has been enacted in America to meet such cases affords no reason why we should copy the example "there set. Are there in Australia any industries which, administer their affairs in such a way as is done in America? Can the Minister cite any law which has been enacted in England or any other country because in America, maladministration has taken place? We Rave known Justices who have not conducted* them-selves as they ought to have done, but that does not justify the enactment of a special law. Let us consider what extensive powers are given to Railway Commissioners by the States. The Commissioners " may " misuse their powers, but the Government and the Parliament trust them. So it is in regard to our Judiciary. There is no sign that we in Australia are influenced by the bad traditions of America. I desire to make a short reference to the results of the Tobacco Monopoly Commission, on which I sat. In the first place, I wish to express my great pleasure at the manner in which its <inline font-weight="bold">chairman, Senator Pearce,</inline> conducted the inquiry. He acted not only with ability, but with an impartiality which I hope will be imitated by the chairman of every other Commission. Now, so far from the Tobacco Monopoly Commission eliciting any evidence of maladministration, I venture to assert that there are few large business undertakings which could have gone so successfully through such an ordeal as the British Australasian Tobacco Company did. The evidence given on its behalf showed the existence of a healthy business spirit. So far as that combine is concerned, there is not an atom; of evidence which can be quoted as a reason why this measure should be brought forward. It was the duty of the Minister, if it existed, to submit evidence of maladministration by large business interests in Australia, to justify the necessity for such legislation as is proposed. </para>

                            <para>- I confess that I have not had time to go through the evidence in connexion with the shipping ring. This afternoon the honorable senator has made statements pointing out that there is a combine, and that in certain directions, perhaps, it has acted unfairly. But I, as a business mam, have not heard of any large amount of injury which is being, done to any of the trading interests in Australia. I have not heard a complaint that the combine has conducted its operations to the injury of the public generally, or to the discomfort of passengers. The absence of a complaint of that kind must, I think, be taken as an indication that it is conducting its business in a legitimate and healthy manner. I admit that, as a matter of fact, it has the power to do a large amount of injury ; but that remark might be made in respect of all combines. The shipping combine is purely a business concern, managed by experienced men, and carried on for a profit ; and the managers know perfectly well that if they were to exceed the limit of commercial "fair play their action would recoil upon the combine itself. In the same way, the British Australasian. Tobacco Combine knew very well that if they were to conduct their business in a manner which would be detrimental to the public, that if they were to use their powers in order to squeeze the consumers, the people, through their representatives, would let the fact become known, and that there would then be just ground for the Parliament taking, action with a view to regulate the tobacco industry. I cannot understand the argument of some persons that combines and trusts, because they are such, must be going to do something which is unjust. It has been proved up to the hilt that in America, trusts which have been administered with business knowledge have been merely combinations of firms to buy in the cheapest market with the largest amount of capital, and thus be able to sell goods at less than the ordinary business man can. Those trusts which have been conducted on equitable lines in America have been successful, and very nearly every trust in America which has used its powers for the purpose of squeezing the public has gone to the wall. </para>

                            <para>- I wrote a letter to a gentleman who is one of the largest merchants and manufacturers in the United Kingdom, and who has written a pamphlet on that very point. Unfortunately, I have mislaid my copy of the pamphlet, in which he gives details of every trust of any size in America, and shows the absolute truth of my statement. I do not say that there are not trusts now which are using their power to the injury of the public. But I submit that, where there is one trust of that kind which has been successful, there are a dozen trusts of the other kind which have been successful, and that is only in accordance with natural law. In Australia, with its small population, business men in combines or trusts would be absolutely foolish to misuse their powers in regard to the public with a full knowledge of what the effect upon themselves would inevitably be. There is not a scintilla of evidence to show that such a Bill as this is necessary in Australia ; not an instance has been quoted of any trust misusing its powers here. </para>

                            <para>- My objection to it is that it would revolutionise the commerce of Australia. There has been no demand either from working men or from the: commercial classes for such a measure, and there is no reason for making an entirely new departure in regard to our business relations. The Bill cannot in any way promote the development of Australia from a commercial point of view. The cry "Australia for the Australians " - like the cry " China for the Chinese," or " Fiji for the Fijians " - is one that, in my view, absolutely takes us back to the old days of barbarism. Let us notice how our policy is regarded in Japan. A Victorian gentleman who has just returned from the East gives the following testimony : - </para>

                            believes that Japan is straining the cord of alliance with Great Britain almost to breaking point, but adds that the Japanese assert that there is no menace to Australia, as the alliance has been consummated. Speaking of trade, he says Australian produce is practically unknown in Japan; further, that the feeling is so intense against Australian exports that they are condemned because labelled Australian.

                    <para class="block">That is one of the results of the cry " Australia for the Australians."Cannot honorable senators realize that Australia, with its enormous possibilities, and its vast area, should aspire to be a great export manufacturing country ? How can we achieve that end when we raise barriers to prevent the nations of the earth from importing their goods? Do honorable senators suppose that the Japanese, the Chinese, and other people are fools? </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator does not know the A, B, C of business if he makes a statement of that kind. Is he not aware that a very large portion of the wool grown in Australia is sold in France and Germany ? Does he not know that the price of our wool is largely maintained by French buyers ? Does he not know that there are subsidized French steamers that take away our goods, and pay us a good price for them? There is, however, one good feature of this Bill, and that is that if it is passed it will, I believe, lead to the break up of the caucus. That is my frank opinion. The Bill will chiefly benefit manufacturers in New South Wales and Victoria, because they are the two principal manufacturing States. Speaking as a representative of New South Wales, I say that the vast majority of the people of that State do not want the Bill. </para>

                            <para>- They have hitherto conducted their business in accordance with principles which they have inherited from the mother country. They are ,satisfied with those principles. They believe that <inline font-style="italic">freedom</inline> of exchange between our commodities and the commodities of other countries is beneficial for the people as a whole. Victoria, however, does want the Bill. But what about the smaller States? What will be- the position of Tasmania, Western Australia, Queensland, and South Australia? The Bill, if it does anything, will absolutely encourage trusts and combines, and will increase the price of goods to every man, woman, and child in the Commonwealth. Suppose a manufacturer in England pays his men 30s. a week, whilst a manufacturer in a similar line of business in Victoria pays his men 40s. Under this Bill the English manufacturer will be shut out, because it will be said he interferes with labour in Victoria. But if his goods are excluded the effect will be to black-mail the people of the smaller States. Under present conditions they can buy their goods at certain prices. The Bill says that they shall not buy goods made abroad, because they interfere with Victorian industries. But if those goods are excluded the first effect will be to interfere with the flow of imports and exports. If the effect is to lessen imports it will increase freights to the producers of butter and other commodities, because vessels will not come here empty and take away our goods at the same rates as they now receive. Consequently, the Bill will be most injurious to the producers of the smaller States. Take another point. Is there a man who does not know-, the pleasure that a woman finds in making a cheap bargain at a shop? There are hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of goods coming into Australia that are simply the surplus stocks of European manufacturers. They are imported for the express purpose of being cheaply sold in Australia. Suppose there is a manufacturer in Melbourne who employs thirty or forty hands, and pays them 40s. a week; and suppose there is a manufacturer of similar goods in England who pays 30s. a week - though it' may be remarked that 30s. a week in England will probably go as far as 40s. here. This Bill would stop the importation of those goods, because the one manufacturer in Victoria might say that his business was injured by them. Is it likely that the importer would take the risk of importing goods under such circumstances? </para>

                            <para>- I never said it would have no effect. The tenor of my speech has been that the effect of the Bill upon trade will be simply revolutionary. That is what I have said from the commencement. The Minister does not realize what this Bill will mean if it is carried in its present form. He does not realize that it must tend to develop and consolidate trusts and combines. There appears, to be a general want of knowledge as to the great importance of pools and rings in the industry of any country. There are rings and pools in Australia to-day. There have been for fifty years past, and I hope there will be in the future. They often do harm. They often use the power which they possess to squeeze the public. We had an illustration of that during the drought, when the Sussex-street importers of Sydney imported grain from abroad, and raised the price to the poor squatter 150 per cent. </para>

                            <para>- Whatever the cause may have been, in my opinion, the ring did a verv cruel and tyrannical thing, as rings often do. But it must not be imagined that production and commerce could be successfully carried on without rings or middlemen. I often hear middlemen traduced, but they have their uses. Business would be reduced to a state of chaos if it were not for them. Take any branch of business honorable senators choose. Four or five middlemen in Sussex-street combine. They have knowledge that there is going to be a scarcity in a certain article in Europe. Say that they buy maize, giving the producer his own price for it. Afterwards perhaps the maize which they have bought for 2S. 6d. runs up to 3s., an3 the seller thinks that he has been "had." The fact of the matter is, however, that if the producers were left to themselves, and there were no middlemen, the probability is that their goods would not realize, on the whole, nearly so much as they get for it. </para>

                            <para>- I am speaking from knowledge. The agents or middlemen correspond with the producers, who are their customers, telling them that they must not send their goods to market except at a certain time, because if they do the effect will be to produce such a glut in the market that their commodities will be absolutely thrown away. If they are perishable goods they will be destroyed. These middlemen almost every day advise their clients as to whether they should send their goods to market or not. They have a knowledge of the capabilities of the market not only in this country, but in Europe, and' they know when they will be able to secure a price that will satisfy the producer. I quite sympathize with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson's</inline> view, but probably he does not realize the actual state of affairs. If he were a producer - an agriculturist or a dairyman for instance - he would see the full force of sending his goods to an agent who had a full knowledge of market conditions, and who would be able to dispose of his produce to the best advantage. </para>

                            <para>- We could do nothing except what is done at the present time unless industries were nationalized. Of course, if we nationalized all industries the Government would have to d'o exactly what the middleman does now. There would be a central depot, which would obtain knowledge as to the conditions of the market, and advise the producers when to send in their, goods, so that the Government might sell at the best price. Some time ago there was, I think, a great ring in Western Australia which regulated the price of cattle. In that case I am not sure that the effect was beneficial, because I believe the proceedings were often carried beyond the limits of fair play, and the public sometimes had to pay dearly. I cannot indorse the proposal to confer on a Judge the powers proposed by the Bill. </para>

                    <para class="block">I recognise the probity of our Judiciary ; and I am sure that the Judge appointed would perform the duty of sifting the evidence before him to the best of his ability. In my opinion, however, the questions involved are purely those of business, with which Judges and lawyers generally are not usually very conversant,., beyond such knowledge as is picked up bv them in the course of their professional work. My suggestion is that before the Bill is passed, or immediately afterwards, the Inter-State Commission should be appointed, ^ and have thrown upon it the responsibility which the Bill seeks to impose on a Judge. This, I believe, would tend to a more equitable administration ofl the Bill, and avoid placing a Judge in a most unfair position. I cannot approve of a measure of this kind being introduced and passed without having, in a more direct way, been submitted for the approval of the public at large. The questions we are dealing with are essentially of a fiscal nature, and could more properly be discussed when the Tariff was before us. Indeed, I regard the introduction of the Bill as somewhat of an insult to the public. We are now at what is practically the fag end of the session, and the public have not been afforded an opportunity to say a single word in regard to it; there is no evidence, as I said before, that the people, as a whole, approve of a measure of. the character. I am certain that if a referendum were taken, both protectionists and free-traders would resent this interference with their constitutional rights, and with their natural liberty to purchase goods from other countries, especially England, under perfectly healthy and natural conditions. If Australia ever becomes a manufacturing country, we shall doubtless produce surplus stocks; and I am sure .we should regard it as very unjust if the mother country were to pass a similar law with the object of preventing the export of those stocks to her shores. About twelve months ago, in one of the best articles T ever read on this subject, it was shown that dumping, instead of being an injury, is absolutely an immense benefit to the manufacturers of England, because these, goods are purchased at a low figure, and re-exported to the country of origin at a large profit. Dumping under normal conditions is essential to trade, though I grant there might be exceptional conditions under which it would not be desirable. I can- not, for one moment, imagine any manufacturer, on personal grounds, setting to work to ruin an Australian industry ; but the Bill seems to contemplate such a state of affairs. Under any circumstances, I cannot believe that any manufacturer in England would seek to ruin a manufacturer in this country. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> was perfectly right when, in the course of his able speech, he showed the utter hypocrisy of the whole measure as exemplified in clauses 4 and 5. That honorable senator made it clear that the ulterior object of the Bill is prohibition, in order that certain industries in Australia may reap the advantage. I believe that' the people of Australia would not indorse the Bill if it were placed before them; and we have no right to pass a measure of the kind at this period of the session. I hope that the Minister will either withdraw it, or permit amendments to be made so that it may prove of some good, while not unduly interfering with the trade and commerce cf the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>. - It is my intention to deal with several matters when we reach the Committee stage, and at present I shall confine myself to only one or two aspects of the Bill. It has been argued that this is a. Bill to prevent unfair competition; and in this connexion I may quote a circular which came into my possession yesterday. It is from an Adelaide firm representing the Colonial Oil Company, and is as follows: - </para>

                        <para>We beg to advise you that the Colonial Oil Company have decided to continue the rebate to retailers, and rebate will be paid accordingly on your purchases of American " White Rose " kerosene during the six months ending 31st December, 1906, and following six-monthly periods until further notice, provided you sign a declaration form stating that you have neither bought nor sold any other than American " White Rose " kerosene during each six-monthly period. As it is just possible you may have purchased kerosene other than " White Rose " since 30th June last, we beg to say that this will not disqualify you from claiming rebate on your purchases during the present six-monthly period, provided you do not continue to purchase any other kerosene after receiving this notification that the rebate to retailers is to be continued. </para>

                    <para class="block">When this Bill was introduced the Colonial Oil Company apparently imagined that they would be brought under its provisions, and thereupon notice was given to customers that the rebates would be discontinued. During the discussion of the measure, however, the Colonial Oil Company appear to have altered their opinion, and, coming to the conclusion that the Bill will not affect them, they have boldly issued the circular which I have read. </para>

The purchase of "Royal Daylight" kerosene, or any other oils of which the Colonial Oil Company are the sole importers, does not invalidate your claim for rebate on American "White Rose" kerosene. </para>

                        <para>For some time past there has been considerable competition in Australia between the respective trading companies in kerosene, with the result that one company has adopted the principle of granting a conditional special rebate per gallon to customers who deal exclusively in their brands of kerosene. We would respectfully ask your support in suppressing the rebate system by introducing into the present Anti-Trust Bill a clause to prevent any company attempting to monopolize the trade by the granting of conditional rebates. We feel sure that practically every dealer in kerosene would prefer to have an open market, and would welcome an Act to suppress the granting of conditional rebates, which are detrimental to both retailers and consumers. We take this opportunity of enclosing a copy of the circular issued, and which we think speaks for itself. </para>

                            <para>- I am not prepared to do that. The only position I take up is that in the oil trade there are these special rebates ; and the same practice is carried on iri the other large manufacturing industries throughout Australia. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company, I believe. adopt exactly the same principle, with the result - I do not grumble at it - that it has virtually shut Mauritius sugar out of the Australian market. </para>

                            <para>- I shall deal with that point presently. What I desire to show now is the exact position in regard to freights or. the Australian coast. I have gone to some trouble to obtain figures, which were received in answer to advertisements inserted in the English newspapers, calling for tenders to carry the principal products of Australia along the British coasts. Although in Australia double or treble the rates of wages have to be paid, and the cost of all necessaries is relatively higher, the shipping combination in Australia is charging less freight, mile for mile, than is charged on the British coasts. I do not think that any honorable senator would attempt to compare ocean carriage with coastal carriage. In the case of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company there is protection against the outside world, and yet rebates are given. But in the case of the shipping industry, in which a large amount of capital is invested, and which is most important to Australia, affording, as it does, employment, directly and indirectly, to a large number of men, there is absolutely no protection - no subsidies, no bounties, or assistance in any way from any State. </para>

I do not say that the Shipping Federation has been ' compelled by law to take this step, but, if it did not, the Governor-General would have power to compel it to register. At any rate, the federation has become an association for the purpose of fighting labour. </para>

                            <para>- When a question is put, the Minister in charge of the Bill ought to be prepared to give a reply, especially when it comes from a supporter. The Oil Company is a corporation which has its head-quarters outside the Commonwealth, and with which, therefore, we cannot deal. It ships its oil to an agent in each State, who transacts all the business with the retailer, and the whole transaction takes place within the boundaries of that State. Can the provisions of the Bill reach the people within a State who are not transacting business outside its limits ? Or will it be an infringement upon State rights ? </para>

                            <para>- :Each company in the federation has, I believe, a distinct and separate existence, with its own offices, officers, and capital. That is why I used the term " loose federation.." There can be no doubt that it is a combine. I have had some connexion with the combine in relation to wages and working conditions. Prior to its formation each one of the six companies forming the combination was enjoying free competition, and trying to steal all the trade it possibly could from the others. Literally they were cutting one another's throats by competing against each other. Two or three boats would be leaving a port on the same day, and each would take about a third of a cargo, and at a rate of freight which did not pay the owners for the cost of handling it. If the boat of another company came into port three or four days later, when no boats were leaving, up would go the rate of freight to considerably higher than it is to-day. Unnecessary tonnage was run ; ships made trips with nothing like a fair loading; and wages fell by one stroke 30 per cent. </para>

When he was before the Navigation Commission, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Glassford,</inline> who is one of the leading produce merchants in Melbourne, and who spoke not only for himself, but for a majority of the produce shippers in Victoria, said that they hailed with satisfaction the formation of the combine, because they knew exactly now when boats would sail, what the freights would be, and that every one .would be on a level footing in that respect. </para>

Brown have been running steamers independent of the monopoly, and, I believe, are doing a very good business, too. Let me now compare the freights from London to Aberdeen, a distance of 430 miles, with the freights between Sydney and Melbourne, a distance of 576 miles. Flour is carried from London to Aberdeen in small lots at 12s. 6d. per ton, and from Sydney to Melbourne at 7 s. 6d. a ton, with 20 per cent rebate. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. It is difficult to get on the English coast line such distances as we have in Australia. I have therefore been obliged to stretch out a little, and take Norway and Sweden into the calculation in order to secure a comparison. From London to Christiana the distance is 656 miles. I compare that voyage with the distance from Adelaide to Melbourne, 504 miles - or 152 miles less. From London to Christiana flour in large parcels is carried at 7s. 6d. a ton; flour, irrespective of quantity, is carried from Melbourne to Adelaide at 7s. 6d. per ton, less 20 per cent. </para>

                            <para>- Horses are carried from London to Christiana for 63s. each ; they are carried from Adelaide to Melbourne for 35s. Fodder goes from London to Christiana for 10s. a ton ; it is carried from Adelaide to Melbourne for 10s. a ton. That is the only instance where freights are equal1 in this comparison. Drapery, cotton and woollen goods are carried from London to Christiana for 13s. 4d. per ton, plus 15 per cent. ; they are carried from Adelaide to Melbourne for 10s. a ton. There is no rebate in that case. Next, I wish to get a distance to compare with that between Adelaide and Fremantle. The distance from London to Belfast is 712 miles; from Adelaide to Fremantle it is 1,380 miles - nearly double the distance. It must be remembered at the same time that there is back loading from Belfast to London, whereas there is comparatively little from Fremantle to Adelaide. Drapery is carried from London to Belfast for 41s. iod. per ton ; from Adelaide to Fremantle for 20s. per ton, or nearly 22s. per ton less for double the distance. </para>

                            <para>- Any quantity of goods are taken from Melbourne and Adelaide to Western Australia. Oilmen's stores are taken from London to Stockholm, 1,127 miles, for 20s. a ton; they are carried from Adelaide to Fremantle, 1,380 miles, for 20s. a ton, less 10 per cent, rebate. Fodder is carried from London to Stockholm for 29s. a ton; from Adelaide to Fremantle for 10s. a .ton, less 10 per cent, rebate. Unfortunately, I have left in my bag some figures which I intended to quote in regard to passenger fares on the English coast, and on the Australian coast. I shall quote them in Committee. I may, however, say this - that a better class of boats than are employed on the Australian coast is not to be found in any part of the world. In respect of accommodation, attendance, and catering the vessels on our coast are equal to any that I know of in any coasting trade in any part of the world, and the fares will compare favorably with those charged elsewhere. I had prepared these figures for another purpose, but I thought it just as well to give the Senate the benefit of them now. With regard to the Bill itself, I say frankly that I do not like it. But it has been stated that under our Constitution we have no power to nationalize monopolies. The very fact that an honorable senator has introduced a Bill for the purpose of enabling a referendum to be taken on that subject affords proof that in' the opinion of others, as well as myself, we have not that constitutional power at present. My opinion is, therefore, that it would be as well to adopt this as a tentative measure. I think there are brains enough in Australia, without going to America, to devise means to cope with our own situation. However, in my opinion, the true remedy for any monopoly that may spring up is nationalization. I wish to refer to one other matter before concluding. During the debate, a considerable amount of discussion has taken place regarding the boot industry. A desire has been ex -' pressed that a document quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> should be laid upon the table of the Senate. Inquiries have been made as to how that desire could be met, and I hope, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> that you will excuse me for re-reading the declaration quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> in order that any honorable senator who chooses may afterwards move that it be printed. It will then be in the possession of the Senate. I also intend to read some other declarations bearing upon the same question, and which also can be laid upon the table. The declaration quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> was as follows: - </para>

Amongst the documents was a receipt for £80. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford,</inline> however, knew no more whether that <inline font-style="italic">£80</inline> was paid by Marshall than I know. I wish to point out that at the time Marshall's place was burnt there were in the factory, belonging to the United Shoe Machinery Company, two Goodyear welding machines, two stitching machines, two Ideal lasting machines, and one Copeland lasting machine; and for the installation of each of those machines in his factory <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Marshall</inline> had to pay at least <inline font-style="italic">£50.</inline> These machines after the fire were in fairly good order. They could have been repaired cheaply and sold for a considerable amount of money ; but the company absolutely refused to allow <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Marshall</inline> to deal with them. The company took possession ; and the <inline font-style="italic">£80</inline> received was in respect of other machinery, and not in respect of the machinery in dispute. </para>

                        <para>. - If the importance of the measure we are now discussing is to be measured by the length of the debate, and, I think, I would be right in saying, by the high quality of the debate, then, undoubtedly, it is of vastly greater moment than one would be led to suppose, judging from the numerous honorable senators who have so coldly turned their backs upon it. I am not one to run bald-headed against what are known as trusts and combinations. I am not going to characterize them as infamous, or as1 practically a menace to our existence. In fact, I have rather a kindly regard for trusts, being inclined to look upon them as creatures of the very circumstances under which we live as a' natural, product of our times. Trusts appear to me to be just the very result that we might expect from the advance of the evolutionary - process in industrial life. If we look back, it seems a great number of years since the small things in industrial life were, left behind. Although only a few years have gone by since trusts came into existence, it seems almost centuries since manufactures were carried on in small factories by individual employers, and under conditions which are entirely dissimilar from those prevailing in our industries to-day. It is of no use to dream that we are going to bring back the little man. Like Julius Caesar, he is gone and will stop where he is. The trusts and combinations have come, not to take the place of the man who has gone, but because the advance of the evolutionary process in our industrial life have given them scope and life. If it were possible by legislation to annul the power of the trusts, that would at once kill the entire influence and mighty operation of combinations, and by one fell stroke advance the civilization in which we live. I am inclined to disbelieve any such thing. The combination of capital was essential to the conditions of the day when it combined. Industry was calling forth efforts greater than had hitherto been put forward. Industry was crying out to be handled by scientific methods which had never yet been applied. A product was required to be put on the market at the most economic cost at which it could be done. Would any man dream for a moment that the small boot factory of one man and a boy in those times could carry on the industry in the same way as does the boot factory to-day with probably 2,000 men and half as many boys ? Of course, I am not speaking of boot factories, in Australia, because they have not yet attained to that stage when they employ such a large number of men. I am speaking of boot factories which, to my knowledge, employ that number of hands. Can we imagine for a moment that one factory with- a man and a boy would be able, to carry on the boot industry as economically and successfully as ai factory in which are employed the grandest machines that brains and money have been able, to devise, and to continue to satisfy all the demands of the market? We, of course, do not incline for a moment to any such belief. I hold that trusts have - as I fully anticipated - worked in a way that has been of infinite service to a good few millions of people. The establishment of trusts and combinations has proved that the man on whose behalf <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> made so eloquent an appeal this afternoon is, after all, not an essential element in this or any other community ; that he is an incubus on any community ; and that there is no room for the calling in which 'he is engaged. Trusts have shown that the middleman, too, can easily be dispensed with. They have also shown that a greater factor is operating side by side with, themselves, but upon an entirely scientific and unquestionably honest basis, not endeavouring to meet the trusts, not following the example of the Oil Trust, to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has referred, but working its way quietly amongst the people of the civilized world - as it has been doing for the past sixty years - and spreading so very widely that ultimately it will swallow the trusts. The trusts will have their bridges to burn, and both they and the bridges will undoubtedly go before the great economic force that is working such a complete revolution in the commercial and manufacturing history of England, and in the productive and manufacturing countries of Germany and Belgium, and which is also achieving such wonderful results in the agricultural and pastoral pursuits of Holland. I refer to the great movement known as the co-operative movement. Side by side with the trusts has grown up the great factor that is leading to the solution of the problem which we are trying to solve, and with which I think we are dealing in altogether a wrong way. I believe that there is only one way of stopping such a trust, as for instance, the shipping trust. Of course, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> who is a very staunch, advocate of the shipping combine, does not believe that we can ever suffer any wrong at its hands. I am not going to accuse the combine of having inflicted any wrong upon us. I am only submitting that, as it is a trust or combine, one day it may possess a power, and by the exercise of that power inflict upon us a very serious injury, and that even with this legislation at our back, we should be quite impotent to deal with it. If, however, we laid down a basis for the nationalization of combinations and trusts which might operate in restraint of trade and to the public detriment, then we should be taking the step which inevitably we should have to take in the end. </para>

I do not think that they could have conceived of a grander method by which to retard the process of nationalization. It can only be retarded, because its advent cannot be prevented by either this or any other Government. It would be just as sensible to set ourselves the task of preventing trusts and combinations from coming. Where is there a man with a knowledge of commerce or industry to-day who would regard the stamping out of trusts and combinations as possible? </para>

                            <para>- Certainly not. How would it be possible to protect the wages of a worker against the operations of a combination, which may do practically anything it likes? It is a large combination, but immediately it sets its foot upon Australian soil it waters its stock. The worker has to pay for <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> watering of the stock, and what could the Government, even with the provisions of this measure, do? They could no more call for an honest deal between the trust and the worker than I could. The man who watches matters closely and takes notice of industry and commercial life must see very clearly that trusts are merely the things we might have looked for.

The attempt to get a fair deal for the consuming public from the company was futile. On coming into office as Attorney-General of Missouri, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hadley</inline> - a young, but undoubtedly very smart man - -began to look up the legislation of the State, and at last he found that it possessed a law which was powerful enough to grapple with the evil with which the Federal law was utterly impotent to deal. He moved the Court, and got an injunction. He tackled this great company - consisting of three parts and known under three names. He put the company into such a position that the president of the central board of directors went so far as to deny its existence, as to tell <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hadley</inline> on oath that he did not know where the office of the company was. The Attorney-General of Missouri, however, was not prepared to be baulked by an answer of that kind. He returned to the Court, and getting greater power, he compelled an answer to his question with the result that ever since that time Missouri has been able to deal with that great octopus, the Standard Oil Company. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> will look through the Bill, until he is half as old again as he is, I do no.t think he will ever see any prevision within its four corners which would enable the Commonwealth Government to deal with a concern which was operating strictly within the limits of one State. Therefore, if there is a possibility of any one of the States being injured by an operation of that character, then certainly the remedy for the injury will have to be provided by the State. </para>

                            <para>- I may be mistaken, but that is how,- as a layman, I read the provision in the Constitution. I have come to the conclusion that there are so many differences of opinion amongst the legal members of the Senate on legal questions that laymen do well to form their own opinions. The Bill, in my opinion, will be unable to accomplish what it sets out to do. I also think it would be a great pity if it did accomplish all that it purports to do. It is impossible that it can be of any service to the worker. When his interests are weighed in the balance, how infinitesimal they are as compared with the mighty power of the opposing forces ! If the worker is to get justice, we must adopt that great system to which I have previously referred - that system that is manufacturing and distributing goods in. England to the extent of about ^96,000,000 per annum; that system that is doing such excellent work amongst the farmers and pastoralists of Holland ; that system that is showing such excellent results in the German banking accounts ; that system that is working out so handsomely in Belgium - the system of cooperation. That is the only system that -will give the worker his due; and when he gets his due, he will not be receiving about 10 per cent, of what he produces, but at least 90 per cent., and the extra ten will go to pay " the other fellow " who is doing the distributing. I shall vote for the second reading. </para>

                        <para>. - I have no desire to prolong a debate which, it appears to me, has already been protracted to a wearisome .length. Many long speeches have- been made both for and against the measure. While there mav be some reasons for them on the part of honorable senators who think that, this is a bad' measure, there is no reason why those who, like myself, wish t'o see it taken into Committee, should delay the proceedings. Possibly, if honorable senators who have indicated their intention of voting for the second reading had done so without giving such lengthy reasons, the Bill would have been law by this time, and the Senate would have been enabled to proceed with other possibly more important business. I do not wish it to be imagined that I am attempting in any way to lecture those who have made long speeches. Possibly, they may have acted from a strong sense of duty. But it occurs to me that a great deal of time is wasted in debating the second reading of a measure, nearly the whole of which has to be gone over again in Committee. A number of combines have been referred to as existing in Australia, and it has been said that this Bill will affect them. One combine has not been mentioned which, in my opinion, is doing as much harm to the people of Australia as any that has been denounced. I refer to the combine which regulates the publishing of the news of the world in our newspapers. It has been referred to in connexion with another Bill. I am glad to notice that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has on the notice-paper an amendment which he will propose in Committee to deal with that combine. When it comes forward, I shall be prepared with evidence which, I- hope, will convince the Senate that it is a combine which should, if possible, be brought under the Bill. I intend to vote for the second reading, though I do not think that the expectations cf the warmest supporters of the measure will be realised. I believe that combines cannot be regulated by a Bill of this description. But until the majority of the electors of Australia can be shown that it is impossible to regulate combines, and prevent the evils that arise from them by such legislation as this, they will not be in a frame 'of mind to agree to the only certain remedy for monopoly, and that is the nationalization of all huge concerns such as the' combines which have been mentioned, and the working of them in the interests of the whole of the people of Australia. </para>

                        SYMON (South Australia) [9.16]. - Now that Ave have got into Committee on the Bill, I shall do all that I can to assist in removing what I think are ambiguities and difficulties from it. The more I examine the Bill, the more I adhere to the opinion which I expressed in the second-reading debate - that it is not deserving of encomiums either for its drafting, its grammar, or the scheme embodied in it. When we reach the clauses which appear to me to be susceptible of improvement, I shall indicate many respects in which they require attention, in order to give them even the appearance of being workable. It is about the most muddled measure I have seen for some time. First of all, I ask honorable senators to consider the title. It is desirable that we should have a title that signifies what the Bill is. The present title is,, most of us will admit, an absolute sham. The Bill is not intended to preserve Australian industries.
                    </para>
                    <para class="block">Surely the Government does not wish to give to the Bill a title which, is a mere electioneering placard. The title " AntiTrust Bill " would sufficiently define it. </para>

                        <para>.- The title "Anti-Trust" would be' more or less misleading. It would make it appear that the Bill was intended' to deal simply with trusts. As a matter of fact, Part III. deals with the prevention pf dumping, and that is an essentially valuable feature of the measure. Indeed, some honorable senators have gone so far as to suggest that it is the most valuable portion. We now have an expressive title which truthfully indicates the objects aimed at. We should adhere to it. It would be unwise for us to accept a title that would fail to explain comprehensively the purport of the Bill. </para>

                        <para>.- What we wish to secure is a title that will express as briefly and as fairly as possible the purpose of the measure. Although I do not pretend) to say that the present title - which I only wish could be made shorter - is the best that could be found, it certainly is the best that I have heard of up to the present to express the real object and meaning of the Bill. Suppose we used the words "anti-trust," we should have to put in .some other words such as "anti-dumping," and even then the whole object of the Bill would not be expressed. The measure does not exclusively deal with trusts but with individuals and with combinations of all sorts which are not trusts. The word " trusts " would not cover a great many of the matters dealt with. If we were only dealing with trusts, I could understand the suggestion, but we are dealing with monopolies which are not necessarily brought about by means of trusts - with monopolies created by 'means of combinations of various sorts, and, in addition, with monopolies which are created by individuals. </para>

If any honorable senator can suggest a better and more complete title, I shall consider it, but under the present circumstances I must oppose the amendment. </para>

                            <para>- I am quite certain that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> made use of the term " picturesque." Now it seems from his remarks that the same artistic idea is present, and he desires to have a picturesque placard in the forefront of this Bill. I quite agree with the Minister of Defence that the title should be expressive of what the Bill is supposed to contain. But there seems to be a feeling in the Chamber that the present title does not quite meet the case. I recognise the deficiency in the title suggested which does not completely describe the measure. Before I make any suggestion, I desire to point out that if honorable senators read the debate which has taken place, and also the criticisms and articles in the newspapers, they will find the Bill invariably referred to as the " Anti-Trust Bill." If we were to go to a man in the street, and ask him if he knew of the "Australian. Industries Preservation Bill," he would certainly think we were talking about the Tariff or bounties, whereas if we asked him if he knew the " Anti-Trust Bill " he would recognise it at once. </para>

                            <para>- I am not disputing the fact that some newspapers which support the honorable senator do so speak of the Capital Site; but I have no knowledge of those newspapers, and I do not want it. My suggestion is that if we desire to express readily, not merely to lawyers, but to ordinary citizens, what the Bill deals with, we ought to make the title the " Trusts and Dumping Act 1906." That certainly would convey at once the idea that this was a Bill dealing with trusts, and also with dumping. </para>

                            <para>- We are not now amending the order of leave, and neither are- we laying out the full scope of the Bill. All we are doing is to fix upon a short title, and the fact that we leave out one section does not affect the matter. We require a short title expressive of the main lines of the Bill. The first part deals with the regulation of trusts and monopolies, and we know that trusts are sometimes spoken of as monopolies, and <inline font-style="italic">vice versa,</inline> so that the word " anti-trust " would cover it. The second part deals with, not the prohibition, but the regulation, of dumping, and there again the title I suggest would cover the whole scope of the measure. I agree with those who' say that the present title is altogether a misnomer. The Bill does not affect a large number of industries, and it is very doubtful whether in actual operation it will tend to the preservation of Australian industries. On the other hand, I can quite conceive that, if used to its fullest extent, it might mean the ruin of certain Australian industries. The draftsman has not adopted the title generally used by writers on legislation of this class, and I trust the Government will see the error they have made and accept the amendment. </para>

                        <para>- - 1 intend to support the Government in adhering to the present title of the Bill. I do not think that the term "AntiTrust " would apply, for the simple reason that this is not an Anti-Trust Bill until a trust has become injurious, and has done something with intent to destroy or injure an Australian industry, the preservation of which is advantageous to the Commonwealth. The real purpose of the Bill is to- protect Australian industries, and that being the case, I think the present title is sufficiently expressive of the intention. </para>

                        <para>. - There is, I think, one title which would correctly describe every part of the. Bill, the whole of which has to do with the operations of trade. The Bill affirms that under certain circumstances the operations of trade shall be restricted, because, in consequence of rings or monopolies, there may be a danger of those operations being injurious to Australian industries. In regard to the dumping clauses, it is suggested that trade, if left free and unrestricted, might also be injurious, and, therefore, I suggest the title, " Trade Restriction." The whole object of the measure is, under certain circumstances, to restrict trade, and we cannot imagine any title which, would describe every operation that may take place. This Bill admittedly is a preventative measure, to come into operation whenever some danger threatens any particular industry, and, as I say, it seeks to restrict trade under certain circumstances. I make this suggestion in reply to the challenge of the Minister of Defence for a comprehensive and correctly descriptive title. </para>

Then, again, there is the apple trade of Tasmania which is threatened . by the codlin moth; does the Bill preserve the apples of the little island? Therefore, I say that the title does not accurately describe the purpose of the Bill, but is far too comprehensive for a measure which deals only with certain industries, and seeks only to preserve them from certain dangers. It seems to me that the title suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> in an interjection, namely, the " Trust, Monopoly, and Dumping Act " is better than the present title. </para>

                        I thought the honorable senator rose to support the suggestion he threw out by way of interjection, but his remarks show the value we are to attach to his suggestion made with a views to shortening the discussion. The honorable senator first suggested that this should be called "The Trust and Dumping
                        <inline font-style="italic">Act,</inline>
                        and I then, also by way of interjection, expressed the opinion that that was infinitely preferable to the present title. In spite of the ingenious and casuistical reasoning of
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline>
                        there is no doubt that the present title is utterly misleading. There are hundreds of ways of preserving Australian industries. I, as a free-trader, know of one great way, and I suppose that
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline>
                        knows of another way, namely, by nationalization. I do not know whether he adheres to that policy, but, judging from his recent remarks, I should say that he repudiates it. The present title assumes that the Bill which we hope to place on the statute-book in some shape or other is the only measure for the preservation of Australian industries.

                            <para>- We are not dealing with the long title of the Bill, but with the short title, which is clearly misleading. I am quite willing to adopt the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> but, in my opinion, the better title is " Monopolies and Dumping Act," because that covers the whole subject, and even that term I am quite willing should be amended if it can be shortened. The Sherman Act contains no short title, but the expression in the marginal note is " Anti-Trust Act." That term would be ample, but still, I do not desire to put that in. I think it is very much better without than with " anti." </para>

I do not think that the word "Regulation" should be inserted, because it is not a Bill for the regulation of monopolies. The only monopoly which ought to be recognised is one which raises prices ; but still, if the Government wish to retain the word " Monopolies," I have no objection. I see no necessity, however, to insert " Regulation " in place of " Repression."

                        <para>- Does the Minister know of any Act on which this Bill is supposed to be founded, and in which that expression is used? I can find none. Neither the Sherman Act nor the Wilson Act contains the phrase. But in each Act the word "trust" is used. I do not propose to move the omission of the words "as understood in equity." The Bill is beset with enough difficulties already, and I invite the Minister to consider if it is not encumbering the expression "trust," which is well understood in connexion with these things in commerce, by surrounding it with something which is supposed to give it a legal interpretation, but which would only confuse it. If he will look at the beginning of the interpretation he will see that - "Commercial Trust" includes a combination, whether wholly or partly' within or beyond Australia, of separate and independent persons. </para>

                <para>What does that mean? Why not say simply "a combination of persons"? Persons are all, I suppose, separate and independent. Why put in the words separate and independent, then? If there is any particular signification in using the words, I think that the Committee ought to be informed of what it is. Then the definition also contains the words "corporate or unincorporated." I do not know what that means. Really, it is the funniest' Bill I have ever seen. Some person with a copious command of terms has simply put in as many as he could. If my honorable friend will look at the definition of "person," he will find that it includes a corporation. Why, then, in the definition of " commercial trust," say persons corporate or unincorporated ? Surely, it is sufficient to say " a combination of persons " unless there is some signification sought to be attached to the words to which I have referred. </para>

                    <para>. - The word " trust " as used in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> of the definition of " commercial trust " is not synonymous with the word " trust " as used in the term "commercial trust," but is used to express the legal relation that arises between persons who have placed themselves in some position of mutual agreement. In order to realize the necessity for the use of those words, we must consider the history of American trade both prior to and since the introduction of what is known as the Anti-Trust Law of the United States. First of all, the Legislature of that country was confronted with this posi-tion - that a number of persons who were engaged in a particular department of trade or enterprise would enter into what was known as a simple combination. They would combine together for a common purpose, either to prevent the continuance of the competition in which they had been engaged one against the other, or to regulate the prices at which they would sell the articles, which all of them produced, or to regulate the prices at which they would buy, say, stock, to be afterwards converted into meat to be sold to the public. Legislation was introduced to prevent that mischief, and under its provisions the Courts found it very easy to repress such combinations. They were enabled to rule that any combinations of that character were against the law. and, consequently, the contracts which had been entered into to bring the combinations into existence were invalid, and, in some instances/ subjected the contracting parties to penalties. But, not to be daunted by such legislation, these ingenious individuals conceived another method of effecting the object which they had intended than that which the law had 1 already decided was illegal, and should be punishable. They then decided to' appoint certain persons who would represent them in common. They would be come, so to speak, a combination or corporation amongst themselves. Their own stock in the corporation they parted with individually to trustees. They gave the trustees the legal power to regulate and to carry out their combined business, and the relation in which the parties stood one to another and with the trustees holding the several stocks ofl the different individuals was a relation which would be known in law as a trust. The trustees held the stock and regulated the business. The only evidences of their title that the. individual persons engaged in the business held were certificates or declarations from the trustees. Legally speaking, therefore, the trustees, as representing all the individuals, could carry on the combined business in a way in which the law had declared that several persons by a simple combination could not do. For some time, they- managed to evade the principles of the law by establishing a trust of that kind. It is in order to prevent a combination of that character being formed that it is provided in this clause that a commercial trust shall include amongst other things a number of persons combined together, controllable by - </para>

I do not suggest that there is a large number of persons in this or any other community who are continually busy exercising their ingenuity in that respect. But there is a certain percentage of people everywhere who look for loopholes, and we must have, in this regard, the widest form of expression. The definition which we are discussing uses terms which are as comprehensive as possible for expressing the relation that may exist between persons forming a trust. </para>

                    <para>. - I am sorry that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has not given reasons why the words to which he objects should be struck out. If the draftsman had inserted the word " single " instead of " separate" I suppose the legal element in the Senate would have raised a question whether " single " meant "married." As to the word "independent," it is necessary that it should be included to indicate whether the members of the trusts are sober, and not leaning up against each other ! Cannot honorable senators see the ridiculousness of raising an argument about such simple terms? I have heard such words read in indictments and bills of costs ; and, seeing that there is no reason shown by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> why they should be struck out, I do not see why they should not remain just to give the Bill a little tone. </para>

                <para class="block">What we are legislating; against is the combination of several independent persons who are separate and independent in reality and in fact, but who are combined for a specific purpose in the form of a commercial trust. That is the essence of the creation of a trust. The word " persons " includes, by virtue of the definition, a corporation or firm; and it is because they are independently carrying on business in the first instance, that when they combine together they become a trust. If there were a number of persons combined together in some branch of manufacture or industry quite legitimately, they would not be a trust. They would form a corporation for the purpose of carrying on that branch of trade. But if there is another corporation and a third, and the three combine together, they may become a commercial trust. </para>

                    because he evidently does not treat the question seriously. Perhaps he is incapable of treating it seriously. It is advisable that we should make this Bill as free as possible from terms that are likely to confuse. The Senate is not responsible for the drafting; of the Bill, but so far as I am concerned, I propose to assist to make it as clear as possible. In the definition of " commercial trust," there should not be introduced more debatable matter than cannot be avoided. The definition is - "Commercial Trust" includes a combination whether wholly or partly within or beyond Australia -

                    <para>.- I think that the Committee will be very wise in adhering to the definition. The more it is studied the more carefully one can see that it has been drawn. It is clearly founded on cases. It seeks to deal with three separate conditions of development in connexion with trusts. First, it deals with the agreement of various firms or persons or corporations. That was the first form that the trust assumed. That was held by the Court to be fundamentally wrong and in restraint of trade. </para>

                        <para>- What was ? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator BEST.</inline> - An agreement on the part of firms and corporations for the purpose of controlling, trade. The next step was for the members of the trust to transfer their various stocks to trustees who executed a declaration of trust. Hence it is that the words " the creation of a trust as understood in equity," are used. That is the widest possible term that could be used. The Court also struck at that form - of declaration of trust. Then came the third development. That was the creation of a corporation for the purpose of holding stocks, and thereby controlling the trade; and in the Northern Securities case - the great Merger case - if was held that that also was totally illegal. That was the biggest blow that had been struck at the trusts up to that time. This definition is drawn to meet those three separate conditions of affairs. The, widest possible words are necessary in order to cover the whole ambit of the cases which have been decided. The words are expressive. </para>

                        <para>- They certainly extend the meaning ; but what I am urging is that the definition most comprehensively deals with each separate development - first .the agreement, secondly the declaration of trust, and thirdly the holding corporations. In regard to each of these several stages cases have been decided. Whilst technically one or two words might be held, to be surplusage, it is desirable that we should use words that make the meaning clear and distinct, and which would cover every case that might arise. </para>
