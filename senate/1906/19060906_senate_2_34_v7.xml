                    <para>. - Whatever views honorable senators may entertain regarding this measure, I think we can all welcome it as one which is likely to clear the ground in the forthcoming electioneering contest in which we must take part. I wish at once to say that I desire to compliment both <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> and his associates on the perfect candour with which they have presented the Bill for our consideration. We have heard it alleged of late that  the cry  of those who believe in individual enterprise as against State enterprise is a  mere  bogy,  and that  there is no such thing as Socialism, which need not concern us. But we now have a very frank  and  open declaration by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> that this Bill is put forward as a definite socialistic proposal. </para>

                        <para>- I did, and I should be quite willing to represent them again in a matter which they intrusted to my keeping. I may ad'd that it would have been a good thing for my honorable friends opposite, and for those who are associated with them, if they had taken the advice that I then gave. It has been urged in support of the contention that the cry of Socialism is a mere bogy that the Constitution itself makes no provision by which the Commonwealth can nationalize any industry. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> makes it clear that instead of being a bogy,  it  is something real and definite. He and his party now come forward, in a perfectly constitutional way, to get over the difficulty that stands between them and certain objects which they have in view. I would also, before passing from that point, draw attention to the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> with' the candour to which I have just referred, admitted last night, on the motion for the adjournment of the Senate, that this was not merely his own personal Bill. It is a measure intrusted to him by his party . Therefore, it' is made, perfectly clear that this matter of nationalization, which has hitherto been only upon the platform of his party, has now reached the stage at which, in the opinion of that party, it is deemed desirable to put it in the forefront of their legislative work. They are, therefore2 seeking from the electors authority for the nationalization of industries in order, we .may assume, that, if the electors give than a majority, they may proceed to give practical effect to the views embodied in this Bill. I can give to the Senate the assurance that I shall endeavour to discuss this matter without any warmth of feeling. It is a matter of enormous magnitude. It is one upon which I think both sides can admit that there are reasonable grounds for difference of opinion, and for conflicting arguments. And when I say, as I do most frankly, that I am prepared to concede to mv opponents opposite the fullest measure of sincerity in the position that they take up, I think I am not unreasonable in asking that they also shall believe in the sincerity of those who, like myself, think that if this Bill were passed, the Commonwealth would be taking not a progressive, but a retrograde step. I lav particular emphasis upon that point, because it will be necessary for me later on to show, as I think I shall be able to do, whilst in no sense impugning the <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> and good intentions of my honorable friend. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> that he has allowed his zeal for the cause which he has at heart rather to outrun, not merely his discretion, but his sense of fairness, and certainly to undermine, to the greatest extent, the judicial faculty which, as Chairman of the recent Royal Commission, he was called upon to exercise. I must regret, too, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> absolutely ignored two important principles, which, to mv mind, are the main principles we have to consider. One is the great effect, the vital influence, which will be asserted upon the Constitution itself if this Bill becomes law; and the other is the great economic change he proposes to make. On neither of those points did <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> say anything. It is quite true that he made a casual reference to the responsibility attached to amending the Constitution; but that reference was made with respect to a minor matter - that which we were discussing yesterday. It is the sort of admission which any one could make, even in regard to the most trivial amendment of the Constitution. But so far as one can gather from his address, he has absolutely failed to grasp what the proposed amendment of the Constitution will mean. He also omitted to refer to the great and fundamental change in our economic system which he proposes to make. He alluded to certain businesses which he thought it desirable to nationalize, but in no case did he go to die root of the whole matter, or refer to the difficulties which would arise from the substitution of State for individual enterprise. In those matters the change which the honorable senator proposes to bring about is so great, so absolutely organic, that I think I am entitled to say that it would be not a. mere reform, but a constitutional and economic revolution. I wish first to deal with the constitutional aspect of the matter. I shall particularly invite the attention of honorable senators to this matter, because so far as I can see, if my view of it is" right, it will mean not merely an amendment of the Constitution, but will prove absolutely destructive of the basic principle upon which the Commonwealth Constitution was brought about. I need hardly remind honorable senators that when the question of bringing the Colonies of Australia into some form of union was under discussion, it was very clearly understood and definitely impressed upon every elector, that there was to be a federation and not an unification. I will show by means of a few quotations what I understand to be the basis of a Federal union. Burgess, a writer of considerable repute, says - </para>

                <para>It was a government of that kind. which was offered to the people of the Commonwealth, and which they accepted - one" under which there was to be a sharp division of powers and functions, between the local and the central Government, each being absolutely sovereign in its own domain and independent of the other. I lay particular stress upon this point, because if this Bill is carried, it will be a breach of faith with any State the people of which do not declare for it. At the first Federal Convention, held in 1891, a series of resolutions was submitted. The preamble to those resolutions reads as follows: - </para>

                    <para>I, therefore, lay down certain conditions which seem to me imperative as a ground-work of anything we have to do, and I prefer stating that these first four resolutions simply lay down what appear to me the four most important conditions on which we must proceed. First : " That the powers and privileges and territorial rights of the several existing Colonies shall remain intact, except in respect to such surrenders as may be agreed upon as necessary and incidental to the power and authority of the National Federal Government." I think it is in the highest degree desirable that we should satisfy the mind of each of the Colonies that we have no intention to cripple their powers, to invade their rights, to diminish their authority, except so far as it is absolutely necessary in view of the great end to be accomplished, which, in point of fact, will not be material as diminishing the powers and privileges and rights of the existing Colonies. It is therefore proposed by this first condition of mine to satisfy them that neither their territorial rights nor their powers of legislation for the well-being of their own country will be interfered with in any way that can impair the security of those rights and the efficiency of their legislative, powers. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">I say that that passage clearly outlines the basis of the union, the compact, the agreement, which was offered to the people of these several States, and which they accepted as a Federal as distinct from an unified form of government. I hold that this Bill is absolutely destructive of that idea. If the Bill were carried, it would mean an advance towards unification. I recognise at once that while the Constitution, based on the principles to which T have referred, does permit of amendment in certain ways, it is possible, by a reck- less use of that power, to take from the States rights and privileges which they would not give up voluntarily. Some stress has been laid by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> upon the fact that the Bill can only be passed if it gain the approval of a majority of the people in a majority of the States. That, of course, is quite clear from the wording of the Constitution. But if a proposal were made to take all the lands away from the States, and hand them over to the Commonwealth, it might command the approval of four States, and the requisite popular majority. Yet it would be an act of injustice to the States which declined to fall in with the idea. In that way my honorable friends could secure something which they know perfectly well the States would not have given up prior to Federation. Therefore, it seems to me abundantly clear that we have no right to attempt to amend the Constitution, even although we have the power to do so, in order to make an encroachment upon rights of the States which they are not prepared to surrender. In introducing the measure, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> threw it out as a sort of challenge that those who doubted the strength of the socialistic movement should agree to his Bill in order that it might' be referred to the people for an expression of their opinion. But one of the strongest reasons why I object to his proposal is that it is possible to take from New South W.a:les, or any State, something which it would not voluntarily surrender, and which, if it had been made a condition of the original agreement, would have meant that it would have stayed outside the Union. Take, for instance, the Crown lands. Does any one suppose for a moment that New South Wales, or any State, would have come into the Union if it had been made part of the bond originally that the lands and the mines should be handed over to the Federation? Not a State would have come into the Union on such a condition. Yet by amending the Constitution my honorable friends, I admit, cam take from the States what they would not voluntarily give up. Is it right to do that? Certainly the Constitution gives the power to take that step; but the mere possession of the power is, morally, no justification for exercising it. I wish now to show how great an encroachment the Bill, if carried, would make" upon the' rights of the States, and to what an extent it would launch us on the road towards unification. Even if limited to the carrying on of industries, it would be a considerable encroachment on States rights. To-day the States possess the right to carry on the business of manufacture or production. It has already been exercised in New South Wales, where w.e have clothing factories and also docks. I am not aware whether Victoria has carried out its brick-making enterprise or not, but I think that the machinery is on the ground. In various directions the States, when circumstances rendered it desirable, have attempted certain enterprises of that kind. Therefore, by proposing to transfer to the Federation these powers, it is proposed to that extent to encroach on what is at present the domain of the States. But I do not regard that in anything like so serious a light as I do the effect which the Bill, if it became law, would have on the Constitution - the substitution, to a very great extent of the principle of unification for that of Federation. It may be said that I am taking an unnecessarily alarmist view when certain sections of the Constitution are considered. I ask honorable senators to turn for a moment to sections 128 and 123. I take it that there is no writer on Socialism - certainly none with whom I am familiar - who does not put forward the land as the first of all monopolies. I am not now saying whether it is right or not, but I assert that all socialistic authors have contended that the first and the greatest monopoly of all is the land. It seems to me that but for a provision in the Constitution, it would be possible under the Bill, if it became law, to nationalize the lands of the several States. That brings me to section 128 of the Constitution, which says - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>No alteration diminishing the proportionate representation of any State in either House of the Parliament, or the minimum number of representatives of a State in the House of Representatives, or increasing, diminishing, or otherwise altering the limits of the State, or in any manner affecting the provisions of the Constitution in relation thereto, shall become law unless the majority of the electors voting in that State approve the proposed law. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">Section 123 provides that the Parliament of the Commonwealth shall not increase, diminish, or otherwise alter the limits of a State except with the consent of the people of the State. According to those two sections, the ordinary majority - that is. a majority of the people in a majority of the States - would not be sufficient where the lands of the State were concerned. In view of that fact, it might seem that if there is a provision to prevent the Parliament from diminishing the area of a State bv taking away a portion of it, therefore we could not take the whole. But, in answer to that view, I turn to paragraph xxi. of section 51 - </para>

I take it that production from the land is the first business, and that manufacture and distribution follow. As regards this easy method of disposing of constitutional objections, when raised, may I remind my honorable friends in the Labour Party that when this proposal was before the Senate previously they treated in exactly the same way the objection which I raised that it was unconstitutional. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> was very clear and emphatic on the point that it was absolutely constitutional, and although at considerable length I quoted several authorities my honorable friends still dissented from the view I expressed. But now we have them admitting that the position I then took up was perfectly right. The introduction of this Bill is proof that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> now admits that in that occasion he was wrong, and that the view I put forward was sound. A similar result would follow in the present case. Paragraph xxxi. of section 51 of the Constitution empowers the Parliament of tne Commonwealth to legislate with respect to- </para>

                        <para>- I am not now arguing whether it would be a calamity or not - evidently my honorable friend thinks that it would not - but I am trying to show that the proposed amendment of the Constitution could not be limited to the mere nationalization of a particular business, but would make such a fundamental alteration in the Constitution as absolutely to lead to unification. Because, to my mind, it 3s impossible to conceive of a Federal Government controlling the lands, and with them the mines, unless we also recognise that from that time forward the State's Governments must become a diminishing quantity until they absolutely disappear. Whether it be for good or ill, we should look well ahead at the road which we are invited to travel, and as I am not prepared to believe that a system of unified Government - one in which all the functions would be centred in a central body, the States Governments would be swept out of existence, and the States boundaries would disappear - would make for the welfare and happiness of the people, that is one of the reasons why I oppose the Bill, and invite the attention of the Senate to the sharp distinction between the Constitution as it stands, and as it would be if this proposal- were carried. The next point I wish to deal with is the fundamental difference between national and private enterprise. On that point <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> was absolutely silent. He may have considered that it was not incumbent upon him to deal with it. But it seems to me very much better that we should look at the principles1 underlying State enterprise as against private enterprise than that we should devote too much time to the incidents connected with any particular industry or business. Charges are made very freely - sometimes with sincerity, sometimes without it - that the advocates of private enterprise 'are absolutely callous, and would simply stand by the principle of let things alone. No individualists ever accept that as their standard. They hold that the functions of the State should, as far as possible, be limited to the regulation of industry without merging into industry itself. Individualists believe that State enterprise has an inherent weakness, and that therefore it ought to be limited as 'much as possible. On the other hand, my Socialist friends believe that State enterprise is in itself a good thing, and that therefore it ought to be adopted as far, and as fast, as possible. Individualists further believe that where action is taken by the State it should be limited to assisting private enterprise. I think I am correct in saying that my Socialist friends would destroy private enterprise altogether. That, I think, very clearly defines the position of the two parties. </para>

That Socialists to-day, as represented by my honorable friend, propose to immediately nationalize all business, and I do not for a moment believe or pretend, but I assert that the Socialist doctrine is to substitute State for private enterprise.

                        <para>- I do not believe anything of the kind nor does the honorable senator think that I do. It is a wellunderstood rule, founded upon common sense, that when a change is proposed anywhere the onus of proof lies with those who make the proposal. When my honorable friends brought forward this measure, they should ha;ve recognised that the responsibility rested upon them-of proving that the system of individualism has absolutely failed, and that the system which they propose to put in its place has reasonable guarantees of success. In no case have they attempted one or the other. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> made no reference at all to individualism generally, but merely picked ou't one or two businesses regarding which he made some very strong allegations. The honorable senator, however, never attempted to ascertain whether there axe any facts of a sufficiently general character to justify the assertion that individualism has absolutely failed. Certainly, neither by facts culled from history, nor bv argument or reasoning, did the honorable senator justify the assertion or hope that Socialism would succeed. I admit at once that the honorable senator pointed to one or two industries, regarding which he made certain allegations ; and if those allegations are founded* on fact they seem to prove that in those particular industries there are certain defects, weaknesses, or evils - call them what we like. But I am not aware that, because a certain number of individuals suffer from indigestion, there is any particular reason why the rest of the community should starve themselves. Yet that seems to be the reasoning of my honorable friends opposite - that because they have found an industry or two where private enterprise has assumed such a phase as to appear to be productive of evil, therefore all private enterprise should be swept on one side in favour of State control. </para>

                        <para>- That is a very good simile. I ask for proof that individualism has proved a failure, or t Rat Socialism will prove a success. While Socialism may overcome some of the difficulties which individualism presents, the former system may be accompanied by evils more serious still. I admit at once that a big question of this kind would occupy too much time and research to enable a discussion to be conducted on the floor of this Chamber. But there are certain broad general facts to which I can direct attention, and on which I am content to rely, in proof of my statement that, so far, we have had no evidence that individualism has failed, and that we are actually without proof that Socialism would succeed. It is a remarkable fact that the nations of the world which have led civilization are those which have allowed the largest measure of liberty to individual citizens, while, on the other hand, those nations which have displayed the larger measure of paternalism on the part of the Government - which have been more directly under the control of the Government - have always occupied a second or third rate place. I know of nothing which more vividly illustrates the potency of allowing a large measure of individual liberty than the history of colonization. England, which has allowed its subjects the fullest measure of liberty, is to-day a great colonizing power, whilst the Continental nations, which sent out their explorers and early settlers in leading strings, under the care of Government officials, have proved absolute and abject failures as colonizers. I am not saying that any of the facts to which I refer are at all conclusive ; but they afford a general indication that where the human mind and enterprise are allowed the fullest measure of liberty, there may Le looked for the richest rewards. I take it that both Socialists and individualists, other than those who may have become so absolutely selfish and callous as to have no regard for the common promptings of humanity, desire that in every act of government we shall keep clearly before us the one objective, the greatest good of the greatest number. On the question whether, with that objective in view, individualism has failed, I invite the attention of honorable senators opposite to a few facts. I know that figures are wearying, and therefore I shall condense as much as possible those which I propose to quote. From <inline font-style="italic">Mulhall</inline> I learn that pauperism in Great Britain is rapidly diminishing. Whereas in 1850 pauperism in Great Britain represented nearly 5 per cent, of the population, the proportion had in 1889 fallen to nearly <inline font-style="italic">2%</inline> per cent. - a practical reduction of 50 per cent. Then in 1850 there were in Great Britain 1,308,000 paupers, as compared with 1,000,000 in 1889, although the population had in the meanwhile increased. As a matter of fact, the reduction in the number of paupers in the period mentioned represented 22 J per cent., while the population had increased by over 35 per cent. In order to prevent any misunderstanding, I may say that in quoting these figures I am omitting the odd numbers. <inline font-style="italic">Mulhall,</inline> dealing with the people of the civilized world as a whole, shows that those who use savings banks - and they are mostly of the working classes added £503,000,000 to their accumulations in seven years, or about ^72,000,000 per annum. According to the same authority, I find that in America the number of depositors increased from 4,000,000 to 5,000,000 in the seven years from 1889 to 1896 - an increase of nearly 25 per cent., while the deposits increased from i.-363, 000,000 dollars to 1,907,000,000 dollars, or, roughly, 40 per cent. This meant an increase of deposits per inhabitant - not per depositor - of 22J per cent. In Great Britain I find that from 1890 to 1897 the number of depositors increased from 5,576,000 to 7,640,000, and the deposits f rom £111, 000, 000 to £164,000,000 ; the deposits per head of population, though not per depositor, rising from ^15 to .£24. Turning mv attention to Australia, I find from <inline font-style="italic">Coghlan,</inline> page 806, that the number of depositors here increased from the year 1861 to 1881 by 100 per cent., which, allowing for the growth of population, means 140 per cent. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly ; but that number is becoming smaller under the present system. I admit that the present system is not perfect - no system is. I desire to ascertain' how far the present system has been a failure up to the present time, and what guarantee there is of equal success, or of a larger measure of success under the system favoured by honorable senators opposite. It is the distribution rather than the production of wealth which excites the hostility of Socialists ; and I should now like to quote a few figures which will conclude my remarks on this aspect of the question. In <inline font-style="italic">Coghlan</inline> there are certain figures which show the number of people in the community who have wealth ; and that number is obtained, as honorable senators know, bv ascertaining how many who die have estates on which duties are levied, and then averaging the values over the whole community. Taking the figures for the whole of the Common wealth, I find that from 1880 to 1884, 11 per cent. - leaving odd decimals on one side - of the total deaths were those of people who possessed property. From 1885 to 1889 the percentage had risen to 12 per cent. ; from 1890 to 1894, to 14 per cent. ; and from 1895 to 1900, to 17.23 per cent. The figures for the next quinquennial period are not available. </para>

                        <para>- Those figures show conclusively, along with the figures as to the bank deposits, that whatever may be the defects of the present system there is a. wider and wider distribution of wealth, with a smaller percentage of absolute poverty. The figures which I have given as to the number of deaths per 100 of the population are in themselves likely to mislead, because there are included a considerable number of infants. In order to determine the number of the adult population who possess property, I have here figures showing that, taking the deaths per hundred of adult males, the number possessing property exhibits the same uniform increase, starting with 34.6 per 100 from 1880 to 1884, and then rising to 37 per1 00 from 1885 to 1889, to 42.1 per 100 from 1890 to 1894, and in the last period for which we have figures, to 46.6 per 100. </para>

I desire here to quote from the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> an extract from an article bearing on the point. I do not quote that journal very often, but there is an admission in the article referred to which touches the subject. We know very well that the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> has latterly been attempting to show that the great industries of the country are not as flourishing as they ought to be; and in the issue of the 22nd of last month there was an article commenting on the figures published by the Victorian Statistician.

                <para class="block">To go exhaustively into the whole question, and show that individualism, as a policy, tends towards progress, would be a task far beyond my strength, and would occupy more time than the Senate could afford to devote to a consideration of the subject. But I have put these few figures forward chiefly in order to show that my honorable friends opposite do not venture to attempt to prove that the system they attack has been a failure. I put them forward as showing, in view of all the facts which can be gleaned without too deep research, that the individualistic system makes for- the prosperity of the civilized nations that have adopted it as their economic system. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> said something just now about State enterprise being Socialism, but I am rather surprised that, before honorable senators put forward State enterprises as evidence of the benefits of Socialism, they did not look a little more closely into them. First of all, I deny that they are socialistic in the sense in which our honorable friends opposite use the term. Every one of the enterprises to which they 'have referred has something in it in the nature of a monopoly. We could not have a railway system in the country without granting a legislative monopoly. We give the right to run the railways over people's land. It is that which constitutes the monopoly, and which differentiates such enterprises altogether from businesses such as the tobacco industry, to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has referred, and which it is competent for one or a dozen men to enter upon if they think fit. I propose to show what strength these State enterprises, or socialistic enterprises, if my honorable friends please, lend to the contention that under Government control our enterprises will produce more wealth for distribution amongst the people in the community than they would under individual control. At the time I prepared some figures on this subject, I was unable to obtain the railway returns for last year in New South Wales, which, I admit, was a phenomenally profitable one, but I find that in New South Wales, for the seven years ending 30th June, 1905, that State lost £1,000,000 on the conduct of the railways. The railways of Victoria, in the same time, showed a loss of £2,500,000. When I take another socialistic service - the Post Office - I find that since Federation was accomplished, allowing for interest on the transferred properties, the Post and Telegraph Department, though we have not yet been federated for six years, has shown a loss of ,£1,760,000. </para>

                        <para>- The figures for the tramways are included in the gross figures to which I have referred honorable senators. These facts indicate that there is no royal road to making a business pay, and that the State has no absolute claim to say that it can conduct a business enterprise with financial success. The obligation to show that it can is upon my honorable friends opposite. I did not bring this matter forward. They have brought it forward as evidence to show what the State can do, and is doing. Despite the picture of success drawn by the lively imagination of my honorable friends, the fact remains that if all business enterprises were under the control and guidance of the State, and were carried on proportionally at the same loss as those to which I have referred, we should, in a verv few years' time, touch the border of national insolvency. </para>

I do not know exactly under what conditions country waterworks have been constructed in Victoria; but. although I have not the figures with me, I know that in New South Wales country waterworks constructed under Government control have shown an absolute and appalling loss. They have been constructed under Government control by Government officials ; the Government have provided the money, constructed the works, and have then handed them over to the municipalities concerned, who have been liable for interest on the cost of construction. </para>

In connexion with country waterworks in New South Wales, there has hardly been a single case in which it has not been shown that the cost of the waterworks, owing to the fact that they were constructed by the Government, represented a financial burden which no single municipality could shoulder. </para>

I am dealing now with New South Wales country, waterworks, and I say that after Government auditors have examined the accounts of the municipalities concerned they have had to admit that they were not competent to shoulder the overwhelming financial responsibilities incurred by the construction of theworks. </para>

We had in New South Wales a Fitzroy Dock, and we had a Commission appointed to inquire into it, and to find out how that State enterprise had been conducted. I need only refer honorable senators to the report of the Commission, which should convince any impartial mind that in carrying out such works under State control the least, rather than the most, effective work is obtained from the industry employed in construction. The same thing was proved when the Government attempted to build a hospital. It was proved that the price paid by outside contractors for the cutting of stone was something like one-third of the price paid by the Government, and the reason was obvious. </para>

                        <para>- If a man is working for an outside contractor, and does not do a fair day's work for a fair day's pay, he knows what will happen. Here is an instance of the results of what my honorable friends would call absolute State Socialism : Some time ago the Government desired to throw open land for settlement in New South Wales, and the idea was suggested by some members of the socialistic party in that State that it would be an excellent thing and a good investment if, instead of throwing the land open to selection in an unimproved condition, the State improved it first, and added the cost of the improvement to the price of the land. The incoming settlers would then, instead of having to spend time and money in getting their land ready for the plough, be able to enter upon an improved property, and start their operations at once. The idea suggested was adopted, the most experienced men in the Department were sent up to the land, and I think I am correct in saving that the assistance of outside practical men was also availed of. What was regarded as a fair price per acre for clearing the land was fixed. The work was let to gangs of men, anc! it was not long before the inevitable agitation arose for better payment. The State conceded the demand, and before the work was completed the cost of clearing the land had run up from £3 to £10 per acre. That sum was added to the price of the land when it was thrown open to selection. But when it was selected the selectors exercised their right under the land law to have the improvements appraised bv the local Land Board The Land Boards in New South Wales, as honorable senators are no doubt aware, are composed of one Government official, and two local men of farming or land experience. The selectors applied to the local Land Board to have the improvements appraised, and they were appraised on the evidence of Crown witnesses, district surveyors, and field surveyors, at prices which ran from 30 to 50 per cent, of the price which the State had paid for having the work of improvement carried out. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator may call it a gross scandal, if he likes; but only the other day I read in one of the Victorian newspapers of an embankment being made in this State to prevent certain land from being swamped, and it was shown that the price paid by the Government for the work was not only many times larger than the price which would 'have been paid by private employers, " but that the result had been an absolute failure when the work was done. I say, therefore, that such cases are not singular to New South Wales. </para>

                        <para>- It was pointed out that the water had got through the hank; and now they are trying to pull the bank down to let the water out again. It is not a matter of one State alone. These things, I take it, are associated with practically every Government enterprise throughout Australia. On another occasion, the Government of my State entered upon a socialistic venture. It decided to construct certain drains to carry away the water from a bore. When the work was done, it was found that it would cost £70 per mile, whereas the ordinary contract price would have been <inline font-style="italic">£6</inline> or £7. The reason was that the Government preferred to do that work with pick and shovel, as probably my friends opposite would have preferred to do it, on the ground that it would give more employment to labour to do it in that way than to use machinery. If the work had been done by private enterprise, it would have been carried out for a much smaller sum by means of effective plant. I could give many other instances, but it is not necessary to do so, because any one who has taken notice of public affairs, not to speak of any one who has been in public ..life, must know of a multiplicity of such cases similar to those which I have mentioned, where, the moment the State stepped out of its legitimate functions and undertook the work of private enterprise, it was landed in a tremendous failure. In fact, it was only possible for it to do such work at all because, if the Government incurs a deficiency, it always has the chance to fall back upon the taxation of the people to make up that deficiency. When I find that consistently Government efforts end in the way I have shown, is it to be supposed that we shall redeem that weakness, or whatever it is, by a mere amendment of the Constitution, which is going to enlarge the opportunities for Government muddling? </para>

                        <para>- It might be assumed that, seeing that the Government, in running these enterprises, evidently pays those engaged in them more than it gets out of the works, there would be a spirit of contentment in the Public Service, and that all those engaged in carrying out State enterprises would be happy. But what is the actual position ? We have had in New South Wales an inquiry into the working of the railways, which' proves that not merely amongst the rank and file, but right up to the heads of the Department, an absolute state of disorganization and discontent has prevailed. We have going, on there now an inquiry into the tramway service, as the result of ,al legations By the men that their superior officers have been imposing upon them, that there has been tyranny on the one hand and favoritism on the other. The facts to which I allude amply prove that, under this " ideal " system which mv honorable friends opposite desire to bring about, there will be an element of dissatisfaction and want of discipline which will prevent the successful undertaking of necessary work. These are instances taken from recent editions of the public press. Not long ago there was a Commission inquiring into the office which deals with weights and measures. Allegations of favoritism and incivility,, and even charges of a more serious character, were inquired into. We had also a water and sewerage board complaint as to am, allegation concerning the dismissal of an employe in order to make room for a nominee of one of the members of the Board. We had also, with regard to the City Council, a system which was known as the " Widow's Cart system," which prevailed for many years, and under which the widow of any one who had been at work under the corporation had an opportunity of hiring a cart and a workman to the City Council at a high rate. Then what about the railways in Western Australia? I find that a Commission of inquiry has been appointed regarding the dismissal of a certain officer for the use of Government material, and for doing private work in Government time. I take all these instances out of recent newspapers as showing - though I admit not at all conclusively - that the 'Socialism advocated by my honorable friends opposite would effect a change that: would be not at all to the advantage of the community: </para>

                        <para>- I am showing that I at least do not. Taking the particular enterprises in point as being socialistic in their character, I inquire how they are being carried on, and I find that instead of an ideal state of things existing, there is dissatisfaction amongst the men employed, and a complete absence of that happiness which we are lead to believe will be one of the features of the socialistic State. Just now I spoke of the inherent weakness of Government Service. In the Public Service - I do not speak of the Commonwealth service particularly, but of all Government services - there are two methods of advancement, one by seniority, and the other by merit. Neither has proved satisfactory. Where we had advancement by seriority, there was an absolute want of incentive to exertion. A man knew that all he had to do was to attend his office daily, and wait for promotion to come. </para>

                        <para>- He waited for some one else to die, and he went on step by step, irrespective of fitness. That system was destructive of any good work. The other system, advancement by merit, should, on the face of it, prove to be better. But what has happened ? The moment any attempt is made to lift a younger officer over an older one, the cry of favoritism is raised. When we were passing our own Public Service Act, we strenuously declared our adherence to the principle of promotion by merit, and our determination that the Public Service Commissioner should be left alone in the discharge of his functions. But whenever the principle of promotion by merit has been tried, we have had complaints about what has been attempted to be done. Quite recently questions were put to the Minister with regard to certain cases. I am not saying that the complaints in question were not justified, but I am pointing out that whenever you attempt in a public department to select men. for offices because of their superior merit, there is immediately a suspicion of favoritism; and the result has been that unless you get a strenuous departmental head who is prepared to advance officers on their merits alone, and to stand the risk of public criticism, that principle is rarely brought into play as it is in private employment. That, I say, is an inherent weakness of any public department. For proof of it, I have only to appeal to the experience of my friends around the Chamber, and to ask them whether it is not so. I. do not say for a moment that a man in the Public Service is any different from a man outside. I "take it that if you were to compare ten average men in the Public Service with a corresponding number of people in private employment, you would find a percentage who were similar in ability, and character. </para>

                        <para>- A statement of that kind may be all very well for the platform, but I do not know where these down-trodden men in private employment are to be found. I do not find any reluctance on the part of manual labourers whom I meet to express their own opinions. I take it that members of the Public Service are just average citizens, neither better nor worse. My point is that if you take a corresponding number of men in private employment you will always find amongst them some men making rapid advancement, some being dismissed for incompetency and negligence, and some being advanced much more slowly. Do you find the same state of things in the Public Service? </para>

I do not mind reasonable interjections, but statements of that kind do not advance the argument, and for that reason, are a little disconcerting. Any private employer will see to it that his employes are reasonably active and energetic in the discharge of their duties ; but any incentive of that kind is absent from the Public Service. For proof of that statement, we can appeal to our own experience. The number of dismissals from the Public Service is so small as to be practically nil. </para>

Were they picked men when they went in as mere youths? There is no getting away from the fact that the civil servants are just average citizens. They are not to blame, but the system. The absence of fear of unpleasant consequences on, the one hand, and of incentive on the other, is what renders any big public department less efficient in its working than the same men would be if engaged in private employment. If we had State enterprise in matters of industry, and the same spirit prevailing as now prevails in our public departments, we should have an absolute diminution in the general wealth 06 the community. National wealth is the result of national effort. If the effort were lessened, the wealth would be reduced. I take it that my honorable friends opposite are not complaining of the quantity of wealth that is produced, but only of its distribution. </para>

                        <para>- If so, my honorable friend will become an advocate of the system o,f private enterprise. Have my honorable friends any assurance that if, under State enterprise, as much would be produced as is produced to-day ? If as much wealth would be distributed as at present, it seems to me that because they are Quarrelling with the distribution of wealth, they are trying to attack the method of its production. That appears to me tq be neither logic nor good business. What guarantees are there that under a socialistic system more wealth would be produced? Let me take some of the statements which my honorable friends have made. First qf all, they offer, as they have done during this debate, easier times to the men employed in the industries to be nationalized. </para>

The workmen are to be less hustled, and the temperature in the tobacco factories, which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> affirms leads to economic manufacture, is to be dispensed with. With what result? Gould we have easier times for workmen, less hustle on their part, and the removal of a factor which leads to economic manufacture, and still get the same result? When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> made an interjection, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> said - " We would have more men working less hours." </para>

                        <para>- It must be remembered that under this so-called socialistic enterprise there is a big check exercised by the great body of the people who are outside the Government preserve. But if all the people of the country were working for the Government it would disappear, and I venture to say that there would then be an interminable struggle between those engaged in one industry and those engaged in another as to the apportionment of wages. At the present time the standard of wages paid in private employment determines to some extent what the wages in State employment shall be, but if all persons came into the employment of the State what standard would there be? The system would bring down the wages to an absolute level, with the result that the cause of incentive which exists to-day would disappear. There is but one form of Socialism which I think has any possibility of succeeding, and that is Socialism under a despotism. Such as for instance existed in Peru. That system can be carried on under a despotic Government, who can tell men to do this, that, or the other, and punish them if they do not obey. But to contend that we could have the system under a democratic Socialism, where every man claims the .right, as undoubtedly he would have, not merely to criticise, but to shape the policy, to determine what he should do, and what should become of the product of his labour, seems to me to be a contradiction in terms. </para>

                        <para>- The same condition would exist then as exists to-day. When the railway employes give their votes to elect their representatives in Parliament does their power end there? Not one bit. Quite recently they have managed to exercise such influence over their representatives in Parliament that the Government have placed upon the Estimates an item for the purpose of making a concession which the Railways Commisioners, who, by Act of Parliament1, are supposed to be outside political control, state that the railways cannot afford to bear. But the Government provided the money out of general revenue. That goes on where there is only a 1 inured section of the people engaged in State employment. If all were so engaged it would simply reduce the matter to a farce - to be taking money out of the pocket of A. to be placed in the pocket of B. and <inline font-style="italic">vice versa.</inline> I want now to say a few words as to the Bill. I ask the attention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> for a moment, because I am at a loss to understand what he means. It is a Bill to provide for' the nationalization of monopolies. I should like him to define the word monopoly. </para>

                    does not mean that. In his speech, he Has given a definition. By the term, he means any business, any corporation, any controlling authority, which secures so large a share of a particular industry as. to become a menace to the public. Where can he find any legal or dictionary interpretation of monopoly to conform to his own? What he means is not the nationalization of monopolies at all. He has admitted that, whilst he calls them virtual or practical monopolies, there is no absolute monopoly in Australia, except one to which I shall refer. In his speech, he made the admission, not once, but several times, that this monopoly is not an absolute one.

                        <para>- So far as I aim concerned, the Bill as it is is quite enough for electioneering purposes. All I have to say anywhere, whether in town or country, is that here is a proposal on the part of the Labour Party to nationalize a monopoly in relation to production. I should not need to go any further - I should be quite satisfied with that as an electioneering cry. If I did require an electioneering cry, I should ask the electors to listen to what I have just addressed to the Senate. I should point out that we were invited to put our national destinies in the hands of a party who, wishing to nationalize one branch of industry, brings in a Bill to nationalize another. I do not know that such remarks would be complimentary to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> but, at any rate, they would be justifiable. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> can scarcely deny his admission that even the one terrible example of the tobacco business does not present a monopoly. The honorable senator went so far as to admit that there are others outside the combine interested in the industry. </para>

                        <para>- If that is the objection, then the phraseology of the Bill ought to be altered. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> not only admitted that the tobacco, industry is not a monopoly, but went out of his way to make a statement, fpr which there is not the slightest justification in the evidence given before the Royal Commission. That statement was that the combine allows certain competition to exist in order that they may be able to say there, is no monopoly. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> added, " I .can prove that if the combine liked it could crush that competition out of existence." But the honorable senator never ventured to attempt to produce any proof. It is easy to make statements, but it is another thing to prove them. In regard to both the sugar and the tobacco industries, <inline font-weight="bold">.Senator Pearce</inline> said they are not monopolies, but only what he termed " virtual " or " practical " monopolies. If the honorable senator desires to nationalize other businesses, he ought to strike out " monopolies " and substitute "businesses," or insert' a definition of what he means by " monopoly." Otherwise we are asked to pass a Bill, and to put the electors to the trouble of voting,' when we know that the measure can accomplish nothing. If a monopoly did exist, it would always be competent under the Bill for it to keep in existence one or two small businesses in order to avoid being brought within the dictionary definition. I said just now that I know of only two monopolies, and it is important to remember what they are. One monopoly is that of the railways, and the other is that represented by patents. </para>

                        <para>- I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> does not quite see the point, because his interjections are usually pertinent. I know of on.lv two enterprises which come within the definition of " monopoly," as I understand the word - as I am entitled to understand the dictionary interpretation. Surely <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> does not* propose that the Commonwealth should nationalize the railways of the States 1 The honorable senator does not propose, I assume, to take over the monopolies which have been given to persons under the patent laws. And yet these are the only two monopolies to which the Bill would apply. I leave that part of the subject by saying that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> must either substitute "businesses " for "monopolies" or insert a definition of the word "monopoly." </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator may be prepared to take the risk ; but it is ridiculous to ask the Senate to pass a Bill for the nationalization of monopolies when the honorable senator admits that that is not what he desires - that what he desires is the nationalization of something which he has shown is not a monopoly. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> may take the risk, but I am sure the Senate will not. I now desire to deal with the speech of the honorable senator. I almost feel inclined to apologize for referring to the evidence placed before the Royal Commission, because it seems to me it would have been far better to discuss this proposal to nationalize industries without making any particular business the crux. </para>

                        <para>- I am going to deal with the report. All I am saying now is that it would have been far better if we could have discussed the question of nationalization quite apart from those debatable points which necessarily arise in the case of a particular business. Personally, I should have liked to deal with the matter entirely from the point of view of what I may call first principles. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> however, dealt almost exclusively with the evidence which he alleges was presented to the Royal Commission, and for that reason I feel called upon to follow him through a great number of the statements he then made. I trust I shall not be misunderstood, because in challenging the statements of the honorable senator I desire to make it perfectly clear that I give him credit for making those statements in the best of good faith, and in no sense intentionally seeking to mislead the Senate. At the same time, I feel it incumbent upon me to show that the honorable senator has misled the Senate, and I shall not look to anything outside the report of the Commission for justification of that statement. It is a matter of very considerable regret - and how far I am entitled to say this must be shown by my subsequent remarks - that the honorable senator should have allowed his zeal to outrun his discretion, and to absolutely outweigh that judicial determination which he ought to have brought to bear on the matter. </para>

First of all, this report was signed by Senators Pearce, Story, Findley, and "Stewart. I take it that in an inquiry of this kind the judicial character is supposed to be uttermost; those who take part are supposed to make an inquiry into facts, and to report according to the evidence presented. Those four gentlemen are all members of a party which is absolutely pledged to nationalization - are gentlemen who, I assume, signed, with perfect sincerity, a pledge to adopt nationalization as a plank in their political programme. They have expressed the belief, strong within themselves, that nationalization would be for the national good, and ought to be accomplished. </para>

                        <para>- I shall show from the statements I am about to quote what chance there was of so convincing the honorable senator. I desire to make it clear that I impute to the honorable senators I have mentioned only that unconscious bias to which all of us are liable. As an illustration, I should like to direct attention to the report of the Tariff Commission. That Commission was composed of an equal number of protectionists and free-traders ; and, on exactly the same evidence and facts, four protectionists came to one conclusion and four free-traders came to another. There is no reason to suppose that either of the two sets of gentlemen acted in any way except according to their conscientious opinions ; but the facts show how absolutely impossible it is for men with preconceived notions to occupy a judicial position and arrive at a judicial determination. </para>

                        <para>- I (am not saying anything about the findings of the Tariff Commission, but merely pointing out that in the minds of all of us there is an unconscious bias from which we cannot entirely free ourselves. I am sure that my protectionist friends will not dispute the statement that there are absolutely honorable men in the ranks of the free-traders. But would my protectionist friends trust those free-traders to conduct an inquiry into Tariff matters? Would I, as a freetrader, trust the most honorable protectionist I know to conduct such an inquiry? Certainly not. The unconscious bias would be so strong that, whilst such men might honestly desire to give a most judicial decision, their judgment would be warped. </para>

                <para class="block">It is the same with all matters connected with race and religion. There is an unconscious bias which warps the judgment to such an extent as to render persons influenced by it ineligible to give a judicial decision. I lay stress on the fact that, whilst there were other members of the Commission, only four signed the report, and each one of them before he took up the work of the Commission was a pledged advocate of the nationalization of the industry. I say that the report loses all value from the fact that those who conducted the inquiry had previously made up their minds as to what they wanted, and believed that the nationalization of monopolies should be undertaken. </para>

                <para>The honorable senator brought that forward, no doubt believing that everything he said expressed his honest and open conviction. But I direct the attention of honorable senators to the fact that even at that early stage he expressed the view that the tobacco business was a monopoly, and that it ought to be nationalized. I do not propose to quote from his speech on that motion,, because the honorable senator's attitude on the subject is well known, and he had often contended that the tobacco industry in Australia formed a monopoly, and should be nationalized. </para>

                        <para>- While the work of the Commission was. in progress, and when its labours had not been more than half completed, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> wrote a most stringent article, which was published in the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Worker,</inline> and in which he dealt with this question. It showed that there was no doubt in his mind then as to what ought to be done any more than there was when he addressed the Senate twelve months ago, because the article was an absolute affirmation of nationalization, and that nationalization of the tobacco business was desirable. So far as the report is concerned it is clearly entitled to no more weight than if the four honorable senators who have signed it had had it written without examining a single witness, because long before the Commission was appointed they were all pledged advocates of nationalization. </para>

                        <para>- I admit at once that the reports of all these Commissions, composed of men engaged in the active strife of politics, are weakened and rendered almost valueless because of the preconceived ideas with which the inquiries are undertaken. Will any honorable senator accept the reports presented by the Tariff Commission as affording anything more than information ? They certainly cannot be taken as judicial findings. To that extent the appointment of these parliamentary Commissions leads to much waste of public money. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has made a reference to electioneering purposes, I admit at once that it might be extremely useful in the conduct of a political propaganda for a man to be able to go upon a platform with an ominous-looking volume, and say, "A Commission inquired and it finds so-and-so " ; while he says nothing as to how the Commission was composed. </para>

I safeguard myself again by saying that I am not impugning the honorable senator's good faith in any way.

I have said that the honorable senator impugned the good faith of witnesses whose evidence did npt support his view. </para>

The first I dealt with was his action in impugning witnesses. The one which I now propose to take is my allegation that he has read into the evidence matter which is not there. And by " matter ' ' let me say that I do not necessarily mean words, but that in his presentation of the case before the Senate the honorable senator has given to the evidence a shade of colouring that is not in the evidence itself. </para>

                    <para>The price of tobacco in European countries and in America is greater than it is in Australia, and the cost of manufacture in Australia, while it is higher than in the other countries I have named, is not so much higher as to account for the difference in the retail price. Therefore, the proportion of profit derived from the tobacco industry in Australia is greater than it is in the other countries mentioned. </para>

                        <para>- To simplify matters, let me say that the price referred to in the quotation by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> disappears from my argument, as he has admitted that it is a mistake. He says that, while there is a difference in wages, it is not so great as to account for the higher price prevailing in Australia for tobacco than elsewhere. But now we have <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley's</inline> statement that France pays as high a price for its tobacco as do other countries, and he adds that she buys in the best market in the world. I propose to .show how far the selected evidence fairly portrays the evidence which was given to the Commission, and is a fair summary of the facts on which its report was founded. </para>

                        <para>- Is the combine so simple as to allow its profit to be taken away by a middleman? The very purpose of a combine is to shut out the middleman. I would sooner have the profits which the combine will make out of their purchase than those which the French Government would make. The percentage of foreign leaf used in France is 40.89, in Austria, 38.61, and in Australia 55.86. The percentage of local leaf used in France is 58.83, in Austria 61.25, and in Australia 19. 81. The percentage of imported manufactured tobacco used in France is only . 28, in Austria 0.14, and in Australia 23.45. These figures seem to me to show that Australia is getting tobacco of a better quality than that supplied by the French Government. That I put forward in disposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley's</inline> interjection. I want now to show what effect the higher prices have, because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has affirmed that the difference in wages is not sufficiently great to account for the difference in the selling price. If honorable senators will turn to the table on page 275 they will find that in France the wages per hour are 3.1d., in Austria1.8d., and in Australia 6.8d. In other words, the Commonwealth is paying a little over twice as much as France, and about five and a half times as much as Austria. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator says that the statement as to wages is wrong: but I shall show that the figures are correct. I undertake to say that the statement I have read, showing that the wages in Australia are double those in France, is correct. I also undertake to show that the cost price of leaf and imported manufactured tobacco in Australia is three times as high as in France, and that nearly ltd. per lb. more is paid here, while the selling price out here is only ] S. 4½d. per lb. more. If we are paying j.rd. 11 d. per lb. more for material, and the wages are 100 per cent, higher, is it not reasonable to suppose that the selling price of the article should be 5jd. more? I propose to leave the comparison as to Austria and other places out of consideration. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has been careful, in referring to the revenue results, to take admittedly the best example, namely, France. In Austria: the State gets only is. 4d. per lb. for the tobacco manufactured and sold in the country ; and this particular instance shows so little advantage that I can quite understand <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> omitting to press it as an example. I dismiss the point with the remark that Austria is such a miserable and insufficient example that it cannot be accepted as a fair comparison with Australia ; and all that the facts prove is that a State monopoly is not necessarily beneficial to those employed, or productive of revenue. I now desire to pass on to another statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> who denied the inferiority of French tobacco. </para>

There are importers of tobacco, cigars, and cigarettes into France, but the imported tobacco cannot be sold in competition with French tobacco, simply because - </para>

The first point I make is that the price paid in France shows the inferiority of a State-manufactured tobacco; and now I turn to other evidence on the point. In passing, I may say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce's</inline> two explanations seem somewhat contradictory. The honorable senator first of all affirmed that the French tobacco is not inferior, and then practically said that it does not matter if it is . inferior - after one gets used to it. If the latter means anything, it is an admission that the French tobacco is inferior, but that the people have been so long familiar with it, that the inferiority does not matter. I propose to inquire whether the French tobacco is, or is not, inferior, and the first thing I find on going through the evidence is an extract from the report of the Tobacco Commission appointed by the German Government to inquire, as was the case in Australia, as to the possibility or desirability of nationalizing the industry. </para>

                    <para>It is generally admitted that the quality of French pipe tobacco is inferior. The reasons for this, as specially stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr.</inline> Kruekl in the Austrian official report on the Paris Exhibition of 1867, and admitted by all experts, is to be found mainly in defective manufacturing processes - the raw material is excessively wetted and roasted. In spite of wholesale complaints, however, no change has so far been made in a single factory throughout Fiance. All progress in the manufacture of tobacco has thus been originated in countries where it is free, specially in Germany, Belgium, and Holland. Leading officials of tobacco Regies admit that the large private factories of Germany are up to date. These establishments are furnished with the latest machinery and appliances, many of which are not to be found in Regie factories." Regie countries seek to obtain knowledge of progress in tobacco manufacture, bv sending officers to inspect the factories of those free countries, and by engaging workmen who have been trained there. France has even been obliged to transfer to private factories the manufacture of certain specialties in cigars. </para>

                <para class="block">I draw attention to the wide difference in the dates, which shows that, although thirty-seven years had elapsed, the conditions were quite similar - reveal the fact that there exists in France a contraband trade of such enormous dimensions that its official description sounds like fairy tales. With regard to frontier districts towards Belgium, the report of the Vicomte de Bourbon, of 1S75, states : - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>The contraband trade has taken the place of the Regie. . . . lt is notorious that the great smuggling enterprises now supply from 50 per cent, to 70 per cent, of 'the consumption. . . This smuggle has its capitalists, insurances, and undertakers, who direct the operations. </para>
                    <para>This smuggle has its capitalists, insurances, and undertakers, who direct the operations. It has its dogs, its vehicles, and armed bands, who transport great quantities of tobacco.' " AH this in spite of the fact that the number of Customs officers in these districts is enormous. In addition, there is the secret manufacture. For instance, the report states that one district, Allauch, having 2,000 inhabitants, has scarcely any other industry than that of the clandestine manufacture of tobacco. The loss of the Regie from these causes, and the sale at reduced prices of its own products in the districts affected, is estimated by the Regie to amount to 20 per cent, of its net revenue." </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">The points I make upon that are these : That the French tobacco is so inferior that people will incur all the risk of smuggling, and that in order to. get any sale for it at all the practice of the Government is to sell the tobacco on' the border district at a lower price than is charged for it throughout the country generally. There is one other extract which confirms that which I have just rea'd, and it will be found on page 285 of the minutes ' of evidence attached to the report - " ' Tn the provinces bordering on Germany, Belgium, and Switzerland, the French Regie charges specially low rates for common tobaccos, as the only method by which smuggling can be minimized. For instance, the lowest quality made, " Talbac de Cantine," which is sold to retailers at 7.20 francs per kilo, all over France, is sold as low as 2.60 francs per kilo, in the districts immediately adjoining those countries.' " </para>
                <para>It appears to me that if the French tobacco were not merely superior but equal to that to be obtained elsewhere, there would be no necessity for the French Government to quote specially low prices for their border districts. There is another source of information which may be resorted to to show the inferiority of French tobacco. I find that the export of tobacco from France, a country of 40,000,000 of people, is 645,000 lbs., valued at ,£93,000. The export from Austria amounts to 451,000 lbs;, valued at £79,000; from Italy, 88,000 lbs., valued at £11,000. The export from Germany, under the stimulus of private enterprise, amounts to 55,615,000 lbs., or something like one hundred times the export from France. Holland is not a big country, but the manufacture of tobacco there is conducted by private enterprise, and the value of the export from that country is given at £1,175,917, as against an export valued at £93,000 from France. The Commonwealth, with its limited community of 4,000,000 of people, or one- tenth of the population of France, exports £40,000 worth of tobacco, or nearly half the value of the export from France. It is well to ask to what countries France exports tobacco. If French tobacco were equal to the other tobaccoes placed on the markets of the world, we might reasonably expect that her exports would correspond to some extent in volume with those of her neighbours, but I have shown that her exports are too insignificant- comparatively to be entitled to the term. A further explanation is that her exports are largely to her own Possessions, and that in the markets of the world French .tobacco is practically unknown. </para>

I have seen the Deal boatmen chase a homecoming ship for miles in the hope of getting a pound or two of tobacco from a tobacco-growing country. I have never seen them attempt to smuggle French tobacco into England, though they had no compunction about chasing a vessel along the Downs in the hope that they might be able to get tobacco from other parts of the world from the officers or crew. I am surprised, in looking through the evidence of the Commission, to notice that no portion of it justifies the statement which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has made to the Senate that French tobacco is not inferior, and that a Frenchman can get any tobacco that he likes. There is nothing in the evidence, so far as I can see, to justify that statement. In fact, the evidence absolutely disproves it. </para>

                        <para>- But upon a question affecting a few pounds worth of private property, I venture to say that the honorable senator1 would have taken up quite a different attitude. Even if he were not challenged on the ground that he was prejudiced, he would ask the Judge to excuse him, as any right thinking mas would do under the circumstances. I come now to the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> that the tobacco combine has strenuously, continuously, and systematically made efforts to crush the growers. I am glad to hear the approving cheer of my honorable friends opposite, because it shows that I have not misunderstood <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce's</inline> statements. In order that the Senate may fully recognise what he has said on the subject, I intend to quote a passage from his speech, pages 3267-8 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard -</inline></para>

                    <para>There was a time when Australia cultivated a fair acreage, and produced a large quantity of tobacco. The acreage and production reached their highest point in this country in1388, when 6,641 acres produced 7,868,112 lbs. of leaf. Since 1888 there has been a gradual drawing together of the factories, which have become fewer and fewer, until in the last three years we have seen the monopoly hy the tobacco combine. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator does not seem to grasp the fact that since 1888 the factories have been becoming fewer, and that buyers have been disappearing and competition lessening, until, in 1900, the latter practically disappeared because there was only one buyer. Ever since 1888 there have been two movements in the tobacco trade of Australia - a gradual diminution of competition in the manufacture, and the elimination of the tobacco grower from amongst our farmers. </para>

                <para class="block">There is a statement which I may condense into a few words - that since 1888 there has been a gradual diminution of buyers, and that, corresponding with that reduction, there has been a decrease in the acreage cultivated for tobacco leaf. I should like to point out, before passing on to give the exact figures, that before October, 1901, each Colony of Australia was an absolutely independent country, and must, therefore, be regarded separately. It is not possible, in view of the different rates of Excise and the different Customs duties which prevailed in each of the Colonies, to regard the Commonwealth as a whole before that date. Although, therefore, I shall give the figures for the whole of Australia, I draw attention to the fact that they are likely to be misleading if honorable senators do not bear in mind what I have said. In South Australia, for instance, there was no Excise duty on tobacco, and the same rate of Customs duty was paid in that State whether the leaf came from New South Wales or from America - namely,1s. 7½d. per lb. The two dates which I wish honorable senators to carry in their minds are 1888 and 1900. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> stated that since  1888  there had been a gradual diminution of factories, until in  1900  they were all rolled into one. The figures which I shall quote are taken from pages  11  and  14  of the Commission's report, and were furnished by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ferguson,</inline> the Inspector of Excise in Victoria. The figures relating to the acreage under tobacco do not begin with 1888. The report to which I refer gives the figures from 1884. The acreage for that year for all Australia was 2.521. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> in order to show as big a reduction as possible, took the year  1888,  when there were  6,641  acres under tobacco cultivation. The Senate will see at once that in those four years the acreage had increased nearly three times. Of course, it appears much more startling to take the highest figures and compare them with a year in which the figures are lower. I shall show, however, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce's</inline> statement that the acreage has declined correspondingly with the diminution in the number of factories is absolutely without foundation. He stated that the diminution in cultivation was due to the closing of factories, but he furnished no evidence to the Senate, nor was any evidence on that subject given to the Commission. </para>

                        <para>- Whilst there has been a diminution in the acreage and in the number; of factories, the two factors do not proceed side by side. We have had a diminution in factories - that is, in buyers - with an increase of acreage, and we have had the reverse position. There is no relation between the alleged cause and the alleged effect. First of all, I take the increase in New South Wales. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ferguson,</inline> in his report, in no case justifies the statement madeby <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> He gives reasons for the reduction in the acreage, and I will quote them later on. The only evidence that I can find in the report to support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce's</inline> statement is that a number of small factories were closed in Victoria between 1880 and 1888. </para>

                        <para>- It is a curious thing that the time when the factories were decreasing was the very time when the acreage was increasing. Take the case of New South Wales. In 1888 there were 4,883 acres under cultivation. With not a single factory less, it gradually fell from 4,883 acres in 1888 to 716 acres in 1894. That statement can be verified by reference to the Customs officials, who, of course, have issued licences to tobacco manufacturers. From 1888 to 1894 there was a rapid fall in the area under cultivation, and yet not a single factory had disappeared or ceased operations. Then there was an improvement for a period of two years, until, in 1897, the acreage had risen to 2,181 acres, when a factory was burnt down, and not rebuilt. Following on, there was a reduction during the next three years, and that brings us down to 1900, the year when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> says the competition was practically confined to one buyer by the amalgamation of the factories. Yet. from the very date which he selected the acreage under cultivation had steadily increased. In 1900 it was 199 acres, whereas in 1903 it was 407 acres. The very opposite result ought to have happened. If the theory of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> be correct, then from 1888 to 1897, when the number of factories remained the same, the acreage under cultivation ought also to have remained the same; but, instead of that, it fell enormously. Then it commenced to rise, and again it fell, and the only time when it began to make a steady advance was when all the factories had been brought into one combination, and the buying was confined to one person. In Victoria we get am even more extraordinary state of affairs. In 1888 there were 1,685 acres under cultivation. There was a steady decrease down to 1898, when the acreage had fallen to 78 acres. With such a big drop in the acreage under cultivation one would naturally expect to see, according to the theory of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> a considerable diminution in the number of factories. But what happened in that time? In 1891 a small factory was closed, and in 1896 a small factory was started. If the theory of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> be a good one, it means that the fall from 1,685 to 78 acres in a decade was entirely due to the fact that for four years one of the smallest factories in Melbourne had temporarily ceased operations. But, as a matter ' of fact," the diminution in the acreage took place before it was closed, and it continued after the other factory was started. Therefore, it is idle to try to make a general statement of that kind when the figures absolutely disprove it. Here, again, since 1900 - the yeast when there was only one. buyer - we find that the acreage has steadily increased. It has increased from 109 acres in 1900 to 129 acres in 1903. In Queensland the acreage has remained at a steady level during the last few years. It was 745 acres in 1899, 665 acres in 1 goo - the year of the alleged combination - and 686 acres in 1903. The only evidence I can find to show that a number of factories were closed anywhere is as to factories that were closed before the year which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> selected.

                    gives a table which shows that from 1879 to 1888 the acreage increased from 531 to 685 acres. Yet those are the years in which, according to
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline>
                    al number of factories were closed. Since the Commission concluded its labours, the figures for another year are available, showing that within a year there has been an increase of from 752 to 809 acres in New South Wales, from 106 to 169 acres in Victoria, and from 784 to 1,100 acres in Queensland. According to the theory of
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline>
                    since 1900, when the tobacco growers were reduced to one market, there ought to have been a still further diminution in the acreage under cultivation ; but it has been during the existence of the combination that there has been a steady progress. It was during the years when there was no diminution in the number of factories that the rapid decline took place. While I say that the theory advanced by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline>
                    in no sense accounts for the decreased acreage, there was an abundant quantity of evidence submitted by independent witnesses to show the real trouble with tobacco growing. Expert evidence was given, as regards New South Wales, by

                    <para class="block">Just before the passing of the Act in 1880 - that is, eight years before the honorable senator brings the figures under review - there were twelve fairly large tobacco and cigar factories in Melbourne, and a number of small manufacturers in Melbourne and country. Those who formerly made tobacco or cigars had now to cease manufacturing unless a licence was taken out. </para>
                    <para class="block">The very years to which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ferguson</inline> referred are those in which there was an increase in the acreage under cultivation, but the years I am dealing with are those which were specially selected by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> that is from 1888 downwards. From 1888 to 1900 - with the exception of the disappearance of a factory here and the appearance of a factory elsewhere - there was practically going on a gradual fall in the acreage under cultivation, side by side with the same number of factories. It was after the combine had been completed, or, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> the factories had come together, in 1900, that the acreage commenced to improve again. In his evidence, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ferguson</inline> gives abundant reasons for the increase in the acreage. He in no sense affirms that the combine had anything to do with that result. He shows that the American Civil War was a contributing factor to the development of the tobacco industry. He points out that the social development of that country had a big effect in that direction, because in a scattered community, small farmers manufactured their own tobacco when they were free to do so, but later on, when an Excise duty was introduced, and the larger factories were started, the small manufacturers did not find it profitable to pay the licence fee, and therefore ceased to manufacture. He deals with a multiplicity of matters of that kind, to which I do not propose to refer, except to say that there is not a single word in them to justify the statement that the drawing together of the factories, if it did take place, had the slightest effect upon the acreage under cultivation. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ferguson</inline> clearly affirms that the Excise duty was a big factor in that direction. In dealing with the evidence of the alleged combine on the local leaf, I am brought to the allegation made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> of unfair treatment against the growers with regard to the Tumut Prize Competition. </para>

                        <para>- They do not all say the same thing. In any case, it does not matter whether they do so or not, because the statement I am challenging is the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> who said, without any qualification as to the evidence given, that there had been two movements visible since 1888, namely, the drawing together of the factories, and the gradual diminution of the acreage under cultivation. It does not matter whether or not all the witnesses swore to that effect, because the figures presented by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ferguson</inline> disproved the statement. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> must have had those figures before him, and they clearly show that the number of factories remained stationary while the acreage diminished, but that when the combination took place the acreage increased. </para>

The statement made is that the tobacco produced is not that which Australian taste requires; and I shall quote evidence later on showing the opinion of the Government expert of New South Wales as to the Tumut tobacco. The evidence of such witnesses is entitled to greater weight than that of interested parties.

                        <para>- I apologize sincerely for occupying so much time, and I can only justify my action, first, bv the stupendous importance of the subject, and next, by the fact that it is easy in a short space of time to make allegations which require many hours to refute. If I detain honorable senators, I can only say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> brief though he was, covered so much ground, and made so many serious assertions that I feel compelled to take sufficient time in which to reply. The quotation I have read is an accusation of improper conduct on the part of the manufacturers. It is said that there was no one to watch the interests of the growers, who had no knowledge of what tobacco was sent to England, and, further, that one of the witnesses, who was originally an expert brought out by the manufacturers, swore that the tobacco which he produced would be worth 8d. per lb. in America. The first allegation is that the manufacturers broke faith with the growers in the matter of this competition. The evidence on -which I shall rely could have been obtained by anybody, either officially, or as it appeared in the public journals, or in the evidence given before the Commission. I have here the leaflet which advertised the competition, and laid down the conditions. I shall read one portion which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has made the ground of one of his charges, namely, that while the company paid 8d. per lb. for the quantity of tobacco which earned the first prize, it did not give 8d. per lb. for the balance of the winner's crop. The leaflet shows that the company never undertook to pay for any more than the two ton lot which formed the entry to the competition, as the following condition will show : - </para>

                <para class="block">What does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> mean by that, except that that price ought to have been paid? From the circular it is clear that the company never undertook to pay more than 8d. for the prize tobacco. The company offered four sums of <inline font-style="italic">£40</inline> each as prizes in different districts, and, in addition, offered to pay 8d. per lb. for the sample which won the prize. To say that they ought, therefore, to have paid the same price for the balance of the man's crop would be not only absurd, but contrary to the terms and conditions under which the prize was advertized. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> went on to quote from witnesses, and any one listening to the quotation I have just read, or reading through that portion of the honorable senator's speech must necessarily come to the conclusion that the man ought to have received 8d. per lb. for the balance of his crop, because of the statement that a witness swore that that tobacco was worth 8d. per lb. in America. Now, the witness did not do anything of the kind. </para>

The question then arose whether the sample wnich was said to be worth 8d. per lb. was a fair sample of the balance of the crop. If it was, it should have realized 8d. per lb., but if it was not, there was no reason why 8d. per lb. should be paid for the balance of the crop. When Creasy was recalled by the Commission he honestly told them that it was not a fair sample, but merely a picked' piece which he brought forward, with the natural pride which any man might have in the district in which he resided, as showing what the Tumut district could produce. </para>

That was the evidence of the expert buyer of the tobacco combine.

                        <para>- That is the way I should be disposed to read the standing order. If I were in the Minister's position I should not be inclined to run any risk. I personally feel interested in the passage of the Bill, and consequently I should have been pleased if the report stage had been disposed of to-night. Then the motion for the call of the Senate might have been moved to-morrow. The spirit and intention of standing order 233 is that a Bill shall pass every stage except the third reading before the call is made. I suggest that, by leave of the Senate, the Minister should amend his motion, so that the report on the Bill may be considered tomorrow. </para>

It seems to me that all that the standing order provides is that before the third reading of the Bill in question- the final and crucial stage - honorable senators shall be made acquainted with the fact that it is under consideration, in order that they may be in their places to vote upon it.

                    <para>. - When I ventured to address a few remarks to the Committee on the subject of wireless telegraphy last night, my honorable friend, the Minister of Defence, evinced a very lively anxiety lest I should make a speech of some duration. He seemed to think that when I commenced to discuss the large subject of the "All Red Line," my prolixity would be such that I should take at least two hours to do justice to it. I can assure my "honorable friend that I had no intention to speak for more than ten minutes. </para>

The anxiety of the Minister was not justified by the facts, nor will it be justified by results. I was saying, when the adjournment took place last night, that when the Postmaster-General returned from the Postal Conference at Rome, he announced that negotiations were being carried on with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Ward, the Postmaster-General of New Zealand, with a view to establish wireless telegraphy between Australia and New Zealand. After stating that inquiries were being made, the subject was suddenly dropped by the Minister. Now, however, I find that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walker,</inline> the representative of the Marconi Company is in New Zealand conducting negotiations with reference to wireless telegraphy. The conjunction of those facts leads us to the conclusion - in view of the absence of any information by the Government - that it is intended to establish a system of wireless telegraphy between this country and New Zealand. Honorable senators will also remember that it was mentioned as probable that the Government would instal a system of wireless telegraphy between Queenscliff, in Victoria, and Tasmania. </para>

                    SMITH.The representative of one of the wireless telegraphy companies has caused a. station to be erected at Queenscliff and another one in Tasmania ; and an exhibition has been given of the method by which messages are despatched and received. Therefore it seems probable - and we have simply to go by inference, because the Government have declined to give any information as to how the money is to be spent - that their intention is to erect a third station, somewhere in New Zealand, and possibly link up a connexion in that way. I am the more ready to accept that conclusion, from the fact that it would take about£10,000 to create such an installation. It is generally admitted that wireless telegraphy is less efficient and reliable than submarine telegraphy. If this system were installed between Australia and New Zealand, we should not have effected any betterment of the telegraphic communication between the two countries. Certainly we should have a third means of communication, but it would be inferior to the two existing ones. Further than that, the Pacific Cable Company is owne'd by Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and Great Britain. Australia is the largest partner, owning one-third of the shares. After allowing for various sinking funds, the deficiency amounts to a sum of which our proportion is about , £26,000 a year. It is proposed to instal a system which would undoubtedly reduce the number of cable messages sent over our own line. We should have two systems owned by the Government competing against each other, and the new system, laid down at a cost of £10,000, would be infinitely inferior to the present one. It is difficult for me to see what advantage would be gained bv the expenditure of £10,000.

                        <para>-I think that the number of operators is quite as great in one case as in the other. We ought to be very careful to see that any engagement which we have entered into between States or nations of the Empire is respected in spirit and in letter. When the negotiations were completed for laying down the Pacific Cable, each partner to the agreement was pledged to use every possible endeavour to influence all cable traffic over that line. That is an honorable engagement, which we should not in any way vitiate. Within fourteen days from the time when that agreement was come to, a Postmaster-General of New South Wales gave to the Eastern Extension Company certain privileges for which they had not asked before, and which there was no reason they should have. Our partners were unanimous in speaking in very strong terms of his action. A similar agreement was proposed in Victoria, and to the credit of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner, he refused to indorse the action of this Postmaster-General. To a certain extent Australia broke faith with the Pacific Cable Company by making that agreement. And if we established a system of wireless telegraphy between the Commonwealth and New Zealand, we should for the second time break faith with our partners in this great Inter-Empire scheme. Then I come to the section of the line between Victoria and Tasmania. There is a most unfortunate agreement between the Eastern Extension Company and the Government of that State. Not only did the company receive a large subsidy from Tasmania, but they obtained from its Government a concession by which they were guaranteed a revenue out of all proportion to a fair interest and profit on their outlay and working expenses. The Commonwealth has taken over the agreement, and it is quite immaterial to the shareholders in the company whether we send all our messages over that line or whether we send no messages, because if we did not they would simply come to us and say, " We have had no revenue from telegrams; you will have to make up the deficiency, because you guaranteed us a certain revenue." I know that at the present time the revenue exceeds the amount of the guarantee, and therefore, although we give the company so much per word, the guarantee costs us nothing. If, however, the wireless system actively competed against the cable between Tasmania and Victoria, the Commonwealth would have to bear the working expenses of sending cablegrams by wireless telegraphy to Tasmania, and for every word which we sent we should have to make up the subsidy guaranteed to the company for, I think, the next four years. </para>

                        <para>- No. Within the last few months we have agreed to a special rate, which I do not think the Commonwealth would care to increase. I was exceedingly anxious to get from the Government some information as to where the wireless telegraphy would be installed, because I have taken some interest in the question of submarine telegraphy. But as regards the two lines which it is most probable they intend to instal, in one case we should be depleting the profit on our own Pacific Cable, and in the other we should be taking from the Eastern Extension Telegraph, Company revenue which we should have to make up with a subsidy. Considering the wide expanse of Australia, and the possibilities of wireless telegraphy for shipping, and for connecting various portions of Commonwealth territory, it seems to me unfortunate that the Government have apparently picked upon the only two possible lines which would either deplete their revenue or necessitate the payment of an increased subsidy. Why should they pick out the only two lines in the whole Commonwealth which could injure us financially with regard to existing schemes? </para>

                    SMITH.Yes. The control of the purse is a great privilege. One of our most important duties is to see that the money of the taxpayers is expended in a way of which we approve. We ought not to be asked to vote a sum for any works without a definite statement as to what they are. If the Government propose to spend £10,000 on installing a wireless telegraphy system without giving any information to Parliament, they should put on the Estimates an item of £20,000 for making general investigations, and, after it has been voted by the Senate without any information as to how it would be spent, to use the money in making a survey of the transcontinental railway. The value of the information which would thus be obtained would redeem such an item from the reproach of being somewhat nebulous in its presentment. The only information concerning this item which has yet been presented to us is a minute by the Postmaster-General, as follows -

                <quote>
                    <para>Wireless Telegraphy,£10,000. - This amount has been placed on the Estimates as a first instalment of the cost of introducing the wireless telegraph system into the Commonwealth. </para>
                    <para>It has not yet been determined in which part of the Commonwealth the system will be introduced, but full inquiries will be made into a number of proposals which have been submitted to the Department, and when a decision has been arrived at lenders will be invited instal the system. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">Would it not have been well for the Government to make those inquiries before they came down and asked Parliament to vote the money?. In view of the fact that it will be sitting within six or nine months there is no desperate hurry in regard to the introduction of wireless telegraphy. No doubt it would be valuable from the point of view of shipping signals. Beyond that, it appears to be a sort of tov. Honorable senators seem fascinated with the idea of experimenting with a new tov which, if brought into competition with submarine telegraphy, would not be nearly so efficient and reliable. According to the second paragraph of the minute, the Department are making full inquiries into a number of proposals which have been submitted. Will the Minister of Defence indicate the nature of the proposals so that we may have an idea as to the direction which the investigations would take? We are not justified in voting a sum of money without knowing for what purpose it will be expended. If we were to say to the Government, "We will vote the money, and you can spend it as you like," the Ministry would be practically taking the place of Parliament. If we vote this money it will mean that we permit the Government, instead of Parliament, to decide what public works shall be carried out. That is a right which is claimed by Parliament itself ; and we are often told about the continued growth of the power of the Executive. The principle involved, as well as the proposal itself, is important ; and if we vote this money in the absence of the slightest information, we shall not be doing our duty to our constituents. We have the power of the purse, and we ought to see that the taxes, which are necessary for certain services and public works, are expended for the advantage' of the public generally. If we abrogate our functions and hand them over to the Executive, we shall adopt a system which is altogether wrong. If the Government have no idea how this money is to be spent, we ought to defer the vote until they have further pursued their investigations, and are in a position to bring before us some definite proposals. If the item be withdrawn until Parliament meets again next year, there will have been in the meantime the Imperial Conference; and we shall then have the benefit of the knowledge of experts as to the best methods of wireless telegraphy, and, possibly, as to the best company with which to enter into negotiations. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest has made a proposal that wireless telegraphy should be installed between some portion of Queensland and Papua. My own opinion is th'at £10,000 spent in other ways in Papua would give a much better return; but if there is a desire to spend money on wireless telegraphy, other than in connexion with the signalling of ships,' and so forth, I honestly think that it could not be undertaken with greater advantage than as between Australia and New Guinea. At- the present time, we have sometimes to wait for two months before we receive replies to communications from New Guinea; and wireless telegraphy would put us, in direct touch, and enable information to be obtained, possibly in two hours. The Government ought to be able to tell us whether it is intended to instal a system with New Guinea, New Zealand, or Tasmania, or whether the idea is simply the signalling of ships? </para>

                    SMITH.Senator McGregor made no objection to the long and able speech to which we listened this afternoon ; and I certainly refuse to be cowed into sitting down by the leader of the Senile. I am not responsible to any one but my constituents ; and I propose to speak as long as I think is needful on a subject of such importance. There are many competing systems of wireless telegraphy ; and the Government appear to have given a certain company a sort of preference.

                    SMITH.It appears to me that the Government intended to give that company certain rights and privileges to the exclusion of other companies. However, so many questions have been asked on the subject, that the Government have now expressed their willingness to call for tenders. So far as I can see, no reason has been given by the Government for any haste in this matter ; on the other hand, the Government do not appear to know what is intended to be done with the £10,000. I suggest that during the recess time might be profitably occupied irt further investigations.

                    <para>. - I hope the Committee will consider this question seriously. There is not only involved the question of wireless telegraphy, or any particular system that may be hereafter adopted- there is a much broader principle at stake. We are asked to sanction an expenditure that may take place at some future time, which, so far as indications go, is by no means close at hand. If this item were to read, " Submarine cable, from a point not stated to a point not ascertained, £10,000," honorable senators would certainly ask for further particulars. </para>

                        <para>- Even in the case of ships there must be one point on shore ; and the absence of one point is quite enough for my argument. We should, as [ say, require further information in the case of a marine cable, which is a means of communication familiar to us, and certainly details are all the more necessary in the case of wireless telegraphy, which, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> has pointed out, is practically in its infancy. Under the circumstances we should certainly hesitate before we vote so large a sum as £10,000, the expenditure of which is to be intrusted to the Ministry without any reference to Parliament. It would be well, I think, for the Government to submit some proposals to Parliament, and afford some information as to the different offers or systems they have investigated. As a matter of fact, however, we are simply asked to allow the Government during recess, if they think fit, to approve any one of, perhaps, a dozen different methods of wireless telegraphy, and to instal. communication in any part of Australia without reference to Parliament. All this expenditure is distributed <inline font-style="italic">per ca-bita;</inline> and from that point of view alone, much might be said as to the undesirability of allowing the Ministry to allocate to any one State so large a sum. </para>

                        <para>- If I were told that the money was to be expended in Tasmania, I should still vote against the item. However, we have no information whatever on the subject; and the Senate has a right to know for the benefit of which State it is proposed to expend the money. For the reasons I have given I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> will see his way to withdraw the item. To show the absurdity of the proposal, I direct attention to the fact that the very next line of the schedule is,. " Less the amount which it is anticipated may not be expended during the year, £20,000." </para>

                        <para>- I simply point out that this deduction refers to the whole of the States, and that in any case it is double ,£10,000. It will be absurd to vote £10,000 in the dark, with no information as to the application of the money. In these circumstances it is an absurdity to vote this ,£10,000 when there is another vote of ,£20,000 which we are told is not going to be expended. I cannot understand how any member of the Committee, who is here to look after the finances as well as the other interests of the State he represents, can agree to vote so large a sum of money as £^10,000 without knowing what is going to be done with it. If any elector in his State should say to him, " You voted ,£10,000 absolutely in the dark," what is he to say? The only answer ' he can give, if such an answer satisfies him, is, " The Ministry came down and asked for it." </para>

                        <para>- If it were for a specific purpose, there could be no objection to.it." This vote might just as well be proposed for ballooning as for wireless telegraphy, and could any member of the Committee justify a vote of ,£10,000 for such a purpose? He could only do so by saying, "I am perfectly satisfied that if the Ministry ask for ,£10,000 for a purpose so vaguely described as _' wireless telegraphy,' they ought to have it." Even if he did' say that he would be to a certain extent abrogating the duties he is sent here to discharge. I have on many occasions contended that in the Senate- we are extremely lax in dealing with the appropriation of large sums of money. We pass them year after year almost as a, matter of course. I admit that we can generally excuse ourselves on the ground that the sums asked for are allocated for some specific purpose. 'But in this instance we are left entirely in the dark. This vote of £10,000, if agreed to, will have to be allocated <inline font-style="italic">per capita,</inline> and each State will be compelled to find a certain portion of the amount; whilst no honorable senator from any State will be able to tell an elector in his State where the money is to be spent, whether it will be spent wisely or unwisely, or that he had any opportunity of judging that, in his opinion, fallible though it might be, it was likely that the money would be well spent. Such a request to act in the dark has never been made to honorable senators before. I ask the Committee to strike out the vote, as to do so will not in any way injure the Ministry. I am aware that, no matter when I speak here, even though I should be anxious to assist the Ministry, as I am sometimes, I am liable to be accused of desiring, to injure them. However. I can ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford,</inline> in this instance, whether the striking out of this vote would hurt even his feelings. The honorable senator would not be a worthy leader of the Senate if he did not invite us to consider all these things, and he should be well pleased when we show some interest in the disposal of the sums of money we are asked to pass. </para>

                    <para>.- I am very much interested in wireless telegraphy, and should like to see it installed between Thursday Island and Papua. Such an undertaking requires inquiry and the command of funds, and I agree with honorable senators who say that we should be asked to vote specific sums only for some specific purpose. The Postmaster-General, in his memorandum, tells us that he wants £10,000 for wireless telegraphy, and does not know where the money is to be spent. He says that he is going to make inquiries, and when he has done so will call for tenders for certain installations, and we have not the faintest notion where they are to be. I never previously heard of a vote being submitted, and a Minister justifying it by saying, " I shall make inquiries as to when and where it should be spent, and what amount should be spent." This is a good illustration in support of my contention that we are asked to vote money in an extravagant and reckless fashion. Let me give one reason why I think this vote should be struck out. Honorable senators will very likely be called upon to discuss the legality, and also the morality, of establishing wireless telegraphy between Victoria and Tasmania. We are under an agreement with the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company, and have undertaken to give them a monopoly in connexion with their submarine cable. Can we, in the circumstances, legally instal a system of wireless telegraphy, and can we honorably and morally do it? If Ministers should seriously consider the advisability of establishing wireless telegraphy between Tasmania and Victoria, they will be confronted with the question of whether it would be right to do it in the circumstances. I am inclined to think that it would not. If I sold out a coaching service between two places, and, in doing so, undertook not to carry passengers by vehicles between those places, and then were to take advantage of the latest developments of science and establish communication between them by means of a flying machine, although I might feel legally justified in doing so, I think I should also feel a little ashamed of myself. All the speeches I have heard on the vote go to show that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> would do well to withdraw the item. I should be prepared to vote money 'for the establishment of wireless telegraphy between Thursday Island and Papua if the Minister, on inquiry, could tell us that it could be done for a reasonable sum, but I am not prepared to support this vote. </para>

He desires that Parliament should trust him with the expenditure of a certain sum of money in connexion with wireless telegraphy, and he tells honorable senators as frankly as possible that at; the present moment he is unable to say where he will spend the money. </para>

                        <para>- I am putting the matter before the Committee with "brutal frankness," to use the expression that an honorable senator applied to me. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith,</inline> as was to be expected, dragged in the matter of the Pacific Cable, and I admit that he had- some justification, because there is some connexion between the two matters. He said that the Government  proposed to establish wireless telegraphic communication between Australia and New Zealand. That could not be done for  £10,000,  and will be likely to cost something more like  £20,000.  It is not the intention of the Government to undertake any such expenditure without consulting Parliament. I asked my honorable colleague whether he had any idea of connecting Thursday Island with New Guinea bv means of wireless telegraphy, and he said that that would be one of the first works of the kind on which he would think of spending money. . <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has said that honorable senators cannot trust the Government, and that if they give us £10,000 to spend they will not know whether they will not be committed to an expenditure of £20,000 or £30,000. In this connexion, I say that honorable senators should judge the Postmaster-General by his actions. We should speak of a man as we find him. and what did the Postmaster-General do last year? The Senate last year voted a sum of £19,000 to be spent in New South Wales, and £11,000 to be spent in Victoria in connexion with the construction df a telephone line between Melbourne and Sydney. </para>

                        <para>- The Postmaster-General called for tenders for the work, and he found that in consequence of a rise in the price of copper, the vote of £19,000 would have to be increased to £23,000, and the vote of £11,000 to £14,000. Did he in the circumstances commit Parliament to the increased expenditure? No; he very properly said that in view of the very considerable increase in the estimated cost of the line, it was only fair that Parliament should be given an opportunity to say whether it would vote the additional amount required for the work, because, when they agreed to the construction of the line, they were led to believe that so far as the contracts which were sought to be made were concerned, the cost would be £7,000 less than the amount of the tender. He did not spend the money. </para>

I understand that the installations of wireless telegraphy which my honorable colleague has in mind will not involve a very large expenditure in any particular case. There is a cable there which is constantly being frayed by the rocks. If we had communication by wireless telegraphy with Port Adelaide, fifty or sixty miles away, it would be a great convenience. Probably there will be an installation like that, or we may have communication established between Thursday Island and Papua. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope that the vote for wireless telegraphy will not be reduced by £5,000. If the Committee is not inclined to agree to it as it stands, I would rather see it knocked out altogether. Wireless telegraphy is, comparatively speaking, new. I wish to submit an illustration to those senators who are constantly telling us that the Commonwealth should do things on commercial lines. If there were a very large business, having dozens of departments, and if suddenly a new line were introduced, and a sum of money were required to open up business in connexion with it, in the nature of things very little information could be obtained as to the amount necessary to . undertake the new work profitably. But suppose the firm had a manager in whom the directors had a fair amount of confidence. The probability is that they would say to him, " This new line of business may be of great service to our company. We do not know exactly what amount of money is required, but we will put £10,000 at your disposal. You are not to involve us in further expenditure without our permission." Would not that be carrying on business on commercial lines ? </para>

                        <para>- It may not be possible to decide yet. It may be advisable to make inquiries before the money is spent. Some of it may be spent, as indicated bv the Minister of Defence, in establishing wireless telegraphy between Thursday Island and Papua. It may be said, " Of what benefit will that be to Western Australia or Tasmania?" No matter where a wireless telegraphy station is established in Australia, so long as that station is in communication with existing telegraph lines it will be of benefit to the whole Commonwealth. If Papua were connected with Thursday Island it would not be necessary to have a station connected with Papua in every State. One would be sufficient. A couple of years ago much was said about a few hundreds of people who live in King Island. Sometimes they are months without any communication with the mainland. Suppose King Island could be connected by wireless telegraphy with Queenscliff. Would not that benefit the Commonwealth generally ? We sometimes hear much about the Solomon Islands, the New Hebrides, and other parts of the Pacific. Inquiries that might cost a little money might be necessary to ascertain how many stations were required to connect the principal islands in the Pacific with the Commonwealth. One station in the Commonwealth would serve the purposes of all Australia It seems to me that the amount asked for is reasonable, in view of the vast possibilities that underlie wireless telegraphy. From that point of view, I should not hesitate to go before my electors in South Australia and justify my vote in support of this item, and I have not the slightest doubt that they would be generous and far-seeing enough to say, " You have done right." </para>

                    <para>. - I shall not follow <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford's</inline> example in referring to a matter that was dealt with last night, except by way of illustration. The position he takes up is that we should vote the sum asked for because we ought to have confidence in the Postmaster-General. But suppose the Government put on the Estimates £10,000 for the purpose of connecting two cities of the Commonwealth by means of the telephone, without naming them, and suppose when it was asked what places were to be connected we were told that that was to be determined by the Postmaster-General, irrespective of Parliament? I venture to say that we should refuse to vote the money. That is precisely the position in which we now are. We are leaving it entirely to the Postmaster-General's judgment, and taking it out of the control of Parliament, to determine how and where wireless telegraphy shall be installed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> has suggested that if Thursday Island were connected with Papua it would be of advantage to the whole Commonwealth, because the news obtained bv such means could be disseminated all over Australia. But ought not Parliament to have a voice in saying whether it desires that Thursday Island and Papua shall be connected by wireless telegraphy ? </para>

                        <para>- Precisely. It is a right and proper thing that this Parliament, not the Postmaster-General, should say what it desires in that respect. My main objection is that we are enabling the Postmaster-General alone to exercise what is our prerogative. As a rule Parliament never agrees to any item in an Appropriation Bill without knowing in. what manner and in what part of the Commonwealth the money is to be spent. But in this case we are asked to give the Postmaster-General an entire discretion. After the money is voted we cannot recover it, no matter if the policy inaugurated by the Postmaster-General is one of which we disapprove. For these reasons I urge every honorable senator to insist upon further information. There will be no hardship in postponing the work. </para>

                    <para>. - I approach this question with much caution, because I know nothing about the cost cf wireless telegraphy or matters connected with it. But a challenge has been thrown out by honorable senators opposite. We have been asked whether we are prepared to vote money for this purpose', and whether we can justify our action to our electors. I have no hesitation in responding to that challenge. We are asked to vote £[10,000 for the introduction of a system of wireless telegraphy. Whether £[10,000 is too much I cannot say, but I feel perfectly sure that the Postmaster-General would not put such an item in his Estimates without consulting the officers of his Department, who are in a position to express an opinion. Further, another place - which is supposed to. have the power to control the public purse - has passed the item. </para>

                        <para>- I have not said we should not. I simply point to the fact that the item has been scrutinized by another place. It has been suggested .that the Government will inaugurate a system of wireless telegraphy between the Commonwealth and New Zealand. The Minister of Defence has suggested that 'probably communication will be established with Papua. My position is this : At present every man-of-war in the Australian fleet is fitted with wireless telegraphy. We are to be asked at a later period to vote for a Bill to enable a survey to be made for the purposes of a railway with Western Australia. The Minister of Defence has said in introducing the Bill that the only justification for the construction of the railway would be for defence purposes. </para>

                        <para>- If honorable senators think that it is justifiable from a Defence, stand-point, to spend £[20,000 in surveying the route of that railway, then the expenditure of £[10,000 on an installation of wireless telegraphy is equally justifiable from that stand-point. The expenditure of the money on a survey would yield no immediate result, but the expenditure of this £[10,000 would produce some result, because it would be the means of establishing communication with the ships which we subsidize to defend our coast. In the interests of trade and commerce, however, the expenditure is quite justifiable. Not one or two, but many of the large mail steamers are fitted with the necessary apparatus for conveying messages by this method. When they come on to the Australian coast their apparatus is quite useless, except to communicate with ships similarly equipped. A short time ago, owing to urgent representations which had been made to me, I had to wait upon the Postmaster-General because ships were arriving from Great Britain and elsewhere without having been signalled. They were arriving in port before the merchants and consignees had received any notice that they were on the coast. Why ? Because, owing to its having laid upon a jagged bottom, the cable between Althorpe Island and the mainland had been worn out. Ever since the Commonwealth took' over the cable and telegraph lines, there has been no communication between Adelaide and Althorpe Island. </para>

                        <para>- That is not necessary, because there is a cable laid between the island and the mainland. Today the ships do not strike Kangaroo Island on their arrival. The honorable senator knows as well as I do that the first point which ships strike is Neptune Island, which has no communication with the mainland, and that the second point is Althorpe Island. The Federal Government have taken up the position that it would be too expensive to re-lay the cable to the latter island, and that even if they did, there would be no guarantee as to how long it would last. If this sum of £[10,000 is required for the purpose of introducing wireless telegraphy and making experiments, what better places could be selected for that purpose than those, islands, first in the interests of defence, secondly in the interests of trade and commerce, and thirdly, but chiefly, in the interests of the safety of the people who travel round the coast. </para>

                        <para>- I do not want a voice. The Government are intrusted by the country and the Parliament with the administration of certain Departments. They have the advice of expert officers as to the best places in which experiments should be made. Practically they say to Parliament, " We do not feel absolutely sure that wireless telegraphy is a success. We want to make some experiments, and, therefore, we ask for this vote." That is where experiments could be made. I. do not think that £10.000 would be a penny too much to vote for the introduction of the system, and when it had been proved to be a success, then we could decide upon how much farther we should go. I shall vote against the amendment. </para>

                        <para>- Inquiries could be made without money. The up-keep of an installation to New Guinea would be at least £1,000 a year. An engineer, an operator, and an attendant would be required at each station, and when honorable senators are prepared lightly to vote £10,000 for the purpose of making certain installations, they ought to remember that it will involve a continual recurring cost to the people. </para>

                    <para>.- An attempt has been made to make it appear that those who intend to vote for the item are going to commit a very serious mistake. I confess that, when I looked at the item for the first time, it occurred to me that it was quite unusual to ask the Senate to sign a cheque for £10,000, and let the Postmaster-General do as he liked with the money. But when we consider that it is quite outside the run of ordinary items, it puts quite a different aspect on the matter. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think so, although I admit that the subject-matter of the item is very debatable. Certainly there is room for differing as to whether it is correct to pass the item or not. The Postmaster-General, speaking with almost brutal candour, through <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford,</inline> has said. " Pass the item. I really do not know where I am going to spend the money. I admit that it is largely required for the purpose of making experiments, but I am not "going to do anything I should not do." To a verv large extent wireless telegraphy is still in its infancy. For the next year or two any installation would be very largely a matter of experiment. After all. I think there is some justification for the Minister of Defence in asking us to pass the item. </para>

                        <para>- I would advise the honorable senator in future to stick to Papua, and leave King Island alone. It may not be altogether ridiculous to contemplate a very early installation of wireless telegraphy between King Island and Victoria. Within the last few weeks I was a member of a deputation which waited upon the Postmaster-General to suggest better means of communication between King Island and Tasmania or Victoria, and one method suggested was wireless telegraphy. He said it would be a matter for inquiry, and that, if he found that the expenditure would be justifiable, he might accede to the request. Of course, it is entirely a matter for the fullest inquiry, and if it were found justifiable to spend any portion of this item in making an experiment between King Island and either Tasmania or Victoria. I have no doubt that, in his wisdom, the Postmaster-General. or his successor - for probably he will have a successor next year - would spend a portion of this sum in that direction. I feel justified in voting for the item. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not think that the information, if it can be called information, which the Government have vouchsafed justifies us in voting ,£10,000. At the same time, there have been demonstrations of the practicability of wireless telegraphy between Tasmania and Victoria, and sooner or later that means of communication may come into general use, where it is not expedient or commercially economical to lay cables. Under the circumstances, I feel justified in voting for the reduced sum of £5,000. I make this explanation, because I am of opinion that, having put our hands to the plough, we should not turn back. If the Government were to frankly ask for ,£4,000 or <inline font-style="italic">£5.000'</inline> for the purpose of making further experiments, which the Commonwealth Government could very well, and, probably, ought to make, I do not think we should refuse to vole the money. </para>

                        <para>- They have done so. There are places where cables have been laid, and have been damaged several times; for instance, between Swan Island, where there is an important lighthouse, and <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> mainland of Tasmania. There are other places similarly situated where it might be a matter of urgency, 'when the cables have parted, to establish more permanent communication such as that afforded by wireless telegraphy. It will be seen, therefore, that there are some reasons for intrusting the Postmaster-General with a sum of money for purposes of the kind, which cannot be definitely described without further expert knowledge. The criticism which the Government have received on this matter is thoroughly well deserved. The Minister of Defence is in the habit of bringing important questions before the Senate in a most slipshod manner. After placing on the table proposals for us to worry at without proper explanation, he later obtains information which he ought to have had at hand at first. The honorable gentleman now contends that we ought to pass the motion, because he has been "brutally frank" enough to say that he knows nothing about the matter. Had it not been for the speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> we should have been justified in throwing the item out ; but under the circumstances I shall support the reduced vote of £5,000. </para>

                    <para>. - This amount is not ear-marked for any particular purpose, but is to be used principally for the purchase of type and type metal. The Treasurer has already spent upwards of £100 on the purchase of numbering machines, which, it is expected, will save their cost in two years. This expenditure of £1,500 is to be under the control of the Treasurer, and it is anticipated that a considerable portion will be devoted to the purchase of type, metal, and other material necessary to keep the printing office of the Commonwealth in good order. </para>

                    <para>.- It is about time the Committee was made aware of the manner in which the printing required for the Commonwealth is conducted. Some five years ago some thousands of pounds were voted for the purchase of type, printing material, and linotype, monotype, and printing machines and presses. That money was voted in the belief that the machinery and type purchased would be utilized for Commonwealth purposes only. I am informed, and, I believe, reliably informed, that the present methods adopted in connexion with this work are anything but business-like - that they are somewhat on the " go-as-you-please " principle. If rumour be correct, the State Government have purchased little or no type during the last five years, and type bought and paid for by the Commonwealth has been extensively used for State purposes. Those who know anything of the work of a printing-office will admit that when types become mixed up it becomes almost impossible to use them, and if they were mixed it would be almost impossible to pick out the Commonwealth type from the State type. If the type is being extensively used for State purposes it can now be of little or r.o value to the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- If for the privilege of being allowed to occupy a small building in proximity to the State Government Printing Office the Commonwealth plant and machinery is being used for State printing we are paying very dearly indeed for the privilege referred to. Who is responsible for looking after the property in these buildings which belongs to the Commonwealth ? I believe that there is only one gazetted Commonwealth officer who has any responsibility at all for the Commonwealth printing plant. He is in charge of the linotype department. I do not say that those who are in charge of the printing machines are not competent, and do not thoroughly understand their work, but if these machines have been driven in the way I am informed they have during the last five years the plant must have considerably depreciated. I understand that one-half of the time they are occupied with State work and the other half of the time with Commonwealth work. The work, I understand, is given out in this way : There are a number of printers, machinists, and operators ; foremen give out work to the employes, and the time is taken during which they are employed on State work and on Commonwealth work, but it is almost impossible that the time occupied on Commonwealth and on State work can be accurately kept, and the bookkeeping system adopted must be. entirely unreliable. </para>

I do not suppose that the State would have any objection to Commonwealth printing being separated from State printing. In the interests of both Commonwealth and State, it is time that we raised our voices in protest against the present happy-go-lucky, go-as-you-please system. The probability is that in a very short time valuable type, the property of the Commonwealth will become almost obsolete, as it is employed in doing State as well as Commonwealth work. </para>

The Commonwealth work is to him and to all the employes in the office a secondary consideration. I do not say that they are not concerned about Commonwealth work, but they are responsible to the State Government, and not to the Commonwealth Government. There is no inventory taken of our property, and there is no Commonwealth employe in charge of the type or machinery. </para>

There are computers who make up the time, and when the accounts are sent iii the Commonwealth pays for the amount with which it is charged, and the State Government for the amount charged for State printing. In all the circumstances, I say that it is almost impossible that under such a system the time occupied on State and Common wealth work respectively can be estimated with absolute accuracy, or in such a way as to give satisfaction. </para>

                    <para>. - Last year and the year before I brought this matter under the notice of the Senate. In supporting what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> has said, I point out that, in addition to the value of the machinery which the Commonwealth has lying in the small building close to the Government Printing Office, we have scattered all over the office itself a large number of costly modern machines, which have become so valuable to the State that they are in constant use. But we have no one <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> supervise the working of them, no one to see that they are not damaged, and no one to act as a Commonwealth computer to check the State computer as to the amount of work done by the State for us. When these new Commonwealth machines were brought out and set up it naturally took a considerable amount of time to teach men to work them. Before they had learned to manipulate them properly, some damage was done to the machines. I have tried to find out whether under our system of bookkeeping any arrangement has been made whereby an amount for depreciation is annually written off the value of the machines. But I cannot ascertain whether there is or is not such an arrangement. As these machines are being worked by members of the State staff, we should find ourselves in this peculiar position, if it became necessary to set up an office of our own : That the machines were more or less worn out, that parts were broken, and that we had no men of our own to work them. It is obvious that the members of the State staff, some of 'them being entitled to pensions and other privileges, would not be likely to transfer their services to the Commonwealth. We have paid for teaching these men to work our machines. </para>

                        <para>- But the greater part of the work done by the machines is, as a matter of fact, done for the State. We have no check on the State in respect to what it charges us for the work done. I do not for a moment suggest that it would wilfully treat us badly, but I complain that the present system is not businesslike. We have no check over the material used, and no allowance is made to the Commonwealth for the new labour-savking machinery which it has purchased to do its work, and wh'ich is used to do the State work also. The amount of money spent by the Commonwealth on printing machinery, according to a return supplied at my request last year, may be stated as follows: - Sixteen linotype machines cost ,£14,004 7s. 9d. ; three monotype machines, £[2,633 I3S- 2d. ; four printing presses, £3,260; four book-bind: ing machines, £[771 ; general printing plant, ,£11,000. Almost as much money has been spent in general printing plant as in the linotype, monotype, and bookbinding machines. The expenditure includes a large number of modern machines, some small and some large. </para>

                        <para>- I think not ; type is purchased from time to time as required. In addition to that unsatisfactory state of things, I wish to point out that at the time the Commonwealth proposed to purchase printing machinery of its own, the Government Printer advertised in the chief cities of the States for linotype operators. He mentioned the rate of wages that they would receive. It was announced, I think rightly, that applications would be received from linotype operators in all the States. Consequently, a number of men came over from the other States to work in the office. I know that some men came over from Western Australia. That was a very fair arrangement. But the first time there was any difficulty in connexion with their work, they approached the Federal Treasurer, in whose Department they were. But they were told that they were not Commonwealth employes. Consequently they went to the State Government Printer, from whom they learnt that they were not wholly State employe's either. In fact, the position became so acute, that, although the wages were fairly good, the feeling of unrest was so great that the men who came over from Western Australia, with the exception of two, have returned. Several to my knowledge have gone back to Queensland. In my opinion, there ought to be an understanding that if they show ability, there will be some chance of their receiving permanent appointments. If we do not have some arrangement of the kind there will be a danger that, if at any time we desire to establish an office of our own, we shall experience considerable difficulty in obtaining the services of good operators. That may easily happen in the printing trade as it has happened in other trades through the demand for first-class men becoming great. </para>

                    <para>. - While we shall all agree that there ought to be sufficient Commonwealth officers to look after our printing plant, and to see that it is kept in good order, I think that it is also fair for us to agree that the State shall use our machinery. Honorable senators will, I think, assent to that proposition when they remember that long before we had any plant of our own, we made use of the State plant to do Commonwealth work. It would be very ungracious on our part if any objection were made to the State using our plant now. Apart from that, I am under the impression that, in spite of the modern machinery which the Commonwealth has purchased, the State has, perhaps, more plant than we have. </para>

Of course, I quite agree that we should have sufficient Commonwealth officers to supervise and to see that the work done for us is charged for fairly. That is only reasonable. But to find fault with the State officers for making use of our plant, seeing that we had the use of theirs, wou;ld be most unreasonable, especially in view of the fact that probably a portion of the State plant is requisite for doing our work. </para>

                        has urged that the present arrangements in connexion with the Government Printing Office are unsatisfactory, and lead to confusion, and that the Commonwealth has no inventory of the plant which it has purchased.
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Croft</inline>
                        has argued that the machinery which the Commonwealth has purchased is scattered all over the office, and that there is no one to look after it. If there is any irregularity, and our plant is not being looked after as it should be, we have to thank
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline>
                        for bringing the matter under our notice. But 1 am totally opposed to the idea that we should establish a. printing office of our own. One of the most monstrous things I have heard in this Parliament was the statement made two or three years ago by a Minister that the Commonwealth and the States could not work together for the purpose of carrying out public works. The people of the States and of the Commonwealth are the same people, and our expenses are borne practically out of the same revenue, although a certain portion of it is earmarked for State, and a certain portion for Commonwealth, purposes. We have been told that £31,000 has been spent on printing machinery. But we have not been told what is the value of the machinery owned bv the Slate.

                        <para>- Let me give an illustration. I recollect that some time ago <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne declared that he would have nothing to do with public works - that lie would not even consent to the building of a post-office - unless his own officers were responsible. After a great deal of discussion. Parliament consented to the appointment of an Inspector-General of Public Works, and a number of other officers. In fact, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne insisted upon creating a Federal Department. But only a fortnight ago <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne - I forget in connexion with what matter - said that Stale officers might be trusted to look after and protect Commonwealth interests. That was the same Minister who, a few years ago, had insisted upon the necessity of appointing Commonwealth Public Works officers. It appears to me that my honorable friends, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Croft</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> are arguing in the same direction. I should like to know what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Croft</inline> means by saying that our machines are' " scattered about " the Government Printing Office. Would not they be scattered over various rooms if we had a Federal Department? Again and again during the past six years in the Senate, and the other House, members of Parliament .have expressed unbounded satisfaction at the way in which the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff has done its work, and at the way in which that publication, and other printing, have been produced by the State Government Printing Office. </para>

                        <para>-We ought, in my opinion, to do everything we can to work in co-operation with the State's. We ought to keep down the cost of the Federal government. It seems to me a monstrous idea to suggest that we cannot trust a printing office, almost next door to this Parliament, to do all our printing, without having a spy there in the form of a Federal officer to see that the time is properly kept. If it is difficult to keep the time, there might be an officer employed to check the work, but if we cannot trust the Victorian Government Printer - an old and experienced officer, who I suppose gets a salary of £800 - to divide the work between the State and the Commonwealth, then what is he fit for? Is it not offering an insult to him to say he is not fit to do that? Would it not be folly to .appoint an officer at a cost of £4 or £5 per week to check a simple thing of that sort. </para>

                    <para>. - There is only one way out of the alleged confusion, and that is to establish a Commonwealth Printing Office. I think it must be admitted that if we were permanently located anywhere the composite system which now prevails would be unsatisfactory. But it must be borne in mind that we are only here tentatively. The argument for establishing a permanent Department in co-operation with the State points to what at least one of the States is verv much afraid of, and what would be very wrong in itself, and that is the fixing of the Federal Parliament in Melbourne. We ought to have all our arrangements as easily transferable as possible, in order that whenever the time came to permanently locate the Federal Capital - either100 miles or further from Sydney, or at Sydney, it might be - we could do that with , as little expense as possible, and obviously the more complete the Departments we created in Melbourne, the more difficult that operation would be. With reference to the printing for the Commonwealth, it will be remembered that in the early stages the whole of our work was done under very high pressure with the machinery that the State had. It had a very ample supply of machinery for its own requirements, but it had not provided machinery to meet the necessities of two distinct Governments, the other rapidly becoming bigger than itself so far as printing was concerned. When it was necessary, as it soon became necessary, to largely augment the plant it could not be expected that the State would undertake all the extra cost, knowing that in the ordinary course of events the Federal Parliament would be removing to some other place, and would require the additional plant for its purposes. Therefore, it was necessary that the Commonwealth should undertake some responsibility in connexion with the enlargement of the concern, which it did in the purchase of a considerable quantity of necessary machinery. </para>

                        <para>- I quite agree with the honorable se'nator, if there is any doubt on that point, but that cannot be done on these Estimates. If the abuses are as great and widespread as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> has alleged the only way to ascertain the facts is by instituting an inquiry. That cannot be accomplished either by a discussion or by omitting the item. The better course would be to submit a specific motion, and bring up concrete facts more definite and complete than those we have had. I am not in a position to say that there may not be great cause for complaint. </para>

                        <para>- No. Speaking not as a Victorian, but as a member of the Commonwealth Parliament, I admit that we are necessarily under a very great obligation to the Victorian Government. They met us in a most gracious and generous manner, when, if I may so express it, we came as a necessity of the Constitution to Victoria to live. Some persons said they did so with the view of fixing us here. I do not think that there is any justification for that remark. I think that the action of the State Government has been prompted by a truly generous Federal spirit. I deprecate any suggestion that the State is imposing upon the Commonwealth. </para>

The Executive enjoys the confidence of Parliament, and we have a right to assume until proof to the contrary is presented that this Department, with others, is being administered with care, watchfulness, and necessary supervision. If a question were presented to the Minister in the Senate, I dare say that it would elicit most complete information. We cannot expect any one Minister to know the business of all the Departments. All we have a reasonable right to expect is that when difficulties are presented, the leader of the Senate will obtain information for us. </para>

                        <para>- The objections which have been raised seem to me to be unfairly exacting. I do not say that everything in the Printing Office is as it should be. It is reasonable that under existing circumstances there should be some uncertainty as to the exact use and application of each machine where two complete sets are employed conjointly to do the work of two Governments. If the State were to say, " We are sorry that you are dissatisfied ; but for the future you can do your own work on your own machines," we should immediately be placed in a difficulty. Of course, we should place ourselves in a position to get our work done, but the immediate result would be that we would not be able to do our work for some time, and to equip ourselves for that purpose would entail an expenditure of probably twice as much as we have already5 incurred. </para>

                    <para>. - I rise to corroborate every word which has fallen from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith.</inline> I think it is well that a representative of another State should say that we quite appreciate the generosity with which we have been treated by the Government of Victoria. This discussion suggests that we should hasten the establishment of a Federal Capital as much as possible, in order that we may have our own printing office. It must be remembered that we are not charged rent for the use of the Victorian Printing Office. Probably <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> knows a great deal more about the state of the printing plant than any one in the chamber. I do not find fault with what he has said, but I think that the time has come for us to pass the item without further delay, and to admit, as I believe we all do that the Victorian Government have done everything which could reasonably be expected. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> expressed the opinion that it is only reasonable that the State and the Commonwealth should co-operate. We all indorse that sentiment: but the statements of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findlev</inline> show that, as a matter of fact, there is' no' system of co-operation. On the contrary, there appears to be no definite organization; and that view was confirmed by the Minister when he interjected that the whole thing is a sort of " go-as-you-please " arrangement. Sufficient has been said, in the absence of any answer from the Minister, to justify a call for inquiry. I do not know enough to affirm that the time has arrived to start a Commonwealth printing office, or to say whether that would necessarily be the more expensive course. But if the Minister is not in a position to give any information, it is, I think, incumbent on the Senate to take steps to obtain information by some other means. </para>

                        <para>- In view of that question, I need not go any further. Is the Committee prepared to go on voting sums of money for we know not what? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline> that staunch apostle of economy, says that economy is to be conserved by voting any sum the Minister asks for, without our knowing what plant or machinery we have now, or what is going to be done with the money. The statement has been made that the Commonwealth makes no payment for the use of the machinery in the State printing office; but I should like to know whether, when Commonwealth work is done on State plant, a percentage is not added to the cost for the use of that plant. I do not know whether there is such a practice or not. </para>

We have never yet had a satisfactory explanation of the item from the honorable gentleman, who has practically told us with great candour, as he told me on another occasion, " I have told you all I know, and I know nothing." We cannot, of course, have an inquiry at this stage, but I hope the Minister will give us an assurance that some investigation will be made into the many statements which have been made here, so that he may be enabled, at a short date, to offer some explanation to honorable senators. If the Minister does not do so, I suggest that honorable senators who think with me, should take steps to have a committee appointed, or to ask the Printing Committee to inquire and report. At present 1 can only regard the position as exceedingly unsatisfactory. </para>

                    <para>. -In answer to questions raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Croft</inline> last year, I went fully into this question, and honorable senators appeared to be perfectly satisfied with the explanation I gave. All the criticism that has been offered to-night simply amounts to an allegation that present and past Treasurers, including <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner, have failed to look after the interests of the Commonwealth as they should have done, and have allowed the business in the Government Printing Office to get into such a fearful state of confusion as to occasion loss. I had to go and see <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner on the subject, and he expressed the opinion, with which I agree, that it would be much preferable to have our own printing office, managed bv our own officers. But at the same time, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner assured me that the expense of such an undertaking was prohibitive, and that the arrangement, which he made at the inauguration of the Commonwealth withthe </para>

                <para class="block">Spring-streetoffice, although not absolutely satisfactory, was the best possible under all the circumstances. The men at the Government Printing Office are in the employ cf the State, with the exception df one man, who, because of his special knowledge, is engaged by the Commonwealth to look after some of the principal machines. The arrangement with the Spring-street office is reciprocal ; that is, we use their type and machinery, some of which is quite equal to our own, and they use a certain amount of our plant. The paper and other necessary material are, I understand, supplied from our own stores ; and the men are paid according to the time they are employed. If a man is employed on Commonwealth work for an hour he gets <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> docket on which that is stated. If he is employed on State work, he gets a similar docket. When the wages are to be paid, the men bring up their dockets and show that they are entitled to payment for so many hours' work. Then the time during which they were working on Commonwealth work is paid for by the Commonwealth, and the time during which they were employed on State work is paid for by the State. I can assure honorable senators that I shall bring the statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> and others to the effect that there is some confusion in the conduct of the business under the notice of the Treasurer. I am quite confident that he will look into the matter, and when I submit the Estimates to the Senate, as I shall have to do shortly, I shall be prepared with information on the subject. I am willing to supply honorable senators with all the information I can if I am given sufficient notice. In this case, I guarantee that the Treasurer will have the matters referred to thoroughly looked into, and I shall be able to supply honorable senators with information. If it is found that the reciprocal arrangement under which we are working is a fair one, well and good, but if it is found that we are paying more than we ought to pay, and the arrangement is not satisfactory, we shall make some alteration. </para>

                        <para>- I take, for example, the vote of £53,040 for field artillery, guns and ammunition. Can the honorable senator say how that sum is to be divided amongst the States? The Minister must recognise that this is a very large vote, and one of the largest votes for special defence material that has ever been submitted in a similarBill. </para>

                    <para>. - I think that the vote is ' sufficiently explicit. I could give an explanation with respect to every one of the items, but I cannot tell the honorable senator, for instance, to which States a certain quantity of saddle-trees, bits and accoutrements will go. They will be provided wherever they are required. The field artillery guns and ammunition will be distributed to the different States as they are required, and every State will get its share, but I am unable to say how many guns will go to one State and how many to another. In the same way the vote for camp equipment will cover the requirements for camps in the various States. </para>

I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> that before he occupied his present exalted position he frequently contended that it was the right of the Senate to be given time for a fair and reasonable discussion of the very important matter pf the Estimates. I should like the honorable senator to say now whether he will bring the Appropriation Bill before the Senate at such a time that it will- not be, necessary for him to ask honorable senators to rush it through after all-night sittings in the last two or three days of the session. </para>

It is only fair that the Senate should be given a reasonable time to- discuss the Estimates for the year. With respect to the business to_ be taken to-morrow, we shall deal first with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating's</inline> motion for a call of the Senate.
