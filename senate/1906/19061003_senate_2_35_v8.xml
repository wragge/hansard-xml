Senators Gould and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir J.</inline> H. Symon sent excuses on the ground of private business, and they could not come. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> was absent, and his leave of absence had expired. He sent no excuse, and I must leave it to the Senate to decide whether or not any action shall be taken. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. When the Commission was deliberating upon the evidence with a view to arriving at some conclusions, naturally there was a difference of opinion. Four Commissioners thought it advisable that the existing duties ought to be increased on certain conditions, whilst four others considered that, from their point of view, the existing duties were quite sufficient to give all the necessary encouragement to local industries. I suppose I ought to state why I voted for the recommendations in favour of the imposition of increased duties. In the various States', the Commission took a vast body of evidence with respect to not only harvesting machinery, but agricultural machinery generally. But, so far, the discussion in the Senate has centered round harvesting machinery. </para>

                            <para>- Another striking feature of the discussion is that, in the view of those who have spoken, there is no manufacturer in Australia but Hugh Victor McKay. Apparently he is the only individual who has agitated for the imposition of increased duties, and given any reasons why they should be levied. The Bill deals exclusively with agricultural machinery, including harvesters. In most of the States the Commission found that factories for the production of various kinds of agricultural machinery had been in existence for years, and had sprung up under various conditions. The opinion was almost universally expressed by the manufacturers that the imposition of increased duties was necessary. There were very few instances in which the witnesses asked for increased duties for the purpose of raising the price to the consumer. The evidence tended to show that these industries were in danger from foreign competition owing to the greater aggregation of capital in America and elsewhere. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable senator looks at my declaration, I am afraid that he will experience some difficulty in carrying out the nailing operation. I do not believe that the Act, viewed from the point of view of honorable senators opposite, will be very effective. I conceive that it will probably have a deterrent effect upon trusts and monopolies in Australia, and to that extent prove beneficial; but it cannot operate in any appreciable degree in regard to trusts in other parts of the world. The cry of honorable senators opposite, when the Australian Industries Preservation Bill was before us, was: "Why not come honestly forward with proposals for the imposition of higher protective duties?" Now that the Government, acting upon 'the recommendation of a section of the Tariff Commission, are coming forward with proposals for increased duties, they are being met with just the same objections that were urged against the Bill referred to. It was not with the idea of obtaining increased prices for their productions that any of the manufacturers of agricultural machinery put forward their claims for higher duties. They feared that unfair competition on the part of trusts and combines in other countries would have a prejudicial effect upon their industry, and I think that the experience of the past has been quite sufficient to justify their alarm. Several manufacturers in South Australia gave very straightforward evidence with respect to not only harvesting machinery but other agricultural appliances, and honorable senators have only to turn to the evidence of Messrs. J. F. Martin, Bagshaw, and Rees, in order to ascertain that they have no fear of Australian competition. When it was suggested that manufacturers in other countries might come to Australia, the gentlemen referred to unanimously declared that they had no fear. They said, " Let them come here and compete with us under similar conditions, and we are prepared to take our chance."That really is the substance of their evidence. Some of these manufacturers have been known to me for many years, and I would readily accept their word upon a question of this kind, because I believe that they are honest in their endeavours to do the best they can for themselves and the country in which they live. I should like to call attention to one feature of the recommendations of the Commission. Many Australian manufacturers and inventors complain that, after having devoted their time, intelligence, and money to the development of machinery and implements suitable to our conditions of climate and soil, copies of their inventions have been taken to America and imitated there by manufacturers, who have immediately sent their products over to Australia, with the object of underselling those engaged in the Australian industry. At the same time, it was pointed out that if machinery developed in America were copied in other parts of the world, it could not be introduced into the markets of the United States of America, because of the prohibitive Tariff restrictions imposed there. Hence our manufacturers considered that they had a just claim for protection against the manufacturing organizations of the United States. It will be noticed that agricultural machinery and implements which have been invented or developed in Australia, such as combined harvesters, stripper-harvesters, stump-jumping ploughs, and seed drills are given a distinct preference. </para>

                            <para>- I am referring to the first recorded instance of shipbuilding. If any of the ancestors of the honorable senator were sailing about the globe before the time of Noah, I shall be very glad to hear about them. Special ties in the way of machinery and appliances and methods of construction may be founded upon ideas which have been in existence for thousands of years, and any developments of this kind belong to the country in which they take place, just as fully as if the original idea had been conceived there. Take, for instance, the stump-jumping plough. Would any honorable senator say that that development originated in any other country? The idea of the plough was conceived thousands of years ago, but this particular development was first brought into practical use in South Australia. Consequently, it is a purely Australian application of the plough. There is evidence that that instrument has been copied in America, and the probability is that the American machine will soon be competing in Australia just as the American harvester has already done. We should, in considering this subject, disregard the name of Hugh Victor McKay. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> has shown that that gentleman has spent time, money, and energy in the development of the machine that has brought him his fortune, and I do not think that any honorable senator would begrudge him the success that he has attained. But there are other men in Australia who have also been developing the same machine, and are still endeavouring to improve it. I believe that they will even surpass the Sunshine harvester in time. Are these men to run the risk of spending years of time and thousands of pounds in developing a machine, only to have it copied in America, and to be undersold by importers? </para>

                            <para>- The local manufacturers, of harvesters have a right to consideration. The Tariff Commission, in considering its recommendations, proposed to give them the advantage of a higher duty than now obtains. The Commission proposed that machinery invented in Australia should have an additional duty of12½ per cent., while general machinery should have an additional duty of per cent. I consider that the Commission was wise in adopting that principle. It also recommended, in the interests of the primary producer, that some arrangement should be made with the manufacturers for a reduction in price, consequent upon an increase of the duty. That principle has also been embodied in the Bill. The Tariff Commission considered that the workers in the industry should receive some of the benefits of protection. As a result of that, another Bill relating to the one before us provides that if the manufacturers are not prepared to share the profits arising out of their increased output with their workers, they will not receive the advantage of the increased protection. The Bills before us embody the recommendations of the Tariff Commission fairly well. There has been a slight alteration in connexion with the duty on stripper-harvesters to comply with the request of many manufacturers who desire a fixed instead of an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rate. The advantages and disadvantages of that proposal have been amply discussed. One advantage was suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> by way of interjection - that it would put it out of the power of the Minister to interfere with the business of importation, as has been done in the past. It will have a still greater advantage in preventing dishonest importers from cooking their' invoices and endeavouring to make the Customs Department believe that their machines can be produced at a lower price in other parts of the world than in Australia. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator is probably right under ordinary circumstances, but there are cases in which articles can be introduced at a nominal value, and thus defeat an almost prohibitive duty. So long as it is left to the importer to state the value of an article, there is always a risk that he will get over the Customs in some way or other. It is marvellous to notice the methods that importers have adopted to cheat the Customs. Nothing short of prohibition would prevent them doing anything of that kind. But the local manufacturers have declared that they will be satisfied with a reasonable duty, to put them on an equality with producers in other parts of the world. I think that the Tariff Commission, in making the recommendations it has done, arrived at a very fair medium, and I hope that the duties set forward in this Bill will be carried into effect. </para>

                            <para>- I am aware that a very subtle distinction has to be drawn ; but, in the Legislative Council of South' Australia, I have ruled out of order an amendment affirming " That this Bill be not further proceeded with until the finances of the State are in a better position." That proposal would have raised a discussion upon the whole question of what was the position of the finances of the State - a subject which was not relevant to the Bill under consideration. It seems to me that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild's</inline> amendment - raising, as it does, the whole business of the session - can scarcely be considered strictly relevant to the Bill. </para>

                            <para>- Certainly I can. However, I have no desire to do that. I merely ask that the consideration of more urgent matters should be proceeded with. If my proposed amendment be not relevant to the Bill, I have spent twenty-five years in" a State Parliament without learning of a single instance in which such a proposal has been ruled out of order. Of course, it may have been my misfortune to be a member of a Parliament which did not follow the practice of the British Parliament, though there was a standing order which declared that that practice should be followed. Having looked through our Standing Orders, I fail to see any reference to amendments to Bills such as you, sir, have indicated. </para>

                            <para>- I submit that there is a vast difference between the proposal which you, sir, have cited, and that which I desire to submit. In the former case the amendment was to absolutely refuse to proceed with the consideration of the Bill in a most indefinite manner, but my proposal is merely to postpone the consideration of this Bill until matters of more pressing consequences have been dealt with. Of course, if you rule me out of order, I shall be able to say all that I desire to say upon an amendment to the effect that the Bil] be read this day six months. If you rule my proposal out of order, I shall take a course which will be in consonance with your ruling, but which will not restrict my freedom of action in any way. </para>

                            <para>- My party? I think the senators, with whom I have the honour to be associated, will be here quite soon enough, and in sufficient number, for the comfort and peace of mind of the honorable senator. It is not a question of "my" party, and, with the honorable senator's permission, I shall change the word to "our." The press, which has given the present Administration unbounded support, is now " turning dog," as the phrase goes. We cannot pick up a morning paper in Melbourne without reading the strongest strictures on the conduct of public business by the present Ministry. If it were not for the ever-existing excellent temper and kindly disposition of the Minister of Defence and his colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> - both of whom, I make free to say, have endeared themselves to every honorable senator who has his heart in the right place - the course of public business in this Chamber would have been very different. I think we can all agree with the words used by the President, a few days ago, when he described this Chamber as resembling a bear garden. We have seen the most extraordinary developments during the last few days in the conduct of public business - developments which warrant the postponement of all but the most urgent public measures, in order that an appeal may be made to the masters of this and another place. We have had honorable senators making the strongest speeches against a Bill, and afterwards voting for it. I pass no strictures on those honorable senators; but, as an old public man, I know what ir. means, and the journalists of the daily press, and others familiar with parliamentary life, also know the meaning. The Prime Minister, in his speech at Ballarat, eloquently and vehemently denounced the demoralization of Parliament - not a demoralization that involves corruption, but a demoralization which precludes the satisfactory conduct of public business. Who can deny what happened yesterday in connexion with the passage of a measure here, which I then pointed out would have to be treated as a new Bill when it went to another place? By the daily press this morning we see that the Ministry have recognised that fact, and have issued something like an informal" whip in the hope of keeping together members who desire to go north, west, and south, with a view to secure election. We cannot blame those members of Parliament ; but the position of affairs as described in journals, which are far more friendly to the Government than to the Opposition, is that every effort is being made, and every tactic, and every dodge adopted to postpone the general election to a time when the farmers - and the great producers of the country - will not be able to vote bv reason of the strenuousness of their position in relation to the harvest. </para>

                            <para>- The observations, I submit, are relative to the amendment, which declares that this Bill ought not to be proceeded with. At the time of the last general election we had the great gerrymandering scandal, and now we have the scandal of everything possible being done in connexion with useless and pernicious measures, such as the one under discussion, in order to delay an appeal to the people. The business is being thrust on us in' a manner absolutely without precedent, unless, perhaps, in some 'South American Republics. There are on the Senate notice-paper four Bills for second reading, and one of a most contentious character in Committee. One of the Bills down for second reading is the Appropriation Bill for the whole service of the Commonwealth for the year ; and on the table of the Senate there is an official paper which shows that in another place there are no fewer than eight Bills awaiting second reading, all of which are supposed to be dealt with by the Senate. There are several other measures which have reached the Committee stage, and one of these is of an absolutely absurd character - being brought in to correct the bacl language of a previous Parliament, or of officials in the employ of the Commonwealth. We find the business in such a condition that, owing to the interesting question of the appointment of Judges to the High Court, Parliament is without a law adviser. I suppose we shall have a few more amending Bills introduced in order to correct the bad language found in them. </para>

Unless we adopt the amendment, either the law must be broken, or there must be a prorogation of Parliament without the passing of measures of greater consequence than is this miserable Bill, by which it is proposed to confer immense benefits on a firm the members of which were not prepared, before a Royal Commission, to give any information about their business. One of the two supporters of the Ministry in the Senate gave us, last night, an excellent speech of about two hours' duration. It was delivered at the rate of about from 75 to 80 words a minute, and, as an exposition of stonewalling, was a verv fine effort. It was done so well that no one would have thought that the honorable senator was stone-walling. I compliment <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> on his admirable effort. </para>

How is it that the business of the Senate has become so congested ? Why is it necessary for me to move that the Bill be read a second time this day six months ? It is due to the contemptuous manner in which the Senate has been treated by the Ministry. They are not even prepared to introduce in this Chamber a Bill to amend their own bad language. One of the principal reasons for this awful congestion of business is that six or seven measures all stand in the name of one Minister, who for some months has been conspicuous by his devotion to cow shows and pig pens in his electorate. It is consequent upon that honorable gentleman's absence at these interesting agricultural functions that we find the public interests absolutely jeopardized. The courtesy that one honorable senator may extend to another, whether he be an independent representative or a creature of the Crown as a Minister- </para>

                            <para>- Then I shall say servants of the Crown. "Creature" is a very old word, and has a significance nowadays that was never thought of in times gone by. There is a vast difference between the man who 'sacrifices his independence as a representative of the people in order to be a servant of the Crown, and the man who does not. I have not sacrificed my independence, and am free, as a representative of the people, to complain of the acts of Ministers, who. although apparently on a higher plane of official responsibility-, are not on a higher plane of responsibility to the people. They have neglected their duties in Parliament, with the result that we have to-day a congestion of business without parallel in any Legislature. We find that the legal business of the Parliament is in a deplorable state, because the Minister of all Ministers who should be capable of attending and advising members finds, apparently, that the shadow of a coming appointment prevents his devotion to the public interest. Instead of trafficking with a Harvester Bill and other measures which are asked for by only one firm, we should deal with more pressing business that is left in the background. It is impossible to follow everything that appears in the press in regard to this noxious business of harvester jobs; but, so far as I know, only one firm has sought to obtain, not merely protection, but prohibition, in respect of these machines. Indeed, the speech made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> would lead one to suppose that the object of this Bill is to secure not protection, but prohibition. The honorable senator said he was not going to raise the cry of free-trade or protection. I shall not do so, for I do not think this Bill necessarily involves either proposition. But it certainly involves an extraordinary departure from all decent procedure. It is a departure from all decent usage that a Bill should be passed for the exclusive benefit of one set of individuals. </para>

                            <para>- I was drawn aside by the interesting observation made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> as to the building of walls. This Bill shows clearly that the authors of the Australian Industries Preservation Act recognise that it is practically a failure. If it were what it is claimed to be, this Bill would be unnecessary. The Australian Industries Preservation Act was heralded as a measure that, in the course of a month, would abolish trusts. It has been found, however, to be a dead letter, and now the great Parliament of the Commonwealth is engaged in passing measures for the good fortune of individuals and separate corporations. It as a motet deplorable situation for what is supposed to be a national Parliament to occupy. A large name was applied to the Parliament, and big things were expected of it; but we have come down to trafficking in peddling measures for the aggrandizement of individual firms. This Bill ought not to be passed. It ought not even to be read a second time six months hence, but I cannot move that the second reading be postponed beyond that time. During the next six months I hope that there will be an opportunity for the people to show their sense of proportion in legislation. I have moved the amendment in order that the voice of Australia mav be heard at the polling places - that we may ascertain whether it is the desire of the electors of the Commonwealth that their would-be great national Parliament shall become a huckstering shop for the advantage of individual manufacturers. I do not consider that the question of protection or free-trade is involved, and I shall not discuss the Bill from that stand-point. But I do think it is a Bill for the advantage of one or two persons who are known and some persons unspecified, lor these reasons, and for many others, the Bill should be read this day six months rather than at the present time, and we should proceed with the consideration of the measures which must be passed before the close of the session if the administration of the. Commonwealth is to be decently conducted. It is necessary at the end of this year to deal with the great kanaka question. I do not propose to discuss it now, but, apparently, from the views expressed by Ministers, it is impossible to carry out the laws passed by this Parliament to deal with that question without additional legislation. We are trafficking in the harvester business, whilst the great question of White Australia - to which some honorable senators profess to attach-, so much importance - is trembling in- thebalance. </para>

I am unable to understand why the interests of the Commonwealth should be sacrificed to the interests, political or otherwise, of one or two Ministers. We occupied some time in dealing with a measure which was infinitely dear to the heart of one Minister, and infinitely bound up with his political fortunes.

I was sent here to represent the people, and not to be a jack of all trades for any Administration. I decline to subordinate the trust imposed upon me by the people of my State to the fortunes of any Ministry. The whole financial service of the year is bound up in the Appropriation Bill, which was read a first time in the Senate on Monday, and which we should have been discussing long ago. On a proposal to expend public money on a useless enterprise, we can find 20,000 reasons for discussion extending over weeks. If a Bill is introduced in connexion with harvesters, to enrich some person who is already rich, we can spend unlimited time over that. There are other measures to which I might refer; but I shall not do so, because I have no desire to unduly occupy the few short hours which will be left before so many members of the Federal Parliament have gone away on electioneering business that there will not be a quorum in either Chamber. With all kindly feeling, I warn the Minister of Defence that, by taking up valuable time in the consideration of comparatively trifling, and individual interests, he is running the risk of being left without a quorum in this Chamber, or in another place, to carry on really important business.

                            <para>- I am glad to hear the Minister assent to that statement, because I feel that I have given the Government reasonable help. Though I have been opposed to one or two of their measures, I have expressed my opposition briefly enough. I have not touched upon the Bill itself, because I prefer to see it postponed, and dealt with after the people have had an opportunity, at the coming elections, of saying what they think should be done with this and with some other measures. If they are placed on the statute-book, of what use will it be to consult the public about them ? Every conceivable topic under Heaven has been dealt with in one or other of the measures submitted this session. What are we going to consult the people about? Those members of the Senate and the House of Representatives who must shortly submit themselves for reelection will go before their constituents, not with a number of reforms to offer the electors, but full of apologies for the action of Parliament in passing trumpery measures to the disadvantage of the community. I am not personally affected, because my term of office will not expire until three years hence; but I think that those who have to seek re-election should, in sporting parlance, be given a " fair run for their money." Let us be content with passing a Bill to amend the bad language of the Government, the Appropriation Bill, and one or two other essential measures, and not continue sitting, with barely a quorum present dealing with questions seriously affecting the public interest. Surely it is not unreasonable to ask that measures of paramount importance, such as some of those on the business-paper. shall be postponed until we can be sure of attendances at' least as Targe as the statutory quorum. The people, in voting for the Constitution, did not think that Bills of this kind would be discussed in the House of Representatives when only six or seven of the seventy-five members which constitute that body were present and. by the suspension of theStanding Orders, hurried through the Senate of thirty-six members in the presence of only three or four. </para>

Having protested against a procedure without parallel in the other Parliaments of Australia, and contrary to all decent parliamentary methods, and especially to the constitutional principles and rules which should govern the chief Parliament of the Commonwealth, I consider that I have discharged my duties to those who sent me here, and shall say no more on the subject. </para>

                        <para>. - When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> yesterday spoke of the policy of the Commonwealth as being protection, I understood him to mean the Victorian idea of protection, which is practically prohibition. If he had said moderate protection, I should have agreed with him. In the framing of the original Tariff some years ago, it was generally recognised that the intention was to afford more or less protection to Australian industries, and I did what I could to carry into effect <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton's aphorism of revenue without destruction. Now we are being asked to throw overboard that idea, and adopt the Victorian ultra-protection, building a wall round Australia to keep out all imports. Moderate protection has had good effects, and has proved useful in enabling industries to be started here against the competition of those in the old world, which may have been in existence for years, or even for centuries. But there is a great difference between encouraging industries by moderate Customs duties and prohibiting importation, thus preventing competition, which, on fair lines, is a good thing for the community. Whenever it is1 seen that an industry is being crushed out bv importation, the rates of duty can be altered. The Tariff Commission was appointed to consider to what extent alterations were necessary, but instead of its reports being fairly considered, with a view to the removal of anomalies, and the further protection of such industries as may require it, the whole Tariff is being recast, in order to bring about the prohibition without which the manufacturers of Victoria declare themselves to be unable to live. The result of the operation of the Tariff has shown that hardly any, if one, industry has been destroyed or injured. On the other hand, all the facts and statistics available show that the factories in the Commonwealth have never been more flourishing than they are. That is the best evidence we could have that we did a wise thing when, remembering that live States were more or less protectionist and that one was free-trade, we agreed to a compromise Tariff. Like the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> and ether newspapers, some honorable senators may compare the Tariff with the Canadian Tariff, and say that it is shockingly low, but the fact remains that, under its operation, our industries have flourished, the output as well as the capital has increased, the dividends have multiplied, and the male employes have increased in number. In the face of such convincing evidence, it can only be for a miserable party purpose that we are now asked to re-open the Tariff. I shall be no party to that. If there is one factory more than another which has flourished under a duty of 121 per cent., it is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay's</inline> harvester factory. What hypocrisy it is to imagine that he wants more protection ? I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> if he is capable of making a relevant remark, whether he can mention another industry in which he would prefer to invest his own money? </para>

I defy <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> to pick out an industry which is more flourishing than is that of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay.</inline> It has been demonstrated by statistics that of the two the primary producers are more important than the secondary producers. Of course they are both of importance to the Commonwealth. No one can look at our factories without being proud of them. No one would wish, by putting a line in the Tariff, to do one of them any harm, but we must do justice to the primary producers. I sympathize with every person engaged in industry, whether he makes boots or shoes or grows wheat or hops. I desire to do justice to all,- but I am now asked by the Government to do injustice to the farmer. I am weary of hearing arguments trotted out over and over again, and I suppose I have been in the Chamber less during the last forty-eight hours than at any previous period. I do not think that any one has yet laid very great stress upon the evidence which the Tariff Commission took from agriculturists. We all know that at Show time the farmers - God bless them - had a meeting, and selected representatives to give evidence before that body. On that point I shall read a paragraph from Progress Report No. 5 - </para>

                        <para>During the Royal Show week, in September, 1905, a meeting was held in Melbourne at which 250 delegates, representing the societies, attended, and a resolution was passed that representatives be appointed to give evidence before the Tariff Commission, protesting against any further duty on agricultural implements or machinery. Subsequently <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> C. Smith, of St. Arnaud, farmer; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. James</inline> McGregor, of Numurkah, farmer; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Duncan</inline> McLennan, of Warracknabeal, farmer; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Christian</inline> Nowotna, of Horsham and Murtoa, farmer, attended before the Commission and gave evidence as instructed by the meeting. They particularly objected to any increase in the duty on harvesters (see Special Report on Harvesters). They drew attention to the fact that, as producers, they had to compete in the markets of the world with their produce, that they had to compete with the cheapest labour and the cheapest land, besides being handicapped by having 10 pay high railway and shipping freights on their produce before it reached the selling market. - (Q. 65956.) They had also to pay high railway and shipping freight on the goods they bought and required for use on their farms. - (Q. 65967.) The farmers themselves had no protection against foreign competition, the duties on imported grain, such as wheat and oats, were practically inoperative, as farmers are exporters. They contend that the higher the duties were upon agricultural implements the less they would have available for labour and improvements upon their lands. - (Q. 66210.) "On every occasion," said <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. James</inline> McGregor, "when duties have been increased, I have found that the price has increased in proportion ; that is my practical experience. I could give you an instance of it in the purchase of a plough. A plough that .1 could get for ,£21 was, when some years ago the Tariff was raised, increased at once to ^22 10s." - (Q. 66210-13.) <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Duncan</inline> McLennan argued that the present duty of </para>
                        <para class="block">I2£ per cent, on agricultural machinery, in addition to natural protection, was amply sufficient for the success and development of the agricultural implement industry. - (Q. 66343.) </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">That evidence ought, I think, to be regarded by Senators Trenwith, McGregor, and others with the same sacredness and interest as that of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> and other factory owners. The farmers have to get their \iving in the Commonwealth, and therefore justice ought to be meted out to them. In the Tariff there was no item over which we had so much argument and trouble as thai relating to agricultural machinery. Every possible argument was then adduced. We considered the position of all the industries! and tried to do the fair thing. After a great struggle the protectionists managed to impose a duty of tsA- per cent, on the greater portion of the farmer's machines, together with a natural protection which we know is considerable, as they are all bulky. The evidence all goes to show that twenty-three manufacturers of stripper-harvesters, including <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay,</inline> have all clone admirably well under the operation of that duty. I ask protectionist senators what profit do they expect a man to make on the machine, or to be entitled to wring out of the farmer? It is well known that the farmer has his good years and his bad years. We have had seven bad years, one after the other, and hundreds of farmers have been struggling, for a bare subsistence. Now, taking into account good and bad seasons, what profit do my honorable friends expect a man like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> to make out of the manufacture of one machine? So far as I can understand, the cost of production is put down by many persons at from ^32 to £35 j but the Tariff Commission unanimously agreed that it did not and could not exceed <inline font-style="italic">£41.</inline> I have heard a statement that the American and Canadian manufacturers say that they can produce stripper-harvesters much more cheaply in North America than they can be produced in Australia, and that the invoice price of ^38 represents not only the factory cost, but the manufacturing profit for the head establishment in Canada and in the United States before the machines are transmitted to Australia for sale. Here is an invoice price of .£38, which represents the manufacturing profit. We are allowing now that it costs <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline><inline font-style="italic">£41</inline> to make a harvester. If he is allowed to sell the machine now at <inline font-style="italic">£8o,</inline> and within a year or two at <inline font-style="italic">£to,</inline> after paying for the cost of distribution, what an enormous profit he must make ! It is very difficult to get at the cost of distribution. In some cases it is given at <inline font-style="italic">-£112</inline> per machine, in others at ^17 6s., and in others at <inline font-style="italic">-£21</inline> 17s. But I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> puts down his cost at ,£27. If other manufacturers can distribute the machine for the sums I have mentioned, I find it rather difficult to credit that it costs <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> that enormous sum. We all know that when enormous profits are being earned every effort is made to conceal the information from the public. Assuming that the cost of construction is <inline font-style="italic">£40.</inline> and that the expenses incurred in connexion with the distribution amount to <inline font-style="italic">£20</inline> per machine, there is still a margin of <inline font-style="italic">£20</inline> profit for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay.</inline> The total annual output of Australian machines is 4.000, of which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> makes 2,000 ; the other twenty-three manufacturers dividing the balance between them. The imported machines number 1,400 per annum. I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay,</inline> not only annually places 2,000 machines upon the local market, but that he sends 400 machines to the Argentine. Therefore, he must be .making an enormous profit. </para>

It is .monstrous that because protection is a cry that wins votes, and gives power and influence we should be asked to throw over the primary producer, and leave him to look after himself, whilst we impose upon him an enormous ,tax in order to enrich the manufacturers. </para>

                            <para>- I am glad that the honorable senator has reminded me of that point, which is the most important of all. It is a very good thing to endeavour to make the factory owners pay fair wages, because the men are undoubtedly entitled to share in the benefits of any protection that may be granted; but I do not think that the method that we are adopting will prove effective. If the manufacturers had to reduce the price of their machines, what would be easier for them than to employ less skilled labour, and, by using inferior material, turn out a slip-shod machine? They could fully compensate themselves for any reduction in price by putting in bad workmanship and inferior material, and thus turning out a less efficient machine. </para>

                            <para>- No doubt that would be a. very large item. The manufacturers are not required to keep the machines in order after they are once disposed of, and they must make, enormous profits out of repairs. In adjusting this protection, and endeavouring, to do what is fair, we have to bear in mind that the cost of manufacturing the machines will be reduced every year. We have all heard of the specialization in industry which is carried on in the United States. We know that in boot factories, for instance, boots pass through the hands of hundreds of operatives, each of whom perform one small operation, and can handle hundreds of boots every day. These men are so thoroughly trained that they become exceedingly expert. Similar methods might very well be adopted by our manufacturers of agricultural machinery, in order to bring about a reduction in the cost of production which would more than compensate them for the smaller selling price. I am afraid that we are entering upon a hopeless task. It is proposed to give an undue measure of protection, for which the evidence given before the Tariff Commission affords no warrant. If the Bill be passed, the farmers will be unduly taxed, in order to enable the Government to run wild in connexion with their prohibitive protectionist policy. </para>

In reply to the interjection of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> I would point out that no State has made such sacrifices in the cause of Federation as has New South Wales. We have had to sacrifice our free-trade principles to a large extent, and this is a case in point. The farmers in Australia are much more numerous than are the manufacturers of stripper-harvesters, and ft is now proposed to punish our primary producers for the benefit, presumably, of a few manufacturers, one of whom is making upwards of .£20,000 per annum. </para>

                            <para>- I was always under the impression that Parliament was supposed to legislate for " the greatest good to the greatest number." But we are now going to abandon the greatest number in the interests of a very few, reversing what ought to be an axiom of legislation. I do not see how we can avoid introducing the question of free-trade and protection in such a glaring case as this. The Government is becoming a kind of patron to the ironmongering trade, stipulating at what price goods shall be sold. I never heard of such a thing as a Bill declaring the price at which a manufacturer shall sell his goods. </para>

                            <para>- He will still have half the protection which the Bill proposes to give, even if he raises his price above the stipulated amount. Do we want to see an ironmongering Government in Australia? The rate of duty proposed is absolutely prohibitive. The evidence collected by the Tariff Commission shows that the cost of manufacturing a harvester certainly does not exceed £41. It seems that the Canadian manufacturers can sell them for including manufacturers' profit. Add <inline font-style="italic">£12</inline> to £38, and, apart from freight and other charges, the price is brought up to £50. But what about the unfortunate farmers in Queensland who have to come to Melbourne or Adelaide to buy their harvesters? Why should they have to pay the enormous freight from these cities when they can get -their machines cheaper from abroad? It is a most outrageous thing to propose. Where does the Federal feeling come in? Under clause 4 of the Bill, the Governor-General has to be " satisfied." That is an entirely new thing. If he is satisfied, he may by proclamation reduce the rate of duty specified in respect to stripper-harvesters. </para>

                        SYMON (South Australia) [12.18]. - This Bill arises out of circumstances which appear to me to be so absolutely against the best interests of the country, and its origin is so extremely questionable that I shall be found opposing it at every stage. I desire in the first place, to offer for the consideration of honorable senators, two points to which they should direct their attention, and upon which I shall take the opportunity at a later stage to ask for the ruling of the President. We have a Constitution - though that sometimes seems to be forgotten - under which the Commonwealth exists. Under that Constitution two things were provided which are supposed to be essential to legislation upon sound grounds, arid also to the control of the Senate over legislation. The first section to which I direct attention is 54, which provides that -
                    </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>The proposed law which appropriates revenue or money for the ordinary annual services of the Government shall deal only with such appropriation. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">That section, of course, was intended to prevent the possibility of proposals relating to the appropriation of revenue being introduced, except in a Bill for that purpose. It arose out of conflicts which had previously taken place when a strong Government in the popular branch of the Legislature tried to thrust upon the other branch legislation of which it disapproved, and which, when associated with Appropriation Bills, it was supposed to have no power to alter. That provision does not apply in this case, except in a way to which I shall presently call attention. It is followed by section 55, which provides that laws imposing taxation shall deal only with the imposition of taxation, and that any provision therein dealing with any other matter shall have no effect. It seems to me that those who have been hugging to their hearts the idea that they are going to mitigate the mischief which, by common consent, this Bill, in its positive enactments will bring about - by reason of the two provisions to which I shall presently allude - are leaning upon a broken reed. In my judgment, those provisions will be absolutely worthless, and I intend to ask your ruling, sir, as to whether this Bill is not entirely out of order. In the first place, under it we are seeking to impose fresh Customs duties of a most onerous character. It is admitted upon all hands that it imposes an oppressive and a mischievous increase of duties. It was pointed out in the other Chamber that its effect will be to very largely increase the emoluments of makers, and particularly of one maker, who has in season and out of season <inline font-style="italic">per faso -et nef as</inline> brought about this piece of legislation. The House of Representatives thought it desirable to prevent this admitted robbery, and to protect the farmer from being fleeced. To enable that to be done, a provision was inserted in this Bill not for imposing taxation, but for regulating the prices at which manufacturers shall sell their goods. </para>

                            <para>- That is another matter. I say, unhesitatingly, that any such provision is utterly alien to the Bill, and with the utmost confidence I shall ask your ruling upon the point. I contend that the provision in question is a violation of the Constitution. The mischief of it is that it is a confession that the positive enactment of this Bill constitutes a downright robbery of a certain class of people, and that we ought to legislate in some way or other to "temper the wind to the shorn Iamb." Then it was felt that a further protection must be introduced. Whilst it was admitted that the farmers were likely to be fleeced, it was also felt that the enormous profits - all the sovereigns which were being pushed into the pockets of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> and others - came from the sweat of the brow of the workmen who did not participate in those profits. I wish to say that if we are to impose this high protection, which is making millionaires - and which will make multi-millionaires of a lot of these manufacturers - I shall join with my honorable friends opposite, if no other redress can be obtained, in attempting to insure that the workmen shall obtain a share of the profits. I tell all the protectionist patriots that that is the attitude which I shall take up if I am driven to it. I repeat that it was felt - before the Bill reached the Senate - that the workmen must also be protected against the machinations of the manufacturers ? What do the latter want ? Naturally, they desire to secure a profit. But they are greedy. They wish to obtain the most extravagant profit that it is possible to secure. They desire to obtain it at the expense of the farmers on the one hand, and of the workmen on the other. That is what the Bill admits. The redress offered to the farmer is that the prices which the manufacturer can demand for his machines have been fixed by the measure, and that offered to the workmen is that certain Customs duties shall be" levied, and fair conditions of labour must prevail. I say that such a provision is absolutely unconstitutional. We have no power to legislate in respect of conditions of labour. We have no power to tack on to a Bill of this character judgments of Arbitration Courts or resolutions of this Parliament in order to protect one class of the community against the machinations of another. I venture to say that both this Bill and the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Bill are unconstitutional. They are out of order. I did not intend to speak upon the second reading of this measure when I arrived, here this morning, but my sympathies are entirely with the amendment that has been submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild.</inline> What I have pointed out strengthens the view which I hope honorable members will take in opposition to hasty action in respect to this measure. The Senate is simply being made a dumping ground for belated legislation. I sa,y it with regret, but with all the earnestness of which I am capable, that the Senate ought to resent the treatment to which it is being subjected when we are on the brink of a dissolution of Parliament, and not merely of a prorogation. This Senate will be unworthy of itself and of the Constitution under which it exists if it tolerates it. If there were no other reason than that for my action, I should declare in favour of any motion which would postpone the consideration of so serious a Bill as this is. It is serious because we feel that without those safeguards in the two measures to which I have referred, and which I say are unconstitutional, we are not justified in passing them. The other Chamber has admitted that. It has declared that it is unjust to pass these enactments as they were originally introduced, and in order to insure their just working it has gone the length of violating the Constitution. I say all honour to the members of that branch of the Legislature for doing what they did, though, in doing it they violated the Constitution. I do not want to embarrass the Government in the slightest degree ; but I am not going to stand here and allow this thing to be done, so to speak, in the dark and in haste. Let us have the opinion of the farmers of the country, to begin with, if we desire to sanction the imposition of heavier charges which Parliament and the country declare they ought not to bear. Why should they wait until next year for the price to be reduced by £n per machine? The Government knew all the facts three months ago; and why did they not introduce a short Bill declaring that no machine should be sold for over ^70 after the 1st clay of July, or whatever was the date of the presentation of the report of the Tariff Commission ? It is a sham, . <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President</inline> -  a sham. I hope the farmers will know that the reduced prices are to be brought into force when every farmer has got his machine for the next harvest, at a price of £81, and that the additional £11. will go into the pockets of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay.</inline> If £70 will be a fair price in February, 1907, surely it is a fair price four months earlier. Can any one deny that that is a douceur and a bonus to the makers? All I can say is that I hope the farmers will understand the position, and that the members of the Government, including <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford,</inline> will be able to explain to them why the Government are willing that they shall be robbed of £.ri in October of this year, and not willing that they shall be robbed of that amount in February, 1907. I now desire to say one or two words with regard to the Bill itself. I do not wish to mention <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay's</inline> name, more than I do the name of any other man ; but I am obliged to do so, be'- cause he is the moving spirit of this part, at least, of this so-called Tariff Reform. We cannot read the evidence without realizing that fact - we cannot deal with the subject without, so to speak, continually "bumping up against" <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay.</inline> Therefore, I do not think that any honorable senators, either on this or the other side, can possibly be blamed if we occasionally mention <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay's</inline> name. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> was speaking, however, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> interjected, " Oh, there are other makers." Of course, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> is the great maker. </para>

If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> was the first maker, and his business has grown and flourished until he makes half of the machines sold in Australia, why should he be protected and coddled. I thought protection was given to encourage struggling industries, and that the Tariff Commission, whose information and report I very greatly respect, took the view that I am now putting. For instance, in regard to seed drills and fertilizer drills, evidence was given which showed that some 5,000 or 6,000. are sold per annum in Australia, but that of these only 500 or 600 are made in this country. Of course, that was a fair thing for the maker - I forget his name - to state. But what was the view of the Tariff Commission ? The Commission perfectly realized that they were not appointed in order to investigate the desirability of starting or developing new industries, but that they owed their origin to complaints about the ruin of existing industries. That was the foundation of the Tariff Commission's existence, and. therefore, the Commission, in their Progress Report No. 5, say - </para>

                    <para class="block">That was a perfectly natural request for those people to make. Of course, parenthetically, I may say that no higher protection on .these drills will help the farmer, because it will take years to enable the local manufacturers to increase the output from 500 or 600 to the 5,000 or 6,000 required ; and in the meantime the farmers will be paying, not for the establishment, but for the development, of a particular industry. But the Tariff Commission, it seems to me, take the right view when they go on to say - but we consider that cases and suggestions of this kind, turning in the direction of expansion and development, should be distinct from complaints and requests based upon actual injury and prejudice of existing and established industrial interests. </para>
                    <para class="block">Is that not what the Royal Commission was appointed for?

Why should we insult the Tariff Commission, by whom we profess to be guided, and for whose reports the Government, the Opposition, and everybody else, have been waiting?

                            <para>- There is neither protection nor prohibition in the legal- profession. I should welcome <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> into the legal profession as cordially as I welcome him in this Chamber. All that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> has to do is to devote a little of his spare time - though I know he has not much, owing to the number of people into whom he desires to instil the doctrines of protection - to read up <inline font-style="italic">Blackstone's Commentaries</inline> and two or three books of that description, when he may present himself for admission to-morrow, if he likes. We of the legal profession are the one set of people who are exposed to the freest competition by those who are properly instructed. </para>

                            <para>- The foundation of this Bill, so far as its so-called merits are concerned, is supposed to be, if anything at all, prejudice or injury to existing industries. Is there a tittle of evidence of such injury? Did the Tariff Commission discover any, or has the Commission reported any ? Has the Tariff Commission reported that this £12 shall be placed on the price of stripper-harvesters, or that the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty on seed drill fertilizers shall be doubled? Where is there a particle of evidence in favour of such a proposal? I should like to direct attention to a return presented by order to the House of Representatives on the 5th September, 1906. This return shows that the number of stripper-harvesters imported from Canada in 1905 was 1,000, whilst 730 were imported from elsewhere. Canada is one of our sisters of the Empire, for whom we are supposed to have a sentimental love and affection.' We hear gushing proposals for preferential trade with her, and yet, at the expense of the farmers and workmen of Australia, it is proposed to shut out 1,000 harvesters from that country. During the same year 2.700 stripper-harvesters were produced in Australia. That was the output of a deplorably injured industry ! </para>

                            <para>- These figures are most instructive. They show that in 1905 . 1,000 harvesters came from Canada, and 730 from elsewhere. I frankly admit that it may be said that these machines are probably not imported before June, but the fact remains that during the first five months of this year no imports took place. It is stated in the return that it is believed that the local production is increasing. This, then, is the position of a "crushed " and " ruined " industry, which is, so to speak, to be set on its legs by means of this measure. But this is not all. The return shows that we are exporting these machines. </para>

He does not seem to reflect that this increasing export and local trade is being carried on at the expense of one class of producers, upon whom mainly - if not altogether - the prosperity of the Commonwealth rests. In every respect, such an attitude is indefensible. I wish, however, to call attention to the position taken up by

I wish particularly to call attention to the unwillingness of those whom it is sought to aid, notably, the moving spirit in all this business, to supply information which might have guided the Commission in' respect of matters which they were desirous of investigating, with a view to arriving, at a just conclusion. I shall close that part of the matter by quoting from the report of the four protectionist Commissioners, at page 20, where they express their amazement at the attitude adopted by the manufacturers, chiefly by Messrs.

                            <para>- The Commission was quite justified in being astonished that the figures were not supplied and exposed to the fullest possible criticism. No doubt they know their own business. Is Parliament going to put more money into their pockets in respect of each machine, and to take that money out of the pockets of the farmers, at the instance of claimants who were unwilling to supply information to the Commission ? If we come to the question of profit, we have, at page 34 of the report of the protectionist Commissioners, a statement - based on the best figures they had - showing that, at a selling price of £81. the merchandising profit on the Massey-Harris machine was £3 is. 9d., on the international Harvester machine £13 is. id., and on the Australian-made machine £18 2s. 7d. According to that finding, the local manufacturers who went before the Commission with their tale of woe, and who are now coming before the Parliament as mendicants, not to take money out of the general revenue, but to take it out of the pockets of the farmers, actually made a merchandising profit per machine of £18 2s. 7d. These people, who are not satisfied with that profit, appear -to have sold in South Australia, in 1905, in round numbers, 1,000 machines. As there was no risk run in that year, because the farmers were well off, from. South Australia alone Messrs. McKay derived something like £18,000. Yet these are the people who come here and say, "We do not get enough profit; we cannot compete with people who are getting a merchandising profit of only £3 is. 9d. in one case, and £13 is. id. in the other, and we want you to put on a higher duty, to be taken out of the pockets of the farmers." </para>

My honorable friend was a member of the Tariff Commission, and I prefer the statements recorded in its proceedings, to private communications made to him or statements which, for advertising purposes, these people choose to put in the press. We ought not to have an investigation of that kind on the floor of the Senate. When, from the protectionist report, the farmers find that such statements have been made, what are they to think? My protectionist friends propose to allow Messrs. McKay to sell their machines at ; £8o or , £90 each until the requirements of the farmers for the harvest are supplied, that is to the extent of thousands of machines. It is only after next February, when the demand is over - in the season when none of them is sold - that my honorable friends say that the manufacturers are to sell the machines at £70 each. In the meantime, perhaps, Parliament may be invited, on a supposed further protectionist mandate, to remove that restriction arid allow the local manufacturers to do just as they please. The more we come to analyze this proposal, the more monstrous it is. What do my honorable friends think that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> V. McKay - this modest-minded man. who wants no additional profit - asks? His demand was for a duty of £25 per machine. Originally, the Government proposed a duty of <inline font-style="italic">£16,</inline> as they could not rise to his demand. At page 30 of the report, which, I think, is a mine of information, the protectionist Commissioners say that he urged that - </para>

Knowing them personally, I have the highest esteem for them, and, although we differ in opinion on the question of protection, I respect their views, and they respect mine. Martin and Company Limited are an old-established firm, standing high in the estimation of South Australia, and, I believe, of Australia. May Brothers have not been so long established but occupy an equally high position. Hawke and Company are a well-established firm, who have developed very largely, and, I think, intend to develop more in this direction.

Therefore, the competition which would seem to be feared, if feared ali all - I am sure it is not. feared by courageous and enterprising men such as I have mentioned - is the competition from Victoria.

                            <para>- Well, the report does not show it. It is these Victorian makers who are scooping the pool already, and want, practically, to drive the others out of the market. Two years ago in South Australia the price of stripper-harvesters was about £70. Honorable senators will find that on page 17 of the protectionist report. It quotes an advertisement in the <inline font-style="italic">Kapunda Herald,</inline> dated 19th December, 1904, announcing that James Martin and Company of Gawler- were prepared to sell stripper-harvesters at <inline font-style="italic">£yo</inline> cash, with a foot-note to the price-list offering 5 per cent, discount if three machines were ordered. Thus, if three farmers combined they could get their harvesters from Martin and Company at £66 10s. each. A telegram produced out of the possession of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Degenhardt,</inline> of Murtoa, showed that Messrs. Martin and Company had offered to the Murtoa Farmers' Union to supply stripper-harvesters for the season .1004 at £70, less 10 per cent., which is equal to £63. .... . </para>

                    <para>In March, 1905, before the South Australian manufacturers became parties to the combine - of which I shall say a word or two in a minute - the selling price of the machine in South Australia was about £70 cash. May Brothers and Martin and Company offered and sold machines at that price. The selling price of Hawke and Company, of Kapunda, was, however, £70 cash. </para>
                    <para class="block">That is to say, these immaculate people, McKay Brothers, joined - and, so far as I can see, were mainly instrumental in bringing about- a combine to raise the price of machines ; and it was in consequence of that combine, and as a result of what was contemplated by it, that the price was raised from <inline font-style="italic">j£-]o</inline> to as high as, in some instances, £90 or £95, coming down aga'r to £81. And the people who were most reluctant to join this combine were Messrs. James Martin and Company. Honorable' senators will find on gage j8 of the report that it was really bv an inadvertence that Messrs. Martin and Company got into the combine - </para>

He is a man full of energy and enterprise, and I am delighted to see that he was prepared to fight the thing out for himself. I find on page 19 that it was a telegram from Martin and Company which practically broke up the combine. In September, 1905, the deputation of manufacturers waited upon the Minister of Trade and Customs in Melbourne. </para>
                    <para>At that deputation a telegram was read from James Martin and Company, of Gawler, which had the effect of breaking up the combine. They said that they intended to reduce their price, and withdraw from the arrangement. </para>

Martin and Company, and in order to show that, at any rate, we have some honest, self-reliant manufacturers in Australia. Now I want to say a word or two about the report of the Tariff Commission. My honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best,</inline> asked just now whether I was prepared to adopt it. The essential recommendation of the report is that the duty should stand as it is. The recommendation of the protectionist members is, however, cut in two - </para>

                    <para>But then they add - I will not call it a bribe, because that might sound disrespectful to the Commission ; I am sure that they did not intend it in that way, but they make practically a combined arrangement, mixing up a reduction of price, an increase of duty, and a lever for getting better rates of wages for workmen. That was not a recommendation within their power, to my way of thinking. But I should like to call attention to the conditions that they attach to the second part of their recommendation. They say, first of all - </para>

                    <para>Just think what a complication that is ! - certifying to the foregoing effect, by proclamation, suspend the collection of such additional duty of12½ per cent. for such period as <inline font-style="italic">may</inline> be deemed advisable. </para>
                    <para class="block">This12½ per cent. is put on, not as a protective duty, not because it is wanted, not because there is not profit enough, but as a lever to compel these people who are already charging too much to reduce their price, and to pay their workmen a fair and reasonable rate of wages. What sort of manufacturers are they upon whom it is necessary to bring into play a coercive instrument of this description? That recommendation is now embodied in a Bill - which I say is not within the limits of the Constitution - to impose Customs duties. The duty is to be reduced if the manufacturers do not sell at a sufficiently low price. What does that mean? Is it not a legislative declaration that in-' creased duties increase prices? The maximum charge for a harvester is to be£70. Why are we, in a Bill of this description, to put on a duty to compel the manufacturers to reduce their price, and proclaim at the same time that if they do not reduce their price the duty must be taken off? This is not a duty for the purpose of relieving distressed manufacturers, or for the purpose of encouraging industry; it is a duty for an improper purpose which, as I have submitted before and intend to submit again as a matter affecting the business of the Senate, cannot be effected by any such measure as this. Again, what is the use of putting in a statutory obligation as to a reduction of price when there is no stipulation as to quality? We may say that the manufacturers are not to sell their machines for more than£70. </para>

                            <para>- Absolutely nothing. Then, as some one has interjected, what about repairs? It would be a magnificent thing to sell an inferior machine that would perhaps work for one season. There would be no reason to fear competition, and no comparison with imported machines. The local makers would have it both ways. They would have it in the less expensive quality of the machines that they put out, and they would have it in the increased cost of repairs which the farmer must be obliged to make. Could anything be more absurd than that? Look also at the other condition contained in the Excise Bill. Of course it is not an Excise duty at all. It is a misnomer to call it an Excise duty ; it is really an imposition, to be laid upon certain manufacturers under certain conditions. Look at this provision- </para>

                    <para class="block">Let us for a moment consider the position there. I was at first inclined to think that this was an excellent provision. I thought if we are to have these high protective duties we should see to it that the whole of the "boodle," if I may so call it, does not go into the pockets of the makers, and elevate them into multi-millionaires whilst their workmen are being compelled to live under straitened circumstances.

                    <para class="block">Look at the back-door kind of influence permitted ! Over and over again, in other Bills, we have had jurisdiction in important matters handed over to the Minister; but that policy was never exemplified in so indefensible a form as on the present occasion. The decision will depend on the Minister in power, and, may be, it will depend on the constituency. I make no imputation, but human nature is human nature; and I say that it may depend on the extent of the influence or power brought to bear by something in the nature of a combine on the Minister, whose decision is final. What protection is that to the worker ? A case may arise at the beginning of the recess, and no control can be exerted over the Minister until Parliament meets again. We cannot have a Royal Commission every time; and it might be impossible to have any investigation, owing to the fact that the Minister has given his decision verbally on information received, and has no documents connected with the affair. Anything more illusory never was invented. If we are to have provisions of this kind, I shall take care that, so far as I am concerned, they are just and enforcible, and that we shall be able, in the light of day, to insure the participation of the workmen in the benefits of the high protection. Paragraph / is framed in a cloud of words in order to make it absolutely useless. </para>

                            <para>- It is one of those inscrutable things that is equally a mystery to the Minister and myself. I have always found the Minister of Defence perfectly fair, and he says he has heard no reason why there should be this provision ; but I can give a reason why the provision should be struck out. I pass by the date which the Minister has given, and which is comparatively immaterial, though such a principle may shock any one. The words there are until the conditions - are either as advantageous to the workers as the standard conditions at the place of manufacture - "Standard" is not the kind of word that should be there. We had that word in the Spirits Bill, and the Minister agreed that it should not be there, but he voted against me when I moved its omission. What are the standard conditions? Who is to decide the question ? What would <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> say ? In his factory the conditions would be the standard conditions in the place -  or are declared by the  President  of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and 'Arbitration </para>

No, it is not that, because the only evidence we have, as shown in the report of the protectionist members of the Commission, is that higher wage's are paid in Canada than in Australia. </para>

                            <para>- Why should the Minister say that, seeing that it does not appear in the passage I have referred to? The reason that Canadian manufacturers can produce a little cheaper is that they have more up-to-date machinery, and, as the evidence showed, they are content with infinitely less profit than are the Australian manufacturers.

                            <para>- The fact exudes from the whole of the Tariff Commission's report, not merely that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> is coining money, but that he is coining so much that he is unwilling to allow the facts to be brought before the public. Is it because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> has not had Tariff advantages up to the present time? Each machine was taxed, according to the report of the protectionist members of the Commission, at <inline font-style="italic">£5</inline> 4s. 7d. a machine; but in consequence of the autocratic and much-criticised action - I do not wish to apply any severe words - of the 'Minister of Trade and Customs, in increasing the market value in the country of origin from ,£38 to £65, additional duty was charged, making the total £8 as. 6d. Therefore, no one can say that there is not a substantial Tariff advantage given to these makers at present, and, what is more to the point, that the present duties have the effect of producing revenue for the Commonwealth. It may be convenient at the close of the second-reading debate for me to formally submit the point of order which I have already indicated. I regard this Bill as one of the most important we have ever had to consider in the Senate; it is not a measure of minor consequence which we might pass without much consideration. The question is - are we to give increased profits to these already enriched manufacturers? The object of the Tariff Commission, and the object of all Tariff policy and Tariff agitation during the last twelve months or more, has been to strengthen weak industries, and give relief to those which seem to have been debilitated. That has been the desire of every one on both sides ; and we are all ready, whether free-traders or protectionists, to give careful and favorable consideration to any industry which was flourishing and healthy at the time of the imposition of the Commonwealth Tariff, but which is now suffering prejudice as a result of that Tariff. But we want the weakness to be proved, and the ruin or anticipated ruin made manifest. We were urged to pass the Anti-Trust Bill in order to save the industries of Australia from combines, not merely in Australia, but outside - to prevent individual enterprise being, so to speak, overtaken, and driven out by the overpowering and maleficent force of trusts and combines. One object of that measure, amongst others, was to prevent the harvester trust, if there was a trust, from doing damage in Australia. If any damage arises from trusts and combines, why should we not be content with that measure? Are we still to further inflate the profits of the local manufacturers by means of these duties? Let us be just. These Bills are admitted bv the protectionist members of the Tariff Commission to be unjust without the safeguards - those illusory safeguards - to which I have referred. Above all. let us be careful at this period of the session not to be hurried into agreeing to something of which we may bitterly repent; let us refuse to allow the Senate to be made the mere instrument of political exigencies, or of what would be wrong-doing, without ample time for reflection. </para>

                        <para>.- I was curious to know how this Bill would strike the critical mind of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon.</inline> So far as I know, there is no precedent for it. The point I intended to take when we got into Committee was that it is not a Taxation Bill within the meaning of the Constitution. It is true that it is in the form of a Taxation Bill, but I take it that in deciding whether it is such a. Bill or not. the well-known rule will be followed of looking past the form to the substance. A tax is a. general levy made on the " population in order to raise revenue for governmental purposes. An Excise tax is particularly a tax upon the consumer. As the origin of the word shows, it is something that is " cut off," something taken from an article that is consumed, and has, therefore, to be paid by the consumer. The process which a Go,vernment adopts in order to obtain it is to put its hands on the goods which are to be the subject of Excise as near the source of manufacture as possible, and to hold them in bond until the Excise is paid. This is called an Excise Duties Bill, but when we examine it we find that there is attached 10 it a schedule of so-called Excise duties which are not to be imposed except on certain contingencies which may depend upon the will of an individual Minister. I sub.mit that that does not constitute an Excise duty. If we read the measure, disregarding its title and form, this is a Bill to impose certain labour conditions upon persons engaged in certain industries with a penalty provided for a breach of those conditions, and the penalty is to be measured by the number of machines turned out at a certain rate. It seems clear that this is not an. Excise Bill, for the reason that the penalties proposed are not Excise duties. The man who manufactures these articles is to be allowed to sell them without paying any duty, and they will go into consumption all over Australia, and perhaps abroad. Then some dispute arises between him and his workmen as to whether the workmen are receiving fair conditions and wages. They make a complaint, and if they enlist the sympathies of some newspaper, the complaint will probably be heard by the Government. Some inquiry might be made, and the Government might then decide that the machines were not made according to the labour conditions prescribed. What would follow then? If the Bill means anything, I presume that what would follow would be that the Government would impose the penalty upon the manufacturer. But that is not levying an Excise duty. This is not an Excise Bill, but a measure which constitutes an offence, and provides a penalty for a breach of the offence in this form. The Government are trying, under this Bill, to do something which they have not the power to do under the Constitution. If they have not the power to do it under the Constitution directly, and in an open and above-board manner, they certainly cannot do what they propose in the form of an Excise Bill. What they could do under this Bill, if it were in order, would be to regulate the conditions under which manufactories shall be conducted in any State. They are interfering in a trading and industrial matter within a State. It has been shown over and over again that that is what the Government are always trying to do, and what they cannot do under the Constitution. We have power under the Constitution to deal with trade and commerce between the States, and with foreign countries, but we have not the power to interfere with trade and commerce within a State. That is what the Government are always trying to do, and it is what they are trying to do here. They are asking Parliament, in the form of an Excise Bill, to impose conditions of manufacture in a factory within a State, and possibly with respect to goods which will be consumed in that State only. We have no power to do that. They propose, if the conditions prescribed are not complied with, to levy the so-called Excise duties, after the goods have gone into consumption. That will not be levying an Excise duty, but exacting a penalty from certain manufacturers for a breach of conditions of labour laid down in this Bill. I say that if the .measure came to us in that form it would not be a Taxation Bill, and we could, therefore, amend it. The objection would be patent on the face of it that it proposed' to exceed the powers given to the Parliament under the Constitution. What I propose to do in order to test the matter, because I think it is one on which your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> can be obtained- </para>

                            <para>- There is an exception in cases where it is necessary to decide a point in order to fix the proceedings of the Senate. I might mention now that I think the proper way to test the matter will be to move in Committee an amendment instead of a request. If it is not a Taxation Bill we can move an amendment. I propose to adopt that course, and we shall then, probably, obtain the benefit of your ruling on the point. If you decide that it is a Taxation Bill, I suppose we could not get any further ruling on the point, but what I propose to do then is to move a request for the omission of the whole of the proviso in clause 2, on the ground that it exceeds our powers under the Constitution. This is a very difficult matter with which to deal, and, as I do not desire to take up very much time, I feel that I can do little .more than define my position in regard to it. In 1903, less than three years ago, I was proclaiming to the electors of Australia a policy of fiscal peace, which I explained to mean that there would be a period in the existence of this Parliament during which the Tariff would not be disturbed. That did not cover small alterations of the Tariff such as the removal of. hardships and anomalies, and I made the further exception that I should always be in favour of preferential trade. But it was understood at the time that the Government, of which I was a member, had adopted a policy which would prevent the making of any considerable change in the Tariff in the direction of giving increased protection during the currency of this Parliament. It seems to me that nothing that has since taken place between political parties can alter what was practically a compact between Federal politicians and the electors of Australia. I have not created the present situation. It has been forced upon me. I am in the position of having to vote upon a measure brought before the Senate, and I should, therefore, like to be able to consider it upon its merits. </para>

                            <para>- Soon after the last Government took office an inquiry was started in one of the Melbourne newspapers with regard to the condition of industries, and more particularly to those in Victoria, and under the heading, "The Strangled Industries," 'articles appeared from; day to day, reciting the condition of industries round about Melbourne, and describing the parlous state to which they had been reduced by competition with importations. Politicians were exhorted to do something at once in order to rescue these " strangled industries" from complete destruction. Tt was not only large industries that were considered at the time. A number of interesting accounts appeared of what might be called the smaller industries. A great number of them put in a claim for increased protection, and the understanding was that if anything were done, this great newspaper would certainly support the small industries in an endeavour to obtain the protection they were asking for. It is curious to note. and. to say the least, it is thought provoking, that the bitter cry of "the strangled industries^" of which we hear'd so .much, has materialized into n demand for increased protection for two industries only. which, of all the industries in Australia, have the least claim to such assistance. The time of this Parliament has been occupied during the present session with p demand for increased protection for the distilling industries. It has been clearly shown that no increased protection for that industry is needed.. It has been shown that under the Tariff the distillation of spirits has more than doubled in less than five years, the only difference being that the centre of activity has shifted from the south to the more northern States. Another demand has been made for increased protection for the harvester industry, and we had it from Senator Trenwith last night that those concerned in that industry do not claim increased protection, because their operations are not remunerative. They conduct a very large business, and, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> has said, a- most lucrative business. Yet they are asking for more protection. We. had this session a measure called the Anti-Trust Bill, which we were led to understand would do all that was needed, because, if necessary, the Minister of Trade and Customs could prohibit importation. It took a long time to pass that highly contentious measure, and last night- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> said he doubted whether it would be efficacious, because, in his opinion, the importers would find some way of getting round its provisions. Consequently we have, at the instance of the stripper-harvester industry, another Bill of a highly contentious character. It is one which I think should not be brought on at this late stage of the Parliament. Anyone who attempted to read the voluminous evidence taken by the Tariff Commission must come to the conclusion that if we who possess no special information on the subject are to give a considered judgment, we ought to have any amount of time available. But instead of time for reflection being allowed, this very highly contentious and, in many respects, novel legislation, is brought forward at a time when the Parliament is practically demoralized. </para>

                        <para>. - This is not by any means the first time that I have risen to address thu Senate on the subject of the stripper-harvester. I am sorry to say that the position grows in seriousness. I am surprised at such proposals as are contained in this Bill being allowed to remain before the Parliament so long as they have been. I do not believe that, so far, in the history of the Commonwealth, anything has been so calculated to shock the public sense of justice as' the action in connexion: with the stripper-harvesters. The Bills on the subject before the Senate are of a most extraordinary character. For the first time we have the prices of an article fixed in a measure. That is a monstrous and unheard-of thing. Just as well might we presume to regulate how wind should blow ! How the provision is to be carried out I should like to know. Are the various prices to be regarded as net or gross prices, as cash or booking prices? The whole scope of this Bill is ludicrous in that respect. It is provided that the stripper-harvester must be sold at a price not exceeding £80, otherwise certain consequences may ensue, but it is not stated whether or not that is to be a cash price, The sellers may say, " Our price is £80 cash, but if you take time to pay then, according to previous arrangements, certain charges will be added. You will have to pay so much for accommodation." In that way the cost may be brought up from £80 to £90. All the evidence relative to the stripper-harvester which has been brought before the Senate, or supplied to the TarifF Commission, has pointed in one direction, and that is that it can be made in Australia at about ^40 or a little more. Yet we are asked to pass a Bill in which, on the understanding that certain duties are imposed, it is provided that a price ranging from ^70 to £80 may be charged. This is put forward as a great gain to the farming industry. Surely the farmers are not so weak-minded, so easily gulled, as to be led to believe that the provisions of the Bill are at all necessary ! I wish to draw attention to some remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> when the Australian Industries Preservation Bill was introduced, and it must always be remembered that we owed that measure to the harvester agitation. When the honorable senator was speaking about harvesters he spoke about a chain of evidence as if the harvester industry of Australia were the object of a conspiracy- </para>

                            <para>- It has been stated that there was practically something like a conspiracy to injure the harvesting industry, and that harvesters bearing McKay's mark and brand were bought and sold under cost purposely with a view to injuring his industry. I desire to quote from the evidence put before the Tariff Commission to show how unfair that statement was. At page 1748 of the volume dealing with metals and machinery I find the following evidence: - 175. <inline font-style="italic">Massey-Harris</inline><inline font-style="italic">Selling "Sunshines." -</inline> Considerable capital has been made out of the allegation of unfair competition on the part of the importers, and much of the simulated fear of annihilation has been based on this ground. The instance of the " Sunshine " harvesters sold to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Claridge,</inline> Crystal Brook, South Australia, was made a great deal of by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> (see queries 17249 to 17299), as a proof of this unfair competition by Massey-Harris Co. Ltd. The following letter from Messrs. Clutterbuck Bros., the agents of Massey-Harris Co. Ltd., South Australia, deals with this matter. I can produce the original letter to the Commission if desired, as well as letters from the farmers referred to therein, which completely refute <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay'sallegation</inline> that these customers were approached by Clutterbuck Bros. 176. The letter reads as under : - "Adelaide, 29th May, 1905." " Messrs. Massey-Harris Co. Ltd., Melbourne. "Dear Sirs, - H. V. McKay, of the 'Sunshine' Harvester Company, in his evidence before the Tariff Commission, reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of April 29th, has seen fit to drag into prominence the name of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Burford,</inline> one of the partners of our firm, and to single us out for censure in respect to the unfairness of our business methods in the competition of this State for the stripper harvester trade. "In justice to ourselves, ' as well as to your company, we wish to refute the statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay,</inline> and to say that he has not accurately placed before the Commission the facts. " <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> asserts that we in 1904 endeavoured to undermine his business by purchasing 'Sunshine' harvesters at£90 each from farmers, who had placed orders with his firm, that we afterwards hawked them round the country offering to sell them for £80 apiece, and finally disposed of them to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Claridge</inline> at£75 each. " We say emphatically that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay's</inline> evidence in regard to our making overtures for the purchase of these harvesters is not correct, and the facts are as under : - " 1. Having been approached in four instances by farmers who had ordered from McKay, we exchanged four Massey-Harris harvesters for ' Sunshines' ; the customers in each instance, after ordering the 'Sunshine' machines, and expressing themselves as not satisfied with the McKay combination, indicated to us that in the event of our finding outlets for the Sunshines,' they would be prepared to exchange them for our machine, and pay for ours the price they had agreed to pay the 'Sunshine' people. We concluded deals with out friends on these lines, <inline font-style="italic">i.e.,</inline> these farmers paid us the full 'Sunshine' prices for the Massey machines ; these prices being several pounds in excess of the Massey ordinary selling rates. Consequently the farmers lost on these transactions, and not ourselves. "a. The four McKay machines above mentioned were taken from- </para>

At which price we would have been prepared to treat on a net cash basis with any of our agents for that number of machines. " Briefly, these are the facts concerning the transactions referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> in his evidence before the Commission, but he omitted to say, while endeavouring to injure our reputation for honest trading, that he, in 1903, purchased from customers of ours in the Mallala district of South Australia (Messrs.

                    <para class="block">Those statements appear to me to be absolutely conclusive, added to the statements which have appeared from time to time from all sorts of quarters, indicating how cheaply these machines can be made. The Senate by this time is very well aware that the cost of manufacturing them is very largely added to before they reach the hands of the farmers, by the system under which they have to be sold, and that the price contains very considerable amounts of what may be called conditions for tuition, for repairs and so on. All these factors have been purposely ignored, and the price has been stated to have been what it was not. The public have been gulled. The more the facts relating to this matter are looked into the more obvious it becomes that the Minister of Trade and Customs has largely exceeded the demands of justice, that he has taken arbitrary steps, that he has done things that were not called for, and that either by mistake or by design we now have before us measures for adding to the statute-book duties which are not required, and which can only be described as an imposition. </para>

                        GOULD (New South Wales) [3.54] - I feel that it is very unfortunate that we are driven into the discussion of a matter like the one before us at the fag end of a session, when honorable senators are desirous to get away quickly, instead of giving proper care and attention to the subject. It would have been much better had the Government seen its way to allow proposals for amending the Tariff to be dealt with when there was ample time to consider the report of the Tariff Commission, and after we had had an opportunity to consult the electors. I am perfectly sure that the subject would be dealt with much more satisfactorily after mature consideration than at a time when the coming dissolution is so rapidly approaching. However, we have to take matters as they are. The Government has paid more attention to individual cases than to the Tariff generally. Quite recently, we had before us a question of Excise, in which the predominant influence of a Victorian firm was manifest. That influence seemed to have affected Ministers, and induced them to submit proposals for legislation that were not justified or required, either in the interests of the persons immediately concerned, or of the Commonwealth at large. In dealing with harvesters, we find that another 'prominent Victorian firm is especially interested. When we look through the report of the Tariff Commission, we cannot fail to be impressed with the idea that the industry is certainly not in a failing or miserable condition. We have always been told that one of the great objects of imposing protective duties was to enable an industry to struggle through its early stages, so as to be able to equip itself in the fight for life that industries, as well as communities have to endure. But we find that, as time passes, industries established under protection depend more and more upon artificial support, and to an increasing degree come to Parliament for assistance. Instead of being in a position to say, after some years of protection, " We have been able to make our position assured, and are now prepared to fight against all competition, no matter whence it comes," we find that demands are made for increased duties. 'But in the case that we are now dealing with,, we discover that the industry has been increasing. The advantages it enjoys over its foreign competitors in the way of freights, agency charges, and other expenses have enabled it to become prosperous. If the industry had been in a languishing condition. I could have understood protectionists saying, " If it is destroyed a number of men will be thrown out of employment, and, therefore, it is necessary for the Commonwealth to come to its assistance." But even
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline>
                        has admitted that the harvester-makers are in a lucrative position, that their business is considerable, and their profits large. I find, from a return presented to the other branch of the Legislature on the motion of
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kelly</inline>
                        as to the number of stripper-harvesters imported from Canada and other countries, that the figures are as follows: - In 1904, there were no particulars available. In 1905 there were approximately 1,000 stripper-harvesters imported from Canada, and 730 from elsewhere; but there were no imports during the first five months of
                    </para>
                    <para>T906. The same return shows that in 1905 the approximate number of stripper-harvesters made in Australia was 2,700. and that the manufacture was increasing ; and, further, that during 1905; there were 418 exported, and 484 during the first seven months of this year. I am sure that if any honorable senator, in addressing an audience, desired to point out the prosperity of this particular industry, he could not have much better statistics than these, which show that since the beginning of this year Australia has produced all the stripper-harvesters required in the country. It would be interesting to know whether there have been any importations since the end of May of this year, but the fair presumption is that there have not. On the contrary, if there had been any, we may depend upon it that the Minister of Trade and Customs would have taken precious good care to have the fact made known, not only in the House of Representatives, but in the Senate. During 1905 there were 389 stripper-harvesters exported to Argentina, and the number exported in the first seven months of 1906 was 455. The exportation to other places is only small, but I find that there were twenty stripper-harvesters sent to Uruguay during the first seven months of this year. If honorable senators turn to the evidence, they will see that in Argentina big prices were paid for these machines. The argument has been used that it is a good thing to have a place to dump surplus stocks, and certainly the exporters of stripper-harvesters have found a happy dumping-ground in Argentina. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay,</inline> when before the Tariff Commission, said that the Sunshine harvester which was sold retail in Australia at £8i was sold in Argentina at £140. All I can say is that a manufacturer who can find a dumping place where nearly double the home price can be obtained must be doing particularly well. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> declined to give the exact price at which he invoiced the machine, and sold them wholesale in Argentina, but said that he had a better article and got a better price in that country than in Australia. He was asked for the invoice price of the machines exported to Buenos Ayres, but he replied that he did not think it was a fair question, though he subsequently gave the information to the Commission in strict confidence. But is that' a reasonable way in which to deal with a question of this kind? The members of the Commission had this information given to them in confidence; and yet we find that four protectionist members report one .way and four free-trade members another. " The presumption is that the information given to the Commission was not such as to seriously weigh in the minds of the free-trade members. </para>

                                The protectionist members suggested that certain conditions should be observed if there had to be an increase of duty. But are those conditions anything beyond what the workmen of Australia expect in the way of fair wages and conditions of employment? Evidence was taken by the Commission as to the probable cost of manufacturing stripper-harvesters. There seems to have been a good deal of difficulty in obtaining information on this point, but some evidence was given by an overseer in
                                <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay's</inline>
                                works, and this seems to have led to other witnesses following his example. The conclusion at which the Commission arrived was that stripper-harvesters could be produced in Australia for
                                <inline font-style="italic">£41,</inline>
                                as against a cost of production by the Massey-Harris Company of

                                os. 3d.. In the case of the Massey-Harris machines, however, there were importing expenses amounting to
                                <inline font-style="italic">£22,</inline>
                                bringing the cost to

                                as against

                                in the case of the locally-made article. Here we have a difference of something like
                                <inline font-style="italic">£20,</inline>
                                quite apart from the duties, and agency and other expenses. Yet the Government coolly ask us to pass a Bill under which, after the 1st February, 1907, the prices of these machines shall range from
                                <inline font-style="italic">£70</inline>
                                to
                                <inline font-style="italic">£80,</inline>
                                according to size. It is quite true that twelve months later they are to reduce the price by something ke
                                <inline font-style="italic">£5</inline>
                                ; but, under the most favorable conditions, it will be seen that the price will range from
                                <inline font-style="italic">£61</inline>
                                to ^75 for a machine which costs
                                <inline font-style="italic">£a.T.</inline>
                                to produce. It is all very well for honorable senators to say that such prices should be permitted for the purpose of encouraging and strengthening local industries. But those local industries, however valuable, represent but a small fraction of the people who are interested in having cheap machines of this character. These stripper-harvesters were formerly sold at a less price than that proposed by the Government, and it is possible that the industry did not then pay very well ; but it is a mistake to attempt to handicap our farmers by additional duties and charges in every direction. Where the primary producers' are to reap any advantage under this Bill, I am at a loss to see. The Government propose to do something in the way of bonuses for the encouragement of products which they think may be acclimatized in this country ; .but how are the wheat producers to benefit under this legislation? These producers have already proved that a certain agricultural industry can be carried on in this country with profit to themselves and advantage to -the community. But the prices of their products are regulated by the prices in the free-trade markets of the world ; and nothing that we can do by way of legislation can increase their profits. . Why should these men be handicapped, simply in order to keep a few manufacturers employed in producing an article which the farmers are bound to possess, no matter what the price may be?

                            <para>-Col. GOULD.- I recognise that the Bill comes from a protectionist Government, in consequence of a number of protectionist recommendations. But we cannot cease pointing out how cruelly and unfairly such legislation bears on certain classes of the community. There are many occupations which can receive no benefit whatever from protection ; and yet the people engaged in those occupations have to pay enhanced prices in order to swell the profits of certain manufacturers. The three great primary industries of agriculture, pastoral pursuits, and mining can reap no advantage from the increased duties, which are being piled on year after year in the interests of a handful of manufacturers. </para>

                            <para>.- Does the honorable senator contend that this Bill will make machinery cheaper? It has never been the policy of the Commonwealth Government, in the whole course of its history, to assist the people of the country who might justly have expected a helping hand. On the contrary, one hindrance after another has been placed in the way ; and instead of being a free people, left to carry on our vocations for our own advantage, we are being placed in fetters. It is now sought to regulate the price of agricultural implements; but possibly the policy may extend further until, under extraordinary legislation of this kind, we may find ourselves hampered by all sorts -of conditions. In some of the States there have been established Arbitration Courts, and in Victoria there are Wages Boards. With what object? With the object of seeing that employes are fairly paid, and of dealing with any difficulties which may arise in an industry. Under this Bill, however, the Minister of Trade and Customs is to be endowed with all sorts of powers as to the regulation of wages and conditions of work. If we turn to the Bill providing for duties of Excise, we shall find all sorts of conditions set out, and it is provided that-- this Act shall not apply to goods manufactured by any person in any part of the Commonwealth under conditions as to the remuneration of labour which - </para>

                    <para>While we are professing to charge certain duties of Excise we insert a proviso that they are not to apply in the case of a manufacturer who carries on his business under conditions as to the remuneration of labour which are declared by resolution of both Houses of Parliament to be fair and reasonable. Is Parliament the proper place in which to consider and decide such a question? There might be a prolonged debate in which over a hundred members of the Parliament would have the right to take part, and, no doubt, all sorts of diverse views would be expressed. </para>

                            <para>- How would they take evidence? Would they appoint a special committee, or have witnesses called to the bar of each Chamber? We could understand such matters being dealt with by persons who are able to consider such questions judicially, but we know that Parliament is prone to deal with questions from a political, and not from a judicial stand-point. While some members of Parliament might deal with such questions judicially, the majority would view them from a political stand-point, not through any desire to be unjust, but because they would be unable to free themselves from certain preconceived political ideas. Again, there are to be no duties of Excise imposed if the conditions as to the remuneration of labour are in accord with terms which, in the opinion of the Minister, are fair and reasonable. Could anything be imagined more likely to bring about corruption, or the suspicion of corruption, than to leave the decision as to whether the terms are fair and reasonable to a politician dependent for his support, and for the support of the Government of which he is a member, on the votes of persons holding, particular political opinions? We know how serious it would be if in this community we were day after day confronted with charges of corruption against Ministers. In some parts of the world we are often told that Parliament and Ministers are corrupt. Surely we do not desire that people should be given the opportunity to say that our Ministers or Parliament are corrupt. We should prefer to have it said that corruption is most exceptional rather than customary in the political life of Australia. It has been the boast of many in Australia that, at all events, until within, very recent years, there have not been in. this country any of the great public political scandals which from time to time we hear of as arising in other parts of the world. It should be the object of our people to place Ministers in such a position that no opportunity would be afforded to make charges of political corruption, against them. We have no right to put any such duty upon a Minister. He will have a number of responsible duties which he must necessarily perform, and we should not add to them duties which might bring him into conflict with various people, and leave him open to charges of corruption. Conditions of labour and wages should not be decided by Parliament, but by Arbitration Courts and Wages Boards. It will be. time enough to ask Parliament to interfere in such matters when it is shown that Arbitration Courts and Wages Boards are incapable of dealing with them. Even then Parliament should not be asked to deal with such matters in the way provided in this Bill, but should be able to appoint a competent Board to ascertain what would? be proper conditions, and to submit a report which, if satisfactory, might be accepted- I shall always raise my voice against any attempt to give undue consideration to manufacturers who are already doing well and making money, merely in order that they may do still better. I suppose that some honorable senators have made up their mind to support this Bill, whether it is debated or not. We should like to hear from them some good reasons for supporting the measure, and it is not sufficient for them to say that, as the session is drawing to a close, they must go away to their constituents, and must, therefore, hurry the business of the Senate along in order to get into recess as soon as possible. I trust that whatever the ultimate result of the measure may be, it will not be what, apparently, the Government desire. If it is, I hope that it will not be long before an opportunity will be given to Parliament to reconsider this and other measures which have recently been debated in a common-sense way. However, if one desired to undo all that has been clone by this Parliament . which in the interests of the community ought not to have been done, he would have a very hard and difficult task to perform. </para>

                            <para>- He is to be the judge whether the conditions prescribed have been complied with. Where will he obtain the knowledge to enable him to decide such a matter? Is evidence to be taken in the matter, or are members of Parliament to be judges of the conditions of trade? I should say that the Bill is unique in the history of legislation, and that the introduction of such a measure at a time when the industry chiefly concerned is in extremely prosperous conditions, savours very much of log-rolling. I cannot understand why the Government have lent themselves to such a proposal. That an effort should be made to increase the profits of large manufacturers who are already making considerable profits, whilst, perhaps, more deserving industries are not dealt with, gives this proposal a very bad complexion. I should like to have an answer to the question put by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon.</inline> It has not been answered yet. The honorable and learned senator asked why, if81 is too high a price for these machines in February, 1907, it is not too high now. Farmers buying machines for the harvest must under this Bill pay£81 for them. </para>

If the farmers are to receive a present of <inline font-style="italic">£11,</inline> which is considered their due, it ought to be given to them before the harvest, rather than after it, and before the manufacturers are enabled to make the enormous profits which this Bill will permit them to make. </para>

                            <para>- The amendment presents the business in an entirely new light. It really forces us to look all round, and inquire whether or not there is any urgency in connexion with this Bill. I am forced to pause and ask myself whether we are not riding rough-shod over the rights of the electors. In 1903 the members of 'the present Government, or the majority of them, asked the electors to sanction their policy, which was practically that of fiscal peace. By the introduction of this Bill and others, they are unquestionably . violating the pledges which secured their return. </para>

                            <para>- Yes ; but at the present time I want, if the Government have any lingering regard for their own pledges, to show them that having solicited the votes of the electors in support of their policy of fiscal peace, there was no justification for introducing, and still less justification for proceeding with, this Bill, and 'many others, including the Spirits Bill. If, in the course of their interrupted occupancy of the Treasury bench, the Government have seen any reason why they should depart from that policy, and at this juncture to attempt to impose a higher range of protective duties to increase the barriers which stand between the electors and the surplus products of other countries, then they ought not to attempt to pass the Bill now, but, by postponing its consideration until after the general elections, give the electors an opportunity of saying whether they approve of this proceeding or not. If the Senate recognises, as I am sure it does, that it stands here to reflect the wishes of the electors, and as far as possible to give effect to them, there is only one way in which that can be done, and that is by as far as possible legislating according to the desires which the constituencies have expressed. What evidence have we that the electors want this Bill? There is absolutely none. If the Government occupy their position by virtue of anything, it may be said to do so by reason of the fact that in 1903 the electors supported their appeal to the constituencies. That appeal I repeat was one for strength to adhere to their policy of fiscal peace. The Bill violates the. policy, and, therefore, the proper thing for the Senate to do is to lay it aside until the electors have had an opportunity of saying whether or not they approve of this measure, and others of a similar character, or whether they wish that their mandate of three years ago shall still be adhered to; in other words, whether we, with the exception of remedying anomalies, are to maintain the present range of protectionist duties, or whether Parliament is to continue to raise them. My second objection to the immediate passage of this Bill is derived from a consideration of the notice-paper of each House. Honorable senators will recognise, if the Government have failed to do so, that by protracting the session, we are doing an injustice on the one hand to certain senators and the members of the other House, and to candidates, and on the other hand to the electors, if we deprive them of reasonable opportunities of listening to the views of candidates and so determining how they shall vote. The notice-paper of the Senate includes, in addition to this Bill, the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Bill, Customs Tariff (British Preference) Bill, Bounties Bill, and Appropriation Bill. </para>

                            <para>- It ought to have been submitted to the Senate some weeks ago. My object in referring to the notice paper is to show the deplorable position in which the Government, by their mismanagement of parliamentary affairs, are thrusting the States House. If the measures I have mentioned were introduced at any other period of the session, and not now when we are working under pressure in order to conclude our labours as speedily as possible, they would have provided sufficient material to engage our attention for four or five weeks. Take, for instance, the Customs Tariff (British Preference) Bill. Is it a light matter that a deliberative body should be asked to pass that measure, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator. Playford</inline> suggested yesterday, by merely voting on it? </para>

                            <para>- According to the Minister of Defence the details are a mere nothing. A measure like that involves first of all a great underlying principle, secondly, a multiplicity of details, and, thirdly, some very obnoxious provisions. Surely we should be afforded a reasonable and fair opportunity for discussion? How can we do that if the Government will persist in adhering to all the measures on the notice-paper? They ought to select those measures which they regard as imperative from their point of view, and candidly state that the other measures will be held over. One Bill which, I submit, could reasonably be allowed to stand over is the Bill now before the Senate. If we are to do anything more than make a pretence of legislating there is enough business on the notice-paper to occupy the time of the Senate for four or five weeks. </para>

                            <para>- Well, I am speaking of a hope more recently uttered. I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> has many hopes; in fact, they change with each passing day. Suppose that he had any idea of realizing his most recent hope, what chance is to be given to the Senate to deal with the Appropriation Bill? But, suppose that it is anticipated that the session will close next week. I do not know whether the Minister of Defence ignores what is taking place here, but if he ventures to entertain that hope, will that afford full and ample opportunity to the Senate to consider the measures I have mentioned, and also the Estimates? </para>

                            <para>- At the rate at which we are proceeding, it will not be necessary to appeal to the electors for such an amendment, because under the auspices of different Governments we are rapidly drifting into that position by the practice which is growing up. We are amending the Constitution in an unconstitutional way, that is without authority from the electors, by a shameful neglect of the obligations imposed upon us, not merely by our pledges to the electors, but by the Constitution itself. Whilst we are absolutely jammed for time, we still have the Government responsible for the fact that time is being given to private business. Of its importance, I say nothing. But seeing that there is no possible chance of a single Bill in the name of a private senator being passed, it becomes a wanton act on the part of the Government to sanction a continuance of its consideration when public business of great urgency and importance is waiting to be considered. The Bills I have mentioned do not exhaust by any means the demand which the Government propose to make upon the time of the Senate. There are still twelve measures on the notice-paper of the House of Representatives. Last night four additional measures were introduced. How the Government can assume for a moment that there is the slightest chance of carrying all those measures into law passes <inline font-style="italic">my</inline> comprehension ? I can only assume that they do not believe for a moment that they can be passed. The notice-paper of the other House includes the Excise Tariff (Sugar) Amendment Bill, the Pacific. Island Labourers Bill, the Post and Telegraph Bill, the Patents Bill, the Public Service Telegraph Messengers Bill, the Electoral Bill', the Copyright Bill, the Life Assurance Bill, the Postal Rates Bill, and the Preferential Ballot Bill. Some of these measures, are of major importance, but it is quite evident that some of them are, comparatively speaking, insignificant. I submit to the Government that the correct and businesslike method would have been for them to jettison measures which were not of immediate urgency - and I include the measure we are now discussing amongst the number - and to proceed with those which by reason of their character or the circumstances surrounding them, it was imperative that Parliament should pass before the prorogation. But instead, the Government insists on carrying on with all this dead cargo on board. I can understand any Government having -some hesitancy about discarding its measures. But this Government has had no hesitancy about discarding the promises made in the Governor-General's speech at the commencement of the session </para>

                            <para>- I admit at once that it would open up an endless avenue of talk to consider the unfulfilled promises of the present Government. I will allude to one matter which certainly ought to be dealt with before the session closes, but which it will be impossible to discus.s if the Government insists upon proceeding: with all the measures to which I have referred. 1 allude to the question of defence. I know of no more important subject, and' none that is more urgent than the present condition of defence in Australia. Yet beyond a skeleton scheme which the Prime Minister has outlined in another place we have no information before us,. One would have thought that the Minister of Defence would be the one member of the Cabinet who would insist that the Senate should have an opportunity to discuss that question, and, it- may be, to offer some suggestions that would perfect the yet unfolded scheme. I mention these matters as reasons which, to me, are strong and urgent why the Government ought immediately to accept the suggestion of my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline> and determine at once what measures it is necessary to deal with before the session closes. On the occasion of the last dissolution, the general1 elections were held in the middle of December. It was recognised then, at any rate in a State with the climatic conditions; of New South Wales, that the farming population was distinctly handicapped. - On the one hand, they were faced with material loss if they suspended harvesting operations, and, on the other hand, they had to sacrifice their votes. Not only was that a loss to themselves, but, if we believe in the principle, of the vote at all, it was a loss to the whole country, in being deprived of an expression of opinion from a class of people who, otherwise, would have had an opportunity to exercise the franchise. The Government has frequently promised that on the present occasion the elections would be held earlier. But, owing to the mismanagement in the conduct of public business, it is doubtful whether the elections can be held before the middle of December. Indeed, if the Government adheres to its present policy. I venture to say that they will not be held before Christmas. Is that desirable? Is it fair to members of the Senate, who are desirous of getting away, and have a right to be afforded a reasonable time in which 4o meet their constituents, to deprive them of that, opportunity ? I turn to the Bill itself in order to see whether it suggests any reasons for urgency. Is there anything in what the Minister has frequently referred to as the report of the Tariff Commission to suggest that the matter is one which must be dealt with immediately? I prefer to speak of the document simply as the report which, by reason of its length sind redundancy, occupies the greatest bulk. </para>

                            <para>- What I wish to do now is to ascertain from the report of the protectionist members of the Tariff Commission whether there is really any urgency about this matter. I have looked through it to see whether there is a line in it te* justify the contention that the Bill is one that ought to be dealt with before Parliament prorogues, but I have absolutely failed to find one. I venture to say that if the four protectionist members of the Commission had seen, any ground for urgency they would have set it forth. I ignore the report of the free-trade members for the purpose of this argument, and go to the source of what ought to be the Ministerial inspiration. I admit that the greatest claim for immediate treatment would arise if it were shown that the hands engaged in the industry were suffering, or were being diminished, that their livelihood was threatened, that the industry was being undermined, or was in any way in a worse position than at a previous period, which could be compared with the present. But the report suggests no such grounds for urgency. Turning to page 8, I find that the hands employed in the industry in the Commonwealth have increased from 1,580 in 1899 to 2,799 in I905; that is an increase of about 75 per cent, in seven years. That does not suggest anything in the conditions, which, from a labour point of view, appeals for immediate relief. If it were shown that the imports were rapidly increasing and threatening the industry, I should say the matter was urgent, and that we should, at whatever inconvenience to ourselves, proceed to give relief. But the figures disclose no danger which imposes upon us any obligation to pass legislation for the relief of a threatened industry. I find that the value of agricultural implements and machinery imported during the seven years increased from ,£280,000 to £329,000, excluding odd figures. I have not worked out the percentage, but it is a substantial increase ; and it is the more gratifying to note that in the two years, 1904-5, the imports decreased by no less than 57 per cent. I anticipate an objection that in <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> previous two or three years there was a substantial increase of imports. That, however, was due to the phenomenal harvest, and to the absolute inability of the local manufacturers to turn out machinery to the extent required ; and, when that rush, passed away, imports again declined. Is there, in the face of the figures, any reason why we should depart from the sound constitutional and parliamentary practice of appealing to the electors for a mandate on legislation of this kind? Do the facts disclose any crisis? Certainly not. I can quite understand that honorable senators, charged as they are ' more particularly with the protection of States interests, may regard this matter not entirely from a Commonwealth stand-point, but from the point of view of the respective States they represent. It may be interesting, therefore, to see whether there is anything in the conditions of this "industry in any individual State to make it imperative to immediately pass this Bill. I find that in Victoria the importations of agricultural implements and machinery increased in the seven years by 6 per cent. When we allow for the increased population, and also the large extension of farming operations, that appears to be no more than a normal rate; certainly there is nothing to occasion alarm. That there has been a big expansion of the demand for agricultural implements is obvious from the fact that, whilst the imports have increased by 6 per cent., the hands employed in the Victorian factories alone have increased from 1.100 to 1,600. or by 46 per cent. And there is the still more pleasing feature that the exports of this class of goods from Victoria have increased in the same period by 70 per cent. All these figures show that the industry is abundantly sound and profitable. In South Australia, while the figures may not be quite so reassuring, they still show nothing to create any uneasiness. The imports into that State increased in the period mentioned from £29,000 to £44,000, or by 50 per cent. </para>

                            <para>- While the imports increased in South Australia by 50 per cent., the number of hands employed in the industry increased by nearly 300 per cent. Under the circumstances, we may presume that the increased importation was owing to the fact that the local manufacturers were not able to meet the demand. Then I pointed out that in South Australia there was also an increase of exports from £38,000 to nearly £51,000, or by 30 per cent. It appears to me that no industry in Australia could show better results during the period under review. If I were asked to select a particular trade in which there is marked prosperity, I do not think I could point to one which exhibits such conclusive and satisfactory proof of soundness as that with which we are now dealing. New South Wales is popularly supposed to somewhat lag behind in the matter of manufactures, and, therefore, it might be supposed that her factories have not been quite so well-equipped or up-to-date as those which have been longer established in Victoria. For that reason we might expect the figures not to be quite so pleasing; but I find that the imports of agricultural implements and machinery into that State fell in the period under review from £102,000 to £86,000, equalling about 2 per cent. Along with this diminution in imports, the hands employed in the local industry increased by 100 per cent., while the exports of agricultural machinery multiplied ten times, or by 1,000 per cent. Can any one conclude from these figures that this industry requires immediate legislative relief? In Queensland the imports increased more rapidly and to a greater extent than in any other State. The increase was from £23,000 to £88,000, or by 60 per cent. while the exports increased by 37 per cent. I admit that the figures appear extraordinary ; but the explanation is that the totals are small, and that there is really no established industry in the sense as understood in Victoria. Under the circumstances, I think we may safely dismiss Queensland, and, for the same reasons, Tasmania, from our consideration. I should like to say however, that the value of agricultural implements imported into Tasmania fell from £9,277 to £4,726, or by 50 per cent. All these figures deal with imports oversea, and exclude goods transferred from one State to another. " We can only conclude that Tasmania has been purchasing from Victoria and other mainland States goods previously obtained from foreign countries. I challenge any one to show in all the figures I have quoted any urgency or danger to justify the devotion to this Bill of time which is imperatively needed in order to deal with other matters on the business-paper. I take great exception to some of the statements made by the protectionist members of the Tariff Commission. It is stated by them that the claim that imports have increased is " too well founded." There is absolutely no justification for that statement. Not only has there been no increase in the imports, but, as the figures I have quoted show, an absolute diminution. The total imports in 1903 were valued at £280,195.Inthatyearno harvesters were imported, and that figure consequently represents the total value of the imports of agricultural implements and machinery exclusive of harvesters. In 1905 the total value of imports of agricultural machinery including harvesters was £329,000. If we deduct the value of the harvesters imported, the value of agricultural machinery other than harvesters imported in that year was £244,000, showing that in three years the value of the imports ' of agricultural implements other than harvesters was reduced by£35,000, or a reduction of 13 per cent. In view of that, I venture to say that the statement in the report of the Commission is absolutely misleading. I am content to assume that it is due to a mere oversight. It is difficult to assume that, but one must do so, or accept a very uncomplimentary alternative. I would ask the Minister of Defence to say whether there is anything connected with this industry which makes it important that this measure should be proceeded with at once. I admit that such a measure might be important, but we must consider its relative importance as compared with the other matters to which I have referred. If the Minister declares that he intends - if he can, of course - to keep Parliament together until the whole of the business is dealt with, I shall have nothing more to say. The honorable senator is too old a parliamentarian to make a statement of that kind. The alternative is that the Government must discard, postpone, or throw overboard, if honorable senators please, certain of these proposals, and I say that it is bes.t, in the interests of the Senate and. of the Government themselves, that they should do that at once, rather than wait until a greater number of senators have found it necessary to travel to their electorates, -and the Senate, by reason of diminished numbers, is less qualified to perform its legislative work. It is better that the Minister should make his selection to-day than next week. I believe that this Bill is not here with the sanction of the electors, but that it is here in violation of Ministerial election pledges, and presumably on the strength of a report signed by the protectionist members of the Tariff Commission, which offers no suggestion of urgency in the matter, but which, on the contrary, shows that its consideration might be postponed until after the next elections without detriment to the industry or to the country at large. When these considerations are viewed with a knowledge of the other business on the pa]:&gt;er, it becomes evident that it is a wanton act for the Government to press forward these measures which are not urgent, whilst we have business yet to deal with, which is vastly more important to the country, and which, so far as the finances are concerned, is more important to the proper status of the Senate. </para>

                        <para>. - I am very glad to take the opportunity afforded to me in common with every other member of the Senate who spoke before the amendment was moved, to point out, so far as I can, the position in which the Senate is placed at the present time. Before I deal with the state of business in the Senate, I have a few observations to make in respect of the urgency involved in connexion with this Bill. It was read a first time in the Senate on the 24th September. I invite attention to that date, because we know that the Prime Minister made one of his usual firm, declarations some time ago to the effect that Parliament would be prorogued on the 28th September. If the honorable and learned gentleman intended to adhere to what he said he certainly took a view of the Senate which we ought to resent. If he intended that Parliament should be prorogued on the 28th September, he offered a gratuitous insult to the Senate when he sent tip not only this, but, perhaps, half-a-dozen other Bills on or about the 24th September. Because honorable members in another place spent a long, and I venture to say, an unprofitable time, in discussing these measures, the assumption! was that the whole difficulty would easily be solved by asking the Senate to deal with them in a few hours. Every member of the Senate should join with me in expressing his strong objection to such treatment of the Senate by Ministers here or in another place. I do not wish to say unkind things about <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford,</inline> who, I feel, is in a difficult position, but I think I am justified in offering this criticism : I do not know how firm the honorable senator has been, but if he had been firmer, he might have convinced his colleagues in the Government that, to say the least, it was unwise to treat the Senate in this manner. The Bill may be urgent for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay,</inline> and' other Victorian manufacturers, but I venture to say that nj one will contend that so far as the farmers who use these machines are concerned, there is any urgency whatever about the matter. The Bill provides that it is not to come into operation so far as they are concerned - and they are intimately concerned in the matter of the reduction of price - until the 1st February, 1907. Those of us who know anything about farming operations, will recognise that it is more or less a gratuitous act of deception for Ministers .to suggest that the Bill should come into operation on the <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> st February, 1907. So far as the farmers are concerned, it would have been more honest and frank to have provided that it should come into operation on the 1st October, 1907. No farmer is going to buy a stripper-harvester at the close of the harvesting season. </para>

                            <para>- He is not going to buy a harvester on the 1st February in order to store it where it may rust and get into disrepair, when he knows that he will not need to use it until November. We have corroborative proof on the question of urgency in the figures relating to importation. A return submitted to Parliament this year is very instructive on this point. It is a return of the number of stripper-harvesters imported from' Canada and elsewhere. 1 find from it. that for 1904 no particulars were available. In 1905 the number imported from Canada was 1,000, and from elsewhere 730. In 1906, no imports whatever had been received up to the 31st May. </para>

                            <para>- -That is my whole contention on the question of urgency. The matter is urgent only to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> and those who wish to see higher duties imposed. It is obviously not urgent so far as the farmers are concerned-, nor has it any urgency from the point of view of protectionists, who wish to check importations at once. We can predict what will happen next year from what happened this year, and assume that no importations of harvesters will take place during any one of the first five months of the year. It is fair to assume that Parliament will meet within the first five months of next year, and if so, the question can then be dealt with. No importation will have taken place in the meantime, and it is therefore a matter of no moment whether the Tariff remains as it is or the duties are lowered or raised. The amendment proposes that the Bill shall be read a second time this day six months, and I venture to assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> that it is better that the Bill should be read a second time then than that the Government should compel the Senate to sit here in the hope that it will be passed in six weeks, for that is about the prospect which confronts the Ministry. Ever since we have been a Senate we have been fighting, and failing in our efforts to establish a position for the Senate which will bring into clear recognition the powers conferred upon us by the Constitution. We know that the Senate differs entirely from any Upper House known to British civilization. We have certain definite and valuable powers with regard to money Bills, and we know how we can use our powers in connexion with Appropriation Bills. We. know also the duty of. very member of either House in respect of the most important measure which is annually submitted to Parliament, and which involves the expenditure' of many millions of money. If the Government persist in their determination to go on with these unimportant Bills, the alternative is clear. Either they will ask us to dismiss the Appropriation Bill in an hour or two, or they will compel the session to be protracted to very much longer than the end of next week. I should like to know from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Play</inline> ford which of these alternatives he prefers. He must recognise that every member of the Senate feels himself compelled to carefully consider the Appropriation Bill. The Minister has listened to reiterated demands that an opportunity should be given to the Senate to properly consider that measure, and he must recognise that the request this year represents an accumulation of such demands. </para>

                            <para>- When I made the suggestion, I fixed that limit out of all friendliness to the Minister, because I was afraid that he could not afford to give more time. But my. suggestion was received with a perfect chorus from his own supporters that three days would not be enough. On the last Appropriation Bill, I have a clear recollection of bringing up the question of defence policy. Every, one will remember that at or about that time <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> told the Senate that he intended to make a determined effort to bring before the Senate next session his defence policy. </para>

                            <para>-Senator Playford is not entitled to enter the other House of his own sweet will, and give its members the benefit of the knowledge which he ought to possess. His obvious duty is to enunciate his defence policy in the Chamber to which he belongs. I am sorry that he should think that he is in charge of a Department which is of no great importance. But I venture to say that the electors do not, regard the question of defence in that light. </para>

When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> moves the second reading of the Bill we should hear from him in his capacity as Minister of Defence the result of all his deliberations. He must have taken an active part in framing a defence policy, and, therefore, we have a right to expect that on that occasion he will deal at greater length with that subject than with any other subject. That he tacitly admits is a fair assumption for me to make. It was in my mind four or five weeks ago, when I asked him when we were likely to get the Bill. Sooner or later this session he will have to move its second reading, to enlarge upon the subject of defence, and to outline a policy which I hope-- </para>

                            <para>- Surely the Minister would wish honorable senators to consider it. in the usual parliamentary way, and not to insult him by dismissing it with a few casual remarks ! Does he suppose that we are. ever going to do justice to our position as senators, or to his position as Minister, if we slur over the question of defence, and put the Appropriation Bill through in an hour? Undoubtedly, we should be' disregarding our duty if we did. I desire to have ample time in which to thoroughly discuss the defence policy, and other questions, and so do others. Many members of the Labour Party take a very keen interest in several questions which are covered by the Bill, not merely on personal grounds, but because their constituents are also keenly interested. If they were free to express what they really think on the subject-- </para>

                            <para>- To all intents and purposes the other House has completed its work, and so long as a quorum is maintained its members are at liberty to go home. Because of their mismanagement, they have imposed upon the Senate the responsibility of either prolonging the session or passing legislation in a slipshod way. That is a grievance which any honorable senator is justified in ventilating. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> considers that he should pay some regard to the convenience of honorable senators, he ought to study the convenience of those who, in order to instruct the electors, conceive it their duty to traverse their States. In Queensland and Western Australia honorable senators, who cannot possibly get through their work properly in a less period than three months, are forced to accept from the" Ministry a limited period of two months, while a large number of the members of the other House, whose electorates are limited in area, and who therefore want far less time, have been practically told that they are free to go away now and address their constituents. Every one of us knows that it is doubtful whether half the members of another place are at present in Melbourne. They have escaped, and we in the Senate are paying the penalty. Every senator is compelled to remain here - those supporting the Government to make a House, and those in opposition - because measures of vital importance to the country have been crowded into the last few days of the session. We shall, be kept here indefinitely unless one of two things happens - that is, until either the senators who are supporting the Government and who are keeping them in office for a few days prior to cutting their political throats at the elections, decide that they have adequately discharged their obligation ; or until the members of the Opposition leave the Senate as a. protest against the way business is being conducted. I cannot help referring to another matter. The Federal Parliament has been sitting in Melbourne ever since Federation was commenced, and I am forced to recognise that the convenience of the representatives of other States is being entirely subordinated by the present Government to the interest of Victoria. There is scarcely an order of the day upon the notice-paper that has not especial reference to this State. If there is urgency with regard to the Bill now under discussion, it cannot be said that it relates to any other State than Victoria. The harvester question is a Victorian question pine and simple. The Excise Tariff Bill is cognate, and refers to the same people and the same State. The Spirits Bill, which will shortly be before us again, also by universal consent represents nothing but the urgent and imperative demand of Victorian manufacturers to be protected, not against importations from other countries, bm against the activity and energy of other States. But while the representatives of Victoria are able nearly every day in some part of the State to address meetings of their constituents, the representatives, of other parts of Australia! are being kept away from their electorates. I .cannot wonder that senators resent this treatment, and regard it as proof of the direct object of the present Ministry to improve its position in Victoria, to play up to the present position of affairs in this State, and to give a protectionist emphasis to every question that arises, because that is the issue in Victoria, though not in any other State in the Commonwealth. I cannot wonder that if other honorable senators were free, as I am, to express their opinion of the Government, they would say that they resent being kept here in order to allow the Ministry to play up to the propensities of the electors of one State only. Let me revert to the remark . of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> that we can deal with the Appropriation Bill in a short time. In the House of Commons an approximate average time for the discussion of the Estimates would be 60 days per session. You, sir, have always been extremely jealous of the rights, of the Senate in regard to money Bills, and ever since you have been President have been a strong advocate of the exercise of our powers in the adequate discussion of the Appropriation Bill. Three days is the least time we should have for that purpose. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> wishes the measure to be dealt with in a few hours. Is that a fair way to treat the Senate? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild's</inline> amendment is based upon the contention that it is not urgent to proceed with the Bill. </para>

It may be argued by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> that this Bill is comparatively urgent. But there is another question on the paper of which he says nothing. That is the question of preferential trade. Three years ago, when the general election was about to be held, the Prime Minister entered on a strenuous effort to make the sound of preferential trade echo and re-echo throughout the Commonwealth. His election cry was "fiscal peace and preferential trade." I should like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> to give some indication whether he intends to ask us this session to deal with the question of preferential trade? </para>

                            <para>- Then I am extremely sorry that the Ministry should regard it as inferior from the point of view of urgency to the present Bill. If the proposal of the Government regarding preferential trade is a great, important, and statesmanlike effort of the Prime Minister to cement the bonds between Australia and the old country, surely it deserves a better place than a Bill to enable <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> to increase his profits from harvesters. Is the question of preferential trade of the importance which the Prime Minister once assumed ? Personally, I should be delighted to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> cordially and heartily indorse the preferential trade measure in this Chamber. Is a Bill which purports to Bring about preferential trade within the Empire not more urgent than the Bill before us? We have heard that the Minister does not see his way to give three days to the discussion of the Appropriation Bill. </para>

                            <para>- I suppose there are many honorable senators in the same position as myself, and I may say that, practically. I have been booking and unbooking my passage to Tasmania for the last fortnight, and now I have more than booked my passage for next Monday, because I have made all sorts of business arrangements in the hone of being in Launceston on the Tuesday. But if there are to be three days devoted to the Appropriation Bill, and an adequate time allotted for the discussion of preferential trade, it means that we shall be sitting here next week. </para>

                            <para>- But it was this session. That adjournment was, I think, nearly two months after the Tariff Commission had sent in a report, and therefore we might have been discussing the present Bill three months ago. Is it not a satire on our public business - a satire of which Ministers and senators alike may be ashamed - that when we are dealing with a congested business-paper we should be confronted by the fact that private business will be taken from 2.30 to 6.30 p.m. tomorrow ? </para>

                            <para>- I can quite understand that the Minister does not know the state of public business elsewhere, because he does not know what Bills are to come before the Senate; and it is hardly his fault. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> suggested with a view to expedite business that some provision should be struck out of the Bill, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator .</inline> Playford, with that frankness which characterizes him, admitted that the did not know the clause was there, or that he certainly did not know why it was there. </para>

The Appropriation 'Bill is the only measure on the business-paper at present with which the Senate should deal this session, and its consideration should be commenced after the dinner adjournment to-day. It is important to honorable senators of every party in the Federal Parliament, and to none more than to members of the Labour Party, that they should be able to return to their States as quickly as possible to prepare for the elections. The proposal which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> makes is practically that these measures should be allowed to go through without debate. </para>

If it does get into Committee I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford,</inline> as a practical man, who knows the way in which parliamentary proceedings are conducted, to say what he thinks the result will be? I direct his attention to the volume of evidence tendered to the Tariff Commission on the matters dealt within this Bill, and remind him that every word in that volume might be read without any departure from matter which will be relevant to the issues before the Committee. In the circumstances. I ask the honorable senator what, as a reasonable man, he can expect ? </para>

My desire is to answer <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford's</inline> interjection that the Bill will not give very much trouble in Committee. No Bill is deserving of more careful consideration than is a Tariff Bill and I think no Tariff Bill could be introduced on which more diverse opinions might be properly held than are held in connexion with the measure now before the Senate. Surely Senator Playford must recognise that if he wishes to get on with public business he had better withdraw this Bill. If he will not do so, I suppose it is his intention to ask honorable senators to sit up all night. </para>

                            <para>- Owing to the present unparalleled state of things, it is my bounden duty to endeavour to impress upon the Minister of Defence the necessity of intimating as early as possible to-night, his intentions in regard to the conduct of business. I wish it were possible for you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> to express your views on the position with which the Senate is confronted owing to the determined attitude of the Government to force this Bill through. I hope that if the opportunity should arise in Committee you will point cut that it is inadvisable for the Government to attempt to pass, not merely this Bil!, but other measures on the notice-paper. During the adjournment for dinner, I have learned that in the other House a Bill is to be introduced relative to preferential trade with South Africa. In these circumstances, surely any one would be quite justified in supporting the amendment 'to read the present ' Bill a second time this day six months. It must have become obvious that unless we can obtain fair consideration from the Government, it will be our bounden duty to submit a similar amendment in respect of other Bills. If the amendment were accepted by the Government, the Bill could be introduced next session, and dealt with under more agreeable circumstances. In that case, it would be taken up in a new Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- I do not see any reason why it should be thrown out without fair debate any more than I see any reason why it should be accepted without proper consideration. I would point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> that the Bill would not be imperilled by a postponement. No one' has yet said that it is imperative that it should be passed this session. If there is one measure which, because of all its surroundings, is not urgent, it is this Bill. I recognise with great regret that, in spite of my protest, the Minister of Defence has not yet given an indication of a desire to help the Senate out of its present difficulty. The question is whether we shall agree to the amendment in regard to this Bill or in regard to another Bill. I believe, sir, that if you were free to express your opinions you would say that the Senate will have to consider the question of urgency, because it cannot possibly pass, if tie ordinary procedure is observed, all the measures which have been mentioned. We are compelled to speak to the amendment because, so far, we have elicited no indication from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> that if it be disposed of a similar amendment will be accepted in relation to another Bill, or that he will take a smoother and easier way of getting through with the work. I fear that if i were to allow the present Bill to pass I, with others, would be expected to accord similar treatment to every other Bill. I can only assume that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> intends to treat every order of the day in the same way as he is treating this one. In spite of mv repeated appeals for an indication of his intention, he has remained dumb. We are confronted with, as it were, a wall of passive resistance. Practically, we are told that, willing or unwilling, we must pass the Bill. </para>

                            <para>- Is that a fair answer? Really, there is not proper time in which to throw them out, let alone to pass them. I am prepared at once to take into serious consideration, with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford,</inline> the possibility, and, if he likes, the necessity, of passing some of the Bills. I suppose that I shall have to object to the passage of certain Bills, when, perhaps, there might be some ground of urgency, simply because so much time has been spent upon the consideration of this Bill. I seem to fail to impress upon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> that sense of proportion which I think he ought to recognise. There surely must be some order of preference in reference to these Bills. I recognise that as parties are constituted it is impossible to take the business out of the hands of the representatives of the Government, even if it were desirable to do so. But a minority, however small, is justified in taking steps to secure consideration for its views. It is not unfair for a minority to say that it objects to such a Bill as this being thrust through the Senate in indecent haste, and at an indecent time. That is what is now happening. But in spite of these remarks <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> remains absolutely silent. </para>

I have considered the means I am now adopting, and I say with a full recognition of the meaning of my language, that every member of the Opposition is justified in offering legitimate hindrance to the Government going on with business. When I say that I mean it to have the fullest significance it can have under our Standing Orders. I do not believe that I have ever before in the Senate stated that I considered it to be my duty to interpose obstacles of time against the proposals of the Government. But I say so now, because I do not believe that the present state of things has ever been paralleled in any Legislative Assembly in the world.

When I used the word "cowardice" <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> ought not to have misunderstood me. I merely referred to his attitude relating to our Standing Orders. Instead of my being asked to withdraw, it should be the Other way. He has practically accused me of calling him a coward. I never did anything of the sort. I merely referred to the Standing Orders, and he knows it. I might as well be accused of cowardice in being afraid to debate this question or being ruled out of order for tedious repetition. </para>

                            <para>- 1 rise now, sir, to submit to you that neither the motion nor the amendment upon it can be put to the Senate, and to submit the point which I took the liberty of indicating in the remarks which I made earlier in the afternoon. I should like to say, in the first place, that this is a matter of vital concern to the Senate. It is not an ordinary point of order. I am afraid that points of order sometimes give rise to irritation, and occupy considerable time. Although in many cases they are of the greatest importance - because there is nothing more desirable than regularity of procedure - still I am free to admit that there are points of order and' points of order. This is not a point of order in the sense that we are ordinarily accustomed to deal with. It is a question that concerns the safeguards which the Constitution has thrown around the Senate, and the provisions which have been introduced in connexion with the procedure of the Senate, to enable this great States House adequately to exercise its highest functions for the protection of States interests. I do not think it necessary - in fact, I shall not presume - to appeal to you on any grounds respecting the status, powers, and privileges of the Senate, because ever since you have occupied the chair - for a period of nearly six years - we have all observed the constant efforts which you have made to maintain those powers and to see that they are not infringed in any way, as well as to secure that our functions for the protection of States rights should be exercised as fully and freely as the provisions of the Constitution require. But I do appeal to honorable senators on both sides to look at the question, which I am going to submit very briefly, from an absolutely unbiased point of view. I am not submitting it with the intention of throwing obstacles in the way of the consideration of the Bill in Committee. I am not submitting it because it is a question which may occupy' some time. I am submitting it because, if the point is well founded, as I venture with great confidence to say that it is, it concerns the rights and privileges of the Senate and the interests of the States. I have made these preliminary remarks because none of us can fail to be influenced sometimes by our prejudices in considering points of order of the ordinary kind. I think I may say that without any disrespect to any one. We are all liable to be subject to influences of that character. I make these preliminary remarks, therefore, in the hope that honorable senators will listen to what I desire to say, and view the conclusion which I shall submit for your consideration from the point of view of what our rights and privileges are in relation to taxation Bills. I cannot just at present lay my finger on the reference, but I remember that in 1 901-2 there were several important discussions in connexion with the application to the business of the Senate of the financial provisions of the Constitution. I remember one particular occasion in which the discussion was so important, and was regarded as so vital, that it occupied the greater part of two days. On the first occasion the matter was debated, you, sir, made a valuable contribution to the discussion, not by way of a ruling, but by way of a paper which was laid before the Committee. That paper was afterwards printed, and it was spoken of by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> in high terms, to which we all assented. The consequences of that were so far-reaching that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator, now</inline> Justice, O'Connor, who was then leader of the Senate, took the responsibility of having the matter set down to be re- debated on a subsequent day ; but whether that was the following day or not I do not know. I may have been right or wrong - that is not the question now - but I took the same view as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor,</inline> and that view was adopted, contrary to the opinion that you, sir, had expressed in the paper to which I have referred. </para>

I merely mention the matter in order to emphasize the naturally high importance that you, sir, the Senate, and all of us must attach to a rigid adherence to the provisions of the Constitution, which give effect to the privileges of the Senate in relation to these particular matters. I hope that if my views are not assented to, you will at any rate be assisted by the debate which will follow. First, I want to say that I shall not ask you to interpret or construe the Constitution. What I shall ask you to do is to apply the Constitution to the business of the Senate. We all recognise that it is not the business of the President to express an opinion as to whether a particular clause or enactment transgresses the Constitution in the sense which necessitates its submission to the High Court for settlement; it is not the function of the President, or of this Chamber, to usurp the powers of the High Court. That neither I nor any other honorable senator would ask. The first ruling to which I refer may be found on page 9 of the volume containing your decisions during the session of 1903-4; and it shows the distinction with very great clearness.

                    <para class="block">A matter of the interpretation of the Constitution - of the validity or invalidity of a particular measure, as, for example, the provisions sought to be declared unconstitutional by the ruling in regard to the union label in the case of the Trade Marks Bill - is a matter to be dealt with by the High Court. But if it is necessary to interpret the Constitution so far as regards the procedure of the Senate, that must be done. Neither of these points, however, apply to the position where it is simply sought to apply the provisions of the Constitution to the business immediately before the Senate.

                    <para class="block">That is to say, even if it involves the question of the interpretation of the Constitution. The point which I am' about to submit does not involve any question of the interpretation of the Constitution, but merely invites you to apply the .plain terms of the Constitution to the business before the Senate. The second illustration, which may assist the consideration of this matter, is one quite of an opposite kind - that kind of interpretation which is confided under the Constitution to the High Court. This arose during the discussion of the Trade Marks Bill, when the point was raised whether the introduction of the original provisions moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> for the application of a union label were constitutionally included in the Bill - that is to say, whether they were trade marks within the meaning of the Constitution. The Chairman, in the first place, was asked to rule what was meant by the sub-section of section 51 of the Constitution, which empowers the Commonwealth Parliament to legislate in"" reference to trade marks. In effect, you were asked to rule as you might have ruled, sitting as Chief Justice of the High Court, namely, what was the interpretation to be placed on those words in the Constitution, and whether the provisions sought to be introduced in reference to the trade union label came within the interpretation. That exactly illustrates what you have always declined to do, namely, to interpret the Constitution in the sense in which the interpretation is a function properly appertaining to the High Court.

                        <para>It appears to me that the two objections taken to the ruling of the Chairman, or the two so-called points of order which have been raised, on investigation, resolve themselves into one, and it is not a point of order at all. It is a point of constitutional law. As I have formerly stated, and as has 'been the practice of the Senate ever since it has been in existence, the President is not called upon to interpret the Constitution. In the Constitution itself there is provided a tribunal for its interpretation, and that is the High Court. It would be altogether beyond the scope of my powers if I were to assume to lay down the law as to what the Constitution means'. The first point taken is that these suggested amendments are not within the powers of the Commonwealth Parliament, and that they are not covered by the sub-section of section <inline font-style="italic">51</inline> of the Constitution, which gives the Commonwealth power to legislate concerning "copyrights, patents, of inventions and designs, "and trade marks." </para>

It is necessary that we should consider what is the origin and purpose of this provision. I do not wish you, sir, to consider the matter from any narrow or technical point of view. In order to ascertain the origin, we go back to section 53, which places a limitation upon the powers, functions, and privileges of the Senate. It reads - </para>

I need not recall to you the fact that this method of clothing the Senate with, to a certain extent, unprecedented powers in comparison with most Upper Houses, originated, if not with- yourself , at any rate in the practice which prevailed in the Legislative Council of South Australia. It was to be developed in order that the Senate of the Commonwealth should occupy the highest possible place, and enjoy the greatest possible power in the interests of the States in relation to moneys Bills'.

                    <para class="block">Is this a law imposing taxation? By no possibility can it be said to be a law imposing taxation within the meaning of the Constitution if it violates the provisions of section 55, to which, I have directed your attention. The only law which can be a. proposed law imposing duties of Customs or Excise is a law which deals with duties of Customs only, or with duties of Excise only. These are the only proposed laws imposing, taxation which can possibly come under the operation of section 53 of the Constitution. If that be so, the operation of the Constitution is simple and clear. If it is not so, this will be the practical position in which we shall be placed : When we get into Committee, one of the first questions which must be raised is whether we are bound to make requests or can make amendments in the Bill. We might occupy a week in debating such questions in Committee, and the solution of the matter is now in applying these] provisions of the Constitution. I submit, with very great respect and deference, that it is your duty to apply these provisions of the Constitution to the business of the Senate. To you we look to apply them. You are trie repository of the powers of the Senate, so far as their application to the business of the Senate is concerned, and it is, therefore, to you we look to say whether this is or is not a Bill which is properly before the Senate; and whether, having allowed it to pass its second reading, the result of sending it to the Committee will not be to put us entirely at sea, since we will not know whether the Bill is one in which we can make amendments, or one in connexion with which we are compelled to make requests. I have endeavoured to explain the position as clearly, and, having regard to its importance, as briefly as I- possibly could. I feel that this is a matter possibly of as far-reaching importance in relation to your functions as you have ever had to bring your mind to bear upon. If my view is right, one of the privileges of the Senate is being invaded by these Bills. I look to you for a ruling, and I hope you will take the view I do, and will give a ruling which, given on the eve of the prorogation and dissolution of Parliament, maybe the most important ruling of the present Parliament, and a ruling which will go forth throughout Australia to show that we are determined to maintain the privileges and rights of the Senate, and the protection which the Constitution throws round its operations. </para>

                            <para>- Of course I will. There are certain provisions in this Bill which a majority of honorable senators deem essential to it. You, sir, are being invited to say that that majority is not to be at liberty to express any opinion on those provisions or to embody them in the Bill. The Constitution has in contemplation an ultimate judicial interpretation as to provisions which can be of no effect. That essentially implies that when they are referred to the proper tribunal it will be for that tribunal to say whether those provisions are valid or not. I assume, sir, that your anxiety will be to take the widest and most liberal view, and to give the widest liberty to the Senate to include such provisions as it deems desirable in dealing with any proposal for the imposition of taxation. It is not to be suggested for a moment that to do so will make the Bill invalid. It will make only those particular provisions invalid, and only at the instance and on the interpretation of the High Court. </para>

The Senate was against me at that time, but subsequently the leader of the Senate, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor,</inline> with the concurrence of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> felt that the matter should be reviewed, with the result that the former decision was overruled, and it was held that we could only make requests, anxious as every honorable senator was then to exercise our fullest rights in that connexion. </para>

                            <para>- Surely the honorable senator has forgotten the facts ! I have looked up the case. The question which arose on the Sugar Bounties Bill was whether an appropriation of revenue imposed an increased charge upon the people. It had nothing to do with the imposition of Excise duties. </para>

It imposes duties directly upon stripper-harvesters, but it provides that under certain circumstances the rate shall be modified. In other words, it empowers the Governor-General, if certain things take place, to modify the duties. </para>

                            <para>- Suppose that it was a Bill dealing with the imposition of duties on spirits. We could exempt a particular class of spirits from duty, and impose differential duties on other classes, to be collected from time to time. We could also say that, in respect of a particular class of spirits, the duties should not come into operation before a specified time. The point of order strikes at the very root of the liberty of the Parliament to impose duties in such a way, as it may think proper. Let me illustrate exactly what I mean by referring to the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Bill, because if the point of order is good as regards one Bill, <inline font-style="italic">q fortiori</inline> it must apply to the other. The question would be whether that is a Bill dealing with duties of Excise only. Clause 2 says - </para>

                    <para class="block">There is a direct imposition of Excise duties, as fixed in the schedule, but the clause goes on to provide that it shall not apply to a particular class of goods. Practically it says that the duties shall only apply to a particular class of harvesters. In other words, the provision applies to harvesters generally, but not to harvesters made in a' particular way. It is a general qualification of the imposition of the duties just as, in a Customs Tariff Bill, we can discriminate as to goods which come here in British bottoms. No one would urge for a moment that we could not qualify our imposition of taxation by saying that goods coming here in other than British bottoms should be liable to certain duties, but that goods arriving in British bottoms should be subject to lower duties. In the present case we are attempting to discriminate as to the class of harvesters that we seek to tax. We can always levy a qualified tax. There is not a word in this Bill which does not deal with duties of Customs only. The utmost which can be said is that there is a qualification to the imposition of the duties. </para>

It simply says that under certain conditions the Governor-General is to Se at liberty to reduce taxes which have been imposed. I submit with great respect that the matter, involving as it does, the interpretation of the Constitution, is essentially one for the High Court to deal with. </para>

The honorable senator has brought this matter under your notice as relating to certain sections of the Constitution. Section 53, to which reference has been made, deals with Bills when before Parliament, and to such Bills it refers as " proposed, laws." It says - </para>

Then we come to section 55, which drops the term "proposed laws," and deals with " laws imposing taxation " - that is, Acts. It provides that such laws imposing taxation - shall deal only with the imposition of taxation, and any provision therein dealing with any other matter shall be of no effect. </para>

                            <para>- What 1 am pointing out is that section 55 deals with Statutes, and simply says that so far as they transgress the principle that they shall deal only with the imposition of taxation, they shall be invalid. The consequence attached to them on that account is the invalidity of the provisions which deal with more than taxation. But that consequence does not attach to " proposed laws." </para>

Now, to come to the Question whether what is proposed in this Bill is or is not a tack. I suggest that the object of section 55 is to prevent, in connexion with taxation, Customs and Excise measures, the tacking on of additional matter - that is, matter foreign to the imposition of taxation, the imposition of Customs duties, or the imposition of Excise duties. Clause 4 of this Bill is as follows : - </para>

When Parliament legislates for the imposition of any duty, the duty imposed has its direct, and its indirect, consequences. If you are going to judge of the quality of a measure by the indirect consequences of the taxation that it imposes, I submit that you embark upon a sea for which .you have no chart or compass. </para>

What I am pointing out is that alL that this Bill provides is that in the event of certain prices ruling, the duty shall be so-and-so. If we say that that is a tack, we practically say the same about some of the most important matters that have been passed by this Parliament. Let me draw the attention of honorable senators to the Customs Tariff Act 1902. To that Act there is a schedule, division 6a, " Metals and Machinery " - </para>

                            <para>- Those are the conditions upon which, the Excise is to be reducible by means of a rebate. Surely honorable senators will see - I think I can urge this argument most strongly upon them - that the conditions in the case of a rebate of Excise duty on sugar, and the conditions of the Customs Tariff Act in connexion with metals and machinery are precisely on all fours with conditions of the character mentioned in this Bill. There may be differences in detail, but I submit that there is no . difference in principle. To illustrate further the argument that what is meant by section 55 of the Constitution is that we shall not insert in laws Customs or Excise measures imposing taxation, or foreign matter, I point out that we have, and necessarily must have in all our Customs and Excise Acts, provisions which do not in themselves impose taxation. There are provisions of a preliminary character, and provisions such as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> suggested by interjection a little while ago, suspending duties for six months. It . could be quite as well argued by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> that if we inserted a provision to that effect we should be going outside the ordinary imposition of taxation and adding something to the measure. In the Excise Tariff Act 1902 there are seven sections. After dealing with definitions, the time of imposition of uniform duties of Excise, and what the duties shall be, there is a provision in section 6 of the Excise Tariff Act validating the collections under the proposals. If we were to read section 55 of the Constitution so strictly as to say that an Excise Bill shall deal with duties of Excise only, might it not be argued that this validating provision in regard to the collections already made was a tack? Then in section 7 there is a provision for future contingencies - </para>

                            <para>- It is sufficient to deal with the case we have before us ; if I deal with hypothetical cases, I may be drawn off the thread of my argument. You, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> have been asked to apply the provisions of the Constitution, and have been practically assured that you need not interpret them in the sense of deviating from -your usual procedure. I say that the very fact that this legislation exists on our statute-book,, and the further fact that this provision objected to is precisely analogous, go to show that there cannot be that unanimity in the interpretation of section  55  which must necessarily precede your action in applying the Constitution. I said just now that it would be necessary, before you could apply the provisions, without infringing, if I may say so, your usual procedure there should be the absolute unanimity I have indicated. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> agrees with that. </para>

                            <para>- None of us can be certain absolutely as to what is or what is not constitutional. That is a point with which I dealt at some length when moving the second reading. Neither the House of Representatives nor the Senate is the judge on the subject. I hold the view that unless, in an absolutely clear case, on which there 'is great unanimity, it would not be a safe course for Parliament to set itself up to determine on a doubtful question what was or what was. not constitutional. </para>

                            <para>- I think the reply we have heard may safely and conveniently be divided into two parts. First, there is the question of &lt; whether you, sir, are now asked to interpret or to apply the provisions of the Constitution, and then there is the question of whether this Bill contains in it certain provisions which mav be properly described as conditions tacked on to a Money Bill. So far as I am concerned, I think there is little to be said as to whether you are now asked to interpret or to apply the section of the Constitution. The one sentence of. the Constitution to which your attention has been directed simply <inline font-style="italic">states</inline> that laws imposing duties of Customs or duties of Excise shall deal with duties of Customs or duties of Excise only. And it has been argued that you are asked not to apply, but to interpret, that provision of the Constitution. I venture to  say  that if such a request were made to you with regard to any other section in the Constitution which affects our procedure, it could be pointed out. in innumerable cases, that to strain the meaning so as to make you interpret where application is obvious was unreasonable. We have had an example to-day. It is provided by the Constitution that in any Bill to amend the Constitution there must be an absolute majority to carry it. The statement in the Constitution to that effect is just as simple in its meaning as the statement in reference to duties of Customs. I shall not prolong the debate on that point because I cannot conceive that in that sentence is, concealed any difficulty so far as you are concerned at the present time. The other point is obviously more within our own procedure and less within the ambit of the Constitution. I take it that you are now asked to place an interpretation on the contents of the Bill, just as you might be asked to settle an ordinary point of order. Yow </para>

                        asked to say whether in your opinion this Bill does contain anything in the nature of a tack. Perhaps I might digress for just one moment to refer to the distinction drawn by
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline>
                        between laws and proposed laws. An investigation of the debates of the Federal Convention reveals the fact that that point was very fully discussed there. As a "matter of fact, the Constitution was put in its present form simply and solely to give it the precise effect which we say it ought to have now. That is to say, the word " proposed " was left out after long and serious debate in order to secure to the Senate immunity from tacking in any Bill sent from the other House. I shall not. refer at any great length to that point, which I think
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline>
                        will agree is a minor one. Let me invite you, sir, to consider whether there is any clear evidence of tacking in the Bill now before us. Everyone of the illustrations or parallels submitted by
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline>
                        for our consideration was, an ordinary application of
                        <inline font-style="italic">ejusdem generis;</inline>
                        to put that in another way, they dealt with nothing except conditions affecting the same article or an article of the same kind. What is proposed in the Bill ? A simple scrutiny reveals the fact that it purports to impose Customs duties, absolutely on condition that the price of totally different harvesters - that is the locally-made harvesters - shall be as the schedule states.

                            <para>- Precisely. It will be recognised that the Bill presents these difficulties, which to some of us appear to be insuperable. We cannot directly alter the Customs duties, because if we do we shall be altering the whole purport of the Bill, and why? Because the Customs duties themselves depend absolutely upon Something that has no relation to Customs duties, upon some conditions which, in the case of this Bill, relate clearly to the price of local machines. </para>

We must rely upon you, sir, to get us out of the difficulty as to the question of procedure in Committee. The object of the framers of the Constitution was distinctly to prevent the tacking on to money Bills of any conditions which the Senate could not alter by amendment ; that the Senate should not be embarrassed by finding in a Bill dealing with Customs or Excise duties some conditions which it could not alter in the exercise of its ordinary legislative functions by the usual process of amendment. Suppose we get into Committee on this Bill, how are we to exercise our right to amend if it is decided that this is a Bill which we cannot amend? The measure contains many things which are nothing but conditions. The whole of the schedule from our point of view is merely a condition. I take the first item - </para>

                            <para>- We say that our powers of amendment are limited specifically to a proposed law imposing taxation or burdens on the people, but if we were to say that in the opinion of the Senate the line to which I have referred should be altered, and should read, " Stripper-harvesters 6-foot size and under," we should be endeavouring to impose no burden upon the people, and should be merely exercising our ordinary right of amendment. It will be admitted that in Committee we shall be confronted with that difficulty. I join . with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> in hoping that you will rule that the Senate shall not be put in the position of having to make a request for an amendment which will involve no extra burden upon the people, but which will merely alter certain conditions which might properly find a place in a Bill dealing with money in no way whatever, and which, we should have the undoubted right to amend. </para>

                            <para>- I respectfully submit that a tendency has been displayed to depart from the point presented. The point is not whether in this Bill there is a tack, but whether you, sir, should rule that this Bill is admissible. These are two very different things. 'The question whether there is a tack is not a question for the President, but for the Senate itself. If, in the opinion of the Senate, there is attached to a money Bill, which it may not amend a tack, which, if presented by itself, it might amend, it is for the Senate to refuse to pass that Bill,' and to return it to another place on the ground that there is a tack attached to it. </para>

                            <para>- That is not the point. The question now is whether this is a tack. What we are asked to do in this Bill is to legislate for duties of Customs. The Constitution says that a Customs Bill must deal with duties of Customs only. The question" is does this Bill deal with duties .of' Customs only, or with some other matters as well. I have not the slightest hesitation- in saying that there is not a single proposal for legislation in this Bill, except for the imposition or the remission of duties of Customs. </para>

                            <para>- No, we cannot. I have no hesitation in saying that this is a taxation . Bill, which we have no right to amend. Therefore, if we desire amendments in it, as we might legitimately do, all the power given us under the Constitution is to request that such amendments may be made in another place. We do not propose to legislate with reference to prices. They may be £75 or £1,075. The only thing is that if the prices should vary, the legislation for which we are providing shall vary accordingly. </para>

                            <para>- What is dealt with in each instance is taxation. In this State we do not deal in the slightest degree with the extent to which persons shall hold land, but we provide that where men hold land to a certain extent the tax shall apply. In this Bill we seek to levy a duty of so much per stripper-harvester ; and we provide that if it should happen from any cause after a. certain date that the price of the locally-made harvester is higher than that which is therein prescribed, the duty shall not operate. We do not legislate as to the price of the machine. We can always enforce the payment of the duty, but we cannot send a policeman to impose a penalty upon a man who varies the price of his machine. </para>

I submit that there must be a very sharp distinction drawn between the validity of a Bill which is challengeable in a Law Court, either by an individual or by a State, and the validity of procedure. I do not suggest for a moment, sir, that you should take upon yourself a function of the High Court, and that is to determine whether or not a Bill is constitutional. But I do hold that it is incumbent upon you to see that the rights of the Senate are amply protected. The purpose of section 55 of the Constitution was expressly and avowedly to secure the Senate against encroachments by the other House.

                        <para>There are two methods in which the privileges of the Senate can be defended. First there is the President, whose absolute duty it would be to rule out of order any Bill from the House of Representatives infringing or violating those privileges. </para>

                    <para class="block">The discussion, I mav say, took place on a proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Isaacs</inline> to insert the word " proposed " before the word ' laws " in the clause. </para>
                    <para>It would be the prerogative of the President to do this, absolutely regardless of the opinion of the Senate 'itself. The President has not merely to act upon a point taken by a member of the Senate, but is placed in his position to act of his own motion without wailing to have his attention directed to any particular clause infringing the Constitution. It would be the duty of a President to say that the Bill was out of order, and it would then be sent back to the House of Representatives with an intimation to that effect. I venture to question whether even a majority of the Senate would dare to attempt to override a decision of the President. </para>
                    <para class="block">I do not submit for a moment, sir, that the opinion of even a fellow delegate at the Convention should or ought to override your own opinion. I have quoted (he passage from <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Quick's speech, because it so clearly expresses my own opinion that you, sir, are the repository of the rights and privileges of the Senate, and the proper ' person to defend them if assailed. The question is whether this provision is an infringement of the powers and privileges of the Senate by the other House. Our powers and privileges are coequal with those of the other House, except in one important particular; but if this is a tack to a Bill imposing taxation, it does to that extent infringe upon our rights, inasmuch as it limits the manner in which we can seek to secure an amendment. It has been pointed out that we have already passed measures which, if the contention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> be correct, are equally an .infringement of the Constitution. </para>

                            <para>- Parliament has made no such declaration ; but by omission or negligence or oversight it has passed similar provisions. Every time we pass a measure which may slightly infringe upon the rights of the Senate, or may be thought to do so, our action will be used as a buttress by those who wish to aid, perhaps unconsciously, an effort by the other House to encroach upon our powers. I hold a very strong view as to the position which the Senate occupies in the Constitution. I submit, sir, that if there is a possible doubt as to what the Constitution intended, as to the respective powers of the Houses, you would be acting quite properly in giving the benefit of the doubt to the Senate, thus leaving the other House, if it felt aggrieved, to express its view in proper form, and that is by message. </para>

But on the point whether what is proposed in this Bill is or is not a tack, I wish to direct your attention to one or two cases that have occurred in the history of the Senate, and which, perhaps, you have not had an opportunity to look up. I draw your attention to the test which was stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon.</inline> I think I quote him correctly when I say that he observed, when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> was speaking, that the test is - " Does the Bill deal with other subjects than Customs and Excise? If it does, it abrogates the Constitution." Now, I draw your attention to the "fact that the first Customs Tariff Act, passed by the first Parliament of the Commonwealth - during the time you have occupied the position of President - did deal with other matters than the imposition of duties so far as those matters were conditions governing the remission or imposition of certain duties contained in that Act. I will also refer to another test stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons.</inline> I took down his words as he used them. He said, " If we .alter the duties for some other purpose, then we alter them for some purpose outside the scope of this class of Bill altogether." Applying those tests to the Bill before us, both <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> contend that you should rule the measure to be unconstitutional. The first instance to which I. direct attention is the Customs Tariff Act 1902, page 316 of the first volume of the Commonwealth Statutes. Under the heading, "Special Exemptions," you will find these words : - </para>

                            <para>- I think I am justified in saying a few words in reply to those honorable senators who have adduced what they consider to be precedents for the Bill before us. In my opinion, not one of the cases quoted can be said to be parallel to that of this Bill. The reference was to measures providing that certain Customs duties are to come into operation under certain circumstances. But that is nothing like what is here proposed. The case that comes nearest is that cited by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> with regard to a rebate being paid when sugar is grown by white labour. But there is this to be said in answer to that point : That, although the Act which the honorable senator quoted was passed in 1902, it was afterwards considered that what was done was not done in the proper way to attain the object. Consequently, in 1903, the Government came down with a Bill, by passing which Parliament repealed the provision of the Excise Tariff Act 1902, and provided in its place a system of bounties. </para>

That case is not analagous. In this Bill it is proposed to impose a certain Excise duty upon stripper-harvesters, and it is provided that that duty shall not apply to any person who conforms to certain conditions. An analogous case would have been presented, if we had inserted in the Excise Tariff (Spirits) Bill a provision declaring that the rates therein fixed should not be payable by importers who conducted their business upon certain lines. If the Government can do what is proposed in the Bill they can obtain complete control of any trade which deals with goods that are liable to duties of Customs or Excise. It seems to me that by means of this measure the Government are endeavouring to obtain a power which they do not possess under the Constitution - the power of interfering with private traders within the States. </para>

                            <para>- The Government desire to impose a penalty upon the manufacturer who does not comply with certain conditions. Had they followed the course which I suggest there would have been no doubt as to our absolute power to amend the measure in any particular. It appears to me that they have forwarded the Bill to us in the hope that we shall treat it as a Money Bill. In this connexion I would point out that section 53 of the Constitution refers not to a Bill, but to " a law imposing taxation." Clearly therefore the Senate is not prevented from amending a Bill which primarily does not. impose taxation. That portion of this measure which deals with the manufacture of harvesters is not a law imposing taxation. We cannot proceed much further unless the President decides whether or not we have power to amend this Bill. </para>

                            <para>- When this point of order was taken I certainly understood that the question raised was whether the Bill as submitted complies with the requirements of the Constitution. If you, sir, consider that the Bill does not comply with the requirements of the Constitution, but is really a Bill' which contains a tack, you will rule that it is out of order, and a waste of time in Committee will thereby be prevented. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> it appears to me, submitted the question in very apt terms, and clearly drew the distinction between asking you to interpret the Constitution and asking you to interpret the Bill. I know that a similar question was raised on a previous occasion", but it was not presented to you in the same clear terms as to-night. It seems to me that the wording of the Constitution is perfectly plain. If it were argued that you could not interpret the Bill, and say whether the provision of the Constitution applied, it would not be possible to say whether or not a proposal dealt with laws imposing taxation. After all, it is not what the Constitution means, but what the Constitution actually says, and then there comes the application with regard to any Bill that is submitted for our consideration. The cases cited by Senators Keating. Pearce, and others have been fully replied to by speakers who have preceded me on this side, and therefore I do not propose to occupy further time in dealing with them. But I should like to elaborate one argument submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> as to the necessity to give the Senate the benefit of any doubt, if you have .any doubt, as to the application of the section of the Constitution' to the present Bill. It may be said that a ruling in the direction desired by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> and others might prove rather serious with regard to the Bill before us. That, I take it, is hardly a matter to be considered, but, in any case, a ruling to that effect", even if it were mistaken, could only result in the Bill being sent back to another place, with a message stating the reason why it had not been proceeded with. It would then be perfectly competent for the 'Government to meet our wishes in another Bill, providing for the fixing of the prices to be charged for harvesters. We should have a Bill imposing taxation, which we could not amend, except by way of suggestion, and another Bill, which would fix the prices of the harvesters, and which we could amend in any respect. The only effect would be to cause a certain amount of delay, and some additional work to the Government. But if, on the other hand, your decision was against the view submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> the Bill would pass into law, and remain law until further action was taken by legislation. To this Ministers may reply that according to section 55 - </para>

                        <para>It does not seem to me that I should, from the Chair, undertake the responsibility of interpreting all the provisions of the Constitution. The Constitution itself has provided for a tribunal, the High Court, which, after argument and consideration such as would be 'impossible and undesirable in this Senate, is empowered to finally determine its meaning in most of the cases which will arise. It is my duty to interpret and determine the Standing' Orders, and t&lt; regulate the procedure of the Senate; and, perhaps, to interpret the Constitution so far as thi conduct of the business of the Senate is concerned. </para>

                    <para class="block">I then proceeded to point out the difference between the two cases. In one instance, I undoubtedly did interpret the provisions of the Constitution. That was in a ruling which I gave in the case where the vote of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Saunders</inline> was challenged. It was evident that the business of the Senate could not be proceeded with as long as that question remained in doubt. The honorable senator's vote might have been challenged on every division, and the whole proceedings of the Senate declared invalid. In that case, and, so far as I remember, in that case only, I undertook to interpret the provisions of the Constitution. It has been urged that it is unnecessary for me in dealing with this question to interpret the provisions of the Constitution. It is said that I can apply them. I fail to see how it is possible for me to apply the provisions of section 55 unless I make up my mind as to its meaning, or, in other words, interpret it. Section 55 provides that " laws imposing taxation shall deal only with the imposition of taxation. " It does not provide that laws imposing taxation shall only impose taxation, and it is possible that a different meaning may be implied by the use of the words " deal with taxation." It is contended that this Bill which is one to impose Customs duties, contains a provision that does not deal with the imposition of taxation ; and it seems to me that to decide the question that has been submitted to me, I should have to interpret not only the Constitution, but the Bill itself. In accordance with the rule that has been laid down, I do not think that I should be asked to undertake that responsibility. If - and I use the word "if" - the clause to which objection is taken ought not to appear in the Bill, it is for the Senate in Committee to vote it out. The Senate surely ought to take the responsibility of voting on the question whether a clause should remain in a Bill, or should be rejected. I think that, strictly speaking, I ought to say nothing as to the point raised in reference to what the procedure in Committee ought to be, since it is a matter for the Chairman to rule upon. But. perhaps, I may be permitted by the Chairman of the Committee to refer briefly to it. This Bill is undoubtedly one to impose duties of Customs. The fact - if it be a fact - that it contains a clause that it ought not to contain does not alter the character of the Bill. A question may arise as to whether there ought to be "requests or amendments made, and that, as I have said, is one with which the Chairman of Committees must deal. It seems to me quite clear, however, that, so far as the imposition of taxation is concerned, there ought to be requests. When we come to the clause to which exception is taken, if. it ought not to be in the Bill, it should be voted out If, on the other hand, it ought to be in - if, in the words of the Constitution, It properly deals with " the imposition of taxation " - there should be no question concerning the procedure on it. I regret that I cannot enter into a consideration of the very interesting point as to what ought to be the construction placed on the section of the Constitution, but I propose when we are in Committee, when I shall have a free hand to say something about it. </para>

                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator. Sir JOSIAH</inline>
                SYMON (South Australia) [10.46]. - This clause has already been discussed at considerable length in connexion with the question of whether it is an excrescence on the Bill. I now propose to move an amendment with the object of insuring that it shall have some real effect. It is intended by this measure to impose duties of Customs which shall restrain, limit, or, it may be, altogether prohibit the introduction of harvesters into the Commonwealth. The protection given to the local manufacturers is to be given subject to a. penalty. It is provided that the Australian manufacturers who sell their machines at or under the prices which are specified, are to have the benefit of freedom from competition. If they do not sell at or under these prices, they are to be exposed to competition from abroad. That is the penalty, and it would be a very effective one if the provision in the Bill were of a workable character. The clause provides that if the Governor-General is satisfied that the cash prices at which stripper-harvesters and drills manufactured in Australia are sold exceeds the prices set out, he may by proclamation reduce the rate of duty. Now, what is meant by the cash prices at which the machines are sold? By whom are they to be sold, and how many are to be sold before the Governor-General is to issue his proclamation? Is one stripper-harvester, or are all to be sold at prices in excess of those mentioned before the Governor-General is to take action. I believe in the principle embodied in the clause, so far as it goes. I agree that the users of the machines ought certainly not to be penalized by having to pay an increased price, thus multiplying the profits of the makers. But provision for this must be made in some definite form. It would be absolutely impossible to accomplish the object held in view by means of the provision now in the Bill. I think that the benefit proposed to be conferred upon the farmer ought not to be postponed until next year - until the off season, when none of these machines are sold. The reduced prices should be brought into operation at once. There would be no harm in making such a provision, because we have been told by honorable senators opposite that the machines are now being sold at the prices stipulated in the Bill.

                    <para>- No. That would have the effect of making the reduced prices operative at once, but clause 4 would not be operative at all. The Governor-General would never know when he could issue a proclamation. We are imposing increased Customs duties upon stripper-harvesters, and we are declaring that the local manufacturers shall not derive the benefit of the duty if their machines are sold at prices in excess of those we mentioned. Therefore, I say that the Governor-General should be empowered to do what the clause provides, namely, to reduce the import duty, unless all stripper-harvesters and drills manufactured in Australia are, after the passing of the Act. sold at prices not exceeding those stipulated. I therefore intend to move that the following words be substituted for those now in the clause: - </para>

                        <para>- I desire, sir, to dissent from your ruling, and put my dissent in writing, as required by the standing order. My reason for taking this course is that we have reached a very serious stage in our proceedings. The clause which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> desires to amend in no way affects the import duties set out in the schedule. It does not provide for the imposition of duties, but enacts conditions in regard to the prices at which harvesters are to be sold. If the Committee consents to allow the proposed amendment to be put as a request, it admits that we have no power to amend a clause of this kind, and gives away one of the principal powers conferred upon us by the Constitution. To do so would, in my opinion, be to degrade the position of the Senate. In the early days of the Parliament, no one would have thought of taking such a step. The point is of such great importance that we should have a ruling from the  President  upon it. Had I considered that he had already clearly and definitely decided it, I should not have taken this step, but what he said was that he should not be called upon to rule upon a point which might arise in Committee. </para>

I am of opinion that in this case the intention is to impose certain duties having regard to the price of the articles on which they are imposed. As you did not feel called upon to rule the Bill out of order, I felt bound to follow in your footsteps. In my opinion, the Bill deals only with taxation, and provides that the taxation is to be imposed subject to certain conditions. </para>

                        <para>- I quite understand that. I had hoped that, from remarks which you might have made upon this clause, to discover some way in which the Senate could protect itself should Bills be sent up from another place incorrectly drafted. If the decision of the Temporary Chairman of Committees is upheld, it seems to me that the Senate will be absolutely powerless, and will be left without any means by which it can notify another place that it is prepared to resist the practice of tacking. It is immaterial to my argument whether this is, or is not, a tack, but if, at any time, another place does attach to a taxation Bill something foreign to the subject of taxation, what steps will the Senate be able to take in view of your decision not to interpret the Constitution, if it is not competent for honorable senators in Committee to take action to mark their dissent from the course followed in another place? What will the Senate be able to do to safeguard the rights conferred upon it under the Constitution? You have decided that it is not incumbent upon the President to interpret the Constitution, and to take notice of any Bills sent up from another place to which a foreign provision is tacked. It must, therefore, be left to honorable senators in Committee to take some action to inform another place of the view we take with reference to the extraneous matter. I trust that if, in the circumstances, you feel called upon to support the ruling of the Temporary Chairman, you will, at the same time, indicate some means by which the Senate will be able to mark its dissent from the course taken in another place. </para>

                        <para>- This is a question that is not new to me. I wrote a paper in reference to it, which, in print covers twelve foolscap pages, and which I laid on the table of the. Convention. It was, to a very considerable extent on the information contained in that paper that the method by which the Senate deals with Bills which are vaguely called " Money Bills " was founded. The paper to which I refer is entitled " South Australia. Powers and Practices of the Houses of Parliament in reference to Money Bills." In South Australia, there was a compact between the two Houses that the Legislative Council should not amend what are vaguely called "Money Bills," "but that they should .make suggestions. It was on that practice that the provisions of the Constitution dealing with the method of procedure by the Senate in reference to suggestions or requests were founded. I wrote - </para>

                    <para>In practice between the two Houses, the Council has refrained from amending clauses to raise money or appropriate revenue in Bills which are not suggestion Bills except by way of suggestion - " Suggestion Bills " there means Bills which can only be amended by the Council byway of suggestion - but has amended in the ordinary manner clauses in admitted suggestion Bills, when such amendments do not raise money or appropriate revenue. In other words, instead of there being in the Council a distinct line of demarcation between Bills received from the House of -Assembly - on one side Bills which the Council cannot amend at all except by way of suggestion, and on the other Bills which the Council can amend in all parts in any manner - there is no line of demarcation at all, and al! parts of all Bills received from the House of Assembly which do not raise money or appropriate - revenue are amended in the ordinary manner, and all parts of all Bills which ra'ise money or appropriate revenue are amended by way of suggestion. </para>

                <para class="block">In this case I am forced to put an interpretation upon the Constitution, because the conduct of the business of the Senate demands that we should have the matter decided, otherwise we could not go on. The paragraphs I have just read throw a light on the subject. This is a Bill to impose duties of Customs, but it contains a clause - clause 4 - .which, according to my interpretation of the Constitution, which may or may not be right, it ought not to contain. It seems to me that section 55 of the Constitution, which provides that laws imposing taxation shall deal only with the imposition of taxation, requires that the imposition of taxation, and perhaps some small details which relate to the imposition of taxation, are the only matters which ought to be contained in a measure of this nature. Now we have a clause which, under the guise of being a condition as to the imposition of the tax is really a clause to regulate the maximum prices to be paid for stripper-harvesters. Is that a proper clause to insert in the Bill ? It does not appear to me that it is. And not being a clause to which the provisions of the Constitution, in respect ' of requests, apply, I think we ought to be able to amend it in the ordinary manner. That is a matter which is of very great importance, because the privileges and powers of the Senate may be challenged by the other House sending up Bills imposing taxation with! a tack to them. Section 55 of the Constitution was made purposely in order to protect the powers of the Senate, and I would ask honorable senators, no matter what they may think of the merits of this particular clause, to bear in mind that if they at once admit the principle of a tack - and this seems to be a tack - they will be placing themselves in a very unfortunate position. Ever since it was inaugurated, the Senate has struggled to maintain its proper powers and position : it has struggled against the Ministry and against the other House; and I 'hope that honorable senators will view this matter from .a broad point of view, and agree that in respect of this clause amendments may be moved in the ordinary manner. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> proposes that unless the Governor-General is satisfied that no stripper harvesters- or drills, as the case may be, are sold at prices exceeding those prescribed, the provisions of the clause shall apply, and the duty shall be reduced. That, I submit, would leave it in the power of any two evilly-disposed persons to frustrate the whole intention of the clause. Let us assume that 4.000 or 5.000 stripper harvesters- are sold in Australia, and that it is proved that one stripper-harvester was sold at a price exceeding that prescribed. In such a case, the Governor-General could not be satisfied that no stripper-harvesters were sold in Australia because one had been sold. </para>

                        <para>- I am inclined to think that it would be extremely difficult to operate the clause as it stands. It seems to me that the intention of the clause is that the duties shall not operate if harvesters are being sold in the ordinary way of trade at more than the prices set out; that is, sold in an appreciable number, and not merely one or two. </para>

                        <para>- That would have to be left to the discretion of the Governor-General. If my honorable friend were administering the measure he would be able to discriminate between a sale that appeared to be instituted with an object, and a genuine sale. I agree that the clause would be difficult to work. I contend, however, that the amendment would be baneful to the last degree, because it would leave it in the power of any two evil-disposed persons to create a sale at a price which would render inoperative the intention of Parliament to give protection to this industry. </para>

                        <para>- The clause is inserted ostensibly to give an advantage to the farming community of Australia in return for the increased measure of protection given to the manufacturers of harvesters. But it will not secure that the manufacturers will sell to the farmers their implements according to the scale of charges here laid down. A more futile attempt to impose upon the credulity of the people of this country has never been perpetrated. The clause is put forward as evidence of the <inline font-style="italic">bond fides</inline> of the supporters of the Bill, and of their desire to shelter the consumer from any extortion which the manufacturer mav feel disposed to exercise towards him. But what happens? When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> moves .an amendment which will give effect to that provision, the Minister refuses it, though without it the clause must be inoperative. </para>

                    has very pertinently raised the question of whether only one harvester or all harvesters are to be sold at those prices. What is to prevent a number of manufacturers; from combining to establish a small factory and turning out a certain number of machines at the scheduled prices, whilst others - secure from foreign competition - are demanding a higher price for their harvesters?

                        <para>- I contend that upon this clause the Committee are entitled to some information from the Minister. If he is determined! that he will offer no information concerning the conditions under which the Governor-General will be advised <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> issue his proclamation I can only assume that he accepts my version of the matter that the clause is merely intended as a placard, and that practical effect cannot be given to it. If practical effect could be given to it, there would be no objection on the part of the Minister to explain how. He can only remain silent for the best of all reasons, namely, that he recognises that it is impossible to say what would happen under any set of conditions that are likely to arise. It is quite obvious that unless the manufacturers agree to sell at the prices mentioned in this schedule the clause cannot be put into operation. If they do so agree, they will be- liable to a prosecution under the Australian Industries Preservation Act for having entered into a combination for the purpose of fixing prices. </para>

We are not lightning conductors in matters of this sort, and we should' have been only too willing to agree to an amendment which would have assisted the passage of the Bill at the earliest possible moment. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> overheard some whispered conversation between myself and my colleague, and was under the impression that there was a likelihood of my supporting the amendment. I can assure the honorable senator that, before he commenced to speak, I had made up my mind that, whatever objections there might be to the clause as it stands, there were considerably more objections to it with the addition of the words proposed. If the amendment be carried, it will place the whole of the manufacturers at the mercy of any unprincipled man who chooses to sell a machine at a certain price. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon.</inline>
                    Evidently it was never intended that the clause should have any effect, because its operation is entirely permissive. The proposal is to increase the duty on harvesters with no intention to reduce that duty until Parliament insists by some other legislation. As I say, the whole provision is permissive, and an absolute fraud. It is trifling with the Senate and the people to enact legislation which it is known cannot effect the purpose intruded. I have no doubt, however, that there is a majority prepared to swallow the clause so long as, on the face of it, there is apparent a spirit of fair play.

Clause 4 provides for certain duties under certain conditions, and we are asked who is to take action when those conditions are not observed. The clause distinctly sets forth who is to take action. </para>

This clause - and honorable senators opposite are aware of the fact - was inserted for the protection of the farmers and others who use these machines. The duty of the Government is to protect the producer, and whenever they see that the manufacturers of these implements are unduly raising prices they will be able to step in and reduce the duty by one- half . </para>

Whilst I voted for the second reading of the Bill because it provides for an increase of duties with which I am in accord, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> has rightly interpreted my attitude. I am totally opposed to this clause, because I believe that it is absolutely impossible to regulate prices. We do not even attempt to define what harvesters or strippers are.

                        <para>- The honorable senator admits that it is imperfect, and would be difficult to administer. In moving my amendment, I said distinctly that my sole object was to insure that this provision, which is intended for the protection of the users of these machines, shall afford real protection, and not be a sham. I stated that I was prepared to accept any modification of my amendment that would more effectively carry out my object. I am not here for fun. My object is to secure something that will realize the expectation of the farmers that they will derive some benefit from the concessions granted to these manufacturers. I do not pledge honorable senators to vote for the amendment that I shall subsequently submit but I repeat that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> ought to vote for that which I have moved, in order to indicate his opinion that the clause as it stands will be difficult to administer, and should ask the Minister to re-cast it so that a real protection will be granted to the farmers. There is no doubt that these words make the clause absolutely unworkable. The Governor-General is empowered to reduce the duty by 50 per cent., but a condition is imposed which prevents him from doing anything at his own discretion. How is the Governor-General to satisfy himself that this condition has been complied with? Is he to issue his proclamation when he is satisfied that one stripper-harvester has been sold at a price in excess of that specified ? If that is what the provision means, it is open to exactly the same criticism that has been levelled against my amendment. I do not pretend that my proposal is a perfect one, but, at least, it is workable. It has been urged that some unprincipled person might sell a machine at a price in excess of that set out in the Bill, in order to bring about a reduction of the duty, but that assumes a fraudulent sale. If a proclamation were issued without sufficient warrant, the person aggrieved would have the right to appeal to the law. Courts. I would prefer that the clause should be amended so as to leave the Governor-General entirely free from any hampering conditions. That is to say, if at any time it is brought to the GovernorGeneral's notice that a large proportion of the machines were being sold at prices in excess of those stipulated, he might reduce the rate of duty. </para>

                    <para>- Unless we assume a combination among the manufacturers of harvesting machinery, the clause cannot become operative. If all the manufacturers agreed upon one price, the clause would be of some value, but such a combination would be in contravention of the Australian Industries Preservation Act. I would ask the Minister to carefully consider the fact that the clause provides that the Governor-General shall be satisfied that the cash prices at which the machines " are sold " exceeds the prices specified before he reduces the rate of duty. If the Governor-General found that fifty machines had been sold, could he issue his proclamation? If he proposed to do any such thing, would not the manufacturers represent that, although fifty strippers, perhaps, had been sold at excessive prices, there was not the slightest intention on their part to sell any more at the higher prices. Would the Governor-General, in the face of a definite promise that no further breach would take place, still reduce the duty. Honorable senators who are anxious that protection shall be given to our local manufacturers should pay very serious attention to this provision. If it were ascertained that a certain number of machines had been sold at prices in excess of those specified, the Government for the time being might decide that the dutv should be reduced. Do any of the protectionists desire that such a result should be brought about? Yet that is the most likely thing to happen. I think that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> recognised that the clause as it stands will not effect his object he would endeavour to alter it. There are. of course, many criticisms to be offered to it besides that of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon.</inline> One of them is suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith,</inline> who anticipates the possibility of the price of raw material being increased, or some other alteration of trade conditions taking place, so as to absolutely prevent the profitable manufacture of the machines at the prices set forth. </para>

                    <para>. - As I stated when speaking on the second reading, I am entirely in accord with the object sought to be achieved by clause 4, which, briefly stated, is to safeguard the interests of purchasers of agricultural implements, who, being prevented for the sake of the local manufacturers from obtaining machines from abroad, are compelled to purchase in this market. The difference of opinion amongst honorable senators is not, I think, as to the object of the clause, but as to the method by which it is sought to make it effective. The Tariff Commissioners evidently had in mind the same end as that of the framers of the clause, though they suggest a different way of arriving at it. In the three provisos which are set out on page 34 of their report, while recommending the remission or suspension of duties, if prices are raised above those ruling in Australia during 1905, they foresaw the possibility of pernicious influence being exercised if the decision of the matter were <inline font-style="italic">left to</inline> a Minister, and therefore proposed that the Governor-General should act in pursuance of a joint address by the Senate and the House of Representatives,. No doubt they thought that the determination of Parliament, whatever might be its wisdom, would at least be come to in the full light of publicity, and would, therefore, be free from suspicion of malign influence. The clause, however, leaves the matter entirely in the hands of the Governor-General, which means the Administration of the day, and, in practice, the Minister of Trade and Customs, while we sometimes find that a Minister, instead of being the master, is the slave of his officers. Protests have frequently been made in this Chamber against legislation whose effect is to give to an Administration or a Minister the power to make laws. This is another instance of such legislation. Whilst professing to make a law, we are leaving it to a Minister to do so. That is one of the objectionable features of the clause. It may be contended, with some force, that nobody is less qualified than is a House of Parliament to give a judicial decision, and, no doubt, an objection to the proposals of the Commissioners is that Members of Parliament would vote on this question in accordance with the fiscal opinions whose expression secured their election. The alternative, however, is to leave the matter to a Minister, who may be very impressionable, and largely sympathetic, with the result that he may be disposed to take action, or to refrain from doing so, without closely examining the statements put before him by interested manufacturers. Experience has shown that, when undue power is left in the hands of a Minister, the door is opened, if not to corruption, to the operation of malign influence. It is not long since the present Minister of Trade and Customs took action in regard to the importation of harvesters, for which he was very strongly censured. He arbitrarily increased the valuation put upon imported machines for Customs purposes, and, for some mysterious reason, explainable only by the fact that the largest local manufacturers of similar machines had had an interview with him, did so without having followed the customary practice of the Department in addressing to the importers concerned a letter asking them to show cause why such action should not be taken. A little later, when the aggrieved importers sought redress at law, and moved for the appointment of a Commission to take evidence in Canada as to the actual cost price of the machines made there, the Government resisted that, and thus violated our ideas of. equity and fair play. It requires no great effort of the imagination to conceive that, under certain circumstances, and with certain individuals in a position of power, the worst elements of corruption such as has been associated with Tariff changes in America might assert themselves here, though I hope that that will never happen. Still, if we leave it absolutely to the Minister to say when the protection of the Customs laws shall be given or withheld, scandal must inevitably occur. Regarding both the proposition of the Tariff Commission and the provisions in the Bill as objectionable, I am sorry that the Government have not kept back the measure until they could formulate a workable scheme. As we are very near the end of the session, and much important business remains to be transacted, it may be impossible to do so now ; but I urge the seriousness of this matter, and I hope that Ministers will, with a view to properly securing the benefits aimed at, pay considerable attention to the objections which I have outlined. </para>

                    <para> I hope that the Committee will not agree to this clause. . I do not propose to say a word about the objects of the clause, with which I entirely sympathize. I ask the Committee to strike out the clause for reasons which have nothing to do with its objects. As I have said before, section 55 of the Constitution was inserted for the purpose of conserving the powers and position of the Senate, and to prevent any tack being made on a taxation Bill sent up to the Senate. We are now dealing with what in my opinion as a senator is a tack. The objects of this clause have nothing whatever to do with the imposition of taxation. Those objects may be good or bad, but we should not in this matter take into consideration the particular Bill or the particular clause. We should consider what the ultimate effect might be of permitting a tack to be made on a Bill such as this. I hope that in this instance I shall have the assistance of the Government in striking out the clause, because I find that Ministers themselves opposed a similar clause, which was moved as an amendment to the Excise Tariff (Spirits) Bill, and on the ground that it was contrary to the provisions of the Constitution.</para>

            <para class="block">I say that is very similar to the clause with which we are now dealing, lt was inserted in the Tariff Bill with an object foreign to the imposition of the duties - to obtain for the employes engaged in the industry a certain rate of wages - and in my opinion its insertion was not warranted by the provisions of section. 55 of the Constitution. It does not deal with the imposition of duties, and the Government opposed it on that ground. How could Ministers oppose the insertion of that clause in that particular Bill on the ground that it ought not to be inserted because the Constitution in section 55 provides that no such clause can be inserted in a Bill dealing with the imposition of duties, and now agree to the retention of this clause in the Bill before the Committee. The matter has been debated at considerable length, and I do not wish to repeat the arguments that have teen adduced, but I ask honorable senators to consider the question from the constitutional point of view - from the point of view that the Senate should uphold its own rights, powers, and privileges - and to subordinate the particular issue and the particular question raised, by the clause itself. </para>

                    <para>. - The views expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> in this matter are entirely mv own views, with this great difference, that I cannot believe that a matter of this kind is ever going to be determined by a politically divided body such1 as this Committee or the Senate is. It seems to me that a matter involving the rights and privileges of the Senate must be asserted by the one officer of the .Senate, who, from his position, is enabled to view all such questions impartially and free from party influence. I hold that it is upon his shoulders that the duty rests of protecting the rights and privileges of the Senate. We know that it is a common practice in the State Legislatures that, where a Bill passing between the two Houses is believed to trespass upon the rights of the House receiving it, the Presiding Officer draws immediate attention to it, and if the objection is at all vital, that settles the fate of the particular measure. The same thing has happened in this Chamber. I recollect a measure coming from another place, which, in the opinion of the President, disclosed some defect. He at once drew attention to it, and action was taken to mark the sense of disapproval of the Senate upon it If I understand <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker's</inline> position now, he admits that this Bill is wrongly here, and contains a tack, but appeals to the Committee to determine the matter. I have not the honorable and learned senator's parliamentary experience, but I say that it is idle to look for a judicial determination of such a question to a tribunal such as this, which is sharply divided by political feeling, and the judgment of whose members may be warped by the merits or demerits of the particular measure before them or by the fact that they will be called upon to give a vote which may affect the fortunes if not the fate of a Government. I say with great regret that if it is to be recognised by the Senate that it is not the duty  of  our responsible officer to determine such matters, it is hopeless to expect the Senate or a Committee of the Senate to do it, and we may once and for all say good-by to those powers and privileges which bv express provision of the  Constitution  have been supposed to be conferred upon us. </para>

As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> he now appeals to the Committee to strike out the clause and for what reason ? . Because in his opinion it is utterly wrong,. and cannot be constitutionally defended.  His  two utterances have been absolutely contradictory, and if I look for an explanation all I can find is that as  President  the honorable and learned senator said he could not officially interpret the Constitution. Why ? Was it because this point is in any way difficult? Was it because it would cost him one moment's more thought to interpret the Constitution as it affects this particular clause than it cost him to interpret the Constitution when he was called upon to decide whether Bills proposing an alteration of the Constitution required to be passed by an absolute majority of the Senate? I am dealing with a statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> in Committee. We are in a most unfortunate position with regard to this question of requests and amendments. I am not divulging what is in the least degree private when I say that owing to the ruling which has been given it is absolutely dangerous now to effect any alteration in this clause ; although I am satisfied that even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> would be glad if some opportunity were afforded to put it into better shape. It is most unfortunate that we should have had about three different rulings from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> tonight. I honestly wish that I had never challenged the Chairman's ruling. I wish I had left it to some one else to appeal to the President. I am utterly tired of endeavouring to do my small part to maintain the rights and privileges of the Senate when I find that as the only result we are rendered powerless and impotent owing to contradictory decisions. It is left to us only to indicate some sort of amendment which would affect one thing in this clause, and that is its sincerity. If I could do anything to bring that about I should be glad to do it. </para>

                    although I think that some of them were severe. I regret the turn which matters have taken in connexion with this highly-important constitutional question. The Constitution says that " laws imposing duties of Customs shall deal with duties of Customs only." We have to determine whether the clause before the Committee violates those plain words. The President was asked to rule on the point whether the Bill dealt with matters other than duties of Customs, and if so, whether that amounted to an infringement of section 55 of the Constitution. The only debatable point which he had to decide was as to whether or not the clause was a tack. He did not rule on the point because he said that it involved an interpretation of the Constitution. But since then, in his capacity as a senator, he has told us that it involves matters other than duties of Customs. If, as President, he did not feel himself at liberty to interpret the Constitution - and I cannot see where that question came in - then the Senate is equally in the position of not being called upon to interpret it. My regret is that, in his capacity as a senator, he should seek to ask the Committee to do that which he declared that he, as President, cannot do, and which I hold the Senate cannot do. He spoke, in the first instance, as the voice of the Senate. It can always disagree with any ruling he gives, but it is he, and he alone, to whom we look in the first instance for a ruling. He occupies a judicial and impartial position. He can give a ruling on a point of this kind with safety and propriety ; but the Senate cannot. It is divided by party feeling, and therefore it is idle to ask the majority on the other side to stultify itself by throwing out the clause. How can we expect Ministers who. when on a former occasion they resisted a provision of this kind, were beaten, to listen to an appeal when they know that they will not be beaten ?

                        <para>- The honorable senator has missed the point of the appeal which has been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> to the Ministers. The reason they gave for resisting the amendment was that it was a violation of section 55 of the Constitution. I should welcome my honorable friend's yielding to the appeal but I could not expect them to do such a silly thing. If the Ministry, with a majority at their back did not seek to carry through the Bill with clause 4 in it they would inspire the greatest possible contempt. In the interests of the Senate, I regret the turn which affairs have taken. I protest against this incident being regarded as a precedent. No President ought to shrink from doing what he is afterwards willing to appeal to the Senate to do, and that is to interpret the Constitution. For these reasons I am unable, with great regret, to join in resisting the clause. If the Government yield, I am not prepared to go with them in asking the Senate to take upon itself the duty winch properly devolves upon the President, of declaring that the clause is an infringement of section 55, and ruling it, so <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> speak, out of order by a majority. </para>

                    GOULD (New South Wales) [1.40]. - I very much regret the turn which affairs have taken, but, unlike
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline>
                    I do not feel that I would not be justified in voting against the clause. Whatever reasons may have influenced the President in dealing with the point of order as he did ought not to influence honorable senators in dealing with the clause when it is put to them that it is a violation of section 55 of the Constitution. I have always held that the Bill is out of order, because the clause is a tack. This, however, is not the time for reviewing the decision of the President. The reasons which will actuate honorable senators in dealing with the clause would probably have influenced their judgment if the ruling had been submitted to them for review. It would have been only natural, I think, for the Senate to confirm the decision which certain honorable senators considered did not accord with the true construction of section 55 of the Constitution. We all know that
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline>
                    has made himself acquainted with the reasons for the provisions of the Constitution. He can construe its provisions, I take it, as well as any member of the Senate. When he was freed from the responsibility of his position as  President,  he pointed out the objection which he has to the clause, and thus confirmed the interpretation which some honorable senators put on section 55 when the point of order was discussed. If it is now thought that he is right in his view that the clause is an infringement of that section, it would be wise for the Government and their supporters to allow it to be negatived, and thus avoid the creation of an undesirable precedent. Already one or two cases have been cited to us as precedents for taking a certain line of action, and it would not be fair to call upon us to create another precedent of the kind. It would be a great mistake for honorable senators, merely for the sake of gaining an advantage in connexion with this Bill, to take a step which would prejudice the position of the Senate. When it first met, there was a strong determination expressed bv honorable senators generally that they would maintain the principles of the Constitution, and insist upon a due recognition of the rights and privileges of the Senate. I do not believe that there is one honorable senator who is willing to barter away its rights. We all have a duty to perform to the States, and it cannot be discharged properly if we surrender any right or privilege of the Senate. I trust that the Committee will see its way to negative the clause, which, from the constitutional stand-point, I regard as most obnoxious. No doubt we are all agreed that the local manufacturers of stripper-harvesters should not be able to charge exorbitant rates to the farmers, under cover of any Federal legislation. If we could deal' with the clause on its merits, a great deal could be said in its favour ; but it is quite unworkable, and if it were passed it would convey, not only to the other House, but to the general public, the impression that, apparently, we are unmindful of the great trust reposed in our hands.

I can well understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker,</inline> as President, feels it is not his duty to construe the Constitution ; but, in Commit- ' tee on the Bill, he has an equal right with any honorable senator to express his personal opinion. If I am not mistaken, he mentioned in the Chair that, in Committee, he would probably have some remarks to offer to us, no doubt referring to an expression of his private opinion. I am sorry that he has been misunderstood by some honorable senators. I believe that he only did his duty as President in declining, to say what the Constitution meant. I hope that the clause will be allowed to go to a division. </para>

                    <para>. - The point which is now urged as a reason for opposing the clause is that it is inconsistent with the Constitution. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> has urged the point upon us, and a good' deal of adverse criticism has been hurled at him because he took up a different position when he discharged his duty as President. To refuse to take the responsibility of stopping discussion on the point by an authoritative act is a very different thing from expressing his personal opinion, which he has admitted may be wrong. For that reason, I think that the criticism of his action has been somewhat unfair. I had the honour to take part in creating the Constitution - a very humble one, I admit, among so many men of transcendent ability. But I feel a great deal of pride in the Constitution, and should be very loth indeed, without an amendment of it formally made, to submit to an abrogation of any part of it. But I do not see that what is proposed is in any sense a tack. This is a Bill dealing with Customs duties only. It is a Money Bill. An attempt to amend it is, in my opinion, contrary to the powers of the Senate, and would lead to a constitutional conflict which ought not to occur in this connexion. </para>

                        <para>. - I am very loth to occupy the time of the Senate at this hour, but I feel that it is necessary to say a few words in order to conserve my rights. I wish to draw your attention, sir, to entries in the <inline font-style="italic">Journals</inline> of the Senate with regard to the proceedings last Friday in connexion with the proposed call of the Senate. I think that you will find that they are not quite accurate. I will mention three points in which I think corrections should be made. One is the statement that the Minister had leave to amend his motion; another that a division was called for ; and the third that one honorable senator only appeared as voting with the ayes. As a matter of fact there were no senators on that side. The matter affects me to a certain extent, because the <inline font-style="italic">Journals</inline> would appear to read as though I was the senator referred to as being the one "aye," whereas there was actually none. I only saw the <inline font-style="italic">Journals</inline> yesterday, and I forebore to draw your attention to these inaccuracies until I had seen the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report. I have seen since the proof report of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and I find that it is quite accurate in every respect. </para>
