                    <para>. - It is very undesirable that we. should make an alteration of the Constitution by an amendment of the text. It should not be made, as proposed, by striking out words and inserting others, and adding words, but by an additional provision which would exactly express the intention. If that plan were adopted, it would leave the text of the Constitution unimpaired, and that would be exceedingly useful for historical purposes. Every one would then know exactly what it was originally. If, however, it be amended from time to time in the undesirable way I have indicated, I presume that the printer would be instructed to reprint the Constitution with the alteration. It would become very confusing after a time, and extremely difficult to ascertain when alterations were made. The time will come, I think, when, as in the United States, the Constitution will be printed and used as a manual in the State schools. We should follow the example of that country, so that the young people may always have the Constitution as it was agreed to by the people, and the various amendments set out separately, with' the dates upon which they . were made. Otherwise our children and their children would feel a certain amount of contempt for the </para>

                <para class="block">Constitution tinkerers who came along after its founders. The Bill proposes to amend section 87 by striking out words and inserting others, and by adding words. Suppose that those alterations be made, the Constitution must be looked at, I suppose, from that time as though it had been originally printed in that way. The alterations are to be made with a view to provide for the imposition of special duties of Customs, but section 89, sub-section 1, says - </para>

                <para class="block">The revenue to be collected from special duties of Customs would have to go to the credit of the State, because, I presume, that as it comes later in the Constitution, section 89 would override section 87 as amended. Then there is section 93. I have not carefully gone through the whole of the Constitution to see how it would be affected by the proposed alterations. There may be other slips of a similar nature. The better plan, in my judgment, would be to frame a new section of the Constitution, embodying the whole purpose intended. The course which I suggest seems to me to be preferable to that pursued by the Government, because it avoids altering the text of the Constitution, and makes the issues to be submitted to the referendum of the people much simpler. Under the Bill I presume that the question submitted to the electors would be, "Are you in favour of the Bill to alter the Commonwealth Constitution with respect to the appropriation of special duties of Customs and Excise?" That question would have to be answered " Yes" or " No." The candidates at the elections will presumably have the duty of endeavouring to explain intricate constitutional amendments, in addition to discussing political issues of a broader character. Indeed, under the proposal of the Government, if the candidates satisfactorily expound all the amendments to be submitted to the electors they will not be able to talk much about what Parliament has done in the past, or what it is to do in the future. If the proposed amendment of the Constitution is submitted in the form of that Bill, most of the electors will be mystified as to what it is all about. If, however, the proposal is put before them in a clear and definite shape, they will be able to vote "Yes" or "No" upon it without difficulty. I therefore move - </para>

                    <para>. - I wishthat <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> had circulated his amendment, so that we might have considered it. I am very much impressed with his argument in favour of it, though I do not think that his contention that the proposal of the Commonwealth Government conflicts with sections 89 and 93 of the Constitution is well founded. Section 89 commences, " Until the imposition of uniform duties of Customs." The efficacy of that clause has, therefore, expired. Section 93 relates to payments to the States for the first five years after uniform duties have been imposed. From the point of view of clean drafting, there can be no doubt that the method of the Government is the better, because it shows -what parts of the Constitution are repealed ; and when the Constitution is reprinted, the amendments made will be inserted in it, so that when a person obtains a reprinted copy the state of the law will be absolutely clear upon the face of it. The honorable senator considers it inadvisable to make the amendment in the way proposed by the Government,, on the ground that young children, to whom we are supposed to teach the laws of the land, ought to be made acquainted with all the various alterations which, are made. I, myself,' see no necessity for such a. precaution,, so long as the children are taught the law as it exists. However. I do not oppose the amendment, subject to any revision of terms which may be considered advisable, so long as it covers all that the Government desire. As pointed out, the amendment will have the advantage of placing before the electors a clean-cut issue. </para>

                        <para>- That may be; and, if so, there is something in the Minister's contention. But no indication has been given as to where the amendment will be inserted; and it is extremely doubtful if the fact that it is latest in date will give it the overriding effect that the Minister intends and believes it will have. In my opinion, it is almost a matter of public ' reproach that this Bill should have come to us in such an incomplete form. We are in great danger in undertaking so serious a task, if we are not perfectly certain that the amendments we insert will have the effect intended. It is not in accordance with his position as leader of the Senate, for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> to pay this matter such slight attention. It would be better to devote five minutes, or even an hour, longer to' the proper carrying out of our intention, than to have slip-shod legislation. I have great doubt whether, with the proposed amendment inserted, the conflict between, it and section 93, is not one. which ought to be avoided. I have done my duty by pointing out the difficulty, because, after all, the responsibility is largely with the leader of the Senate, though, of course, no honorable senator should shirk his share of that responsibility. I doubt whether the amendment, admirable as it is. goes so far as it ought to go. </para>

                    <para>. - The operation of section 93 of the Constitution is fixed for the first five years after the imposition of uniform duties, and thereafter until Parliament otherwise provides. This is a proposal which, I take it, ought not to be regarded as a mere parliamentary enactment - an amendment of the Constitution amounts to something more. If there is any legitimate reason for doubt, we could possibly overcome the difficulty by preceding <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake's</inline> amendment with the words " Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in' the Constitution." That would remove any doubt such as that suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons.</inline></para>

When the honorable senator was speaking, I asked - " What about the bookkeeping section?" To that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> replied that the bookkeeping section would not apply. I think, however, that the point is far from clear. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford,</inline> that if the proposed amendment conflicts with the Constitution, the amendment, as coming last after an interval of five or six years, must prevail. But it is not a question of contradiction ; it is a question whether the revenue is to be chargeable to the States, subject to one of the fundamental principles of the Constitution. Wise legislators and good draftsmen ought to take care that any addition is not subject to the Constitution, or state that it is not meant tcn be so subject. </para>

                        <para>-The addition alters the Constitution by giving power to impose specific .duties, the revenue from which is to be applied to specific purposes. Supposing that in one year there was, under these specific duties, a surplus Â°f Â£50,000, would it not lie with the State which had raised the larger sum <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> to claim it, and, if necessary, to enforce its claim in the High Court? This question was raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> when he made the remarks to which I have already referred. If my honorable friend had said yesterday that all could take a share of it, I would have expected that our hands would have been held up in horror. Why should we propose an amendment which would enable us to take Â£30,000 of the revenue belonging to Western Australia? </para>

                        <para>- 0;n, the point of order, it appears to me that the primary object of the Bill is to take a referendum in order .that" the people may be asked whether they will agree to such an alteration of the Constitution as would permit the Commonwealth Parliament to impose special duties for a particular purpose, and retain the whole of those duties for that purpose. Mv amendment is really a proposal that the question which the people should be asked at the referendum is whether they will agree to permit the Commonwealth authorities to retain sufficient of the present revenue from Customs and Excise now returnable to the States to meet the cost of an old-age pensions scheme. The whole proposal is to take the voice of the people with regard to a certain amendment. I propose to alter the question to be submitted to the people at the referendum. The Bill proposes a certain course of procedure in connexion with old-age pensions, and my amendment, having a distinct reference to that, I submit that it is perfectly in order. </para>

                <para>I am of opinion that, while the subject-matter of the Bill contemplates expenditure - and I think the common-sense interpretation is that it does - it is within the power of the Committee, if it wishes, to restrict that expenditure The money to be raised by the imposition of the special duties might be used for all kinds of purposes. I take it that, by his amendment, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> wishes to restrict the use of the money, and therefore I rule that it is in, order. </para>

                    took the point that the amendment to his amendment is not in order, because it is not within the subject-matter of the ! JB i 1 1 . It is not for me to decide what the object of

                    is. He may wish that the money to be expended for that or any other purpose shall be taken, out of the three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue which is now handed back to the States. It is not my duty to interpret his object. I can only take into consideration the words of his amendment. If it is not in order, I fail to see how the following words of
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake's</inline>

                        <para>- I recognise that the point of order has been very clearly put by the Chairman of Committees. No objection has been taken to mv amendment on the ground that it is out of order. We are dealing with a Bill which has to do with the appropriation of the revenue to be derived from special duties of Customs and Excise. It proposes to amend the Constitution in such a way as to make that revenue subject to a different law from that which governs the revenue now derived from duties of Customs and Excise. At the present time the Commonwealth has power to raise revenue from such duties to any extent, provided that three-fourths of it shall be given back to the States in which it has been collected. The Bill deals with a different subject, and that is the revenue to be derived from special duties of Customs and Excise which are not to be subject. to that provision. My amendment, which I submit is strictly in order, simply proposes to put clause 2 of the Bill into a different form. It deals with the revenue to be derived from special duties of Customs and Excise to be imposed for and devoted to a special purpose.. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> by . his amendment, wishes to alter the law in regard to the treatment of the revenue from ordinary duties of Customs and Excise. He proposes that in future the whole or any part of the Customs and Excise revenues raised may be devoted to the payment  of old-age pensions. So far as his amendment would have any effect, it would take the revenue derived from Customs and Excise out of the operation of section 87 of the Constitution. The objection that I have to it is that this .Bill deals with special duties of Customs and Excise, and that we cannot in a Bill of that nature, the second reading of which has been passed, introduce an amendment in Committee which deals with ordinary duties of Customs and Excise. </para>

                        <para>- I think that the point urged by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> is sound. The Bill before us is one to alter the Constitution, so as to empower the Federal Parliament to raise special duties of Customs for a special purpose. We have not that power now. We can raise duties through the Customs, but we are limited by the Constitution as to how we shall use them. One-fourth of the revenue may be devoted to the services of the Commonwealth, and at least three-fourths must, under the Constitution, for a certain period, be returned to the States. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart's</inline> amendment, instead of providing for dealing with special duties, which is the object of the Bill, seeks to divert the ordinary duties into another channel. That appears to me to be outside the scope of the Bill, and, therefore, cannot be accepted as an amendment. </para>

                        <para>- I should like to put the facts of the present case as I under- stand them. The Bill has been introduced for a definite object - the appropriation of special duties of Customs and Excise for purposes that are left undefined. The amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> would also have the effect of appropriating special duties for special purposes. But the effect of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart's</inline> amendment is that, instead of appropriating special duties for an indefinite purpose, there shall be an appropriation from the general three-fourths of Customs and Excise revenue for n special purpose. </para>

                        <para>- I should like to point out how the amendment proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> may be contrasted with the amendment proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake.</inline> First of all, we have to remember tEat section 87 of the Constitution for a period of ten years makes the revenue derived from Customs and Excise subject to division as between Commonwealth and State. If we call the existing duties " present duties," and the duties' hereafter to be imposed, and which are not at present imposed, " future duties," the object of the Bill may be summed up as follows: - So far as "present duties" are concerned, the Bill does not alter the effect of section 87. So far as " future duties ' ' are concerned, the Bill provides that for special purposes section 87 shall not apply. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart's</inline> proposal is that, so far as present duties are concerned, Parliament may .appropriate them for a specific purpose. The two amendments are in direct contrast. The one is the converse of the other. That. I think, must be admitted, if we bear in mind the difference between future duties and present duties. Present duties the Bill does not propose, in any way, to affect. Nor does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake's</inline> amendment. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart's</inline> amendment does. It says that, if Parliament decides upon appropriating revenue derived from present duties to specific purposes to that extent, section 87 shall not apply. </para>

                        <para>- Perhaps I may be pardoned for presenting the issue in a fresh form. As the Constitution now stands, under section 87, of every <inline font-style="italic">Â£100</inline> of Customs and Excise duties raised, ^75 have1 to be returned to the States. The purpose of this Bill is not in any way to touch that ^100, or its apportionment. It is to raise a sum of money in excess of the ^100, and it indicates how that excess, when raised, is to be applied. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> now proposes, not an amendment pertaining to the excess amount to be raised under the Bill, but to alter the proportionate distribution of the <inline font-style="italic">Â£100</inline> raised by ordinary Customs and Excise duties. That proposal seems to me to be entirely outside the scope of the Bill. In other words, the Bill proposes to raise fresh revenue, and to appropriate it in a fresh way, whereas <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> proposes merely to appropriate revenue already being raised. There is a sharp distinction between the Bill and the amendment. </para>

                    has moved an amendment which seems to me to negative the whole principle of the Bill. It is a direct negation of its object and subject-matter. I think we should be particularly careful in Bills effecting amendments of the Constitution, to see that all the amendments made are in strict accord with the provisions and subject-matter of the Bill in question, as read a second time.

                    is not in order. I am sorry to differ from the opinion of the Chairman of Committees, but, in this case, my duty seems to me to be quite clear, and the point at issue is. clear.

The Government is appealing to our humanity to make this amendment of the Constitution on the plea that it is for the purpose of paying old-age pensions. It is intended to put it before the electors and to appeal to them on that ground. We have no right to appeal to the best instincts of the people of this country - to appeal to their hearts - to do something when the Government leaves itself in the position after it has secured authority to use it for an entirely different purpose. As the Government has asked us to pass this Bill for the purpose of providing a fund for old-age pensions, I want to provide that they use it for that purpose, and not for something else. My amendment leaves it open for them to carry out their good intention. If- they desire to use the Bill for any other purpose, they ought to say so. I move - </para>

The position put by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> in regard to the intention of the Government is absolutely correct. The Government desire to appeal to the humane and sympathetic feelings of the electors, in order to carry an amendment of the Constitution which, otherwise, they would not dare to propose. On the second reading, I think I showed conclusively that, if we were really' in earnest about old-age pensions, no amendment of the Constitution would be necessary - that all we should require is courage to take the means ready at hand* and provide pensions straight away. The Government proposal, although it may appear on the surface to be humane, is the very opposite. The Government profess to be anxious to minimize the want and suffering of our aged poor, whereas their proposals will have the "effect of taking the bread out of the mouths of the little children of the poorer classes. The proposal is to impose duties on necessaries of life, for which there are no substitutes in the back country. </para>

                        <para>- Even if the man is not in continuous work, he has to contribute the same amount. The wealthy man is not called upon to contribute anything like an equal proportion, and even if he were, he, unlike the poor man. is not deprived of a single necessary of life. I strongly object to the poor man being unduly taxed, and his poor innocent little children being deprived of the necessaries of life, in order to provide a scheme of old-age pensions. The scheme presented to us is an abortion, and should not be tolerated for one moment by the Committee. If there is one source of taxation more than another to which the Government should go for the purpose of providing funds for old-age pensions, it is the lands of Australia. The labours of our old pioneers and explorers, and the population which followed, has given the added value to our land, and created avenues of employment in all directions. Old-age pensions should not depend on any special tax, but should be provided out of the Consolidated Revenue, just as is other expenditure undertaken by the Government. A special tax and special fund will accentuate the idea that an old-age pension is a charity, whereas they should be a charge on the State to which the recipients are entitled, because of the value they have been to the State during their years of active life. In addition to creating a tinge of charity, and consequent soreness amongst the recipients, a special tax and special fund will create a feeling of resentment in the minds of those who have to pay the special tax. This resentment will give rise to a desire to get rid of the burden, and the only way will be to get rid of the special purpose. </para>

                        <para>- If the greater portion pf the people pay the tax there will be an almighty force created against a most worthy object. I contend that the position cannot fairly be put before the people by means of this Bill, because it presents an alternative which really does not exist. Practically we shall say to the people - " You cannot have old-age pensions unless you agree to this tax ' ' ; and that is not a fair statement of the case. </para>

                        <para>- We shall never accomplish reforms if we are frightened by difficulties, or if we weakly palter with our principles. Nothing will drive us into direct taxation but stern necessity. Indirect taxation is the most unjust, wasteful, and extravagant method of raising revenue. Even those who favour indirect taxation know the truth of my words ; but they also know that it is the only way in which the people can be robbed while they are asleep, and the burden shifted on to the shoulders of the poorer people. No vote of mine shall be cast in favour of maintaining the present undue burden of taxation, and certainly not in favour of adding to that burden as the Bill proposes. </para>

                    (New South Wales) [12.10]. - I am entirely in favour of the amendment. As I indicated, in the plainest manner, on the second reading, if this Bill is not to be restricted to old-age pensions, I shall vote against the third reading. The Bill, as it stands, makes it possible to impose duties on articles which are not now subject to duties, and to use the funds so raised for any purpose under heaven. I feel so strongly in the matter that if the amendment is not carried I shall, as I say, deem it my duty 'to vote against the third reading. The Bill opens the door to the widest breach of the Braddon section, which was so lengthily fought in the Federal Convention, and which was specially designed to protect the revenues of the States. At the same time, it imposes no obligation to inaugurate an old-age pensions scheme. The funds raised might be used for a desert railway, the exploitation of the Northern Territory, or any other purpose.

                    <para>. - This is a debatable subject, and when the Government were discussing the Bill, which has for its object the provision of old-age pensions, it may be imagined that the question of whether that object should be clearly set forth came under discussion. After much consideration, however, the Government decided that it would be inadvisable to tie the hands of future Parliaments as to how the money so raised should be applied. There are circumstances which can be conceived as possible, if not probable, under which it might be desirable to raise special funds, say, for purposes of defence. </para>

                    <para>. - I am prepared to support the amendment as originally proposed, but I am opposed to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's</inline> amendment. In altering the Constitution, we should take all reasonable powers. This is simply a permissive Bill. It proposes to permit us to raise revenue in a special way for a special purpose. We have in mind now one special purpose for which, according to the present feeling of Parliament, it is desirable to raise revenue in this special way. But there might easily arise some other equally laudable special purpose for which it would bc well that we should have this special power without the necessity of having recourse again to an amendment of the Constitution. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. It is in accordance with the well-known and wise business rule of corporations to take all possible necessary power. It does not follow that these powers will be exercised. Some honorable senators speak as though it were here proposed to take a power which must necessarily be immediately abused. The powers proposed to be provided for by this Bill can be exercised only after all the forms of Parliament are applied to them by means of a specific Act. For this reason, I believe, that while we are amending the Constitution in this way, it is as well that we should take as wide powers as possible. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> contends that a,nv form of Customs taxation for this purpose is objectionable. I am with the honorable senator and against him. I think that the principle he affirms is- sound to the last degree - that where practicable direct taxation is the most equitable and wise form of taxation to adopt. But we have to consider that we are to-day confronted with the necessity of relieving a large number of extremely deserving citizens, and that at present we have not the power to relieve them. </para>

                        <para>- We should have, if we were agreed. But we are not agreed, and therefore we have not the power. The honorable senator has pointed out that Customs taxation is believed, generally speaking, to be the least open to objection, because, to use his own language, it is a means by which we can rob people whilst they are asleep. It is, however, the most cumbersome and inequitable method of taxation which we can conceive. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> has said that the doctrine of expediency always lands those who follow it in the bog. I remind the honorable senator that civilization has reached its present stage only by the continual application of the doctrine of expediency. We are now faced with the necessity of adopting an (expedient. We have to decide whether we shall adopt the most expeditious means of raising revenue in order tÂ» meet the requirements of old and necessitous persons, or whether we shall stand by sound principles in fiscal matters, and determine that taxation shall be direct, though these necessitous persons may remain unrelieved. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, to the object which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> has in view. The honorable senator should accept the amendment, because it will certainly improve the chance of the Bill becoming law. I cannot understand the honorable senator stating that he is going to oppose the amendment after giving the strongest possible reasons why it should be accepted. If I could bring myself to believe that the principle of having special duties ear-marked for special purposes was a good one, I should say that in amending the Constitution in the way proposed we should make the amendment as wide as possible, so as to take in all special purposes. But I hold the absolutely contrary opinion. I think the principle is a bad one, and that nothing could possibly have commended it to the members of the Committee if this measure had not been put forward as a possible reason for providing old-age pensions. Whilst ] I do not in the slightest degree retract my contention that the Bill 1 is wholly bad, I am prepared to vote for the amendment, because it seems to me that it supplies the only justification which honorable senators have for passing the measure. Whilst I object <inline font-style="italic">in toto</inline> to the ear-marking of any fund for  any special  purpose derived in the way proposed, I wish to give the Committee a reason why, if there be any justification for the measure it is to be found in the purpose for which the Bill has admittedly  been brought forward. We know that the payment of old-age pensions would be a form of expenditure absolutely fair for the whole Commonwealth, and it would relieve some of the States of expenditure which they are now incurring. It seems to me that we could not have money expended on a more worthy or desirable object, but possibly I could not say the same if the proposal were to spend this money on scene other special purpose. It is not difficult to imagine the introduction of a measure applying special duties of Customs and Excise for a specific purpose which would not commend itself to honorable senators. </para>

                        <para>- It might not; but, seeing that our Constitution is a contract between the States, we should not leave too many loopholes which would enable Parliament by means of a mere casual majority to pass measures which we would consider unfair to the States. I have raised the question as to the way in which these ques 1 tions are to be submitted to the people. I find in a Bill, which perhaps I should not refer to, the form of the writ to be issued directing a referendum to be taken on any. question. It is laid down that the writ must contain a copy of the proposed law or a statement with regard to it. Who is to be responsible for the issue of the writ? Are we to have a writ issued for the taking of a referendum on this Bill with a statement as to what the object of it is ? If so. I have no doubt that the statement will be that it is intended to raise a fund for old age pensions. That, it seems to me, would, be a most improper course to adopt. I hold that if the purpose of this measure is to provide a fund for old-age pensions we should put that in the Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mil</inline> Jen's amendment suggests a clear-cut pro position that if the people would consent to the raising of special duties of Customs under the provisions of the Bill all the. money raised in that way should be devoted to the payment of old-age pensions and to no other purpose whatever. Honorable senators are agreed that the only justification for the Bill is that it is to provide a fund for old-age pensions. Then why not say so? Why leave a loophole in the future for this pernicious practice of raising special funds for special purposes when we know that the money might be used for a purpose which, at the present time at any rate, the Senate would not approve? </para>

                    <para>. - I am still unfavorable to the vicious system of raising taxation by means of special duties, and ear-marking it. But, in this instance, I believe in the amendment, because I think that the only justification for the Bill is to ear-mark the revenue derived from the special duties for the purpose of paying old-age pensions. The reason why I spent so much time yesterday in calling attention to various schemes was because in the report of the Royal Commission, the utterances of public men, and in the press, I see no indication that any one understands - although, of course, every one does - that any but the Australian method of giving a pension of 10s. to each old-age pensioner is to be adopted. I desire to move an amendment. But it would save trouble if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> would ask leave to insert in his amendment after the word " providing " the words "or subsidizing" a fund, because I do not want any words in the Bill, which would be likely to prevent the best scheme from being adopted. I might "feel safe, however, if the provision contained the words "creating or establishing." </para>

                    <para>. - I do not see any serious objection to the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> which, I think, the Government would do well to accept. It has been urged that the power sought by the Government might be used for any purpose to which the Constitution would permit the Parliament to apply the money to be raised by special duties. There is a great deal of reason in the contention. If the object of the Bill is to provide a fund for the purpose of relieving the deserving poor by the granting of . old-age pensions, why should it not be made absolutely clear? That, I think, is all that the amendment proposes to do. Of course, if any Government proposed to apply the revenue from this source to any other purpose, their tenure of office would not be worth five minutes purchase. Surely it will be much easier for us to explain the purpose of the measure to the electors if it be printed on its face. I do not ask the Government to accept the amendment with the object of defeating the measure, because I have no sympathy with the tactics of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens.</inline></para>

                    <para>. - We should be careful not to confuse the reference of the proposal to the electors, and its effect if adopted. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie has given a good reason why the amendment might be accepted, and that is, that it would explain the object of the Bill to the electors. But that is not the whole meaning of the proposal. If it were accepted, it would remain in the Constitution until it was struck out, and occasions might arise when it would be justifiable to devote a portion of the money to other purposes. Of course, that could only be done by an Act of Parliament. But if the proposed restriction were inserted in the section of the Constitution, the Parliament would not have the control of the money in its hands. The amendment is also open to the objection that it would establish in Australia the poor rate system- of the old country. The proposed duties are "special duties," not so much in the use of the revenue to be derived therefrom as in its distribution. We all recognise that the object which has prompted the Government to bring in the Bill has been to establish a system of old-age pensions. The accomplishment of that desire is a very different thing from putting a provision to that effect in the Constitution for all time, unless the Parliament otherwise provided. If I could get any support, I should divide the Committee, because I am strongly opposed to the ear-marking of a tax for a special purpose. We recognise that the inauguration of a scheme of old-age pensions would cause a deficit in the revenue of the Commonwealth. The imposition of special taxation is necessary, but the Parliament is not prepared to impose direct taxation sufficient to finance a scheme of old-age pensions. Therefore the only alternative is to impose indirect taxation. Under section 87 as it stands we should be obliged to raise three times as much revenue by indirect taxation as would be required. Therefore, a special provision is submitted to meet that special case, and in order that the intention may be clearly indicated, it is provided that the term " special duties " refers to the duties on articles which were not dutiable prior to January, 1907. For what purpose are the special duties to be levied? To make up the deficit which would be caused in the accounts. </para>

                    <para>. - The further the debate proceeds the more tangling the whole business seems to become. The amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has put the Government "to the touch." It is thereby invited to declare the special purpose for which special duties are to be imposed. But the Government refused to do so. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> tells us that that aspect of the question has been considered by the Government, and that it was decided to leave the whole matter open. So that, under the guise of raising sufficient money to defray the cost of an old-age pensions scheme, the Government is really asking for a large addition to its present revenue from Customs. The Government wants power to add largely to the indirect taxation for purposes which it refuses to define. I am astonished that any honorable senator should even dream of assisting in such a pernicious project. This proposal sweeps away every one of our ideas regarding taxation. We are not told what articles the Government wishes to tax. It gives us no information. It does not say how the money is to be spent. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">It merely says, " Give us <inline font-style="italic">carte blanche,</inline> and trust to our honesty." I am not inclined to do anything of the kind. If the Government proposes such an extraordinary departure from the ordinary procedure as to levy special duties for a special purpose, I want to know something about it. If we are asked to open our mouths, shut our eyes, and swallow whatever Providence may send us, I hope honorable senators will not be so foolish, as to consent. I do not like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's</inline> amendment. I am absolutely opposed to the idea of earmarking revenue for any particular purpose. This plan revives the taxation methods of the Middle Ages. It brings us back to the time when "the people of Great Britain had the crudest ideas possible with regard to taxation, and how the government of the country should be conducted. But if the Ministry insists on thrusting its measures down my throat, I want it definitely stated in the Bill for what purpose it is to be passed. When I am driven into a corner and compelled "to accept the proposal to levy special duties, I am well within my rights in insisting upon the object for which those duties are to be levied being specified in the measure. Much, against my will, therefore, I intend to vote for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's</inline> amendment. Let us here and now put in the Bill what the purpose of the special duties is. Then when we go before the electors we shall have something definite to tell them. Let us pin the Government down, to an old-age pensions scheme in the Bill itself. If the Government refuses to agree to the amendment, what conclusion can I draw? Indeed, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> has told us in so many words that the Government may wish to draw upon this fund for other purposes than old-age pensions. But for the bait of old-age pensions being dangled before their eyes, but for this bunch of carrots being held out before them- </para>

                        <para>- I should not like to say, but if the honorable senator feels that his ears are fairly long he may draw his own conclusion. I am sure of this - that were not this old-age pensions scheme held out to honorable senators as a bait, nine-tenths of those who are supporting the Bill would scout it and toss it out of the Senate with the slightest consideration. We have no guarantee that if Parliament .grants this power of levying additional taxation the money will be used for old-age pensions purposes. It may be wanted for penny postage or for any of a dozen schemes, of which we have not even heard. The proposal amounts to a gross breach of the compact entered into between the States on the establishment of Federation, and before we agree to it we ought to have the most absolute assurances from the Government: I have been a fairly constant supporter of theirs, and confess that I would rather support them than oppose them. But I owe a duty to my constituents, and I have my own self-respect to maintain. I intend to vote for the amendment, because if the Bill must pass I had rather that 'it passed with the amendment embodied in it; but in any case I shall vote against the third reading of the Bill. </para>

                    <para>- The honorable senator is referring to something which took place a long time ago, but from which, by reason of action elsewhere, there has been no result. I ask honorable senators to remember exactly what the position is in reference to the Federal Capital. In October of 1903 there was presented in the House of Representatives a Bill to determine the Seat of Government. A number of ballots were taken, and the final ballot resulted in the selection of Tumut by thirty-six votes as against twenty-five votes recorded for Lyndhurst. The" Bill came up to the Senate, where Bombala was substituted for Tumut. The House of Representatives, however, refused to assent to that amendment, and a majority of the members of the Senate "went back" on themselves, and agreed to the selection of Bombala. Nothing came of that selection. I draw attention to the utter indifference of senators generally to the question of the selection of the Federal Capital, as evidenced by their absence this afternoon. I draw attention to the absence of a quorum. <inline font-style="italic">[Quorum formed,}</inline> In May, 1904, the Ministry of which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson</inline> was the head introduced a Bill irc this Chamber, and the Senate selected Bombala as the site. In the House of Representatives the locality of Bombala was agreed to by thirty-nine votes, as against twenty-eight votes recorded in favour of Lyndhurst. But the Bill -was so altered as to give a preference to a site within 17 miles of the little town of Dalgety. To that the Senate assented, and, so far as any settlement of the matter by the two Houses of the Federal Parliament is concerned, that was the final settlement. </para>

                    <para>- I might have had something to do with securing an investigation of the claims of Dalgety. I thought that, as such a number of extremely out-of-the-way localities were being inspected, it was only fair that a locality which certainly possessed the finest water supply of any should at least be considered bv the Commission. The Federal Parliament was not in session at the time, and I did take some little action, in conjunction with the Prime Minister of the day, to see that the Commission investigated the claims of Dalgety as well as of sites much more out of the way. I offer no apology for that, and I do not suppose that any one will throw it up against me. To-day there are reasons why Dalgety has strong claims for selection, especially in view of its water supply. Both Houses of the Federal Parliament deliberately selected Dalgety or its immediate vicinity. Four months after we had selected that site the New South Wales Parliament, which had remained quiescent while we took action, was invited by the Premier, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers,</inline> to - formally offer to grant to the Federal Government an area of between 100 square miles and 200 square miles at or near the four following sites : - Tumut, Lyndhurst, Dalgety, and Yass. </para>
                </talk.start>
            </interjection>
            <para class="block">The proposal was negatived by both Houses of the State Parliament. It was the negativing of that proposal of the New South Wales Premier that has, to use a colloquial expression, "upset the apple-cart." The Federal Parliament selected a site, and the New South Wales Parliament have refused to grant that site. If there is a complaint or grievance against any one, it is to be found rather in this, that the Federal Government - and I think more than one has been in office during the time - has, if not exactly quiescent, nevertheless shown an amount of ineptitude in not forcing this issue to a settlement. Either the Federal Government, acting on behalf of the Federal Parliament, has a right to force the hand of New South Wales or it has not. By its quiescence it appears to have recognised that it was unable to do anything, and must wait the pleasure of the Parliament sitting in Macquarie-street, Sydney. From the end of 1904 to the present time the Federal Government has been quiescent, at least in so far as any actual outcome of negotiations is concerned. I do not hold that the Federal Government, whether that of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin, Mr. Reid,</inline> or any other, is wholly and solely to blame in this matter. The facts I am prepared to submit will show very clearly that a large measure of responsibility rests on the New South Wales Government and Parliament. As an old member of that Parliament, I am speaking against what was at one time my political nest, but as that Parliament has evinced a verv warlike spirit towards the Federal Parliament I thin'k,the time has surely come when without heat or feeling the Federal Parliament should put forward its views in opposition to the rather rancorous attack that was made upon us some time back in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, and, to some extent, also in the Legislative Council of that State. The facts are these: The Ministry, of which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> See, then <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. See,</inline> was Premier, offered the Dalgety site, as well as some seventeen or eighteen other sites, to the </para>
            <para class="block">Federal Government. That was in the early days of the Commonwealth. Then, while this Parliament was actually considering and determining in 1904 in favour of the Dalgety site, the New South Wales Government, of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas'</inline> Waddell, by proclamation in the <inline font-style="italic">Government Gazette</inline> of the State, deliberately reserved all lands in the neighbourhood of Dalgety for the purpose of the Federal Capital. That was a practical repetition of the offer of Dalgety. Then, as I have already said, at the end of 1904, the State Ministry, headed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers,</inline> invited the State Parliament to offer the Dalgety site to the Commonwealth as one of four from which we might make a selection. I think that no complaint can be made against the Federal Parliament for selecting Dalgety, although I was one who preferred Lyndhurst, as being more centrally situated, particularly in view of the future development of population in Australia. However, upon the negativing of the motion proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. 'Carruthers,</inline> offering Dalgety to the Commonwealth, we had <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers</inline> coming along a year afterwards, and, metaphorically, " raising Cain " because we had selected Dalgety. That happened a! the end of last year. Later still, we have had a number of interesting localities suggested as suitable sites until the issue has become so confused that I suppose there are few members of either Chamber who have any definite idea of what the Government and Parliament of New South Wales really desire in the matter. We had an interesting incident the other day, when the New South Wales Government provided funds to enable members of the Federal Parliament to visit the site of Dalgety, which] the New South Wales Parliament had refused to grant. But there were no funds forthcoming to enable honorable members of this Parliament to visit the site that the New South Wales Parliament had' offered. I mav be accused of speaking against my own State to some extent, but I am a member of the Federal Parliament, and when I. think that all the blame should not rest on one set of shoulders, I have as much right to point out where I think the blame, or some portion of it, should rest, as to hold my peace, and profess that I do not understand. Whilst I have said this on one side, <inline font-style="italic">per contra</inline> I regret that the present Federal Government have not taken </para>
            <para>Steps have already been taken to cope with the difficult matter of selecting the Federal territory within which the capital of the Commonwealth is to be built, and in this task no longer time will be occupied than is necessary for the exercise of a good judgment in the choice of an area which it is hoped will be of a size ample for all public requirements, and of which the climate, accessibility, and natural beauty will give promise of a Seat of Government worthy of the new nation. </para>

It is the old story. The Senate is regarded by Ministries as a sort of sawhorse, off which they can cut certain chunks of legislation, but they take every opportunity - at the opening ari3 the closing of the Parliament - to restrict our sphere of action, and ignore our position in the Constitution Until they learn a little more sense in that regard, they will not get many more chunks, if I can prevent it - </para>

            <para class="block">Only two days ago the Minister of Defence told me across the table that there is no time to do anything. The next paragraph in this speech - .and this, by the way, seems the first speech in which the paragraphs have been numbered - deals with what the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> is pleased to call the " desert railway." Except in the matter of fifteen letters, the latter occupies as much space in the speech as does the Federal Capital. I admit the importance of the transcontinental railway, and if some of those who have the project very much at heart had displayed as much, interest as I have done very likely the Bill would have passed. The point I desire to bring before the Parliament is that a couple of years ago it certainly did select a site. The State Parliament said, " No, we shall not give you that site." The Federal Government then started negotiations with the State Government to arrive at a decision, and I now ask the Senate to record an expression of <inline font-style="italic">regret</inline> that a provision of the Constitution has not been complied with. I do not think that when a member of the Chamber puts forward such a proposition he can be said to be injuring the feelings of any one. He is merely offering an expression of regret that a much vexed and much negotiated question has not been brought to a final issue in, accordance with many vice-regal speeches. I do not blame the Parliament at all, because since we selected a site we have not had an opportunity to correct any misapprehension or difficulty. I take it that a proposition for settling the position of the Federal Capital is one which must come from a Minister, and cannot appropriately come from a private senator. That I do not hold the Federal Government wholly to blame is shown by what I have said. I suppose I have gone as far as any honorable senator has ever (gone in reference to remarks adverse to the doings of the Premier or the Parliament of his State. I go further, and say, as I .have said over my signature in the Sydney press, particularly in the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph,</inline> that in propounding a list of new sites - some of them so absolutely out of the way that there was not even a road to them - the Premier of New South Wales has distinctly tended to delay the settlement of this question. I therefore cannot be supposed to be passing strictures upon the Federal Parliament, especially upon the Senate; nor will the Ministers opposite, I am sure, deem my remarks in any way ungenerous to them. I recognise that there has been a lack somewhere. There has been delay created by the submission of unnecessarily numerous sites. If we are to go on year by year coming across Barren Jack schemes, we can go on for ever, because New South Wales contains a sufficiency of sites for the Federal Capital that practically there would never be an end to the proceeding. From what I have read in the press, I have gathered that some questions have been asked in another place. We have been told that, as certain negotiations are or have been proceeding about the Federal Capital, the Ministry do not seem disposed to disclose the position of affairs. I hope that the Minister of Defence, when he replies, as I am sure he will- </para>

Because this motion which I am now submitting has been on the business-paper for a day or two, I suppose that my honorable friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> knew that it was going to be discussed, and it would certainly be only consonant with the courtesy which usually characterizes my honorable friend that he should be in a position to tell us something about the negotiations which have taken place. My honorable friend is at present conversing over the barrier with the Postmaster-General. Of course, applying to his present source of information, he will only be able to tell us something about Dalgety. Another thought occurs to me. I am afraid that, so long as the present Government lasts, this question never will be settled, because it is notorious that the selection of the Federal Capital Site is of infinitely less importance than the political destinies of two members of the Ministry ; and it is as ' notorious as the fact that the sun does occasionally shine in Melbourne - of which we are assured by what we sometimes read in the newspapers - that in the Cabinet the question has been one, not of " pull devil pull baker," but of " Pull Lyne pull Chapman " for the last five years. It is idle to deny that if one .of those gentlemen does not get the Capital Site in his electorate he is going to take all the care in the world that it is not fixed anywhere else. </para>

                    <para>. - I beg to second the motion. I should like to point out, in doing so, that if there is a grievance on the part of those who desire to see some action taken, it arises entirely from the assurance of the Government, embodied in the GovernorGeneral's speech at the commencement of the session, that an opportunity would be given for revising the decision previously arrived at. If it is said, as it has been to-day, that a decision has been arrived at, and that therefore .there is nothing more to be done, I reply that that position would have been intelligible, and one could have understood it but for the action of the Government. A decision was arrived at by the Federal Parliament for what it is .worth. But the Government embodied an assurance in the Governor-General's speech at the commencement of the present session that an opportunity would be afforded for Parliament to reconsider that decision. </para>

                <para class="block">The complaint of my; honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline> is that that promise has not been redeemed. I am not going to enter into the merits of the matter. 1 do not intend to say where I think the Capital ought to be. I am not going to say, even, that a case has been made out for reopening it. But the Government itself, having voluntarily given a promise to the country that an opportunity would be afforded of further considering the matter, ought either to redeem that pledge or to offer some' substantial reason for departing from it. That is the whole charge which I understand <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> makes, and which I am prepared to indorse. If we are to adhere to the decision previously arrived at, the Government ought not to have embodied the paragraph referred to in the GovernorGeneral's speech. But, having done so, it practically told New South Wales that further action would be taken. Does the Government intend to redeem that pledge, or does it not? </para>

But I do say that, having put it in, New South Wales was practically informed that it was intended to reconsider the subject. Either the Government was honest when it made that promise or it was not. Was it inserted merely for the purpose of creating an impression in the minds of the New South Wales people that the Government would, honestly endeavour to reverse the decision, or was it a, mere empty placard with no honest intention behind it? </para>

                    <para>. - I can to some extent agree with the mover of the motion when he says that the terms of it are very moderate. They are moderate in their appearance. But if the Senate were to pass the motion, I think it would be very properly construed bv .people outside, and more particularly by the people of New South Wales, as tantamount to a reflection upon the action, either of the Senate or of both branches of the Legislature or of the Government. </para>

                        <para>- Speaking for myself personally, and not as a member of the Senate, I ' can say that I agree entirely with the terms of the motion. Nobody regrets - not even New South Wales representatives, in this or the other branch of the Legislature - more deeply than I do the fact that the Federal Capital Site has not yet been selected. I do not think there is any honorable senator, from New South Wales or elsewhere, who could say that I have shirked my responsibilities or duties in this regard. It does not matter to me whether the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> or any other newspaper has called this " The Bush Capital." It does riot matter to me what designation the newspaper chose to fasten on any measure before Parliament - I personally, whether as Minister or private member, am not going to be moved out of the path which I consider to be correct. So far as this particular matter is concerned, I point out that the Federal Parliament in the past, after having had submitted to it by the various Governments of New South Wales, or, at any rate, one Government, a number of sites, which the Government of New South Wales put forward as available for selection, fixed finally on Dalgety. I am not for the moment certain, but I think I am correct in saying that Dalgety was one of the sites which the New South Wales Government submitted to the Federal Parliament for selection. After members of both Houses who chose to avail themselves of the opportunity had inspected the various sites, Dalgety was chosen, and, by a formal Act of this Parliament, was selected as the Federal Capital Site. Subsequent! v action was taken By the New South Wales Government. I think I can fairly and honestly say that, had it not been for the action taken by the Government of New South. Wales, subsequent to the adoption of Dalgety as the site, there would not have been the delay that is now complained of. So far as the promises made by the Federal Government in the speech read at the opening of this Parliament are concerned, I may say that they have formed the subject of correspondence between the Prime Minister and the Premier of New South Wales. Honorable senators and members of another place are quite well aware that during the present session investigations have proceeded in connexion with the site submitted. Who submitted those sites for the consideration of the members of the Federal Parliament? The sites were submitted by the Government of New South Wales. Even at the present time there are other sites under submission to the Federal Government. I think I cannot do better than read the correspondence which recently passed between the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth and the Premier of New South' Wales. The first letter is as follows: - </para>

                        With reference to the selection of a site for the Federal Capital, and to the correspondence which has passed between us relative thereto, I have the honour to inquire whether you propose submitting the question for the consideration of the Commonwealth Legislature, in accordance with the undertaking contained in your despatch of 6th Mav last, to His Excellency the Governor-General, wherein you stated that the matter would be brought before Parliament during the ensuing session, and that ever}' effort would be made to arrive at a final determination thereon.

                        I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th September, on the subject of the Federal Capital Site, and to inform you, in reply, that it was the intention of the Government to arrive at a final determination in the matter, which would have been placed before Parliament some time ago, if it had not been that invitations were received from your Government for members to inspect other sites which had not previously been brought under notice. Until these inspections were completed, it would clearly have been premature to make any proposals to Parliament.

                <para>The Honorable the Premier of New South Wales, Sydney. </para>
                <para>That, I think, is a correct statement. The delay which has occurred has not been due to any desire on the part of the present Government of the Commonwealth, nor. to any inaction on the part of the Federal Parliament. Having that in mind, we should be very careful before we pass a resolution of the character proposed. As I said in my opening remarks, the motion is capable of only one kind of interpretation - a reflection either on us"' as a branch of the Legislature, or a, reflection on the whole of the Federal Parliament, or a reflection on the Commonwealth Government. I feel perfectly certain that any honorable senator, who is mindful of what has occurred, and who recognises the condition of things, must in fairness and justice, say that he cannot honestly pass such a vote of censure. If any honorable senator agrees to the motion, he must recognise that he is passing a vote of censure, either on one branch of the Legislature, on both branches, or on the Executive of the day. I, therefore, with confidence, ask honorable senators, after they have discussed the matter, to refrain from supporting Senator Neild, who has so ably placed before us the case, from the point of view of New South Wales. </para>

                </quote>
                <para>I did not support Dalgety in the first place, because I was in favour of Lyndhurst. But the majority of Parliament accepted Dalgety, and that decision was arrived at after a great deal of investigation by members of both Houses. Many thousands of pounds were spent by both the New South Wales Government and the Federal Government in getting information to enable parliamentary representatives to come to a decision. Representatives of Victoria have been blamed for trying to "chisel" New South Wales out of the Seat of Government ; and members representing other States have also been blamed, because the Seat of Government has not yet been established. From conversations with members for the various States, I have come to the conclusion that they are all as ready as are the representatives of Queensland, to have this matter settled, and to get away from Melbourne as soon as possible. I <inline font-style="italic">do not</inline> for one <inline font-style="italic">moment suggest</inline> that we have been badly treated in Melbourne; on the contrary, we have been treated most handsomely. We have had placed at our disposal this building, which, I think, was erected at a cost of nearly ,Â£1,000,000, and it is certainly a for more palatial building than we can hope to have at the Federal Capital for years to come. I repeat that we have no reason to complain of the treatment we have received at the hands of the Victorian people. It is not because of our treatment that we desire to get away, but because we feel that New South Wales is entitled to have the Capital Site within its borders as soon as possible. We have arrived at a decision after an immense amount of labour on the part of special Commissions appointed 'to collect data, and of trouble in the way of travelling and the reading of reports. We have arrived at a decision, and surely honorable senators will not stultify themselves by "going back" on the decision of the first Parliament? The matter was ;fresh in our minds when we arrived at the decision in 1904. </para>

                        <para>- The Federal Parliament has asked that the territory in which the Seat of Government shall be established shall comprise an area of 900 square miles. The people of New South Wales have a most erroneous impression as to what the Federal Parliament meant when they expressed their desire to obtain a territory of 900 square miles. The idea has been encouraged in New South Wales that we desired to rob that State. If the people understood the matter they -would realize that our object in selecting so large an area was the hope that the Seat of Government and the Federal Territory might be self-supporting, and should not add to the burdens of the people of the State by compelling them to find large sums to meet the interest on the money that would be necessary to establish the Capital if the Federal Territory were not self-supporting. We had in view the idea of leasing the Territory in residential, agricultural, and other areas, and expected to be able to use the revenue derived from the rent of the land in paying interest on the amount which would be expended in the, building of the Capital. </para>

                        <para>- That is so; we wished to have control of the water supply, which was one of the chief features for which Dalgety was selected. Although we have not much time at our disposal, I hope we shall assure the Government and people of New South Wales that we are most anxious to have a commencement made with the establishment of the Federal Capital. There is no way in which we can achieve that end more quickly than by adhering to our first choice, that the Seat of Government of the Commonwealth should be within seventeen miles of the town of Dalgety, in New South Wales. </para>

                    <para>- - I propose to speak to both motion and amendment. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> did not intend exactly to blame the Government, but to give expression to our general feeling of regret that nothing has been done in this matter. I must admit, after hearing the correspondence read by the Minister, that the Government have apparently kept the matter in view, and it is not altogether their fault that it has not been further proceeded with. It is quite true that some years ago both Houses of the Federal Parliament gave an expression of opinion preferring Dalgety to any of the sites then submitted. Since that time, there have been several Capital Site hunting expeditions, and in this connexion, whatever people might say against him, there is one member of the Government, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne, to whom I could give a certificate as being one of the best men in charge of a picnic expedition -with whom I have had the pleasure to travel-. The catering, under his supervision, was excellent, and he endeavoured to promote kindly feeling amongst those who accompanied him. We hear that the Federal spirit is abroad, and our friends of the smaller States will, I trust, bear with me, as a representative of <inline font-style="italic">one</inline> of the largest States in the Commonwealth, when I say that we asked them to carry out the spirit of the Constitution in this matter. I have my preference for a particular site, but I am willing to submit to the wish of the majority when the time comes. However, I strongly object, on behalf of <inline font-style="italic">New</inline> South Wales, to any idea that it is necessary that the Commonwealth should have a Territory comprising 900 square miles. It appeared to me that certain honorable senators, in proposing to acquire a Territory of 900 square miles, had some idea of forming a socialistic State. </para>

The people of New South Wales recognise that the State Parliament had a right to make such an offer, and we, as representatives of the State, are glad to be able to support their offer. They offered a site at Tumut, at Yass, and another at Canberra, in the neighbourhood of Lake George. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator is slightly mistaken. The New South Wales Government appointed a Commissioner to report on the various sites. He did so, and territory was afterwards offered to the Federal Government bv the Government of New South Wales. I have never heard any one say that any land has ever been granted to or acquired bv the Commonwealth. Until that takes place, it is premature to say that Dalgety or any other site is to be the site of the Federal Capital. I think that Tumut has a great deal to recommend it as a site for the Federal Capital. There is a good water supply there, it is half-way between Melbourne and Sydney, and it has a delightful climate. What more can honorable senators want? Canberra, which is admitted to lie a good site, is a little nearer to Sydney. Those of us who visited the place lately could not but admire it, and the water supply is satisfactory. On the subject of the area of the Federal Territory, I direct the attention of honorable senators to the fact that section 125 of the Constitution provides that the Federal Territory shall be in New South Wales, and - shall contain an area of not less than roo square miles. </para>

                        <para>- I hold the opinion that, until New South Wales grants to, or disposes of, certain territory to the Commonwealth, we cannot say that the Federal Capital site has been legally selected. We have merely expressed a pious wish that it might be at Dalgety. I have no reason to object to Dalgety, which place, I admit, improves on acquaintance. Tumut and Canberra are more advantageously situated, from the fact that they can be made accessible without expenditure upon railway construction, whilst the selection of Dalgety for the Federal Capital would involve a large expenditure upon railway construction from the New South Wales side, and a larger expenditure from the Victorian side. One thing that may be "said for Dalgety is that it is no longer . called "Buckley's Crossing." 1 should object to a Federal Capital at a place called "Buckley's Crossing." </para>

                            to task for having submitted the motion. He, as a representative of New South Wales, desired to show that its representatives are not unmindful of the fact that the selection of the site has not been finally determined by this Parliament. We know that it has passed an Act purporting to select a site near Dalgety. But we also know that the Government felt that it was not so definitely settled that they would be justified in proceeding any further without first affording to the Government or Parliament of the State an opportunity to express its opinion upon that action. Many honorable senators contend that Dalgety was one of the sites offered to the Commonwealth for selection, but on that point I join issue with them. When the State Government was asked to suggest a site - a recognition bv the Commonwealth that it possessed that right - the only reply it made was, " We are not prepared to do so. We have had a Commissioner reporting on various sites ; we send you a copy of his report, and we shall reserve land anywhere so that you may have an opportunity of inspecting sites, and offering an opinion as to the most suitable one from your stand-point." The State Parliament, however, was not asked to express an opinion on the subject until this Parliament had selected Dalgety. Some comment has been made upon the fact that when the State Parliament' did consider the question, the State Government proposed that Dalgety should be one of the sites which it should offer to the Commonwealth. The State Parliament distinctly and avowedly excluded Dalgety from consideration, believing that it was not a suitable site, and that in the interests of both the State and the Commonwealth, it was undesirable that it should be selected.

                        <para>.- I quite dissent from the view of the honorable senator. When the State Government knew that the question was to be considered by this Parliament it had a perfect right, in order to afford a full opportunity for an examination of various sites, to reserve any areas which the Commonwealth Government had desired to be reserved. But by that reservation it did not assent to the grant of a particular site. The intention with which I believe various sites were reserved was that there should be no possibility of conflict arising between the two Parliaments. No doubt when it was decided that the Federal Capital should be located in New South Wales, it was felt that it would be possible to bring the two Parliaments into unison on the question of selecting a site. It will be recollected by honorable senators that in the first instance there was a strong objection by New South Wales to the question of the location of the Federal Capital being left open. At the Premiers' Conference in Melbourne, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> strongly urged that one of the conditions of Federation was that Sydney was to be chosen as the site of the Federal Capital. The condition, however, was not approved by the majority of the Premiers, and then a compromise was arrived at to the effect that the Federal Capital should be located in New South Wales, but not within a limited distance of that city, and, as we have since learned, not beyond a certain distance therefrom ; practically it was to be located within a radius of from joo to 200 miles from Sydney. The Constitution does not contain any limitation, except that the Federal Capital shall not be within 100 miles of that city. That, it was. thought, would be a benefit to the State as a compensation for certain sacrifices which its people believed that they would make by entering the Union. Having gone so far, is it not unreasonable for the Parliament of the Commonwealth to say, " We have a right to select a site, irrespective of the wishes of the people of New South Wales, and we may select one which will be in a most inconvenient and undesirable position from your stand-point?" Honorable senators have been advocating that the Federal Capital should have a seaport, and that it should be located in such a position that it would not be necessary to approach it through the State. That was not the understanding with which the compact was arrived at at the Premiers' Conference. If any honorable senators are suggesting that the State might throw hindrances in the way of persons having access to the Federal Capital, they are casting an unworthy aspersion upon (her. It is only right and proper that there should be absolutely free and unfettered approach to the Federal Capital. I now come to the question of whether the Federal Government have been guilty of any blame. Recognising that the question was not finally settled, they placed a paragraph in the speech with which the Governor-General opened Parliament this session. Furthermore, they welcomed suggestions from New South Wales that honorable senators should have an opportunity of visiting the sites, which had met with, the approval of, I think, both Houses of the State Parliament. There was a distinct promise that, even if the visits were made, the question would be settled during the present session. Since the completion of the visits there has been, to a great extent, a congestion of public business. No doubt, in the minds of the Ministers, that was a sufficient reason for not pressing forward the matter, as probably they feared that it might be detrimental to the consideration of other public business. It is desirable that the people of New South Wales should know that their representatives are not going to allow the question to slumber, but are prepared to apply a spur to the Government, and to point out that the question is so urgent that it should be settled at the earliest possible date. </para>

                        <para>.- As most honorable senators are well aware, the nationalization of monopolies is a verv prominent plank in the platform of the Labour Party. On many occasions, when members of that party have in the Senate and on public platforms warmly supported it, some of our opponents have said that it is not a principle that meets with the approbation of the majority of the people of the Commonwealth. We deny that assertion. In order that the people may have an opportunity to express their opinion in regard to it, we are anxious to have a Bill passed by both Houses of this Parliament formally submitting the issue to the electors. It has also been said that the coming general elections will enable the people to express their views by confirming the principles of those who are returned to Parliament. But, in connexion with all elections various issues are raised. At the coming elections, we shall have freetraders, protectionists, revenue tariff candidates, white and anti- white Australian advocates,, socialists and anti-socialists, and supporters of a large number of other issues submitting their views to the people. In addition to whom, I suppose the ghosts of the six hatters and the six potters will be resurrected. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has made an exhaustive speech upon the Bill. He' damned with faint praise all the collective enterprises' that are owned and controlled by various Governments in the Commonwealth, and, if I followed him rightly, warmly approved of the private enterprise monopolies that exist in Australia to-day. I am glad to note, however, that in this respect he is distinctly at variance with the views expressed by his leader, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> who, when speaking on the Anti-Trust Bill, said- </para>

                            <para>- Perhaps I shall be in order in saying that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> is a strong opponent of private monopolies, that he said that he detests them, and that, although not seeing eye to eye with the Labour Party in his desire to see monopolies nationalized, he would go so far as to say that, if he could see no other way out of the difficulty, he would be in favour of their nationalization. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> in his warm approval of individualism and private enterprise, quoted a number of statistics to show the growth of individualism, not only in the Commonwealth, but in other countries. He pointed out that the wealth of nations was increasing, though he did not admit that, side by side with that increase, there is an unequal distribution of wealth, not only in other countries which he mentioned, but in his own State. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coghlan,</inline> a- recognised statistician, in his volume for 1903-4, points out that during the year 1903 the number of adults in the State of New South Wales was 735,389&gt; of whom 190,617 were possessors of property, whilst 544,972 were without property. After tabulating the possessors of wealth, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coghlan</inline> goes on to say  that 987 persons, that is to say 0.13, or about J of 1 per cent., were the possessors of property to the value of Â£130,521,000, or 35.4 per cent., whilst 2,086 persons held  property  to the value of Â£168,782,800, or 45.8 per cent. In other words, the total wealth or property of the State is in the hands of about 3,000 persons. Later statistics published by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hall,"</inline> the Government Statistician of New South Wales, show that there is even a greater disparity than that shown by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coghlan. Mr. Hall</inline> says that in the year 1904-5 there were 1,004 persons - 13 in every 10,000 - who owned from Â£50,000 worth of property and upwards, and 10,853 persons, or 144 per 10,000, who held property to the value of ,Â£5,000 and upwards. Their wealth is estimated at Â£259.674.000. In 1904 there were 749,300 adults in New South Wales. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hall's</inline> returns show that there were in 19044  *95&gt;834 owners of property, and that there were 553,466 persons who had no property whatever, so that in the year 1.903-4 there were 544,972 persons without property, and a year later there were 553.466 persons without property, showing an increase of 8,464 persons who had no property whatever. As to the possessors of wealth, comparing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coghlan's</inline> figures with those of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hall,</inline> I find that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coghlan</inline> says that 190,617 persons were possessors of property. and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hall</inline> gives the number as 195,874, an increase of the possessors of property of 5,257. 1 quote these figures mainly to show that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's</inline> picture was overdrawn. In "regard to some of the countries which he cited, it is true that wealth is increasing, and there is a broader distribution of that wealth amongst the citizens, but that is due, in my opinion, largely to collective principles that are extending in almost every country in the civilized world. No better example of the growth of collectivism can be afforded than that of the Japanese nation. Japan for a considerable number of years has owned and controlled various monopolies. To give honorable senators an idea of the extent to which that is the case. I will quote from an article published in <inline font-style="italic">Everybody' s Magazine,</inline> entitled, " Soldiers of the Common Good." It is written by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Charles</inline> Edward Russell, a gentleman who is' making an extended tour of the world, to see, at firsthand, how Government-owned monopolies operate in the interest of the people. The Government of Japan has derived the following immense sums from the enterprises that I will mention. In 1893 the Japanese Government received from State-owned monopolies Â£998,488; in 1898 the sum was Â£2,646,881 ; in 1903 it was Â£5,802,298; in 1904 it was Â£6,478,335 ; and in 1905 it was Â£7,720,092. There are many industries owned and controlled by the Government of Japan, which has a monopoly of tobacco, salt, and camphor. According to the writer, the Japanese Government will some day have a monopoly of the manufacture of matches, is planning a monopoly and interest in the cotton and spinning industry, and controls many industries which it does not absolutely own. As to the tobacco industry in Japan, the writer says - </para>

                    <para>Once we (the United States) enjoyed an abundant trade with Japan in these things, for we had taught her to want them, and then joyously we supplied her want at high prices. Thus in the end Japan served copiously to swell the hard-earned treasures of the American Tobacco Trust, for the Japanese were industrious consumers, and the Trust could charge what it pleased, having the trade by the throat. But when the Trust had established branch houses and offices, and works, and invested in them $12,000,000, the Japanese Government concluded that it might as well have the goodly profits as let the Trust have them, so it went into the tobacco business on its own account. It bought factories and stores, and passed a law establishing itself in a practical monopoly of the tobacco trade, for no makers of cigarettes, cigars, or tobacco were allowed to sell their products until they had been offered to, and declined by, an agent of the Government - a necessary provision, because in Japan cigarette making is largely a domiciliary trade. Still, there might have been left to the American Trust a chance to compete in quality of product, or in some special lines, if it had not been for one thing. The Government put an import duty of 250 per cent. on cigarettes and tobacco. Thereupon the American cigarettes vanished faster than their own smoke, and the defeated American Tobacco Trust was glad to sell to the Government (for what it could get) its business and branch houses. Now in the Japanese shops you will see on shelves formerly loaded with American product, nothing but the cigarettes . and tobacco of the Japanese Government. From this trade revolution certain results have followed, very suggestive to minds observant of the changing order. </para>

                    <para>The tobacco business has become a great source of public revenue. When the tremendous expenditures of the Russian war strained the Japanese resources, the Government raised the prices of tobacco and cigarettes, and it was its operations as a tradesman that enabled it to beat Russia. Now it has launched itself directly into the international tobacco trade. Having driven the American Tobacco Trust from Japan, the Japanese Government is keenly contending with the Trust for markets elsewhere. It is selling great quantities of its cigarettes and tobacco in Korea and China. It is duplicating American Trust methods by selling abroad for less than it charges at home. With its great advantages in nearness to the market, in its control of transportation charges, in its cheap labour, other tobacco markets have small chance against it, and when it secures the vast Chinese and Korean fields, its opportunities for profits will be far beyond any Trust's. Who shall compete with it? Who shall say it nay? No combination of individuals, certainly, no company, no firm. Nothing can check it, but the opposition of another national trader, and in all the world there is no other national trader to speak of with . this. </para>

                            <para>- It is <inline font-style="italic">Everybody's Magazine,</inline> of July, 1906. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> dwelt rather lengthily on the subject of Japan, but forgot to mention that the progress there is in a large measure due to the fact that the Government, and not private enterprise, runs the monopolies. The honorable senator also spoke of the inferiority of tobacco produced under State monopoly ; but, having paid a visit to Japan last year, I can speak with personal knowledge of the excellent quality of the tobacco there produced. The price of cigarettes was then slightly higher than at normal times, owing to the war with Russia; but I can say that the quality of the tobacco in cigarettes sold at1d. per packet in Japan is quite equal to that of the cigarettes sold at 3d. per packet in Australia. I should here like to briefly quote from an excellent report, written by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Staniforth</inline> Smith, and published by the Government Printer, on the <inline font-style="italic">Federated Malay States and Java; their Systems of Government, Methods of Administration and Economic Development: -</inline> In Java, the Government receive from Government monopolies a sum of Â£2,857,871, which is made up as follows : - Opium monopoly , Â£1,657,546; State tin mines, Â£71,525; salt manufacture, Â£1,010,167; coal mines, Â£66,083 ;and public auctions, Â£52,550. From Government plantations there is received Â£546,792, and from 24 Government pawn shops, Â£115,383. Coming nearer home,wefindthe Government of New Zealand running various enterprises, one of the latest to be taken under State ownership being the coal industry. According to a short article which appeared in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> a few days ago, the quantity of coal mined at the Government mines last year was 131,816 tons from Port Elizabeth, and . 46,085 tons from the Seddon mine; while the capital outlay was Â£69,698, and the profit, after the payment of Â£2,000 to sinking fund, amounted to Â£14,647. That is equal to1s. per ton of the coal sold ; and the sales averaged  1 8s. 4&lt;i. per ton for the coal from Port Elizabeth, and 14s. 9d. per ton for the coal from the Seddon mine. Another example of successful Government enterprise may be observed in Victoria. For a considerable number of years the engines required by the Government of Victoria were constructed by private enterprise at the Phoenix Foundry, Ballarat. But a short time ago tenders were called for the construction of, I believe, thirty-nine locomotives, and the prices submitted by private tenderers were considered by the Government of the day as excessive. After giving the matter consideration, the management of the Newport workshops, on behalf of the Government, put in a tender, with the result that the thirty-nine engines, or, at any rate, many of them, were constructed at Â£42 per ton - a price which, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tait,</inline> the Railway Commissioner, was 40 per cent, less than that which would have been possible under private enterprise. In New South Wales, the State Government called for tenders for the construction of sixty locomotives, of a. similar kind, and .had to pay Â£70 per ton, as compared with Â£42 per ton paid at the Newport railway shops in Victoria under collectivism. if the Government of New South Wales had had those engines constructed at the Victorian railway shops instead of at the Clyde Engineering Works, they would have effected a saving of no less a sum than Â£.126,000 ; while the Victorian Government, bv building the engines themselves, saved Â£49,928. The probabilities are that, had the Government of Victoria undertaken the construction of their own locomotives from the beginning, they would have saved to the State something like Â£500,000, considering that the Phoenix Foundry -built for the State Government something like 351 engines. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> when speaking on this Bill, directed his attention mainly to the tobacco trust, which, considering its age, has, in mv opinion, reared its head more prominently than any other monopoly in the Commonwealth. That monopoly has cheapened production by the introduction of female labour, and of labour-saving appliances. and has discouraged the growth of colonial leaf. </para>

                            <para>- As I have already said, the combine has largely introduced female labour to do the work previously performed by male labour. On this point the statements in the report of the Royal Commission have been challenged in the Chamber ; and in the newspapers of today there is a letter of two or three columns in. length on the subject. I venture to think, however, that that is not an ordinary letter, but an advertisement - that, after all, it is paid-for opinion, and not the opinion of a man free from bias. On the subject of the increase in the number oT~ females employed in the combine's factory, I shall quote from the report itself, and my authorities are <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jacobs</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dixson,</inline> two gentlemen who tendered evidence to the Commission. In June, .1903, there were no females employed in the British Australasian Tobacco Company's factory, in Sydney. In November, 1903, there were 200 men. 147 youths and boys, and 37 females. In November, 1905, 195 men, 135 youths and boys, and 94 females, a decrease in two years of 5 men, 13 youths and boys, and an increase of 57 females, or an increase of 94 females over June of the year 1903. In addition to this remarkable increase of female labour, I am reliably informed that a short time ago work that had always previously been performed by men was given to women. The men strongly objected tj the. employment of females at this work. They waited on the foreman, and pointed out the injustice. He gave them no satisfaction, and the men had no alternative but to go on strike. From all accounts, they are still on strike, and ave not likely to be taken back. </para>

                            <para>- This combine cannot afford to pay big wages? We know that they paid a big sum to get a legal opinion concerning the Commission's report, and, if rumour can be believed, they are interesting themselves very largely in a financial sense in the coming elections. We know what immense profits they are making by, the employment of female labour in the displacement of male labour, and by the increased prices they are charging consumers for tobacco. In i903i 220 males and 193 females were employed in the combine's factory in Melbourne, and in 1904 the numbers employed were 262 males and 259 females, showing an increase of 42 males and 66 females. The States Tobacco Company of Melbourne employed in 1903, 58 men, 43 youths and boys, and 25 girls. In 1905, they employed 98 men, 68 youths and boys, and 63 women and girls, showing an increase in two years of 40 men, 25 youths and boys, and 38 women and girls, the increase in the number ot women and girls being considerable when compared with the increase in the number of men. In Adelaide, in 1903, there were employed at the combine's factory 51 men, 14 youths an3 boys,- and 4 females; and in 1905, there were 52 men, 15 youths and boys, and 15 females, showing an increase of 1 man, r boy, and 11 females. </para>

                            <para>- I am dealing just now with the operations of the combine in Australia. I shall deal with the Government monopoly in France later on. These figures show that whilst there has been a slight increase in the number of adult males in the last two years, there has been a considerable increase in the number of females. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dixson</inline> further shows in his statement that, whilst there has been an apparent increase of 132 persons in the factories of the combine in 1905, as compared with 1903, there was to be deducted from that number 120 who were thrown out of employment by the closing down by the combine of Cameron Brothers, Brisbane, the National Cigarette Company, Melbourne, and the States Tobacco Company, Adelaide. So that, for a period of - two years, notwithstanding the enormously increased output of the combine's factories, there has only, been an additional 12 hands employed by them, which number is spread over the whole of their factories in Sydney, Melbourne, and Adelaide. I have figures supplied by the Government Statisticians of the various States of the Commonwealth which show that the number of persons employed in the tobacco, cigar, and cigarette factories throughout the Commonwealth in 1905 was less by 257 than the number employed in 1901 before the creation of this huge combine. Now, with respect to the grower, I have no hesitation in saying that this combine has discouraged the grower of colonial leaf, that it has misled them, and has taken advantage of their circumstances. It is true that the combine promoted a competition and donated the sum of Â£20 in order to encourage the growth of a superior kind of colonial leaf. But what conditions did they lay down. They practically said this : Take all the care you can in the growth and cultivation of your leaf, and no matter how superior in quality that leaf may be, we have decided that we shall not pay a higher price than 8d. per lb. for it." Was that a proper course to pursue? Should not the combine have paid what the leaf was worth? If any further information were required to confirm the statements I an making in regard to the way in which the combine has treated the growers, and especially those engaged in the cultivation of leaf around Tumut, the following extract from the Albury <inline font-style="italic">Daily Mail,</inline> of October, 1905, will be admitted to prove my statement up to the hilt : - </para>

                        <para>Great consternation was occasioned amongst the tobacco growers of this district recently owing to the offers received for their leaf from the British-Australian Company. The highest price offered was for Messrs. Bridle and Creasy's Bombowlee crop, viz., 8d. per lb. for firsts, and 3$d. for seconds.- The company early in the season offered prizes to the amount of ^20 for competition, two-ton lots to be exhibited, and the company to purchase the first prize leaf at 811. per lb. and the second prize leaf at 7d. But they now offer 7d. to Messrs. Cornett and Taylor, who secured the first prize, for their first quality. The second prize-winners are offered 6d. for first, and from 3Â½d. to 2Â§d. for second. A great number were induced by the offers held out by the company to start the industry last year, and they erected, at considerable expense, large sheds for curing. Some of the growers vow that the}' will never grow another stalk of tobacco unless buyers from other parts of the world can be found to guarantee a payable price before the seed is grown. </para>

                    <para class="block">There can be no doubt that the growers of tobacco in Australia are unfortunately circumstanced. I might mention that the growers, of leaf in the United States are under similar disadvantages, because they are limited to one buyer. At the present time they are making an effort to start a co-operative factory with a view to secure a better return for their labour, and a more profitable market for their produce. I have here a journal called the <inline font-style="italic">Southern Tobacco Journal,</inline> published in North Carolina, and I quote the following from the issue of 6th August, 1906 : - </para>

                        <para>When we consider the fate of independent factories in Danville, Martinsville, Winston, and other tobacco towns, where men of capital and experience have been unable lo hold out against the unscrupulous methods of the trust, we feel that the farmers would be taking a serious risk lo put their money in factories. It takes time and money to build up trade; to popularize brands and make the consumer call for them like the children do for a popular brand of soothing syrup. The trust has spent millions in crushing rival brands, notably in the case of its "Battle-Axe" brand, which it put on the market at a big loss. It would pursue similar tactics in fighting the factories established by the Farmers' Protective Association, and a hundred thousand dollar factory would be an easy proposition for it to handle. </para>

                    <para class="block">In what position are the growers of leaf in Australia? It will be urged that the combine in the first place arranged the competition with the sincere desire to promote the Australian industry, but it is self-evident that they recognised that they have not treated the growers of leaf properly, because when serious complaints had been made bv them, and attention had been called in the columns of the daily press to the way in which they had been treated, and after the Commission sat at Tumut, and had taken the evidence of the dissatisfied growers, a representative of the combine, in the person of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shaw,</inline> went up there, and distributed a large sum of money to those- who were dissatisfied. </para>

If we take the men who are engaged in the growth of leaf at Tumut, so far as I have been able to follow their evidence, there is not one of them who considers himself a. collectivist or a Socialist, yet 90 per cent, of the growers of Tumut are of opinion that it would be highly beneficial to the Commonwealth if the industry were nationalized.

                        <para>Some eighteen months ago every one was talking about the tobacco industry. I think the American expert who came up here was the cause of it. He went round and explained to the' people the benefits they would derive from tobacco culture, and it was, I believe, on his recommendation that a number of people went into the industry. At that time I was largely interested in dairying, and was trying to induce the farmers to go in for it. But it was of no use talking to them. There was nothing but ruberoid sheds in people's minds, and they were 'talking about the great boon that tobacco growing was going to be to the district. It seemed to be going along all right, but after a while I heard there was something wrong about it. The cause of the trouble was the competition instigated by the company. When the circular came up about the prizes it caused the people to open their eyes. They were led to believe from the prices obtained" last year for an inferior article, that if they produced something superior the prices would bc much better. But when the circular about the competition come up they all said that something was wrong. They said that it was a dodge on the part of the combine to fix prices, and they thought that that was altogether unfair. I have had opportunities of speaking to all the tobacco growers, and have been in their confidence. Nobody was satisfied with the prices obtained. But, notwithstanding that, there was a difficulty in getting them to come and" give evidence before this Committee. I said to them - "If this combine is injuring your district you ought to be men enough to come forward and try to exterminate them." They said that if they did they would be boycotted. I can assure you that men would have come here and given evidence except that they were afraid of this combine. They thought the combine would have an edge on them. </para>

Do you think that the combine has been injurious to the tobacco-growers? - I certainly do, from the experience we have had this year. 3376. In what way has it injuriously affected them? - I believe it would have paid the company better to give more for the tobacco than it did, because a larger quantity would have been put in this year if the growers had been satisfied with the price. 3377. What do you think of the idea of nationalizing the tobacco industry ? - I have been against Socialism, but if no better method can be found, I am in favour of that.

                            <para>- Exactly; although he had spent only an hour and a half there during a period of eight years. Further than that, by a table which the combine submitted, it" absolutely proved the statement made by the operatives. It was submitted in Sydney to prove that the atmosphere was all right, and that, from a health stand-point, the conditions could not be complained of. Under the head of " Sick and Accident' 'Fund of the British-Australasian Tobacco Company," it shows that in one year the number of subscribing members was 331, and that the number of members who had drawn sick pay from 1st October, 1904, to 18th November, 1905 - a period of nine months - was ninety. Can that be a healthy occupation or healthy factory? The total amount which the 331 members subscribed in twelve months amounted to Â£333 os. 4d., and the total amount which they drew by way of sick allowance was no less than Â£170 14s. 4d. That, I think, proves without the shadow of a doubt the correctness of the statement which was made by the operatives, and which is mentioned in the Commission's report. It is also alleged that the price of tobacco to the consumer has not been increased. When we were in Adelaide, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Graysaid</inline> to a witness, "You say that the price per lb. for tobacco is the same now as it was a short while ago?" "Yes," said the witness, "but it is sold differently." <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> then inquired, " What does it matter whether it is sold by the pound or by the half-pound, if the price per pound is the same?" That sounds all right, but let me give the explanation of how the combine has increased the price to the consumer. In Adelaide, the factories were making fourteen sticks of tobacco to the pound, and the retailer was charged so much per pound. After the combine came into existence, it sold sixteen plugs to the pound, charging, of course, the same price per pound, but the retail distributer had the advantage of two plugs ger pound, so that he made a profit of 8d. on them, and the consumer got lighter plugs, but paid the same price. Hence there is not the shadow of a doubt that the price of tobacco, not only in South Australia, but also in Victoria, has been increased, and that the consumer is paying the increase. </para>

                            <para>- That has nothing to do with the increased number of plugs. It has been said that the Royal Commission was biased, that it was composed mainly of labour men who had preconceived ideas in regard to the industry. It will be within the recollection of many honorable senators that, in 1895, the Legislative Assembly of Victoria appointed a Select Committee upon " State Monopoly in Manufacture of Tobacco." It was composed, not of labour men, but of men with very strong conservative opinions. . The only man holding collectivist views was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. G.</inline> M. Prendergast, the present leader of the Opposition in that House. The other members were <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Graham, Mr. Graves, Mr. John</inline> Mclntyre, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scott,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Outtrim,</inline> the mover. The Select Committee submitted a report, not so exhaustive, but just as strong, in favour of the nationalization of the tobacco industry as that of the Commonwealth Royal Commission, which has been described as biased. The Select Committee recommended that the Government should take over the industry. They said that its ownership by the Government would mean an increase in the revenue, the supply of better tobacco to the consumer, the encouragement of the farmers to grow tobacco, and the provision of additional employment to the people. Further, they said - </para>

                    <para class="block">It has been said that the quality of the tobacco manufactured in France is inferior. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jacobs,</inline> who admitted to the Royal Commission that he is not a practical man, has roundly condemned the quality of French tobacco, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cameron,</inline> who, if I remember rightly, had never been in France, said that if a similar kind of tobacco were manufactured in the Commonwealth there would be riots. If any one likes to take the trouble to examine the Trade and Customs Returns, he will find that during last year cigars weighing over 34,000 lbs. were imported into the Commonwealth from France. Taking the Customs average that, in that year, 1,000 cigars weighed 12 lbs., it means that about 3,000,000 cigars were imported from France; and their value as shown by the Customs, makes it clear that their value would be about Â£8 per 1,000. It is safe to say that, before any of the cigars were retailed, they had cost the retailer Â£10 or Â£11 per 1,000, and the combine that turns out a cigar, and extensively advertises, can, I am informed, sell at Â£8 5s. per thousand. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jacobs'</inline> opinion is distinctly at variance with that of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. George</inline> Carter, who, two or three years ago, did pay a visit to France, and who, unlike the other, is a thoroughly practical man, has had a lifelong experience in the manufacture of cigars, and knows good from bad tobacco. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carter</inline> unhesitatingly told the Commission that, price for price, as good a cigar can be obtained in France as in any other part of the world, except, perhaps, Cuba, where it is said the best cigars are made After all, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jacobs'</inline> opinion cannot be taken too seriously. A witness in Sydney - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mosley</inline> Richard Aaron - expressed his opinion in regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jacobs.</inline> After swearing that he had been in the trade for forty years, he went on to say - -I have nothing personally to say against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jacobs,</inline> and I believe that so far as his lights  go - which is not very far - he does the best he can. I, however, attended at <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jacobs'</inline> office with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. de</inline> Beers, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jacobs</inline> brought down four or five boxes of Matador cigars. It is a nicely finished cigar, and looks well, but, not unlike the pudding, you cannot tell what it is like till you have tried it. I lit one of them, and he asked' me what I thought of it; I asked <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. de</inline> Beers what he thought of it, and said that as my English education was very neglected, I was afraid I could not coin a word to express the quality of it. I could do so in Flemish, which means that the five-eighths of the cigar had not sufficient body in it, and it was like smoking straw. A cigar which appears large, and really is not large, immediately it is smoked, goes very soft. " Just like smoking straw " is the opinion of a man who has been all these years in the trade as to the cigars turned out by the combine. We know that France does import tobacco leaf extensively. She buys in the best markets. According to returns published in the United States <inline font-style="italic">Tobacco Journal</inline> for the 25th November, 1905, in the year 1904 France imported 66,500,000 lbs. of tobacco. Of those imports the United States supplied 40,000,000 lbs. The same journal says that in the same year about 83,000,000 cigars were imported into France, many of which came f rota Cuba, ' where the best cigars are manufactured. Going back to the report of the Select Committee appointed in Victoria, I find that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. James</inline> Sinclair was the first witness. He had paid a recent visit to France, and though his opinions were distinctly opposed to the Government ownership of the tobacco industry, he save some very valuable testimony from my point of view.

                            <para>- Just so. France is adjacent to five foreign countries, and naturally there is a good deal of smuggling. In order to prevent it the French Regie manufactures a cheaper cigar for sale on the border. In the year 1816 a law was passed in France authorizing the Regie to make a tobacco the price of which was not to exceed is. 4d. per lb. That is the cause of the cheaper tobacco sold on the frontier, and it has nothing whatever to do with the quality of the tobacco sold in France. A comparison has been made between the industrial conditions in the Government factories in France, and those which pertain under private enterprise in this country. Yet <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jacobs'</inline> evidence on page 72 of the report of the Royal Commission showed that according to the official report submitted by him there were, in the year 1902', 14,941 women engaged in the industry, who were paid on an average 3s. 3d. per day. There were 1,146 men employed, who earned on an average 4s. iod. per day. The average wage paid in France therefore, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jacobs'</inline> evidence, is Â£1 os. 6d. per week, as against the wage stated in the minority report, 15s. 6d. In Australia, according to the minority report, the wages average 27s. 4d. per week. I have examined these figures carefully,- and have arrived at the conclusion - as I think any one will do who makes his own calculations - that if all the men and women engaged in the socialistic enterprise in France were paid Â£2 os. 6d. per week, and worked eight hours a day, there would still be a profit of over Â£12,000,000 per annum. </para>

                            <para>- No; I am endeavouring to show, and I think I have done it, that the conditions in the Government monopoly in France are much better than those obtaining in any private establishment in the same country. That is the fair comparison. In regard to another point mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> that the combine is making an immense fortune, not out of tobacco leaf, but out of moisture, a few figures which I will give will be interesting to the Senate. According to a return published by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Drake,</inline> the Government Statistician, in 1901 the Victorian tobacco manufacturers purchased 2,506,515 lbs. of imported leaf, and 228,124 lbs. of Colonial leaf; in 1902 they purchased 1,344,832 lbs. of imported leaf, and 204,286 lbs. of Colonial leaf: in 1903, 2,012,692 lbs. of imported leaf, and 302,744 lbs. of Colonial leaf; in 1904, 2&gt;74Â°&lt;353 hbs. Â°f imported leaf and 263,084 lbs. of Colonial leaf; in 1905, 3,568,811 lbs. of imported leaf, and 261,197 lbs. of Colonial leaf. Those figures show that the Victorian factories in the years mentioned purchased 13,432,603 lbs. of tobacco leaf. There were manufactured from that quantity 15,183,024 lbs. of tobacco. </para>

                            <para>- I am concerned just now with the moisture in Australian tobaccos; it is very difficult to get complete particulars in regard to the French monopoly. This 13 per cent, of added moisture indicates that the combine have had an advantage of 1,750,421 lbs., which, at the average value of 3s. id. per lb., shows a profit, from moisture and other additions, of no less than Â£269,856 for Victoria alone, which amount could be safely doubled for the whole of the Commonwealth. That average value is arrived at from tables contained in the report of the Royal Commission, showing that the average price of the tobacco is 6s. iod. 4-7ths per lb., and when we deduct the taxation and the retailer's profit, we arrive at 3s. id. per lb. In my opinion, the report of the Royal Commission shows conclusively that there is great dissatisfaction amongst the growers of Australian leaf, because they have not received from the combine the consideration they deserve ; and, so long as the monopoly is permitted to exist, there is little hope for improvement in this connexion. It is notorious that the combine has largely increased female labour in their various factories, and that disputes have occurred, and must continue to occur. The combine has shown great hostility to trade unionism,, or combination of any description. In Australia, the desire to employ female labour is probably due to two causes; first, the females are cheaper; and, secondly, there is greater difficulty in organizing any combination of the women employed. When a strong trade union of the women engaged in this industry was formed in Great Britain, the twin brother of the Australian monopolistic institution took occasion to find fault with their work, and to lock them out; and we know how vigorously the combine has fought trade unionism in the United States. For years,, trade unionists in America have devoted much energy in their efforts to get trade unionism recognised by the combine ; but it is notorious that in not one of the combine's factories is there employed a solitary man belonging to a trade union. Further, the combine is well known for its employment of child labour. In order to prevent any of these evils in Australia, the Commonwealth Government ought to take over the control of the industry : and the time is ripe for such a step. I am satisfied that if the people of Australia were polled to-morrow there would be an immense majority in favour of the principle of the nationalization of monopolies. But honorable senators who oppose this Bill have no faith in the popular judgment, and are doing all they possibly can to prevent the question being submitted to the people. What are they afraid of? A proper expression of public opinion or. a particular question cannot be obtained at a general election, when a hundred and one issues may be placed before the constituencies. I strongly approve of the principle of a referendum, as must every one who believes in majority rule, because then we can have a clear-cut issue. </para>

                            <para>- The evidence shows that the combine has 80 per cent, to 90 per cent, of the trade. To my own personal knowledge, Dudgeon and Arnell, who conduct one of the independent factories, were workking full time and nay ing reasonable wages before the creation of the combine, whereas now their factory is almost closed clown. Never before in its long existence has the business of Messrs. Dudgeon and Arnell been so dull ; and this is due to the monopoly. </para>

                    <para>SenatorFINDLEY.- Well, then, I shall imagine the case of a man employed in a factory belonging to the combine, who, before a properly constituted tribunal., explains the conditions obtaining in that particular factory. Those statements that man repeats on oath before another tribunal, and, subsequently, his employers find fault with him for some reason or another, and dismiss him. That man now has no hope of obtaining employment in his own trade in Australia. </para>

                    <para>. - I desire to say only a few words on this matter. I did not speak on the second reading of the Bill, but I wish now to give a reason for the vote I shall give on the amendment. I consider that this Bill is a bad one. Perhaps, on that account, I should vote against everything connected with it, but, as the amendment would improve the Bill as it stands, I am constrained to support it. In connexion with the last Bill we had under discussion for the alteration of the Constitution, the Government disclosed no policy. In this Bill they disclose a policy which I consider vicious. I object to the imposition of special taxation for special purposes in the way proposed in this measure. The proposal is practically to levy a poor law tax upon the people - a form of taxation which is dying out now in Great Britain. I believe it is a form of taxation which would be resented by the people of Australia. All the expenditure of. the Commonwealth should came out of the Consolidated Revenue. As the Government have not disclosed what they are going to do with the special duties which might be imposed under this Bill, I must certainly support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's</inline> amendment, which would specifically indicate the purpose to which the money raised by these special duties must be devoted. </para>

                    has moved an amendment intended to recast the clause, and I would ask the honorable and learned senator whether he contemplates that this is a matter which can be dealt with without first consulting Parliament, both with regard to the special purpose contemplated and also the special duties to be imposed ? I presume, however, that nothing can be done until the matter comes before Parliament again.

                <para class="block">Bill has been the desirability of. instituting a system of old-age pensions that will be applicable to the whole of the Commonwealth. As a matter of policy, I recognise that it would be far better that there should be one system of old-age pensions for the whole Commonwealth rather than that old-age pensions schemes should be adopted in some of the States and not in others. I recognise, " also, that if a. man resides in one State for a lengthened period, and subsequently removes to another, that should not debar him from the benefit of an old-age pension scheme. The battle for old-age pensions has been fought and won. and the feeling of a majority of the people is in favour of the payment of these pensions. If we had a Bill before us proposing this, honorable senators could count on my vote in favour of it. Under existing conditions, New South Wales and Victoria have established old-age pensions schemes, but if a man resided in South Australia for thirty or forty years, and then came over to Victoria or New South Wales, and resided there fourteen or fifteen years, he would not be eligible for an old-age pension. We ought to regard the Commonwealth in this respect, not as a loose collection of States, but as an amalgamation of States, desiring legislation on distinct lines applicable to all. I question whether those States that have not yet established systems of old-age pensions are prepared at the present time to approve of a proposal of this character. New South Wales pays old-age pensions with a maximum of 10s. per week, and Victoria has a maximum of 8s. per week. These two States between them spend from Â£700,000 to Â£800,000 per annum in the payment of old-age pensions, and it is unquestionable that it would be to their advantage if a Commonwealth system were established. Western Australia, as a wealthy State, would probably accept such a proposal readily, but I am not satisfied that Queensland, South Australia, and Tasmania would be prepared to do so; nor am I satisfied that the present is an opportune time for the extension of such a system throughout the Commonwealth. There can be no question that the establishment of a Commonwealth system would involve increased expenditure in those States that have not yet .made provision for old-age pensions. We know that the special duties provided for would have to be imposed on articles of almost universal con- sumption, and as it is probable that the poorer people would have lo bear the great share of this taxation,- I feel' that by the adoption of the system we should be putting the people of the States in a worse position than they are in at the present time. </para>

I may be told that the measure must receive the support of the majority- of the electors in a majority of the States. I point out that New South Wales and Victoria, having already adopted systems of old-age pensions, would be disposed to accept this proposal, whilst its adoption might be detrimental to the interests of Tasmania and South Australia. The people of the latter States would be overwhelmed by the vote cast in the former States, since Victoria and New South Wales have nearly three-fourths of the total population of the Commonwealth. In the circumstances, until we are absolutely satisfied that the smaller States are willing to be taxed in the way proposed to provide pensions for their old people, we ought not to take this decided step inadvance. </para>

                        <para>.- I desire that the people should be informed as to the desirability and possibility of establishing a Commonwealth system of old-age pensions at the present time. With the best feeling towards such a system, I do not believe that the time is ripe for its adoption ; and as at present advised, I do not see my way to support the proposal. We cannot feel absolutely certain that the electors would so fully realize what they were asked to sanction on short notice such as they would get, as they would if afforded a longer opportunity in which to reflect and make up their minds. I think that in this case <inline font-style="italic">festina lente</inline> is about the best motto for the Committee to observe when such an important and drastic change is sought to be introduced.

                    <para>. - I hold that it is extremely undesirable that the Parliament should appeal to the people for further powers of taxation until its present taxing powers have been exhausted. That truism, I should think, only needs to be stated to be accepted. The question at once arises - Have we exceeded those powers? So far as the imposition of Customs duties is concerned, we have. But there are many other methods of raising revenue, and I am of opinion that the Constitution ought not to be altered as proposed until we have ' exhausted our taxing powers. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> said he would like to know what are the opinions of the people of Australia on the question of inaugurating a scheme of old-age pensions. I do not feel competent to speak for" the people of the other States, but I think I can vouch for the position taken up by the people of Queensland. Of its fifteen representatives in this Parliament - six in the Senate and nine in the other House - fourteen to my knowledge are pledged to support, or to assist to bring about, the institution of a scheme. That proves conclusively, I think, the attitude which Queensland has taken up. I may go further, and say that fourteen out of its fifteen representatives are pledged, if they can, to see that the money for the purpose is raised, not by imposing additional Customs duties, hut by some form of direct taxation. That is- a point upon which its people have decided without any reservation. I consider that if, for any reason, I disobeyed or acted contrary to that mandate from the electors, I should be betraying the trust which they have reposed in me. I, ask honorable senators to consider very seriously what they are doing before they vote for the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake.</inline> . We are discussing a proposal to create an entirely new feature in our system of taxation. I am aware that Ministers and politicians generally have a great respect for precedent. If some other country has followed a particular course, that, in their opinion, is quite a sufficient reason why we should do likewise. But I have not heard of a country during recent times which has sought to impose special duties for a special purpose. In the United Kingdom, so far as my reading goes, all the expenditure on its various departments of government, is defrayed out of the Consolidated Revenue, and such a thing as the- imposition of special duties for special purposes . is not at present known to the Imperial Parliament. Of course, I know that under the system of local government, a number of rates are imposed for- various purposes. The proposal before the Committee, therefore, is contrary to all our experience of government hitherto, and, unless some very good reason can be shown, it ought not to be adopted. If it were a sound principle, to raise special duties for a specific purpose, then I am sure that the Governments. of many older countries, with their very wide experience, would have adopted it long ago. But we cannot find that any Government has taken this extraordinary departure. When a new proposal is made, whether it be in finance or in industrial matters, or in any department of human affairs, it has always to undergo a most microscopical examination. I think that we are in duty bound to make the proposal of the Government run the gauntlet of a discussion. While I do not hold that there is anything sacred about the Constitution - I regard it merely as a tool which we can adapt to our own ends - I do not think that it ought to te altered until every other method of doing what is desired, has been exhausted; until, in short, it is found to be insufficient for the accomplishment of that purpose. Is that so in the present instance? Our taxing powers, so far from having been exhausted, have not yet been fully exercised. Under the Constitution, the Parliament has unlimited taxing powers, and, therefore, we ought not to ask for any new taxing power until they have 'been used to the very uttermost, and found to be insufficient. Has that been done? I venture to submit that it has not. No attempt has been made to extend the area of taxation, so far as the Commonwealth Parliament is entitled to impose it. Instead of that, we are asked to submit to a referendum of the people an entirely new reading of the Constitution, so far as Customs and Excise revenue is concerned. There is an understanding that two articles which are of common human consumption are to be made to contribute the funds for an old-age pension. Ought we to go to the poorest section of the people, rather than to those who are more liberally blessed with this world's goods? A large number of the people of Australia find it exceedingly difficult to make a living. They are already heavily taxed. My honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> showed to-day how unfair, the incidence of taxation is. I propose to go even further, and to show the immense disparity between the amount of taxation levied upon a working man who we will say earns Â£2 a week, and lias three or four children to support, and a middle-class man earning probably Â£1,000 a year. The average contribution of each man, woman, 'and child in the Commonwealth to the Customs and Excise revenue is about <inline font-style="italic">Â£2</inline> 5s. per annum. Of course, every man does not pay that. The man who does not drink or smoke, or indulge in any of the luxuries of life escapes. </para>

It is when we throw a search-light upon these details that we discover the enormous difference between the proportion of his income which the poor man pays in taxation, and the proportion of income paid by the comparatively well-to-do-man. Here is the working man almost crouching to the ground under the load of taxation which he bears, while the rich man walks erect, and comparatively free.

                        <para>- I am entitled to do it again. I am surprised that a man like the Minister of Defence, who at one time was not too rich, and knows, or ought to know, that very often the lot of the poor man is one of hardship and penury, should support a proposal of this kind. If we are to have old-age pensions, and we ought to have them, let us go to the right source for the money. Let us not try to salve our consciences with the sophism that we cannot compel the rich to pay, and must have recourse to the poor. Why can we not compel the rich? Have we ever tried ? Has <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> for instance, ever raised his voice in any effective way in the Senate in that direction? </para>

                        <para>- I know that perfectly well, but we ought to have the numbers to defeat this contemptible proposition - because that is the only character I can give to it. The Government says that it is in favour of old-age pensions, but in order to raise the funds to pay them, it is going to put the fist of the tax gatherer into the tea billy of every bushman in Australia, and to tax the very light of the peopl'e who live in country places. It reminds me of the light tax imposed by English Governments in a semi-barbarous period. </para>

                        <para>- The amendment is a proposal to alter the Bill, and, if T discuss the amendment, surely I may discuss the Bill? In any case, if I am out of order, I shall" hot pursue that line of reasoning any further, although I Believe it is an exceedingly profitable one, which might very well be followed bv honorable senators who are scouting this proposal. As I intimated earlier in the debate, I intend to vote for the amendment proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> though I must confess that I do  so  very much against  my  will. I vote for the amendment, first, because I absolutely object to public moneys being ear-marked for any purpose whatever. </para>

                        <para>- Therefore I wish to be consistent. I am opposed to the earmarking of public money for any purpose whatever, but if the Government will persist in seeking authority to raise taxation without saying from what source or for what purpose, I think I am quite justified in nailing them down, if I' can, to the particular purpose of this Bill. I do not desert my principles, but I am compelled to do something which is in opposition to these principles ari consequence of the proposal of the Government. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> said some time ago, the Government might use this money for anything - they might use it for defence purposes or they might levy taxation in a way which would seriously interfere with some of our industries. The Government might do many things under cover- of this Bill to which I should seriously object. That being the case, I think I am not only justified, but quite consistent in seeking to limit their power. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> spoke as a member of a Government would speak. The honorable senator said, " We want this power for a particular purpose, but in case we should require it at some future period for something else, do not let us tie ourselves up; let us have all the freedom we possibly can." That may be the honorable senator's idea, but it is not mine, because I want to tie the Government down to a particular expenditure. I know I am departing from my ordinary principles in this matter, but I consider I am justified by the situation. </para>

                        <para>- The Government say that it is not, and that it is the intention ; they " blow hot and cold," and nobody knows what they mean. I can understand <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith's</inline> position and feeling. He was at one time a member of a Government) and desired to have the widest latitude - no confinement, " give me room 1" We have Had so much experience of the untrustworthiness of Governments, and of their tendency to laxity in dealing with public affairs, that we ought to be extremely careful with regard to any powers we may confer. For instance, I have heard of a Parliament which, in a virtuous moment, established a sinking fund for the redemption of the public debt. But when the money was wanted, it was found to have been scooped by the Treasurer to meet some expenditure which had suddenly cropped up; and, after the money was gone, the authority of Parliament was asked to validate the Treasurer's action. Instances of that kind have occurred without number, so that we really do not know what may. happen if we give the Government unrestrained and unrestricted power in this connexion. It was an inspiration on the part of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> to move this amendment ; and if he will submit another enumerating The articles which he desires should be taxed, I am not sure that I shall not vote with him. I will not promise, however, because I want an opportunity to consider any fresh ideas he may offer. I shall vote for the amendment, reserving to myself the right to vote against the Bill on the third reading, if I think fit. </para>

                    <para>- It is only fair to intimate that I intend to submit a subsequent amendment. It will be noticed that in the Bill as originally introduced, and in the re-draft prepared by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake,</inline> the expression occurs, " goods of a description, not liable to Customs and Excise duty on the 1st day of January." I submit that the words, " of a description " will be liable to lead to some complication later on. It seems to me that all we need to say in the Bill, or in the amendment, is simply "goods not liable." </para>

                    <para>. - The road having been cleared by the unfortunate loss of my previous amendment, I wish now to invite the' attention of the Minister and of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> to what is, perhaps, a matter of phraseology, but might lead to possible complications. The objection I urge to the use of certain words will apply equally to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake's</inline> amendment and to the Bill as it stands. I find that the phrase "goods of a description not liable to Customs or Excise duties " is used, and it seems to me that what is wanted is to make available for the special duties all goods not liable to Customs or Excise duties on the 1st January, 1907. The use of the words "of a description " may possibly lead to complications. For instance, many articles come under the description of apparel that are not liable to duty, but if the Bill became law as it stands, or if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake's</inline> amendment were adopted as now framed, and the attempt were made to levy a duty for a special purpose upon one article of apparel not now liable to duty, the objection might be taken in the Courts that that particular article came under a description of a general class of goods which were liable to duty. In support of my contention, I quote from the <inline font-style="italic">Century Dictionary</inline> the following definition of the word " description " - </para>

                    <para>. - I thank the honorable senator for calling my attention to this matter. As soon as he mentioned it it struck me that there was a redundancy about the phrase, to say the least, and that it is quite sufficient to say " goods not liable to Customs or Excise duties." The phrase used in the Tariff is " dutiable goods." It is possible that the use of the words "of a description" would involve some curtailment of the powers we seek under this measure, since of a number of articles under a common description some are dutiable and others are not. It might be argued that goods not dutiable could not be taxed under this measure, because they came under a certain description, covering goods which are dutiable. I am prepared to accept the amendment suggested. </para>

                    <para>.- I am prepared to accept the decision of the Committee. Still, in a matter of this kind, when we are amending the Constitution, we should carefully consider whether these words are absolutely without meaning. I suggest that the Minister should get some advice on the subject from such Customs authority. It might be that as used in the Bill th~y have a very important meaning. I suggest that their use here probably means that these special duties of Customs must not be imposed upon any article belonging to a certain classification. Let me put a specific example. We have in the Tariff the heading "Apparel," which I take to be a general description, and under that heading there are certain articles expressly exempt from duty. They are allowed to come in free in order to assist in the production of apparel in Australia. It is possible that the use of the words "of a description" might mean that we must not impose special duties upon those goods. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know what is intended. When I find these words " of a description " used in the Bill I assume first of all that they are put in with some object. Presumably the gentleman who drafted the Bill had instructions, and probably had the advantage of the experience of some Customs! officer. I start with the presumption that the words; are not superfluous, but have been put in with an object, and have some meaning. If they have, we should know what it is. I have considered the matter for some little time, and have looked up the Customs Act, and it occurs to me that the use of the words in this Bill means that we can impose a special tax upon articles of a certain description where no dutv has previously been imposed on articles of that description, but that if a duty has been imposed upon goods of that description as in the case of apparel, we must not impose a special duty under this measure on articles of that description, although they may now be duty free. </para>

                    <para>.- By the technical meaning which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> has attached to " description" he has supplied the very reason why the words should be left out as the Government have agreed to do. I believe with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> that their retention would be calculated to cause serious difficulty in regard to interpretation, and, perhaps, to curtail the intention of Parliament. The idea is, I think, that every article which at present is not taxed should be liable to taxation hereafter. But the words "of a description," if they have any meaning at all, are calculated to limit that intention. In fact, they might, to a very large extent, nullify the measure. In the Customs Tariff Act we do not meet with words such as are proposed to be inserted in this Bill. Section 5, for instance, says - </para>

                    <para>.- In connexion with the 'schedule to the Customs Tariff Act, another example has just occurred to me. In my previous speech, I referred to the division under the head of "Apparel and Textiles." The next division is headed "Metals and Machinery." Articles in that division might be taken to be another description of goods. To different articles various duties are attached; but, in the list of special exemptions, we find - </para>

                <para class="block">If the words "of a description" have the meaning which has been suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> and are omitted, then special duties of Customs could be levied on particular articles which, in that Act, were exempted for a special reason. The words may have been inserted in the provision for the express purpose of preventing special duties being raised on particular articles which it was the policy of the law to exempt. I feel quite sure that it was not the intention of the framers of the amendment that the special duties should be raised on such articles. In my opinion, the Government would do well to take the advice of the Comptroller-General of Customs on the point. </para>

                    <para>. - If I thought that there was any danger in my amendment, I would agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> as to the advisability of getting expert advice. If he had examined the schedule to the Customs Tariff Act a little more carefully, he would have found the strongest possible argument for its adoption. Take, for instance, the article which it is generally assumed would be taxed if the Bill became law. Under what description of goods does kerosene come? It comes under " oils." Seeing that oils are goods of a description not only liable to, but actually taxed, it might be contended that kerosene would not be subject to taxation. It is because I can see no danger in omitting the words, but unlimited possibility of danger if they were retained, that I press the amendment. </para>

                    <para>. - I have an -amendment to propose in this clause. It has been pointed out that under the Constitution, as it stands, if the Commonwealth takes over a certain proportion of the debt of any State, it has to take over a proportionate amount of the debts of the other States, according to population. It was urged that that was not necessary. I propose to meet that criticism by leaving out the words " a proportion thereof, according to the respective number of their people as shown by the latest statistics of the Commonwealth," and inserting "any part -thereof." </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake,</inline> in proposing this amendment, has, I think, very 'properly followed the example of the amendment already inserted to-day in another Bill dealing with a constitutional alteration. He has given close consideration to that point ; and while it was considered at one time that it would perhaps be more desirable to insert the words relating to " taking over " the public debts they have been left out, because although section 105 of the Constitution has the marginal note "Taking over public debts of States," it also provides for doing something else with them. Therefore, those words have not been inserted in the amendment. With regard to what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has said, I wish to remark that the proposed amendment has regard to every possible contingency. so far as I am able to judge it. The words " shall extend to the debts incurred since the establishment of the Commonwealth " leaves no loop-hole such as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has suggested. </para>

                        <para>- May I recall the position, and then <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> will be able to judge whether the word " re- . deem " is necessary. The object of the Bill is simply to extend the power of the Commonwealth to enable it to deal with Â£202,000,000 of public debt instead of with Â£236,000,000. The Constitution does not use the word " redeem " with regard to debt incurred before Federation, and it is not necessary to use it simply with regard to the Â£34,000,000, or any future debt that we might desire to take over under section 105. Does the Minister want to do more than section 105 enables us to do in regard to converting, renewing, or consolidating debts? I do not think he does. I attach no special value to the. word " redeem," and if it is introduced it may upset the agreement which we seem to have come to in regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake's</inline> amendment. </para>

                    <para>. - The fact that the Government have agreed to accept the amendment eliminating that portion of the clause which gives the Minister power to take over any portion of the debts of any States, removes my principal objection to the Bill. Had that portion of the clause remained, there would have been power on the part of the Government to exercise an injurious discrimination between State and State. It might be argued that no Government would do such a thing, and very probably a Government would not ; but I do not believe in leaving it in the power of any Government to do wrong when we can provide safeguards on the face of a. Bill. I voted against the second-reading, but now I have no difficulty in giving my support to the measure. I may further say that both <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin.</inline> have assured me that the provision which, we are asked to strike out really does not matter - that it was only inserted for the convenience of the Treasury officers. </para>

                    <para>. -My interest in the Bill has largely faded. The chief virtue I saw in the Bill was the proposal to do away with the restriction, because, in my view, that amendment would! have largely assisted in the solution of the question of taking over the States debts. But I suppose we must not aim at the impossible. The only justification the Government can have for this extraordinary revolution is that if they can not get a whole loaf they must be content with half. It seemed quite obvious that the Bill, as originally drafted, would not be passed, and, therefore, the Government have to be content with an instalment. I regret the circumstances very much, and if I had an opportunity, I should certainly vote against the proposed alteration. </para>

                    GOULD (New South Wales) [9.39]. - I think that
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane's</inline>
                    idea is that the amendment should read, " That section 105 be amended by the addition of the following words," and so forth. That would show on the face of the Bill where the amendment was to be inserted in the Constitution - that section 105 was still to stand with an addition. It would also have made the question much clearer to the people who have to vote ; and I suggest to
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline>
                    whether it would not be better to have the amendment in that form. I should have liked to say something in regard to the clause itself, but I do not wish to detain the Committee, and I may have an opportunity on the third reading.

                    <para>That the Bill be now read a second time. I do not anticipate any difficulty in disposing of this Bill before 10.30 p.m., and so -enabling the order of the day for the second reading of the Bounties Bill, which has been postponed in order to give this priority being dealt with. The Bill has been in the hands of honorable senators for some time. It is very small, so far as its dimensions are concerned, but so far as the State of Tasmania is concerned, it is of no little importance. Shortly stated, the object of the Bill is to bring Tasmania, in the matter of telegraphic communication throughout the Commonwealth into line with each of the other States composing the Union. Honorable senators, and especially those who occupied seats in this Chamber during the first Parliament must by this time be cognisant of the awkward position in which Tasmania has heretofore been placed in the matter of telegraphic communication, not only with the outside world, but with the other States of Australia. At the time Federation was established the cost of telegraphing from Tasmania to Victoria was 2s. for ten words, with address and signature free; 2s. 6d. to New South Wales, 3s. to Queensland and South Australia and, if my memory serves me rightly, 4s. to Western Australia. Of course, corresponding charges were made for messages from those States to Tasmania. Early in the first Federal Parliament a proposal was introduced to reduce these rates. At that time it was proposed to establish what was known as the shilling telegram throughout the Commonwealth, and provision was made accordingly. But so far as Tasmania was concerned, the difficulty that presented itself to the Government of the day lay in the existence of the cable which connected Tasmania with the mainland. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake,</inline> as Postmaster-General, on one occasion in connexion with a motion which I had before the Senate referred to that cable as an intrusion on the part of private ownership into the public ownership of the telegraphy of the Commonwealth. The owners of that cable acquired rights from the Government of Tasmania as far back as 1868. They then acquired the exclusive right to submarine telegraphic communication for some twenty or twenty-one years, upon terms and conditions set out in an agreement. Before the expiry of their rights under that agreement, they entered into another for a corresponding period, but in the renewed agreement they gave to the Tasmanian Government the right to fix through telegraphic charges from Tasmania to Victoria, subject to the condition that the Tasmanian Government, no matter what rates they might impose for their telegraphic charges, should guarantee them a message receipts revenue amounting to Â£5,600 per year. I have already said that at the time Federation was established the cost of a telegram from Tasmania to Victoria was 2s. for every ten words, with address and signature free. Of that sum 6d. went to the Government of Tasmania, 6d. to the Government of Victoria, and the remaining is. to the Cable Company. If the telegram were sent from Tasmania to New South Wales the cost to the sender was 2s. 6d., and of this sum each of the three States - Tasmania, Victoria, and New South Wales - received 6d., and the Cable Company received is. Since the inauguration of the Commonwealth, and the establishment of what is known as the uniform telegraphic charge throughout the Commonwealth of is. for sixteen words, inclusive of address and signature, there has been, so far as Tasmania is concerned, superadded an extra charge of Jd. per word to pay cable charges. That is practically one-half of what is was before. At the time this alteration was made,- the company were receiving a revenue considerably in excess of the Â£5,600 a year. It was contemplated at the time the charge of Jd. per word was imposed as a special toll on telegrams to and from Tasmania, it would result in the  company receiving something less than Â£5,600 a year, and there would be a consequent obligation upon Tasmania to make good the Cable Company's revenue up to that amount. But I understand that the Cable Company has every year since realized at least the revenue of ,Â£5,600 guaranteed under their agreement with the Government of Tasmania. At the present the position is this : A citizen of the Commonwealth, or any one who happens to be in the Commonwealth, can send a telegram from Melbourne to the remotest part of Western Australia, or the most distant part of the Northern Territory or of Queensland  for is. for sixteen words, inclusive of address and signature. Such a telegram might have to pass through the hands of a large number of officers, and to travel thousands of miles, and yet, if a person desired to send it from the nearest part of  Victoria to the nearest part of Tasmania, there would be an extra charge of <inline font-style="italic">\A.</inline> per word to be paid to the Cable Company. Honorable senators will see that that must necessarily tend, in comparison with the communication between the other States, to considerably reduce the volume of communication with Tasmania. In other words, it is a charge which keeps Tasmania commercially, socially, and politically separated from her neighbours to an extent toÂ» which it is not desirable that any one State of the Union should be severed from her sister States. We propose in this Bill to abolish this special charge of Jd. per word from the 1st October next. I point out to honorable senators that every one on this side of Bass Straits in the Commonwealth who is in the habit of communicating with Tasmania by means of the telegraphs will benefit to just the same extent as any Tasmanian who wishes to correspond by telegraph with people in the other States. The cost to the Commonwealth will be Â£^5,600 per annum, and that will be allocated in something like the following proportions: - New South Wales will pay Â£2,061, Victoria Â£1,684, Queensland Â£730, South. Australia Â£523, Western Australia Â£352,. and Tasmania Â£250. When I say that the cost to the Commonwealth will be Â£5,600' per annum, I mention the extreme figure, because, even though this Bill be carried, there will still be some special charges in connexion with cable communication with Tasmania. At present, so far as private telegrams are concerned between residents of the other States and Tasmania, and' <inline font-style="italic">vice versa,</inline> there is, as I have said, in addition to the ordinary Commonwealth charge, a charge of Jd. per word. Oppress messages between the mainland and Tasmania, there is super-added to the ordinary press telegraphic charges for InterState messages a is. cable charge for the first 100 words, and 6d. for each additional fifty words. These additional: charges will be abolished if we pass this Bill. I think I can say that, in consequence, the press of the one ocean State of the Commonwealth will be able to secure a greater amount of information respecting political doings in the sister - States and in the Seat of Government for the time being of the Commonwealth. That advantage would not be confined to Tasmania, it would be reciprocal. The Bill deals with Commonwealth telegraphic rates only, and, therefore, the charges in respect of international telegrams are not affected. So far, we have only legislated' in regard to. the charges on telegraphic messages within the Commonwealth, and" this Bill does not propose to go any further. In regard to international telegrams threepence per word is charged over the cable on ordinary and Government telegrams, and ijd. per word on press telegrams. Those charges are inclusive in respect of all telegrams from Europe, Even with the abolition of the charge in respect of Inter-State telegraphy, there would still be a little revenue derivable by the cable company from other international messages. So far as press cable messages are. concerned, the through charge to Tasmania is the same as to Victoria, but when they come from the East, say, from Manila or Hong Kong, the international rale of ijd. per word would apply, and so with private messages. </para>

                            <para>- They are through charges from the other end. We have not of course yet dealt with the charges on telegrams going outside the Commonwealth. If the Bill be passed, the amount to be paid to the cable company would be under Â£5,600 a year. It is of such slight importance that it need hardly be taken into consideration. We in Tasmania have been labouring under a great disadvantage. For some time, we have had a considerable reduction on pre-existing rates. I understand that, by reason of such reduction, there has been an increased volume of traffic. I have not yet been able to ascertain what the exact increase has been. At any rate, it must have been of no small importance, because the estimate of the Department that a charge of one half-penny per word would not yield Â£5,600 per year has been not only falsified, but that sum has been considerably increased. I believe that the amount received by the company has been nearer Â£7,000. What I wish to impress upon honorable senators is that when a wire of sixteen words is sent from Victoria to South Australia, or Queensland, or New South Wales, or Western Australia, it goes for is., although it may have to pass through a dozen offices. But if it is sent from Victoria to Tasmania, and has to pass through only two or three offices, the cost to the sender is is. 8d. Of that sum, 6d. goes to Victoria, 6d. to Tasmania, and 8d. to the cable company. For every additional word, one penny halfpenny is charged, of which one half-penny goes to Victoria, Tasmania, and the company respectively. If a citizen "on either side of the Strait could send a telegram of sixteen words for is. instead of is. 8d., perhaps he would be inclined to send twice as many messages. The present rates are such that if reduced by eliminating the cable charge, the traffic must be increased, and every penny of the resultant increase would go into the Consolidated Revenue of the Commonwealth, to be credited to one State or other. It will, therefore, be seen that <inline font-style="italic">Â£5,600</inline> is a very small sum to ask the Commonwealth to pay for doing this act of justice to Tasmania, and bringing her into the same telegraphic relation with the other States as they now occupy in respect to each other. I believe that very little time indeed would elapse, before the increase in the revenues of the States affected would amount to Â£5,600, and more, so that practically we should be .getting reduced charges, increased communication, and the amount paid to the cable company would be recouped to the Commonwealth. I feel, from expressions I have heard here on previous occasions when I have spoken on this subject, that I can with the utmost confidence commend the Bill to the kindly reception of honorable senators. I trust, sir, that they will be mindful of your hint, and that we may be able to emulate the example of another place, and, perhaps, get it put through all its stages before half-past ten o'clock. </para>

                        <para>. - It is with great pleasure that I have heard the statement of the Minister. Four years ago, when the Post and Telegraph Rates Bill was before the Senate, I urged that equality amongst the States ought to be our first consideration. I have always held that it was not fair to charge is. 8d. for the transmission of a telegram to Tasmania, when on the mainland a message could be sent from Thursday Island to Western Australia for is. The Bill will abolish this injustice, and though it is estimated that the immediate result will be a. loss of Â£5.600 to the revenue, the increase in business will very soon make that up again. The whole Commonwealth will benefit by this reduction in rates, because a great number of persons on the mainland have occasion to send telegrams to Tasmania, especially in regard to mining matters. </para>

I am glad to welcome this little stranger now. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> might have said a little more to show that the other States will practically lose nothing by this reduction in rates. The estimated loss to the Commonwealth as a whole is .Â£5,600, which will be distributed amongst the six States on a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> basis ; but it is extremely likely that the increase of business which will result will soon make up that loss. The fact that while telegrams could be despatched between any two points on the mainland for is., a higher rate was charged for Tasmania has, no doubt, kept many people from using the cable. I indorse <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating's</inline> statement that the increase in traffic will, in a few years, make good any probable loss. </para>

                        <para>. - Those who remember the debates which took place in 1902 on the Postal Rates Bill, are aware that the provision which it is now proposed to alter, was inserted bv me as Postmaster-General of the day, though with very great reluctance. It was struck out of the Bill, but restored, not with the desire to place burdens upon the people of Tasmania, but because it was thought that the Constitution compelled us to make this extra charge. I have always thought the arrangement an un-Federal one, and was in favour of treating Tasmania and the mainland States equally. But it appeared to me, and to the officers of the Department, that reading together sections 89 and 93 of the Constitution, we could not make the cable rate a Federal charge. Section 89 of the Constitution provides the manner in which the expenditure of a transferred Department shall be dealt with, and deals with the crediting of revenue and the debiting of expenditure. Section 93 gives effect to that provision for the first five years of the imposition of uniform duties, and thereafter until Parliament shall otherwise provide. The sub-section says - </para>

Here is the point which seems to me to be exceedingly important in connexion with this Bill, and which I should like the Minister to consider. I do not express a definite opinion upon it. Under the first part of section 93, coupled with the sub-section I have mentioned, it is provided that the. revenue is to be credited, and the expenditure debited during the period mentioned, and thereafter " until the Parliament otherwise provides." This bookkeeping period will expire next Monday week. I suggest to the Minister that it is not a strained reading of the section, that after next Monday week in respect to crediting revenue or debiting expenditure, Parliament may deal with the matter as it pleases. If the Minister thinks that there is anything in that contention the date of this Bill might very well be altered. </para>

                            <para>- Then the opinion of the Attorney-General is, I take it, different from the opinion that was prevalent in T902 when the Postal Rates Bill was, passed. The opinion held then was that we were debarred by the bookkeeping sections from making this Federal expenditure. I should rejoice very much if in consequence of the bookkeeping section having now practically expired, we could substitute a different method of distributing expenditure and revenue connected with transferred Departments. </para>

                        (New South Wales) [10.25]. - I am not opposed to the Bill, because I realize that under circumstances where all the States ought to be equal, Tasmania is at a disadvantage at present.. For instance, a few months ago I was at Thursday Island and was going to Port Darwin. I wanted to secure a bedroom there, and sent a telegram from Thursday Island. That message travelled all the way through Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia to Adelaide, and then all the way by the transcontinental line to Port Darwin. That message involved an expenditure of is. But if I had wanted to send a similar telegram to Launceston, I should have had to pay a larger sum. That is certainly not a Federal arrangement. The Bill is one that aims at achieving a proper reform in that respect, and I hope it will be carried. I like to support measures brought in by a Ministry to which I am in some respects naturally opposed, and in this instance the measure deserves support. If I can send a telegram from Thursday Island to the extreme limits, of Western Australia - say, to Wyndham - for is., it does seem rather absurd that it should cost more to send a telegram from Queenscliff to Burnie or Devonport, or even to Tamar Heads. Of course, the cable is expensive, but I suppose that a telegraph line through the wilds of Cape York, and portions of Western Australia is also costly to maintain. In fulfilment of our Federal understanding we should make our telegraph rates uniform. It therefore gives me pleasure to support the Bill.

                            <para>- The honorable senator expresses some surprise, but if I use an argument regarding the measure with which he was in entire agreement a few days ago, when its principle was applied to another proposal before the Senate, he will admit that I have some reason for my doubt. I take this to be a proposal, one of the objects of which is to transfer from a State to the Federation expenditure which that State' under the Constitution ought legitimately to bear. I am not saying that there is anything wrong in a State asking to be relieved from an- obligation ; but I say that, under the circumstances, the Ministry ought to be in a position to make out a special case in regard to this particular proposal. I remind honorable senators that the bookkeeping 'period continues in operation, and will continue, until Parliament makes some other provision. Under the bookkeeping sections, the whole of the revenue in connexion with the Post and Telegraph Department in Tasmania is credited to that State, and I desire to knew why this portion of the service should be singled out and made a Federal charge. </para>

                            <para>- My friend must think there is a streak of green somewhere, or he would not thus attempt to impose on our innocence. Of course it is open to the Government to devise another scheme in the place of the bookkeeping system, but the latter is now in force. I contend that, so far, a case has not been made out why we should remove the cable service between Tasmania and the mainland from the operation of the bookkeeping section. Before I can consent to this transfer, I am entitled to ask the Minister, or the representatives of Tasmania, to offer some sounder reason than I have yet heard. I want to hear some sound business reason advanced for the change. </para>

                        <para>. - I cannot understand the brevity of the speech in which the Minister introduced this Bill. There is no doubt that this is an important measure, which should not be hurled at us in this manner. It is difficult for me to understand why the people of Kalgoorlie should be taxed to find money for a cable from which they can never benefit. The introduction of this Bill scarcely occupied five minutes. </para>

The Senate- is entitled to more information than it has received on .this question. I am sure that the representatives of Tasmania cannot have sufficient cast-iron cheek to hope that Western Australian representatives will vote for a measure of this kind. I should like to have some explanation of that, and if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> is unable to give it at this stage, perhaps some other representatives of Tasmania may be able to do so. We are entitled to know why the people of Western Australia should be asked to take upon themselves this responsibility, in order to pay something for the people of Tasmania, which they have rightly had to pay themselves in the past. With the solitary exception of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe,</inline> the whole of the representatives of Tasmania in the Senate are enthusiastic supporters of the principle of private enterprise. They are getting a taste of private enterprise through this cable, and I ask why they should be so anxious to get rid of its blessings? </para>

                            <para>- Tasmania is an extremely wealthy State, and as it is small and compact, its Postal Department should be worked most economically, as compared with the expenditure necessary to carry on that Department in the other States, that are now being asked to tax themselves in order to relieve Tasmania. Some of the centres of population of Western Australia are almost 2,000 miles apart, and it is unfair that that State should be asked to bear the whole of the expense of maintaining a Post and Telegraph Department over a great area, and at the same time bear a load which the people of Tasmania ought to bear. </para>

                            <para>- We have no information as to the number qf messages passing between Tasmania and the other States of the Commonwealth. This information should be given us, and we should not be asked to rush the Bill through all its stages in a few minutes. I might very easily prolong my remarks, but I have some consideration for the members of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff, who have had a very hard time. I therefore conclude by saying that I recognise that, so far as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> is concerned, the charge of parochialism which might very fairly be made against other honorable senators representing Tasmania, cannot be made against him. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator PEARCE</inline> (Western Australia) [10.47]. - I think that this Bill redounds very greatly to the credit of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating.</inline> It is a proof that the honorable and learned senator has been very active and successful in the Cabinet in looking after the interests of his own State. Tasmania has been represented in the Federal Government for five years, and this is the first occasion on which we have had a Bill brought forward which removes a grievance which the people of that State might consider they have had. It is fair that it should be stated that the Tasmanian people have themselves to thank for having had this millstone round their necks for so long. It was the result of an agreement entered into between the Tasmanian Government and the private company. The Commonwealth had to take over that agreement in taking over the transferred services. I wish honorable senators from Tasmania to recognise that they do not in this matter occupy a singular position. In addition to the land line between Western Australia and the eastern States, we have also a cable service. Recently our land line broke down and people who were thus compelled to use the cable between Western Australia and the eastern States had to pay a charge of 4d. per word. It is very likely that that wil] happen again, but we have not approached Parliament for any relief. If anything happened to the land lines, we should stand a poor show of getting relief. </para>

                        <para>- It has happened on several occasions, extending once over a period of some weeks. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> said that he did not wish to claim any credit in connexion with this matter. One has only to read the press of his State to see that he got all the credit in respect of another matter. If he does not get any credit in respect of this Bill, the credit, or discredit, in respect of the other matter has been given solely to him, and, therefore, he ought to be satisfied. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> said that, prior to Federation, a wire from Tasmania to Victoria cost 2s., of which 6d. went to Tasmania, 6d. to Victoria, and is. to the cable company Under the Commonwealth, the position of Tasmania has been improved, because a. wire can now be sent across the Strait for is. 8d., of which the cable company gets 8d. The guarantee to the company was Â£5^00. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> said that its receipts for last year amounted to about Â£7,000. That represents about 210,000 messages at is. each, so that the Commonwealth has to face the position that it may have to pay 8d. on each message. I think that the Tasmanians, in saying that there would probably be no loss from the reduction of the rate, are more sanguine than they have a right to be. There would have to be an enormous increase of business to make up the guarantee of Â£5,600. We have only to look at the figures to see that the Commonwealth would have to contribute very largely towards that sum. But, although that is my view, I do not intend to delay the passage of the Bill because I consider that Tasmania is entitled to be placed on an equal footing with the other States in this regard. </para>

                        <para>. - I was not quite satisfied with the answer which the Minister gave to me by way of interjection, and I propose to move an amendment unless he can satisfy my mind. The great difficulty which confronted us in 1902 was that we could not, as we believed, omit this provision in consequence of the bookkeeping provision. I understood the Minister to say that the Bill is in order because there will not be any expenditure, but I still think that the position now is exactly the same as it was in 1902, and that the Bill involves expenditure. In order that there may be no charge made for transmitting messages by cable, a sum will have to be paid to the company, and the question will arise at once as to the purpose to which it shall be debited. In 1901, we felt that the only way in which we could make the cable free was by making a payment to the company, and then we believed that, by force of the bookkeeping provision, we should be compelled to debit it to Tasmania. I wish to refer briefly to the debate which is reported in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> Volume VII., page 8502. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane</inline> had moved to omit these very words.

                        <para>The whole question of cable agreements with the various States that have joined the Commonwealth has been for some time under consideration, and I think we have arrived at a time now when we shall be able to deal definitely with the matter. I have had the opinion of the Attorney-General upon nearly all the points, and I have now prepared a statement of the whole matter with regard to our relations to the Eastern Extension Company, the Pacific Cable, and this cable between Tasmania and Victoria. </para>

                    <quote>
                        <para>Another consideration is that during the bookkeeping period we have to debit each State the cost of maintaining these services at the time -of the transfer, and it seems to me that even if we were to pay the Eastern Extension Company for the messages that go over their .cable in order to bring the charges to Tasmania on a level with the telegraphic charges to other parts of the Commonwealth, as the agreement is one entered into by the Tasmanian Government, we should have to debit that State with the amount. If that were so, it would be exactly as broad as' it is long, and it would be no advantage to the State of Tasmania. It is very much to be regretted that we cannot make .our rates absolutely uniform throughout the Commonwealth, but it seems to me that the fact of that cable, being owned by a private company is an insuperable objection, whichever way we look at it. The only way in which I can see any opportunity of benefiting Tasmania in this matter is by treating with the company, and endeavouring in that way to secure a reduction in the present rate. </para>

                        <para>- I asked the question because, if these words are considered to be a part of the schedule, I am prepared to move that they be omitted? I am glad that we have the sympathy of the Postmaster-General in the matter, and I am also glad to see that the honorable and ,learned senator recognises that it would be only equity to provide for uniform rates throughout Australia. Tasmania is very much a loser financially in this matter, and as pointed out by the Postmaster-General, the loss to the Commonwealth will be almost <inline font-style="italic">nil</inline> during the bookkeeping period. </para>

                        <para>- - I trust that the honorable senator will not press his amendment. He has quoted my remarks in connexion with a statement he made with reference to a proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane</inline> when the Post and Telegraph Rates Bill was under consideration. If he means to ascribe to me the opinion that it was not competent for the Government bv any means to abolish the cable charges he is attributing to me <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> view which I never held. Time after time, I urged upon him to take the bold course of abolishing these charges, and I pointed out that it could be done. I indicated that there was a great distinction between a definite cable subsidy and a conditional guarantee. The honorable senator and his colleagues, however, seemed to think that Tasmania was paying, and was chargeable under the Constitution with this guarantee as well as the subsidy of ,Â£4,200 per annum payable to the Eastern Extension Company. So far as Tasmania is concerned, she is undoubtedly responsible during the bookkeeping period for expenditure as at the time of transfer. She was paying Â£4,200 per annum bv way of subsidy, and over and above that there was a conditional guarantee to the company of ,Â£5,600 per annum message rates revenue. Who was responsible for that - Tasmania? Yes, primarily ;' but at the time of her entry into the Commonwealth, no. Victoria took her share of the responsibility long before the Commonwealth was established, and it was because we in this Parliament reduced the charge from id. to Jd. per word that Victoria was held to have no further liability. She had accepted the responsibility for her portion of the guarantee or. condition that the cable charge should be reduced to id. ; and because the charge was further reduced to Jd., it was held that, although she received the benefit of the reduction, her liability under the guarantee ceased. As a matter of fact, the Â£5,600 conditional guarantee was not operative, and was not an expenditure of Tasmania. The question of cable communication between Tasmania and the mainland was intermingled with a large number of agreements which a number of the States had entered into with the Eastern Extension Company in connexion with the Port Darwin overland telegraph line and other services. The honorable senator knows that the Â£4,200 debited to Tasmania was allocated amongst the other States, who were also parties to those other agreements with the Eastern Extension Company. It is all very well to imagine that when Tasmania came over to the Federation she was paying Â£5,600 to the Eastern Extension Company, but, as a matter of fact, the public on both sides of Bass Strait were paying practically id. per word above the governmental telegraph charges to the company, and making up that amount and more. </para>

                    <para class="block">The people upon both sides of Bass Strait - not Tasmania - by_ paying since Jd. per word have been bearing the burden of that Â£5,600. It is the people of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and the other States who have been paying this extra toll before and since Federation - who have been paying the message receipts revenue. That is the point which I repeatedly attempted to impress upon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> at the time that he was a Minister. The question of the relations of this company with Tasmania have been, at my instance, most carefully considered by the .present Attorney-General, who has recommended that the course proposed can be constitutionally adopted. More than that I cannot say. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> will not withdraw his amendment, I ask honorable members to vote against it. </para>
