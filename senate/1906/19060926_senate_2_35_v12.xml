I wish to ask whether the Minister will see if it is possible, before the close of the session, to present the return for those States for which the figures are available without waiting to get the figures for the other States. By taking that course it will be possible for honorable senators to obtain information during the session ; otherwise it will not be available ? </para>

                        <para>- It will be remembered that when this matter was brought forward last June, the Minister of Defence promised the fullest inquiry, and report to the Senate on the facts of the case - facts which I venture to say I can show very easily were not. as then represented. The answer given by the Minister the other day, that the Ministry had not inquired, and that he could not report anything to the Senate, is my warrant for rising here, inasmuch as three months have passed since the promise was made, and I am in a position to show that no substantial) effort has been made to comply therewith, that Stone has suffered no injustice at all, and that at the date the charges of injury to this unfortunate man - I call him unfortunate because of his own unwarrantable action - were made, he knew very well that not only was he not under any. disadvantage by reason of his evidence, inasmuch as it was not the truth that he was, but that the union of which he was the secretary had actually thrown him over and refused to support him in connexion with, or have any. thing to do with, the inquiry which the tobacco company in question has most zealously sought to bring about. I am also prepared to show that the company has made several applications to the Ministry to give effect to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford's</inline> promise, but without result. That being the case, and the end of the session being at hand, I consider that this is a matter of urgency, inasmuch as justice should be done to those who have been misrepresented, just as an effort was desired on the part of the Chamber to insure that justice should be done to Stone, if he had suffered any wrong. Let me briefly state the facts: On the 12th January last James Stone, who was an employe of the British Australasian Tobacco Company Proprietary Limited, gave evidence before the Tobacco Monopoly Com- mission. He referred to a test alleged to have been made in the works of the company in September, 1904, with reference to the relative efficiency of male and female tobacco workers. The official record shows that he made this statement: - </para>

                <para>During that month we were all supposed to be on the test, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shaw</inline> threw" out a challenge. The union accepted it, on the condition that they be allowed an arbitrator, because we knew the leaf was tampered with. ' The boys at the bin said that when the men knocked off at half-past three it was disgraceful to see what was done with the leaf. After that, members of the union used to stay behind, and they caught the foreman bringing the females' returns and mixing them in with the leaf, so that when they came next morning to start it would be taken as an average. No test was made. </para>
                <para class="block">That is a direct charge made by Stone against the company's foreman, P. M. Lawrence - whose statutory declaration I shall read - that, in order to impair the efficiency of the work done by the men, he tampered with the wrapping left to be used by them, by surreptitiously mixing with it waste leaf which had been discarded by the females on the previous day. That is a very serious charge for an employe to make against a foreman. If the foreman was guilty he ought to have been discharged. He was not fit for his position. It will be observed from the extract from the official report that Stone made these statements of his own knowledge. He did not profess to make them from hearsay, as he subsequently endeavoured to make out. Nearly a year and a half elapsed between the alleged incident of the mixing of this leaf and the giving of evidence by Stone; yet during that period he never made any complaint to the proprietors or any one else in connexion with the matter. Immediately he had given this extraordinary evidence, he was spoken to outside the room in which the Commission was sitting by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shaw,</inline> the managing director of the company, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wicks,</inline> the factory manager. </para>

                        <para>- Oh, yes. They told him that he had made a false statement. On the following morning, Saturday, 13th January, Stone complained to the Commission, and sought its protection. A full report of the incident appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Evening News,</inline> Sydney. I will not take up time by reading it, but may mention that it is headed " The Damnation of a Witness " ; and the incident is reported in a somewhat sensational form. Of course, the managing director of the company assumed that an account of the incident would appear in the report of the Commission. But it is not published there; and, therefore, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shaw</inline> apparently had no opportunity to take any action. </para>

It was specifically alleged on a previous occasion in this Chamber that if Stone made a false statement he could have been prosecuted for perjury. But it was not Stone who alleged that he had been discharged for making a statement before the Commission. He made no such statement in his statutory declaration. If honorable senators look up the declaration made by Stone published in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> they will see that he carefully dodged or evaded that point. I suppose he was well advised in avoiding it. It was a statement made by senators that he was discharged for giving evidence. </para>

                        <para>- Such a motion can be if pressed to a division, but that is not usually done. I am not now giving a definite decision upon the point. I should like to hear reasons for and against the idea that is in my mind. But I call attention to the point that if we can discuss a particular matter on a motion for the adjournment of the Senate once or twice, we can discuss it a dozen times. </para>

                        <para>- This question has not been " resolved." You say that it is substantially the same question as was previously discussed, but I think there is a great deal of difference between the two. There is as much difference between the case submitted to-day and that submitted last June as there is between the case for the plaintiff in a law suit and the case for the defendant. In this matter the case for the plaintiff was brought forward in June. I am now seeking to answer it. Surely there is the widest possible distinction between an accusation and the reply to it. </para>

There may be a most serious denial of justice. Persons who have been wronged by the publication of charges that have no foundation in fact may have no opportunity to state their defence. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly; but there has been no attempt on the part of Ministers to fulfil their promise made in the Senate. I have nothing more to say. There is certainly no standing order on the point except the one which distinctly refers to questions that have been resolved in the affirmative or the negative. I take it that if this sort of thing were likely to occur frequently, it would be gravely unfortunate, but I suggest that such a question is not likely to arise twice in a session. It is scarce v likely that charges will be made which have not been the subject of inquiry, and have not been cleared up, and that it will be necessary again to do what I am doing now - seeking to reply to them in the only manner that apparently the circumstances of the Senate at the present time afford any opportunity for. I hope that I shall be allowed to complete the exposition that I desire to put before honorable senators, and through the public journals to the country, in respect of persons who are suffering a very grievous wrong by reason of representations made with respect to them. </para>

This is a matter, however, on which there has been no decision. </para>

                        <para>- That being so, it seems to me that the standing order quoted cannot apply to motions for the adjournment. But, as far as motions for the adjournment give effect to or decide any question, it would apply if such a motion were pressed to a division and actually carried. I remember at least one motion for the adjournment of the Senate to an unreasonable hour, though I do not recollect why that motion was submitted. If an honorable senator desires to bring something of the nature of a charge against the Government, perhaps the only way he can do so is to carry such a motion against the wish of the Government ; and that has actually been done. In such a case, I should say that, as nearly as possible, the Senate has resolved something, namely, that the Senate should adjourn to an unusual hour, the expressed object being to censure and defeat the Government. In the case of a motion for adjournment which is discussed and then withdrawn, I should say that nothing is resolved either in the affirmative or the negative. In tile discussion of motions for the adjournment of the Senate, in order that grievances may be ventilated, both speeches and the time allotted to the debate are limited, and it may be that the question is not fully debated when the time limit expires. The reason for permitting this form of approaching the Senate is to afford opportunity to discuss matters of urgent public importance, and it seems to me that if a motion for adjournment is talked out, nothing is done to rectify the particular grievance. </para>

                        <para>- Will the honorable senator kindly take his seat. I may say that I am considerably impressed by the arguments used, and it seems to me that standing order 126 clearly does not apply, because the motion to which I referred was withdrawn, and, therefore, there is no resolution of the Senate on the question. The Standing Orders do not provide for a case like this. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly. I am coming to that. So far about the inquiry. On the 6th June the company wrote to Stone, -whom they were employing all this time - from January to June. There was no dismissal, because they were only too anxious to get at the facts of the case. They wrote: - </para>

                    <para>Dear <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, -</inline> You are aware that the opportunity offered you of proving the charge of dishonest practices, made in your statement before the Royal Commission, was brought to a standstill by your solicitors, Messrs. Brown and Beeby, stating in their letter of 27th February that the Union, on further reflection, declined to be parties to any inquiry into the truth or otherwise of the statements made, and suggesting that the company had recourse by instituting a prosecution against you for perjury. </para>
                    <para>The matter was allowed to stand in abeyance pending the arbitration case, when we fully expected that this charge would have been again brought up, seeing how important a bearing it had on the question of the economy in wrappers as between men and women. </para>
                    <para>You did, at the Arbitration Court, repeat the charge originally made before the Royal Commission, and this time went so far as to mention names in support of your evidence, but beyond your own bald statement no witness was called, nor evidence whatever produced. </para>
                    <para>Seeing the enormous advantage such evidence would have been to your party during the recent proceedings, it is not to be conceived that your legal advisers would have failed in producing it, and so we are forced into the belief that they also gave no credence to your statements. </para>
                    <para>Our duty, therefore, first to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lawrence,</inline> the foreman, whom we consider you have so grossly wronged, is that you shall make reparation to him in the form of an approved apology ; for had your charge been proven he would have lost his situation ; and secondly, an equal apology to ourselves, whom you have endeavoured to hold up to public discredit. </para>
                    <para>At the close of the Arbitration Court proceedings we expected that you would probably tender an apology, and we have delayed writing in consequence. (Signed) W. E. Shaw, </para>

                        I have the honour, by direction of my Union, to respectfully acknowledge the receipt of your letter bearing yesterday's date. In reference to Messrs. Brown and Beeby's letter of the 27th February last, I would with all due respect point out that the Union only acted on the advice of those members of the Royal Commission that they saw.

                    <para>I respectfully ask you, sir, to look over the report of the Royal Commission, and you will find therein that I said as follows : - That I had in my possession two statutory declarations, sworn to by two of your employes. They were working for the B.A.T. Co. during the foremanship of Messrs. Newman and Lawrence, and during the alleged test. Every evening, from June to September, the female returns were brought and mixed in with the wrapper leaf which the men had to work next day. </para>
                    <para>That I had been informed by two other of your employes to the same effect. I have never stated from my own knowledge that the act you complain of had been done. </para>

                <para class="block">These alleged declarations have never been produced. What have been produced are other declarations, which did not come from workmen in the employ of the firm, but from two boys, who had formerly been in the employ of the firm. I have already pointed out clearly that Stone did make these statements on his own authority in the first instance, and that he tried to tone them down afterwards. The company replied to him on the 9th June: - </para>

                    <para>Your endeavouring to explain away your position by saying YOU were acting under advice of certain members of the Royal Commission does not, it seems to us, have any bearing on the case, which is very simple. You, in the witness box, before the Royal Commission, made certain very gross and damaging statements against the foreman and ourselves. You had every opportunity of proving them - 1st, at the Royal Commission ; 2nd, at our invitation, which you through your solicitors positively declined; 3rd, at the recent arbitration proceedings. </para>
                    <para>Having failed to even make an attempt at establishing your charge, one which, as we have already stated, if proved would have meant the immediate discharge of the foreman concerned, we demanded an apology, and shall be glad to hear your intentions as early as possible. </para>

It is a dismissal at the end of more than six months, because he would not support his allegations, apologize for them, withdraw them, or express any kind of regret.

What would the Senate do if one of its officers defamed it or any member of it, and then refused to make any withdrawal, retraction, or apology? </para>

                    <para>. - I defy <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> orany other member of the Senate to read the speech I made in moving the adjournment on a previous occasion, and say that, on my own responsibility, I made any charges whatever against the company? I was careful to point out that I was putting before the Senate the case submitted to me, and all J asked was that the Government should look into the matter and say whether they thought the case was one in connexion with which a prosecution or an inquiry should follow, because of the alleged discharge of an employe on account of the evidence he had given before a Royal Commission. So far as. the case now stands, I say that I have not in the Senate or outside of it endeavoured in any way to block an inquiry. On the other hand, I have repeatedly asked the Government if they would take action in . the matter, and, as honorable senators must be aware from the replies I have received, I was told in each case that the Government had not yet come to a decision on the matter. I am in no way responsible for that. As regards the statements which have been made here by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> this morning, I wish te say that if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shaw</inline> was anxious for an inquiry into this matter, it must be admitted that he wanted an inquiry of his own making, because both <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shaw</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Weeks</inline> attended the sitting of the Commission when Stone made his statement, and they had an opportunity of being recalled if they wished, and' of replying to the statements made by Stone. </para>

                        <para>- It has assumed as serious an aspect as it wears to-day, because the question raised was as to the relative superiority of male and female labour in a particular department. I take it that the object of Stone's evidence was to show that it was not a fair test. It was given within the hearing of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Weeks</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shaw,</inline> and,' in order to prove that they did realize its importance from their point of view, let me point out that the brief, which evidently has been made out by the company, and which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> has <inline font-style="italic">been</inline> quoting, contains a statement that after they left the room they "had an altercation with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stone</inline> in the passage. He returned to the room and said to me - " I have been intimidated." I said - "The Commission has ended its sitting for to-day. If you have been intimidated you must come up and make your complaint to-morrow morning when we resume." <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shaw</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Weeks</inline> could have been called then had they wished to bring evidence in rebuttal, but they did not ask to be called for the purpose. At the following meeting, however, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shaw</inline> asked me to call, in Melbourne, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilkins,</inline> the managing superintendent of both the Sydney and Melbourne factories, and I agreed to do so. It is very significant that, although in his evidence <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilkins</inline> actually referred to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stone,</inline> yet he gave no rebutting evidence. Speaking about the question of wages in his evidence, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilkins</inline> said - 7364. <inline font-style="italic">By</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray.</inline> - Those are the wages under exceptional conditions? - Yes. I gave them the option of going off the " twist " in order that they might fill in their time by wrapping flat tobacco. Some of the men took advantage of that, and' others did not. 7365. I asked <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stone,</inline> when he was giving evidence in Sydney, whether the reason, why the women were put on in place of men in connexion with covering was not because Dixson's asked the permission of the union to be allowed to employ a certain number of apprentices, and the union declined te do so. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stone</inline> said that no such request was made? - I understood that Dixson's did apply at that time through the union for more men (flat coverers we call them, the others we call twisters). The union had no more men, as we had absorbed them in the factory, and then something was said about apprentices, but they would not allow that. Therefore we had to put on women. That was the first introduction of women into the Sydney factory. </para>

The matter was again raised before the Arbitration Court, where <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stone,</inline> in addition to repeating his evidence before the Royal Commission, produced two sworn declarations, .which may be seen on page 499 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of this session. If the company were concerned about the charges, why did it not then bring evidence to rebut them in a Court which consisted of a Judge, with an employers' representative and an employe's' representative. Surely that was a fair tribunal ! </para>

                        <para>- I am pointing out the strange desire for an inquiry which was developed subsequently. Although all the material for a fair inquiry was then available, yet the question was not raised. But <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shaw</inline> wanted an inquiry of his own making. He wished to induce <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stone</inline> to make the same statements in a different position, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shaw</inline> negotiated with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stone</inline> and the union over the matter. The Royal Commission was not consulted as to an inquiry. In Melbourne, just before the hour of meeting, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stone</inline> came to me and said - "The company is asking for an inquiry of its own making. What would you do if you were in my position ?". " Well," I said, " you have made your statement before the Royal Commission, and repeated it before the' Arbitration Court. If it is untrue an action will lie against you for perjury. The company did not ask for an inquiry before the Royal Commission or the Arbitration Court. It might have said that the former is a political tribunal, but it could not make that statement regarding the latter. It was not prepared to take up an inquiry before the Arbitration Court, and, were I in your position, I would not submit to any inquiry. It is a matter for yourself. I do not make this statement to you as Chairman of the Commission." That is all that transpired. So much for the advice of the Royal Commission. The question of intimidation arises in this way : that the company could have had an impartial inquiry if it had been required before the' Arbitration Court, if it thought that the Royal Commission was not an impartial body. The same charge, backed up by sworn declarations, was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stone</inline> before that Court, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shaw</inline> admits in his letters.

                        <para>- I know the standing order, and do not wish to break it. I repeat that, on account of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford's</inline> promise, very fairly made, that he would have an inquiry. and subsequently furnish a report to the Senate, I am justified in making these statements. Now what are the facts as to the inquiry ? All that we know at present - and I speak subject to correction by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> - is that he referred the matter to the Attorney-General. I have a copy of the Aittorney-General's letter contained in a letter signed by the Secretary for External Affairs, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Atlee</inline> Hunt, written under the direction of the Prime Minister. I will read it : - </para>

                        I have the honour, by direction of the Prime Minster, to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the17th inst., addressed to
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford,</inline>
                        with reference to the case of Jas. Stone, a former employe of your company, and to inform you in reply that the matter was referred to the Attorney-General, who finds as follows : - " From the facts as stated it would
                        <inline font-style="italic">prima facie</inline>
                        appear that Stone had been treated harshly and unjustly."
                    </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">I, will offer a word of criticism there. The Attorney-General states " from the facts as stated." The only facts that could have been before the Attorney-General at the time were the facts contained in what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> will readily admit was an <inline font-style="italic">ex parte</inline> statement. It does not reflect much credit upon the Attorney-General that he should give a judicial decision on an <inline font-style="italic">ex parte</inline> statement made by one who was, so to speak, the prosecutor. The letter goes on - " The company may be able to show that this conclusion is not correct." </para>
                <para>The company has had no chance. " Still, the testimony which Stone gave - namely, that he had been informed that certain things had been done - appears, so far as there is any evidence at all, to be proved. Whether or not the information is correct is another matter; but it has been declared to on oath by Herington and Bartlett - who, I understand, are still in the company's employ - and it was not contradicted in evidence before the Royal Commission, although full opportunity existed for doing so. Stone was called on to substantiate his statements at an inquiry to be held by the company - who would be at once prosecutor, judge, and jury. </para>
                <para class="block">No more disgraceful statement could have been made by any man, let alone an Attorney-General, than that. It is most discreditable - it is almost infamous - that the Attorney-General, if he knew the facts - and certainly he ought to have known some of the facts before he wrote this letter - should have said that the proposed tribunal suggested by this man Stone, or rather by the union's secretary, Beeby, was a trial in which the company would be prosecutor, judge, and jury. I cannot help saying, whatever the merits of this case are, that such a statement as this, made by the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth, deserves to be stigmatized in the strongest possible language. The fact is not disputed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> or any one else - that the proposal was made by the union's own solicitors to have these matters tried by such a tribunal. </para>

                        <para>- Surely it will be admitted, at any rate, that if by any chance the proposal did not originate with the solicitors of the union, it was concurred in by them. The question of origination does not matter at all, I venture to say. So far as I am informed, it was originated by the union's solicitors ; but it does not matter so long as they agreed - and upon that point I am quite certain - that a reference should be made to one of four persons named, independent lawyers outside Parliament, and outside any immediate connexion with the case. To propose such a tribunal was to propose a body as fair and as impartial as could be secured. But that method was stigmatized by this Attorney -General as a tribunal which would be at once prosecutor, judge, and jury. No more infamous statement has ever been made. </para>

The bulky brief that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> holds is evidently one that has been furnished to him by the combine, but, after all his efforts, I do not think that he has made out avery good case on behalf of his clients. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stone</inline> did state before the Royal Commission, in answer to a statement made by persons interested in the combine, that women in the factory were more economical than men, but he also asserted on oath that some of the small leaf rejected by the women was placed amongst the material to be worked upon by the men, and that this was done by the foreman. That statement was repeated before the Arbitration Court in New South Wales, and after it was repeated, the members of the combine called upon him either to prove his case or to apologize. In brief, they said to Stone, holding a revolver at his head, We will shoot you out of this place if you do not do as we tell you." </para>

                        <para>- People will back this man up, and see that he gets justice; and care will be taken that this combine shall not, in this young land of ours, do what its twin brothers are doing in the United States and the United Kingdom. This combine, which honeycombs the industry. almost throughout the world, has no consideration whatever for humanitarian organizations. For a considerable number of years trade unions have fought this organization in the United States, but had been defeated; and now the combine will not employ a man or woman who is a member of a union. Further, the combine has carried on a crusade against trade union organization in the United Kingdom. </para>

                        <para>- I think so. It is because of its dislike to trade union organization that the combine is presenting its case before lis to-day. I am of opinion that every word stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stone</inline> is correct, and that he would be quite prepared and content to abide by the decision of a fair, impartial tribunal, but not such a tribunal as that proposed by the members of the combine. The combine has a very great regard for women, simply because their labour is cheaper than that of men; and, according to reports, it has, in this connexion, for a considerable time, taken action which has irritated and harassed the men. The case under notice is only a further evidence of the many things that have been done in connexion with the large employment of women. The statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> is simply <inline font-style="italic">ex parte.</inline></para>

What we had this morning is a brief for the combine, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> apparently has given no consideration to the statement made bv Stone, or to the evidence given before the Royal Commission. In my opinion, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> did the proper thing in having this matter ventilated in the Senate, and I, at any rate, should not be satisfied with any inquiry other than one which would meet with the approval of the men, and, at the same time, do justice to the persons against whom the accusations are made. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has dealt with a great many statements not made here, and I admit the ingenuity which introduces into this debate matters which have no possible bearing on the question. Senators Pearce and Findley have introduced the question of whether trickery was resorted to in connexion with the trial made in the factory. That was a proper subject for the Royal Commission to inquire into, or it might have been a proper subject for the Arbitration Court ; but it was never brought before" the Senate on a former occasion. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce's</inline> demand for an inquiry rested on statements - <inline font-style="italic">ex parte,</inline> as is frankly admitted - that intimidation had been resorted to in the case of a Royal Commission witness. If the question had been merely whether trickery had been resorted to in the factory, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> would have scouted the idea of asking for an inquiry by the Government. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce's</inline> whole case rested on the charge that an attempt had been made to intimidate a witness; but on the present occasions, Senators Pearce and Findley have been eloquently silent on that point. They have sought to confuse the issue by referring to allegations of trickery and malpractice in the factory. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> was Chairman of the Royal Commission, but he evidently did not think it his proper function to bring this question of trickery before the Senate, and ask for an inquiry. What he very properly said was that he believed the witness had been intimidated, and that, in his opinion, there ought to be some investigation made. </para>

It has been frequently stated that the employers in this case had an opportunity to have the matter decided before a proper tribunal. But the question of intimidation never could, and never would, have come before that tribunal. The tribunal to which the union at first agreed was the only one before which the company could have had a fair deal. An agreement was arrived at to appoint one of four gentlemen, but in some mysterious war - I venture to say it was after consultation with members of the Royal Commission - the union withdrew. That was the only impartial tribunal it would have been possible for the employes to have put their case before, and it was rejected, I do not hesitate to say, by the advice of members of the Royal Commission. </para>

                    <para>As we have not so far been approached, we would like, if possible, to know when it may be convenient for the inquiry to be held, as we are equally desirous of having a thorough investigation, when we have every confidence that we shall be able to remove any misconception which might exist in the minds of some of those who took part in the debate. </para>

                <para class="block">The reply Senator Clemons has read. Then the company, through their managing director, wrote a further letter, dated 27th July last, taking exception to the extraordinary statement of the Attorney-General, and again urging that an inquiry should be held in order that they might have an opportunity to clear their reputation, which had been so seriously assailed. To that letter of the 27th July, the Ministry have not deigned an answer. No less than two months have elapsed since the last time the company asked for an inquiry to clear their reputation and the reputation of their foreman, and it is in these circumstances, and on account of the failure on the part of the Government that I, as a public man, and as a member of the Federal Legislature, deem that I am doing my duty in showing the actual correspondence that has taken place. I have made no statement today that is not supported by the documentary evidence and reports. I consider that if the Government, had done their duty, a report might by this time have been presented, which would have rendered it totally unnecessary that I should have occupied the time of Che Senate for one moment on the subject. I ask leave to withdraw my motion. </para>

That I may put myself in order, and may not anticipate debate on that motion, I desire to say that, owing to the late stage of the session at which we have arrived, and the fact that there will not be sufficient time to discuss so important a subject, it is my intention to take the first opportunity to move that the motion be discharged from the paper. </para>

                            <para>- I do not intend to proceed with it. Another point of order which might be taken in objection ' to the remarks which I and other honorable senators desire to make is that there is nothing about old-age pensions in the Bill - it deals only with the imposition of special duties of Customs and Excise - but we know that the real reason for its introduction is to make provision for the establishment of a system of old-age pensions. It is impossible to discuss the measure without referring to the only reason, so far as I know, for which, the special duties are to be levied. If it will put me more in order in making those references, I say that when the Bill gets into Committee I intend to take steps to have the specific object of the measure mentioned in the Bill, and also to insert certain safeguards with regard to the amount of the old-age pensions, the total amount to be spent by the Commonwealth for this purpose, and the various conditions under which' the pensions shall be granted. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable senator did, he seems to think that I have not learned it. He seems to be under the impression that I am ordering ten-guinea coats myself when I know that I can get' a verv good coat for five guineas. I am doing nothing of the kind. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake,</inline> in his excellent speech yesterday, showed that this measure is to a great extent a violation of one of the basic and fundamental principles of the Constitution. It is true that both Houses of the Federal Parliament must consent to. it, and it must run the gauntlet of a referendum in each State, before it becomes law ; but it is a very complicated matter to put before the electors, and it is, I think, unreasonable that we should ask the electors on the one hand to say whether we should pay old-age pensions of 10s. a week from the age of sixty-five years, and on the other hand, if the Commonwealth can afford to do that, how the fund is to be raised. It will also be the dutv of the electors to consider the other questions of sound finance which arise. I hope that we shall be able to confer such a benefit as is proposed, but it is our duty before the issue is put to the electors to discuss whether an old-age pensions scheme can be established on business principles, whether the system adopted should be an economical system, based upon thrift and self-help, and having regard to what we know is inherent in human nature, or whether we should throw every precaution aside, and go in for a system of old-age pensions regardless of every condition which a business man would consider necessary. </para>

                            <para>- Tasmania under Federation has already lost revenue to the extent of about <inline font-style="italic">j£i</inline> per head of her population. I remind honorable senators of the Labour Party that the direct taxation of the State amounts to <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> 4s. 3d. per head, and we come nearer to realizing the proper balance between indirect and direct- taxation than does any other State .in the Commonwealth. I point out that if a scheme of old-age pensions on a basis of 10s. per week is inaugurated without safeguard and without regard to the difference between the deserving and undeserving poor, Tasmania cannot afford it. I would say that our shortage of revenue, if not our will, must compel us to support a system which will not be extravagant. </para>

                            <para>- I hope that they will cease to make interjections intended to exalt themselves and disparage me_ in the eyes of the electors. I am not going before the electors this year, and I hope that I shall be allowed to proceed in peace. I am sorry that I shall not have time to proceed with the motion which I have undertaken to move. ' It is important to consider whether we can afford an extravagant system of old-age pensions. I expect to gain the sympathy, if not the sup port, of honorable senators, -when I say that Tasmania has lost a lot of revenue under Federation, and it would be simply hopeless for that State to agree to the establishment of the system recommended by the Royal Commission when it would cost' her ,£59,700. I want to see if we cannot adopt a more economical system, and one which would1, have some regard to the character of our people. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> that it is a bad principle to ear-mark certain sources of revenue for a specific purpose. This departure is taken merely to make the scheme palatable, to win success which otherwise might not be won. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> tried the same plan when he wished to bring about preferential duties. He wanted to establish a modicum of protection, and he proposed that the revenue so raised should be spent on old-age pensions, but the idea did not "catch on" because the members of the House of Commons, on each side, are sincere. They have all declared that at the present time it is impossible for England and Wales to afford £18,000,000 to carry out the scheme. If there is one principle more than another which is impressed on the mind of the electors, it is the fact that out of the Customs and Excise revenue three-fourths have to be returned to the States, so that each State may pay its debts and carry on its affairs. To propose, before we have taken over the States debts, to empower the Government of the Commonwealth to raise specific duties for a specific purpose is, I think, to propose a breach of the Constitution which ought not to be favoured for a moment, and which, if made, might prove disastrous to various States. I think that the transfer of the States debts should precede the grant of such power to the Federal Government. Until the Commonwealth has come to an arrangement with the States in regard to the bookkeeping system and the transfer of States debts, it is most reckless, I think, to empower the Government to raise specific duties for a specific purpose. Let me give an illustration, in order to show the difference between economy and extravagance. According to a paper which I read the other day, and which I have not at hand, the cost of the administration of the Old-Age Pensions Department in New South Wales is about 300 per cent, higher than that of the corresponding Department in Victoria. That ought to show the vast difference be- tween a prudent system and one which is based upon a desire to please every elector. </para>

                            <para>- For some reason or other the Government has not had the courage to state in the Bill what it means. Does the Minister think that every candidate will not tell the electors its object? Yet it is not disclosed in the Bill itself. Every candidate will tell the electors at each meeting he addresses that the object of the Bill is to sanction an old-age pension of 10s. per week. Does not the Minister, with his practical common sense, think it is quite bad enough to ask for power to levy special duties for one purpose and to that extent violate a Basic principle in the Constitution. Why does the Government want power to raise specific duties for any other purpose? The Government seems to have gone out of its way to make the Bill unpalatable, and to conceal from the electors its real purpose. Tasmania cannot afford an expenditure of £60,000, but she might be able to contribute to a more moderate system. Let me illustrate the difference between an economical and an extravagant system. I understand that originally, if not now, the old-age pension in New Zealand was 7s. per week ; in Victoria it is 8s. ; and in New South Wales it is 10s. Do I deserve to be sneered at when I say that Tasmania cannot afford to contribute towards a pension of 10s., but that she might make a desperate struggle to contribute towards a pension ofl 7s. ? We all admit that the soldier in the industrial arm v is entitled to better treatment in his old age, when he cannot work, than to be placed in a poor-house or a benevolent institution, as if he had not assisted in building up this great Commonwealth. Let me now refer to a few of the schemes whose test features we might copy. In a speech which he made last night, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mackinnon,</inline> the ex-leader of the Opposition in the State Legislative Assembly, dealt with the_question of the friendly societies, and from him I propose to quote in order to show how important it is to have a system that would encourage, and not discourage, thrift.

                        <para>No fewer than five million persons in England were providing by their own exertions for sick ness and death, and they possessed twenty million pounds of capital. The total industrial male population of England was estimated at 7,000,000. These were striking figures. The last Victorian Actuary's report (1905) showed that the friendly societies of Australia had 346,583 members, and £4,357,939 of funds. Attributing three persons - those who get the benefits - to each member, it worked out that over one-fourth cf the population were connected directly with the societies and shared in the benefits. Victoria had 103,364 members and ^1,541, 630 of funds. The capital per member was about £15, which was only exceeded by prosperous New Zealand. in 1878 there were 48,500 members. These figures showed the importance of friendly societies to the national life of Victoria. The benefits were widespread ; they induced thrift and education ; and by education, training, improving the quality of the individual, and raising his moral tone, the community benefited. There was no need to dwell on the importance of such societies. </para>

                    <para class="block">In Australia, therefore, thrift has been encouraged, and one-fourth of the total population are deriving benefits from the friendly societies.

In his efforts to establish a system of old-age pensions. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> was most anxious to work with the friendly societies. I suppose that some honorable senators recollect a famous letter in which he impressed upon, the people of Great Britain that it would be verv disastrous to inaugurate a scheme which did not work with, and.- to some extent, take in, the friendly societies throughout the United Kingdom. I cannot conceive of a responsible Minister considering a scheme without having regard to the friendly societies. Victoria and New South Wales, which contain far more than half the population of the Commonwealth, each have a scheme in which no account is taken of the friendly societies. But the German scheme, which is compulsory in its nature, takes account of accident, sickness, death, and old age. It is one of the most perfect systems which the world has ever known, and one which other nations would do well to copy, so long as they adapted its principles to their own industrial conditions. In my motion, I ventured to point out to the Government that it could not do a wiser or better thing than to offer a substantial prize of, say, <inline font-style="italic">£100</inline> to any man who would devise the best plan for introducing a system of old-age pensions, based oh the principles of the German scheme.

                            <para>- We all know that the administration of whatever Act we place on the statute-book will be a very important feature in its success. We must admit that a great many mistakes have been made in the administration of Old-age Pensions Acts in Australia up to the present time. That is natural enough, and is no argument against the system as a whole, but these mistakes should, at all events, serve as a guide to us, and should enable us to formulate a better scheme than any State has yet done. Let me give an exam'ple. Since the passing of the Victorian Act, 197 persons have been re-ad mitted to the Benevolent Asylums which they had previously left, because pensions had been granted to them ; and, at the time they were re-admitted, 9^ had surrendered their pensions. Their re-admission involved a saving of about £4,000 a year, being' the difference between the amount of the pension granted to them and the cost of maintaining them in the institutions. That fact shows how recklessly pensions must have been granted, and is a warning to us. Although the cost of administering the Victorian Act is exceedingly small - so small as to make one wonder - we all recollect that Victoria made a fatal blunder in inaugurating the system. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner forgot to provide a special fund from which to pay the pensions. Although an Act was placed upon the statute-book granting this right, no provision was made for raising the money. The pension originally paid in Victoria was 10s. per week. But there were terrible cases -of old men being found in huts and holes covered with vermin, having spent their pensions irc drink, and having had to be carried back to the Benevolent Asylums and similar institutions, lt was then found that the 10s. a week pension was excessive, and Victoria had to reduce it to 8s. I trust that the Commonwealth will save itself from the fatal blunder of going ahead too fast, and then having to take a retrograde step. If 10s. per week is more than we can afford - and I am inclined to think that it is - let us make the pension 8s. a week, or 9s. Personally, I think that 7 s. would be too low. But we certainly should not grant a high pension, and then find that our financial necessities compel us to retrace our steps. All these points suggest themselves for reflection and warning. Referring to the German system, I may point out that it is a compulsory system. I admit that there are very few systems in the world that are compulsory. But while we have. had such voluntary systems as that suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> in Great Britain, at least one compulsory system has been suggested there, by Canon Blackley. We have only to look at the German system to recognise what an admirable one it is. The information at our disposal shows that it has been a magnificent success in every direction. Bismarck first created the scheme, in 1883. It was then called a sick insurance scheme. It was altered in 1884, when an accident insurance system was added to it. It was altered again, in 1889, into a complete scheme of infirmity and old-age insurance, the State making a contribution towards the pensions, and the rest being made up by compulsory contributions of employer and employe. We have been discussing old-age pensions on the basis that the State should contribute the whole amount. I think that any scheme introduced into the Commonwealth should be one under which the State would most liberally subsidize the fund, but I have, not the slightest hesitation in saying that the worker ought to contribute a considerable portion towards the pension, and that the employer should also contribute his share. Of course the proportions to be contributed by each of the parties is a matter for consideration. If we are going to have minimum wages, Wages Boards, and Arbitration Courts, insuring the payment of fair wages to employes, those factors will have to be taken into consideration in fixing the contribution to be made by the employes to the fund. It might be determined that the State, the employer, and the employe should each contribute a third, or the amount of the pension might be divided into five, the employer and the employe" contributing two-fifths each, and the State one-fifth. In. determining these factors, we must have regard to the conditions under which employers have to conduct their business, to the wages paid to employes, the conditions under which they work, and whether they are in a good position to make a substantial contribution. I do not wish to have it said that such a scheme is unworkable. It can be made workable. </para>

                            <para>- I think that my honorable friend is right, and that some amendment has been made in the German system in that respect. But, nevertheless, I am strongly of opinion that whatever fund is established should be maintained by contributions from the three parties I have mentioned, the State, the worker, and the employer. I have seen it suggested - I think in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild's</inline> admirable book, which contains an enormous amount of information, although it is getting a little out of date - that our population is one which, to a large extent, moves about from place to place, and that a considerable percentage of workers would not be able to afford contributions. I am, of course, aware that there is a section of our working class who wander, not only over particular States, but from State to State, but their number is small in comparison with the mechanics and other workmen, thousands, and tens of thousands of whom are permanently employed in the industries of the country. The principle upon which I desire to insist is, that whatever scheme we establish shall be based upon sound principles, and shall be a scheme which will grow, and which instead of discouraging thrift, will promote it. The German scheme, of course, is only applied to persons who work for employers, <inline font-style="italic">and</inline> whose incomes do not amount to £100 a year. In Australia we could make those limits and exceptions upon any basis we pleased. Let us look at the results in Germany!. In 1902-3, 10,320,000 persons were insured against sickness, and 3,983,000 of those persons received sick pay to- the amount of £9,158,705. In addition, there were 19,083,000 who were insured, and compensation amounting to £5,406,000 was paid to 834.600. Self help is not prevented by this system. Some people have argued that it would be, but it is not, as is proved by the amount of savings per head of population of Germany, which has increased to a greater extent than in Great Britain. In fact, during the last ten years the savings of the working classes in Germany have become four times as great as those in Great Britain. They have increased from £200,000,000 to nearly £400,000,000. Count Posadowsky, a Russian literary man, commenting on these facts, expresses the opinion that - the great increase in the prosperity of German industries is chiefly due to the raising of the level of life of the working classes by this social-political legislation, and his conviction is shared by many thoughtful observers. </para>

                    <para class="block">Turning to Professor Ashley's book on the <inline font-style="italic">Progress of the German Working Classes,</inline> I find that he gives interesting testimony to the value of this system. He says - </para>

                        <para>Let us put on one side the accident insurance' system, as roughly balanced by our recent compensation legislation, though the latter is probably less efficacious for its purpose. There remains the sickness insurance system, and also that which covers old age and infirmity. These may be roughly compared with our friendly society organization, supplemented by various union and other trade societies. But there are these striking differences. (1) Two-thirds of all the wage-earning work people in Germany are insured against sickness, and can confidently look forward to receiving, in case of need, both medical assistance and pecuniary relief ; <inline font-style="italic">i.e.,</inline> there is a much narrower fringe of people totally unprovided for. (2) A considerable part (one-third) of the cost is compulsorily borne by the employers. (3) Thirteen out of sixteen wage-earning work people have a right to a small pension in case of permanent incapacity, or on reaching the age of seventy - a far larger number than the few who in England benefit by friendly society pensions. The accompanying diagram vividly presents to the eye the proportion of the working population of Germany which falls within the range of this beneficent system. The pension is small, varying from about two shillings to five shillings a week. But added to other means of livelihood, it will often make all the difference between a pinched but possible existence and absolute starvation ; and it is to be remembered that it can be claimed as a right and not as a charity. (4) Almost two-fifths of the cost of this are also compulsorily borne by the employers. </para>

                        <para>For a complete survey of the conditions of the German working classes there are still several other topics which deserve to be considered. It might be shown how, since its creation in 1883-1889, the workmen's insurance system has been almost every year widened in its range, extended in the amount of benefits offered, and brought into closer touch with the real circumstances of working-class life. Most full of promise for the future of the country are the friendly personal relations between the representatives of the employing and employed classes, which has happily been brought about in some important industries by their compulsory co-operation in the carrying out of the new laws. Having achieved the establishment, not only of insurance against sickness and accident, but also of a vast system of old-age pensions, German social reformers are beginning to feel themselves within sight of the next great step in advance - some provision for widows and orphans. </para>

                    <para class="block">I have always thought what a wonderful thing it is that no working-class party, nor any other party in Australia, has taken sufficient' account of the widows and of women deserted by their husbands, and who, with two or three infant children tugging at their gowns, find it quite impossible to work. It appears to me that a widow in that position, or a deserted wife, is even more worth v of the consideration of the State in the matter of pecuniary aid than, a man of 65 years of age who is perhaps capable" of earning 15s. or £1 per week. All these matters can be considered, and we may adopt the best features of every system that we know of. We could offer a prize for a scheme, and by care and thought, aided by experience, we might in Australia establish the best the world knows. But we shall not do that if we simply adopt the recommendations contained in the report of the Royal Commission, admirable as that report is; because we must follow lines better than those which have been adopted in Australia up to the present. As to the system suggested for England, let me read some extracts from Drage's <inline font-style="italic">Problem of the Aged Poor.</inline> In this work is set forth a summary of all the systems heard of in the House of Commons during the last thirty years.

                            slates that his scheme had its origin in a voluntary committee, composed of about eighty members of the House of Commons. " The Parliamentary Committee never had it in their mind that it would be possible at the present time to secure any universal system of old-age provision. The utmost that they hoped was to propose something in the nature of an experiment which would throw a good deal of light on the subject, and which would be good so far as it went, and which might lead gradually to a much more complete arrangement. . . . The scheme contemplates three cases, in which persons desirous to make provision for old age, and voluntarily prepared to do so, can be helped by this State Pension Fund."

                    <para class="block">That is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain's</inline> scheme, as recommended bv the voluntary committee of eighty members of the House of Commons. </para>
                    <para>Case I. provides for a pension of 5s. a week after the age of sixty-five. It provides for no collateral advantages, and no return of the subscriptions in the event of death before the age of sixty-five. To secure this pension a man must deposit a lump sum of <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> 10s., at the age of twenty-five, and pay an annual subscription of 10s. afterwards. The State adds a lump sum of <inline font-style="italic">£io</inline> to the sum of <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> 10s. contributed, and in . addition an annual interest of 2^ per cent, on this ;£io, and on the subscription and deposits of the insurer. More than 5s. a week can be insured for by higher contributions, but the State aid in this class is limited to <inline font-style="italic">£10.</inline> Case II. provides for a pension of 5s. a week after sixty-five, with certain benefits, in the case of death before sixty-five. To secure this form of pension the insurer would have to deposit a lump sum of <inline font-style="italic">£5</inline> at the age of twenty-five, and pay an annual subscription of <inline font-style="italic">£1.</inline> The State would add <inline font-style="italic">£15</inline> (instead of <inline font-style="italic">£10,</inline> as in case I.), which would accrue at once. In case of death before the third payment was made, the deposits would be returned. In the case of death after the third payment was made, and before sixty-five, provision up to a sum not exceeding 12s. a week would be made for his widow, and all his children until they reached the age of twelve. If he died before sixty-five, having no widow and no children,£5 would be paid to his representatives for funeral expenses. These benefits, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> states, could be varied if it were thought desirable. The mode of payment might also be varied. For instance, it would be possible for a man to pay down a lump sum, at any time, which would cover his annual contribution for a certain period, or tables might be prepared by which a man could begin to insure at an earlier age than twenty-five for a pension to commence at any age before or after sixty-five. According to the report of the actuary, this£15 paid down by the State would be sufficient to meet all the liabilities to widows and orphans. Both under case I. and case II. the scheme provides special rates and benefits applicable to females. But no suggestion is made that the money should be returnable, or that any benefits should accrue in case the insurer died before sixty-five. Case III. provides for cooperation with Friendly Societies and Trade Unions. </para>
                    <para class="block">It would appear to me extraordinary if we were to absolutely ignore trade unions, friendly societies, benefit societies, and similar organizations, and, forgetting the large membership they represent, and the work they have been doing for centuries almost, attempt to establish an entirely new system of our own. </para>
                    <para>To this case, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> attaches " the very greatest importance." " I would say at once," he says, " that if the Friendly Societies take this matter up. I do not hesitate to say that it is through them that I should anticipate by far the largest result." </para>
                    <para class="block">Here, the State would tell the friendly societies and other similar organizations, to go ahead with their sick and accident funds, and particularly with their old-age pension funds, and would undertake to double whatever had been contributed on the pensioner reaching the age of sixty-five. As <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> says, that system is well worth consideration. </para>
                    <para>Case IV. would provide for a temporary pension scheme for those now above the age of twenty-five. </para>
                    <para class="block">It will be noticed that in the motion I have on the business-paper I mention the age as thirty, but all under that age ought to have applied to them the scheme I suggest. </para>

                        states that it would be desirable that such provision should be made, for it would relieve a large number of aged at the present time, and would add to the ultimate success of the scheme ; but, he adds, " I should be sorry to put forward the scheme of the Parliamentary Committee as having been sufficiently carefully studied to be accepted as a final solution of that part of the question." He thinks, however, that it would be necessary for the State to make this provision on a more generous basis than the rest of the scheme. It is suggested in this scheme that in the case of arrears the contributor should be charged interest at the rate of 5 per cent., for a period of ten years, during which he might have an opportunity of paying up his arrears. If he does not do so, and dies before he is sixty-five years old, his widow is to have 5s. for twenty-six weeks, and any balance there is of his own subscription in cash.

                    <para class="block">We now pass away from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain,</inline> and come to the system suggested by Canon Blackley. </para>
                    <para>Canon Blackley's scheme of compulsory national insurance was first published in1878 ; since that time it has undergone various alterations. </para>
                    <para class="block">My friends of the Labour Party will see that they were not the first to direct attention to this subject. </para>
                    <para>It was originally suggested that all persons from the age of eighteen to twenty-one should be required " to contribute to a fund, State collected and State secured, a sufficient amount to entitle each contributor, when physically unable to earn wages, to a weekly sick pay of8s., and to an old-age pension of 4s., a week." The scheme was examined fully before the Select Committee of the House of Commons during the years1885-7. As a result, the sick pay portion of the scheme was condemned. Since that time the supporters of the scheme have dropped the sick benefits, and only adhered to the old-age pensions. This part of the scheme met with a favorable reception before the Committee. The original scheme provided for a payment of£10 between the ages of eighteen and twenty-one, which would have been sufficient to secure the benefits promised, according to the rate of interest at that time. This sum, Canon Blackley says, was merely intended to be a tentative one. </para>

                        Booth proposes that the State should grant free and universal pensions for old age. The scheme provides " that every one born in England or Wales, who has not for any length of time resided abroad (unless as a soldier or in the service of the State) shall, when sixty-five, be entitled to a pension of 5s. a week."

Does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> contend that criminals and prostitutes are entitled to a pension of 10s.per week as a matter of right? It makes one sick when he is trying to do his best to assist in establishing old-age pensions to hear approval expressed of extending the benefits to criminals and prostitutes. In every such system in the world, such people are not permitted to enjoy the full benefits. It does not follow, however, that they are left to die in the gutters, because there are homes, benevolent asylums, retreats, gaols, and all sorts of places. </para>

                        is a very sanguine man if he thinks that the spending of£18,000,000 in giving old-age pensions to everybody would encourage thrift. It appears to me that such expenditure would have an opposite tendency.

                        scheme. The chief points of difference are that - (1) Pensions should only be given to those aged persons who are proved to be impecunious - that is to say, to all those who have not sufficient means to support themselves. Each applicant would have to submit him or herself to examination on oath.

                        thinks that the examination would practically be made once and for all, as it is rare that an aged person who is impecunious once will ever recover his position. (2) All pensioners would have to give up work. This

                        considers to be essential to the successful working of the scheme ; first, as a means of ascertaining that the case is genuine; secondly, to prevent the pensioners interfering with the ordinary labour market. (3) The amount of pension would be raised to 10s. a week, except, perhaps, in the case of aged married couples, when the pensions would be on a reduced scale. The cost of the scheme,
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hardy</inline>
                        thinks, would not be much more than the cost of the present Poor Law.
                    </para>
                    <para class="block">Unfortunately, experience has shown that old-age pensions decrease- only to a small extent the cost of poor law and charitable institutions; indeed, in some cases, the cost of the latter is increased. The book then proceeds to deal with the schemes of' <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bartley, Mr. Frome</inline> Wilkinson, and Professor Marshall. I shall not trouble the Senate with the details of the schemes of those gentlemen, except to say that Professor Marshall proposes one which is based on the co-operation of the poor law and charitable institutions. That, of course, would not suit Australia. Before leaving this part of the subject. I should like to refer to the admirable table in the report of the Commonwealth Royal Commission, showing what may be done in the way of providing that the people shall contribute to the payment of their own pensions. It appears from figures supplied by the Registrar of Friendly Societies at Brisbane, that if £10 be deposited at birth, and invested at 3 per cent., it will yield a pension of 10s. per week at the age of sixty-five, while a deposit of£5 at birth, invested at compound interest, at 4 per cent., will yield a similar pension at the same age. If we take the more practical age of twenty-one, and assume that a youth, from that age onward to the age of sixty-five, contributes £14s.10d. annually. this invested at31/2 per cent. will provide a pension of 10s. per week. Does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> say that most of our workmen, who receive wages of <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> and over a week, could not contribute £1 4s.10d. per annum? </para>

If a youth waits until he is twenty-five years of age, when he ought to be a skilled mechanic in permanent employment, he could by an annual contribution of£1 10s. 8d. per year, invested at 31/2 per cent., secure at sixty-five years of age, a pension, not of 7s. or 8s., but of 10s. per week. Do these figures not show that, by adjusting contributions in a fair way, so as not to overburden a man, or deprive his wife and family of one single necessary of life, an admirably sound system could be founded? Old-age pensions of 10s. per week would cost Tasmania£60,000 per annum, and while that State has been deprived of£1 per head of revenue under Federation, pensions on such a scale would add to the burden of the people by 6s. 7d. per head. </para>

These are some articles on old-age pensions which I have taken from the <inline font-style="italic">Mercury.</inline> I do not know who the writer of the articles is, but, speaking of New Zealand, he writes in this way - </para>
                        </talk.start>
                    </continue>
                    <para>A number of instances of the ill effects of the pensions are mentioned. Some spent their money in beer; others contracted "swelled head," and were expelled ; one man, who " was a peaceable inmate of a charitable institution," as soon as he was granted his pension, left it, and became an actor in a tragic affair. The following are instances of unfairness : A man of 65, of indifferent character, because he was a wastrel, was granted a pension ; another of 82, of good character, who had supported himself, was denied a pension because he had saved£52 during the year ! So that the system actually offers a premium for idleness. " Do nothing for your own support, and the State will keep you; work, deny yourself, save, and the State will do nothing for you." </para>
                    <para>I have no wish to drive that axiom to extremes, but honorable senators must see that it is unfair that a man who is a waster, and has gambled or drunk the value of two or three old-age pensions, should be able, because of present poverty, to secure a pension, whilst a man who has struggled all lis life on a wage of, perhaps,£1 per week, should get nothing. These are matters which should be considered. We cannot deal with these questions blindly and without taking into account what goes to build up the character of the people of the Commonwealth. The writer goes on to say - </para>
                    <para>The testimony of a resident near Nelson is quoted, in which the following, <inline font-style="italic">inter alia,</inline> occurs : - " It is said that people do all sorts of things to rid themselves of their bits of property, giving them away to their relatives with whom they mean to live. Children take no further responsibility about parents, and old people, who have not misbehaved heretofore, seem to lose their heads, and begin to drink and swagger. I know old people in this neighbourhood who were quite well off, with cottages, fields, and orchards of their own, who have somehow divested themselves and become pensioners without shame or scruple." Notwithstanding the condition which makes poverty imperative, the pensioners contrive to get on the blind side of the authorities. The cases are cited of a wife who died having £600 in the bank, and a pensioner, who had£500 in the bank at his death. Another case was that of an old couple who made over their farm to a married daughter, with whom they lived, and drove in in a pony chaise once a month to draw their pension. The Agent-General of New Zealand says:- "There can be little doubt that a large portion of the £200,000 to be found by the New Zealand Treasury under the Pensions Act will go towards lowering the sums found by the children of the poor to the support of their aged relatives." </para>

Honorable senators must see how difficult and complicated the whole question is. It is not sufficient to talk merely about old-age pensions. I admit that the phrase has caught on, and that it has helped some of my honorable friends opposite wonderfully at elections. It is like the phrase " White Australia" or the word "arbitration," but we cannot govern a country by phrases. It is idle for a statesman to talk about going before the people, and asking them whether they prefer that 10s. per week should be given to them when they have reached the age of sixty-five years, or that they should help to get it for themselves. We can expect only one answer to such a question, and it is for us, in the circumstances, to show some little business aptitude and statesmanship in devising a scheme that will be fair to the State, the employer, and the taxpayer. I wish to say a few words about the report of the Royal Commission, which is an admirable report if considered as dealing with the matter from the Australian point of view. They recommend - </para>

                    <para class="block">In New South Wales they have no provision of that sort, and I point out that, although the Old-age Pensions Commission suggest that such a provision should be made, the Parliament in dealing with the matter might decide that pensions should be paid as a matter of right, and that no contribution need be made by a husband, wife, or child. Parliament might disregard that wise recommendation, and it might so add tens of thousands of pounds to the amount of the fund that would be required. It is all very well for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> to say that this has nothing to do with the Bill, which merely asks that the Government should have the necessary power to provide a fund. Under the scheme I suggest the Commonwealth would have power to subsidize any fund most liberally, and by more than one-third, if that were thought advisable, so long as the principle of self-help, and contributions from the people, is admitted. It is important that I should know whether, in dealing with this Bill, I am dealing with a proposed fund of £1,500,000 or of £1,000,000, whether I am talking of a scheme which will cost Tasmania £60,000 a year, or will be able to say to the electors and the Government of that State that the cost to them will be only £40,000 a year. We are asked to deal with an enormous sum, and the more we can reduce it the more popular the proposal will be with those who have to provide the money, although I admit it will not be so popular with those who will receive the pension.

                            <para>- Certainly it would not, but would not the possession of property of that value be a reason for reducing the pension? Surely it would? My honorable friend's idea of liberality is likely to lead to the scheme adopted being made so generous as to be unsound, and that would kill it altogether. I would ask the honorable senator whether he has ever heard the old axiom, " Save me from my friends." Every one is in favour of the establishment of some system of old-age pensions, but the difficulty is to get the money. We are here dealing with an attempt to provide the funds., and we have interjections made by honorable senators of the Labour Party, who seem to believe that all we need do is to provide for a pension of 10s. per week, and get the necessary funds from the pockets of the taxpayers in any way we possibly can. I do not hold that to be my duty as a senator. The Commission further say - </para>

                    <para class="block">I quite believe in that, but should there not also be a penalty on the pensioner who spends his pension in drink. I think the Commission have made a little omission in this respect. I take it that when we are dealing with the establishment of old-age pensions we shall deal with that matter in a drastic manner. We certainly do not desire to give a pension of 10s. per week to any old man or woman in the Commonwealth for the benefit of the publican, or to increase the revenue from spirits. I do not know how this very important matter is to be submitted to. the electors, but I shall, in Committee, endeavour to have some leading features inserted in the Bill in order that the people may know exactly what it means. I expect that my honorable friends opposite will not deny me the right to be able to tell the electors of Tasmania whether the scheme proposed will cost £1, 500, 000 or £1, 000, 000. If the total subsidy paid by the States were under £1,000,000 it would still be a noble and generous contribution, but apparently we are going to allow mechanics earning £3, £4, and , £410s. per week to contribute nothing. I have not had time to go into the drink bill and the tobacco bill, but in view of the consumption of drink and tobacco, it is idle to tell me that the workmen of Australia could not contribute for such a purpose the sum of £1 4s.10d. a year. It is silly, and I wonder at my honorable friend uttering such a statement. </para>

                        <para>. - If I could presume to measure the feeling of honorable senators by reference to my own, I should say that the time is rapidly approaching when the strain which the Government is putting upon the Senate to discuss measures of vast importance is almost more than can be borne. I certainly have that feeling in regard to this Bill, and I express it all the more emphatically because, in my opinion, the ingenuity of its construction is scarcely less than, devilish. If such an adjective be deemed too strong, I shall make a modification to the extent of saying that it seems to me to be derivative rather than, humanly speaking, original. I suppose that there is not a single debatable point about which honorable senators have more diverging views than that which is the chief feature of the Bill. It raises first the great debatable question of old-age pensions ;secondly, the source from which the fund should be derived; thirdly, the question whether, in order to produce that laudable result, we should adopt direct or indirect taxation - for instance, whether we ought, as some honorable senators strongly advocate, to impose a tax on land. It also necessarily brings up a question which was debated more or less openly in public for many years before Federation was inaugurated, and that is whether the operation of the Braddon section would cripple and hamper the financial resources of the Commonwealth. It further raises a question of the gravest importance to the smaller States, and that is whether there should be retained in the Constitution some safeguard which would insure to them a reasonable proportion of the indirect taxation which is entirely in the hands of the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- It was more than that. I venture to say that there is not one section in the Constitution,, as it stands to-day, which attracted more attention, which was the subject of more earnest and deliberate debate in the Convention,, than the Braddon provision. The history of the last Convention, the history of the proceedings which took place prior to the inauguration of Federation, practically centred round the very provision which is now being attacked. To me it is scarcely conceivable that any honorable senator who comes from a small State - especially a small State in, a financial sense - can consent to allow this Parliament to begin to do something which would rob that State of its chief financial safeguard. As I do not wish to inflict figures upon the Senate at any great length, and as I do not care to use them except when it seems to me to be absolutely necessary, I propose at once to quote some figures with regard to a matter which I think it is my duty to bring before honorable senators. It has been urged within my hearing that, if Tasmania objects to a repeal or modification of the Braddon section, it can only do so on the ground that it is unwilling to resort to some scheme of equitable taxation, which ought to take the place of the indirect taxation, in the form of Customs and Excise duties ; in other words, that its Parliament ought to make some endeavour to get back such money as it may fail to get under the Braddon provision. There is no State in the Commonwealth which is in such an excellent position to answer such a charge as is Tasmania. An almost conclusive answer may be given in one statement from the Budget papers which were laid upon the table of the House of Assembly of Tasmania only a few weeks ago. The total amount of the Commonwealth revenue returned to the State for the last financial year was £256,301, while the direct taxation imposed by the State Parliament yielded £248,799. In other words, Tasmania is raising by direct taxation almost the same amount as she gets from the Commonwealth in respect of Customs and Excise duties. </para>

                            <para>- I have accounted for all the items of direct taxation, and any honorable senator may attribute what he likes to Tattersall's. But it must be perfectly obvious to every one that not much is included in the total sum,. I venture to ask any honorable senator to offer a comparison from the Budget papers of his own State. I have no fear of this statement being contradicted : that no State in the Commonwealth can show anything like such, a proportion in revenue between direct taxation and indirect taxation as can Tasmania. If I were to take the case of Western Australia - and. of course, I am speaking without having before me the figures - probably I should find that the revenue from indirect taxation is at least double the revenue from direct taxation. </para>

                            <para>- I am glad to hear that it is, because, if so, I shall not be accused of raising an argument unfairly. Speaking of the other five States, without singling out Western Australia, I . venture to say that it would be found that the revenue from direct taxation is certainly not more than one-half the revenue from the Customs and Excise duties. Those items of the Tasmanian revenue ought to be considered in conjunction with her expenditure. I desire to show the effect of Federation upon Tasmania's expenditure during the last few years. In 1900, under State control, the revenue from Customs and Excise duties amounted to £492,000. The decrease in revenue from that source has been continuous under the Commonwealth. In 1901 it was £373,000; in 1902, £360,000; in 1903, £342.000; in 1904, £330,000; and in 1905,£326,000. </para>

                            <para>- Possibly. In 1900 the expenses in connexion with our post and telegraph services amounted to £86,000, as against a revenue of £97,000; while last year the expenses amounted to £120,800, as compared with a revenue of £118,000, showing that, under the Federal management, the Department has been worked at a loss, instead of a small gain. In 1900, under State control - perhaps because we starved our Defence Forces - our expenditure on defence was £17,900; whereas last year, under the Commonwealth, it amounted to £40,135. It can be little wonder to any honorable senator, even though he comes from another State that he should be asked by me to give deliberate consideration to the condition of Tasmania's finances. Such a request, of course, it is unnecessary for me to make to any representative of the State. I do not wish to' say anything harsh about <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> ; but I do ask him to make some effort, if he can, to justify - because the point will be raised - his voting, not for other proposals which have gone by, but for a provision which, if adopted, he must know, as well as I do, would seriously affect the finances of Tasmania. I hope that,. before the Bill is passed, if not before it is taken into Committee, he will offer some remarks on that point. I admit that he may have a ready defence, which, however, I hope he will not use, because to use it would be to put every other honorable senator in an unfair position. He might say that, with a full recognition of the position, he deliberately decides to take away from Tasmania a possibility of raising revenue, in order to provide for a system, of old-age pensions. That is the difficulty with which we are confronted, and that, I repeat, is the devilish, -ingenuity of the scheme. There is not a single man in the Senate who does not recognise that he is going to be put. in a false position, do what he may, with regard to this Bill. There is not a possibility of the most ardent member of the Labour Party, or, for that matter, of any honorable senator on this side of the Chamber, whom the members of the Labour Party ma.v consider to be their chief antithesis, getting out of the difficulty created bv the Bill. The honorable senator, who is most anxious to provide an old-age pensions scheme, will have to admit, if he is challenged for voting for the Bill, that in order to provide it he has agreed to tax tea and kerosene. Many honorable senators have distinctly, deliberately, and plainly refused to sanction duties on tea and kerosene, because they decline to put taxes upon poor people. Yet if we vote for this Bill, we shall be liable to be charged with having deliberately taxed those people who are least able in the Commonwealth to bear taxation. If, on the other hand, we vote against it, what will be said? We all know that there are difficulties in the way of providing old-age pensions. Every one realizes that. But if we do not accept this method it will be said, " When some means were suggested whereby the difficulties could be overcome you refused to take advantage of them." What is the position of men in this Senate who have been accused, rightly or wrongly, of being opposed to the scheme altogether? Their position is even worse. They will be told at once, "You took the first and easiest opportunity of finding an excuse for refusing to grant old-age pensions. You were not bold enough to say you were against the whole scheme, but you took advantage of this particular Bill, because you alleged it interfered with the ' Braddon blot,' to vote against it." I say that that charge would be a most unfair one. There is not a single member of this Senate against whom it could be made with fairness and justice. But nevertheless that is the position in which the Government places us by asking us to pass this Bill. There are many other reasons why the Bill should be opposed. Let us come to a salient feature of it. It is proposed to allocate 'Special duties foi a special purpose. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> said, and I believe he spoke with accuracy, that no parallel to such a' provision can be found in any part of the world where the English tongue is spoken. No such parallel has been shown, and I venture to say that there is none within the recollection of any honorable senator. If only on the ground that the principle of allocating special duties for special purposes is inherently bad, and impossible to justify, I do not believe that any honorable senator will rise in his place to defend it. If such a defendant is found, then this is a criticism that can be applied at once and rightly - if we are going to allocate special duties for a special purpose, why does not the Government state in the Bill what the special duties and the special purpose are? If it be desirable to allocate duties on ten, and kerosene for this purpose, we have to admit that they would be largely paid by the poorer persons in the community. Whether we approve of such duties or not for revenue purposes, no one can gainsay that their effect is to press with severity on the poorer classes. But why should tea and kerosene be chosen? Is there no item in the whole range of our Tariff exemptions that offers some slight justification for selection except tea and kerosene? I can instance one - not that I should vote for it or approve of it, though I say that if we are going to specialize we should do so in the direction of some luxury. It is obvious that one article which might be mentioned is stimulants. There would be just a shadow of a pretext for saving that if that were proposed it would be taxing the drink of the people; but the reply would be that it was being taxed to provide for persons, many of whom require old-age pensions because of drink. On that point no one can offer any firm denial . But, as I have said, specialize where you like and how you will, the principle is a wrong one, and we have no right to adopt it. But I have to look at this matter from yet another aspect. We all recognise that this Bill is an attempt, whether for good motives or bad, to impose upon four States in the Commonwealth the will of the Federal Parliament. We know that at present there are two States that have old-age pensions systems. We recognise that there are difficulties in regard to an old-age pensions scheme unless it is made Federal. I admit that. We recognise that it is desirable that an old-age pensions scheme should have an application over the whole Commonwealth. No one will, venture to deny that. But, admirable as such a scheme may be, desirable as it may be from that point of view, it is quite another thing when the Federal Parliament puts itself in the position of saying that four States have not passed legislation which, in its opinion, they ought to have passed - in other words, have not provided old-age pensions - and that we therefore take upon ourselves to pass such a measure as will compel them to do it. </para>

                            <para>- It was put there for a laudable purpose, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> will recognise that the Constitution does not provide that we should break one section of it in order to give effect to another. The Constitution was intended by its framers to be read as one whole. But if we are going to give old-age pensions, there are many_ other ways of doing it than that now proposed. It is not impossible to obtain a sufficient sum out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund. But I cannot conceive of any scheme for getting over the difficulty - which I most readily admit - that deserves more severe condemnation than the one now before us. The Braddon section was put in the Constitution, as we all know, to protect the smaller States. But the figures I have quoted have, at any rate, justified any honorable senator who heard me in coming to the conclusion that Tasmania, not to mention Queensland and other .States, mav one day be in great and dire necessities with regard to the amount of revenue which she receives from Customs and Excise. The day mav come when Tasmania, or some other State, may say, " Much as we regret it, we have to urge our representatives in the Federal Parliament to get us more revenue." I am not saying whether that is right or wrong. I have certain views, which it would be needless for me to mention now. with respect to the revenue. But we h'a.ve to face facts as we find them; and we find that this Bill proposes to take away from the smaller States the one spec.cial safeguard that the framers of the Constitution gave to them. I cannot help referring to another aspect. Can any member ofl the Senate deny that this Bill is framed in the vaguest possible way ? We understand from what the Minister has said, and from our general knowledge, that it is intended to tax tea and kerosene in order to provide funds for old-age pensions. </para>

                            <para>- I accept that answer gladly. My reply to it is that 'this scheme is bad enough if it has the clear and definite object of providing the money for old-age pensions bv taxing tea and kerosene. But if the Minister admits that the Bill does not say that at all, and that we are asked to take steps to pass a Bill which will enable the Federal- Parliament to tax anything whatever that is not mentioned in the Tariff, for any purpose whatever that the Federal Parliament or the Executive may at any time decide, he adds further condemnation to the Bill. He does nothing to justify it, because he makes it more vague. Is it a justification to Parliament that the more the motive of a Bill is concealed, the more it is desirable to pass it ? That is not mv idea of a Bill ; and it is for this reason that I have endeavoured, as every honorable senator should endeavour, to direct my criticism to the object that is clearly implied and understood in connexion with the Bill. I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> will not justify it by saying that it is even vaguer than it purports to be. </para>

There are no other items that any member of the Senate can name, unless <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> can throw light on the subject. But if we approach this subject in a business-like way, we ought to be told by the Government whether, in their opinion, duties on tea and kerosene would yield sufficient revenue to provide pensions to the extent of £1,500,000. Has the Minister indicated any particular duties that will be sufficient to raise that revenue? I have seen a number of estimates made, based on the taxation of tea and kerosene, and, while I cannot guarantee the accuracy of them, nor even venture to make an estimate myself, I do believe that it can be safely assumed that a duty of 3d. per lb. on tea and 6d. per gallon on kerosene will not raise anything like £1,500,000. </para>

There is nothing else left to be taxed, and are we to be forced to the conclusion that, if this is a business proposition, we shall have to face the possibility of a duty of 6d. per . lb. on tea and a duty; of1s. per gallon on kerosene? I venture to say that, if Ministers were bold enough to make a statement to that effect - if they were bold enough to say that they had gone into the question, and had decided to raise the £.1,500,000 by such duties - this Bill would be defeated on the second reading by an enormous majority. </para>

                            <para>- Even if we grant, that a duty on tea may for all time operate as a revenue duty - though that is not certain - it is extremely debatable whether a duty on kerosene would also produce revenue for all time. It is not only true that we may produce kerosene ourselves, in which case a duty of1s. per gallon, would prove to be largely protective, instead of revenue-producing ; but it is a. fact, as disclosed in a recent debate, that in a short time there may be found some substitute for kerosene. Only a few days ago I expressed the opinion that a most promising industrial opening in the Commonwealth was the production of alcohol: at such cheap rates as to make it likely that it will largely supplant kerosene. If that hope be realized - and no one in, the Senate would fail to be glad if it were - the revenue from the kerosene duties would be a diminishing quantity. What would then happen to the old-age pensions scheme? Are the Government prepared to tell the old-age pensioners that the kerosene duties having failed to produce revenue, there are no other sources of taxation to which we can resort? </para>

                            <para>- That is a poor justification for breaking the Commonwealth Constitution - for doing something which will undoubtedly hamper and make still more difficult the work of the States in financing their affairs. Moreover, I venture to say that this is a proposal which will never see the light of day. Does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> or any one else believe that if direct taxation be resorted to for this purpose it will be merely as an auxiliary? If it be agreed that direct taxation ought to provide the means for old-age pensions, we may be certain that Parliament will not make two bites at that sort of cherry. If Parliament once decides that direct taxation must supply the needs, it will definitely, finally, and conclusively decide that direct taxation must provide all sufficient funds for the purpose. I do not wish to dwell any longer on that aspect, but it is one which ought to be seriously considered. If any honorable senator thinks that by voting for this Bill, in spite of his strong objections to taxing the articles used by the poor, he will succeed in establishing old-age pensions,  I  tell him that he will lamentably fail in his object. He will fail by a long way, and his efforts will simply result in gross injustice and unfair treatment. </para>

                            <para>- I repeat that an honorable senator who votes for the Bill will find that he has committed an act of gross unfairness and injustice to the class whose interests he desires to promote, and, at the same time, he . will miserably fail to give them any sort of compensation in the form of old-age pensions. How much revenue does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe</inline> imagine would be derived in Tasmania from a duty on tea and kerosene? How much would Tasmania have to provide for an old-age pensions scheme? 'If the honorable senator will consider those two questions, he will find that there' would be created a deficit with which it would be impossible to cope. Unless tea and kerosene were taxed beyond all reason, there would be ludicrous failure to provide sufficient money for any such scheme for. Tasmania. Will <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe</inline> allow this Bill to fool him - to allow the delusive, hopes of the Ministry to trap him into imposing a duty which otherwise he would absolutely refuse to impose? </para>

                            <para>- When I quarrel with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe</inline> on "the floor of the Senate, I can assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie that both <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe</inline> and myself will be quite able to look after our own affairs, without his intervention. It is quite open to any honorable senator to charge the Government with using this Bill as an electioneering placard. Whether that charge be true or not, any honorable senator, under the circumstances, would be justified in taking that view. The Government will doubtless say that for five years the Federal Parliament have played with this most important question of old-age pensions, and that no Government, until they came into power, proved itself capable of offering a solution. They will point to the various Governments which have been in power, previously, and I have no hesitation in saying that they will emphasize the fact that when the Labour Party was in office, with all its enthusiasm, nothing was done to promote old-age pensions. But this <inline font-style="italic">deus ex machina</inline> - this heaven-gifted Ministry - is the one Ministry to ask the electors to send them back to power with sufficient support to carry such measures as this ! </para>

If I am satisfied however, that that hope will never be realized, as a consequence of this measure, why should I say, " More credit to the Government?" I say that no Ministry has any right to attempt to delude those who are looking for old-age pensions into the belief that they will get them under the operation of the Bill we are now asked to pass.

                            <para>- The time has not yet come when I am asked to agree to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart's</inline> scheme. But if I might venture to guess what it is, I say that the time is rapidly coming when we shall all of us have to deal with the basis of the system of finance as between the Federation and the States, and will have to overhaul and entirely alter the existing conditions. To that extent I am in entire agreement with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart.</inline> Whether in the process of overhauling we shall be found acting together is quite another question. I agree with the honorable senator, as every other member of the Senate must be forced to do, that the time is almost imminent when we shall have to give far more serious consideration to the financial questions of immense importance which confront us than the present Government have done, or have given us the opportunity to do during the closing days of the session. This Bill, and another which was before us, are merely miserable, contemptible make-shifts for postponing the consideration of the financial question. They are deserving of no more consideration than should be given to a temporary expedient. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> will not assert that this Bill is any more than a temporary expedient, or that it will solve the question. </para>

If I can gather anything from his interjection, it means that he knows a great deal more than he will tell the Senate, and I think it is his duty to give us the information which he is prepared to communicate to the electors. Whatever the Minister has to say to the electors, I' shall be unable to tell them anything concerning this Bill which will be satisfactory, and I have not yet heard any honorable senator speak to the measure who will be able to do so, unless we except <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford,</inline> and there was nothing in his remarks which would be con.sidered very satisfactory by the electors. At the risk of repeating what I said on another occasion, I have to say that I think the Senate should resent, with some effect and purpose, the conduct of the Government in asking us to deal with the financial Question in such a piecemeal way, and at a time when they know that proper consideration cannot be given to it. At the risk of an interjection from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford.</inline> I have to say that this measure, again,, is bound up with the 'Braddon section, and also with the bookkeeping provisions. The Government is once more tinkering with the whole business, and doing nothing that will be permanent; nothing, in fact, but shelving the solution of the difficulty. We are going, by this measure, to impose upon the ignorance and credulity of the electors, and we must confess ourselves unable to understand what, as members of the Federal Parliament, we should have at our fingers' ends. That is the position in which the Ministry are placing us. I ask every member of the Senate, unless he is clear as to what this Bill will lead to, and can approve of' the object, both as to the methods and results, to do his utmost to have the measure rejected. </para>

                        <para>. - - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons,</inline> in an interesting speech, has said that he anticipates that, at the coming elections, hard things will be said of honorable senators who vote against this Bill. Although he and I will be voting on opposite sides, and standing on opposite platforms, if we both seek reelection in Tasmania, I can give him my word that I shall not say anything harsh about him, or about any other member of the Senate who is opposed to me on this Bill. Surely we can give each other credit for honest convictions on the question of old-age pensions? I believe that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> were, satisfied that the necessary revenue could be raised without injury to Tasmania, .and believed in old-age pensions, he would vote for the Bill. At present, I do not remember whether the honorable senator Has declared himself in favour of, or against, old-age pensions. Amongst those who have so declared themselves, is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake,</inline> who, last night, said that we all had the question at heart, and believe that old-age pensions should be established as soon as possible - if a scheme can be adopted which will be consistent with the requirements of the different States. Old-age pension schemes are in operation in two of the States, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> asked why the Parliaments of the other States did not raise the necessary funds. I do not know what difficulty presents itself in Queensland against the raising of a fund for this purpose, but in Tasmania there is an insuperable bar to the raising of such a fund. Even if that State were not suffering from financial difficulties </para>

                            <para>- -Th -The Constitution has given the Federal Parliament the power to impose taxation upon the people of Tasmania, and, possibly, some of the taxation now imposed through Customs and Excise does not find favour with many people in that State. We cannot quarrel with that, however, because the majority of the people, in accepting, the Constitution, agreed that the Federal Parliament should have the power to deal with the matter. That is, I think, a very pertinent answer to the' interjection. Surely the Parliament of the Commonwealth is not exceeding its province in projecting a scheme to raise the necessary money? If, as I believe, the majority of the members in each House - and I believe I can include <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> in the number - are in favour of establishing a Federal scheme of old-age pensions, then what we have to consider is, how can the money be raised. I admit that in the case of Tasmania it becomes a very serious question. Although I recognise that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> is quite honest and fair in objecting to the proposal owing to the financial position of' the State, still he should give me credit for sincerity of conviction and honesty of purpose when I state that, in voting for the Bill, after weighing the advantages against the disadvantages, I shall be doing the right thing in the interests of its people, and one to which they will not object when" they thoroughly understand the position. </para>

                            <para>- T - The other point will be decided at the elections, when it may be a burning question. I propose to vote in a direction in which I have spoken for six or seven years. I have been waiting until I am tired of waiting for an opportunity to give a vote in the direction of finding the money for a system of old-age pensions, even although the scheme proposed does not quite come up to my ideal. We cannot possibly provide the fund out of" the surplus now returnable to the States without doing an injury to at least two States. Certainly Tasmania could not afford to provide £68,000 a year for that purpose. </para>

It will be remembered that when the Tariff was sent up to the Senate, it provided for a duty of 3d. per lb. on tea, and 3d. per gallon on kerosene. It has been estimated that, if imposed, a duty of 3d. per lb. on tea and 6d. per gallon on kerosene would yield between £700,000 and £800,000 to the Commonwealth. </para>

I do not think that I need be asked to consider what amount Tasmania would raise by the imposition of Customs duties on tea and kerosene. The question is whether, by the imposition of such duties throughout the Commonwealth, and by the levying of a direct land tax, we could make up a revenue of £1,500.000 for the purpose of providing old-age pensions. </para>

                            <para>- T - That argument has been done to death. My honorable friend leaves it to be understood that, if the Government were empowered to impose special duties on tea and kerosene for a special purpose, the taxation would fall upon the poor old people who were intended to get the benefit of the legislation. That is a hollow argument. Is it only those persons who use tea and kerosene? Do not a very large proportion of the population, of Australia use them ? And would they not also have to pay the duties, if imposed ? What proportion of the total population would 'be entitled to old-age pensions? I suppose that, after deducting the infants under a certain ace.90 per cent, of the population are heavy tea-drinkers, and that probably 50 per cent, use kerosene, and therefore would pay the duty,' if imposed. </para>

                            <para>- I - It appears to me to be perfectly clear that almost every one of the people who will derive benefit from an old-age pensions scheme will pay their share towards it. Ninety per cent. of them use tea, and a very large proportion consume kerosene. Another argument used against what is proposed is that the time is not opportune. When will it be Opportune? I do not like to say it, but I am somewhat doubtful of the sincerity of those who profess to believe in old-age pensions, and yet, when any definite scheme is put before them, say that they are opposed to it because it is not opportune. If we desire to see a Federal old-age pensions scheme established, we ought not to allow any small obstacles to stand in the way. We ought, indeed, to be willing to forego some of our- opinions as to the way in which the money should be realized, in order to secure the great end we have in view. The argument used by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons,</inline> that he is opposed  to  placing taxes on tea  and  kerosene for this particular purpose, seems to me to be absurd in view of the fact that in the next breath -he said that he was in favour of old-age pensions, and would pay them on the security of the revenue. How would he propose to raise that revenue?  His  arguments seem to me to be mutually destructive of each other. I fancy that the honorable senator's zeal to defeat this measure has led him into a position that cannot be logically maintained </para>

                            <para>- Tha That is a very big question, upon which mv honorable friend and I might argue until Christmas without coming any nearer to an agreement. While the primary purpose of the land tax advocated by the Federal Labour Party is to assist. in breaking up large estates, I also" think that it would, for a time at any rate, raise a certain amount of revenue - probably £500,000 a year, which, in addition to the £750,000 estimated to be derived from tea and kerosene, would ma'ke up about the amount required - according to the estimate of the Old-Age Pensions Commission - for the purpose we have in view. I confess that I should have preferred that some other means had been projected by the Government for finding the money. </para>

The difference between the honorable senator and myself is that I believe we should gain a great deal more revenue bv nationalizing the tobacco industry than we derive from it through Customs and Excise under private ownership, and that that difference would go a considerable way towards paying old-age pensions. That is" why I have said that I should favour other means of raising the revenue than that projected by the Government. Does my honorable friend agree with me in that? </para>

Senators Dobson, Macfarlane, and Clemons tell me plainly what sources of revenue they would prefer. If they do not, though I do not like to question their sincerity, I must be pardoned for saying that people outside will be excusable if they question the sincerity of any man who says, " I want old-age pensions as soon as we can get them," but who, when you ask him from what source he proposes to raise the money, gives you no definite answer, except that he would take it from the Consolidated Revenue. I am quite sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> would never agree to- take the money from the Consolidated Revenue as it stands at present. Would he; agree that the £250,000 returned to Tasmania from Customs and Excise should be decreased by £68,000 for the purposes of old-age pensions ? </para>

                            <para>- A - Any sum that is taken from the Consolidated Revenue for this purpose will necessarily decrease the amount returnable to Tasmania. It is because I believe that the Treasurer of Tasmania has sufficient difficulties in his path already that I am not favorable to any policy which would decrease that . revenue. I therefore favour giving the people an opportunity, by referendum, to intrust the Federal Parliament with authority to tax special articles for this special purpose. And, after all, any proposal for taxing tea and kerosene - or, indeed, any other article - must be passed by Parliament. It cannot be agreed to otherwise. We have been talking for five years in the Federal Parliament at one time and another about the necessity for granting old-age pensions: These Commonwealth old-age pensions are intended to take the place of the pensions now paid in New South Wales and Victoria, and to make similar provision throughout the States. , I can say that I am thoroughly tired of advocating old-age pensions, both on the platform and in this Parliament, without taking some definite step to establish them : and this is absolutely the first time I have had an opportunity to vote on the direct question. It is true that the Bill does not mention the exact purposes to which this revenue shall be applied, and, perhaps, it would be better if it were stated in the Bill that the intention is to establish old-age pensions. I am not altogether in love with the means proposed for raising the revenue, but, like a great many people in Australia I aim prepared in this matter to take half a loaf rather than no bread. Even if we allow the truth of all the statements we have heard about the cruelty of such taxation to poor people, T believe that the community generally will be quite, willing to pay their share, provided the burden is equally distributed, in order to make provision for our aged poor. Last night <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> mentioned that at the expiration of four years the Braddon section will cease to operate, thereby inferring that this question should be postponed until then, and the necessary money provided out of the Consolidated Revenue. </para>

                            <para>- I k I know that if Parliament so decides, the Braddon section, at the expiration of three years, will cease to operate. I hope and .believe, however, that there will be substituted fixed payments, or some other plan, so as to insure that the finances of the States shall not be suddenly and entirely disorganized. I believe that in the opinion of the large- majority of the members of the F'ederal Parliament, the States should continue to have returned to them some proportion of the Customs and Excise revenue; and it appears to me that there is not a great deal of difference between discussing this question now and discussing it three or four years hence. Whilst I certainly should have preferred some other method of raising the revenue, I welcome the Bill as a definite attempt to deal with a question which ought to have been dealt with loner ago. I think the Government are honest in their intention when they argue that a very considerable proportion qf the necessary revenue may be obtained if the power sought by the Bill be conferred. It is not said by the Government that the special tax on the two articles, which" have been mentioned, will provide the whole of the necessary funds; and to the Government of the day must be left the duty of providing the balance. Mv own hope is that that balance may be obtained by the imposition of a duty on the unimproved value of land, with an exemption of £5,000. I believe that from those two sources sufficient revenue would be obtained; and I support the second reading of the Bill as an honest attempt to deal with a matter which has agitated the nub.lic mind for a considerable time. </para>

                        <para>. - I yield to no one in my belief in the principle of direct taxation ; and I sympathize very much with the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart.</inline> I have always advocated that the Commonwealth should resort to direct, rather than1 indirect, taxation for the purpose of meeting the additional charge caused by the institution of old-age pensions. But we have to face facts and not theories. There is not a considerable body of members of the Commonwealth Parliament who are prepared to impose such direct taxation as would raise the money necessary for the payment of old-age pensions ; and, that being so, we must drop theories and come to some practical issue. Much as I should have liked to see the revenue raised by direct taxation, I find that that is impracticable. There is now a proposal for an alteration in the Constitution in order to get over the difficulty created by the Braddon section, and to enable the Commonwealth Government to have at their disposal sufficient money to carry out the scheme which is contemplated. First, I may say that I am strongly against the ear-marking of special taxation for special purposes. I do not recognise, however, that this Bill does, ear-mark any special revenue. It certainly gives the Government power to impose duties on articles which are not subject to duty on the 1st January, 1907, but the revenue so produced will be paid into the Consolidated Revenue, and section 87 of the Constitution will not apply. It is a mistake to assume, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe</inline> and others seem to assume, that in voting for this Bill we are ear-marking revenue for old-age pensions - that is not the case. If I thought it was the case, or if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe's</inline> suggestion was acted upon, and that purpose was stated in the measure, I should vote against it. If we ear-mark revenue for special purposes, the particular class who happen to pay this tax, have their interests put in opposition to those of people who receive the benefit of old-age pensions. If the Government have made up their minds to pay old-age pensions, those pensions should be paid irrespective qf any particular section of the taxpayers. It is altogether an unsound and unwise principle in finance to ear-mark special duties for special purposes. </para>

                            <para>- I think not. There is nothing in the Bill to indicate that the revenue raised is for the purpose of old-age pensions. Every purpose is a special purpose - every new expenditure is a special purpose - and, therefore, the phrase means nothing in this connexion. The Royal' Commission 011 old-age pensions, of which I was a member, did not inquire into the advisability of paying such pensions, but took it for granted that the people of the Commonwealth were in favour of the principle. The inquiry was limited to the most economical methods of administration ; and I claim that as one of the results of the work of the Royal Commission, it has been found possible to effect a saving of some £8,000 per annum in the Pensions Department of New South Wales. The evidence- given as to the administration in New South Wales and Victoria, showed that in the former State there was a most wasteful method ; and the saving to which I have indicated must be laid to the credit of the Commission. Those engaged in the inquiry were face to face with the difficulty of financing the scheme, and if- honorable senators will turn to page <inline font-style="italic">i</inline> 1 of the report of the Royal Commission, paragraph 16, they will find this recommendation - </para>

                        <para>As "the best means to be adopted for establishing Old-age Pensions for the Commonwealth," your Commissioners recommend that the pensions be paid out of the Consolidated Revenue. Various suggestions have been made by the different witnesses who have given evidence as to the sources from which additional revenue may be derived. These suggestions include a wages stamp tax, duties on tea and kerosene, an absentee tax, a tax on unimproved land values, a Government monopoly of the tobacco industry, additional duties on intoxicants and matches, and a tax on amusements. </para>
                        <para>Your Commissioners recommend that during the operation of section 87 of the Constitution, which provides for the return by the Commonwealth to the States of at least three-fourths of the nett revenue from Customs and Excise duties, an arrangement should be made by the Commonwealth with the several States by which sufficient money should be handed over to the Commonwealth for the purpose of making good any deficiency in the Consolidated Revenue caused by the establishment of an old-age pension system. </para>

                    <para class="block">Honorable senators will notice that we did not recommend any of the suggestions for raising revenue which were brought before us. We purposely avoided doing so, for the very cogent reason that, by the establishment of a Commonwealth old-age pension scheme, New South Wales would be relieved of expenditure to the extent of £500,000, and Victoria to the extent of a little over .£200,000. Although there are no old-age pensions schemes under tha' name in the other States, in every one of them, apart from charitable institutions and grants, systems are in operation in the nature of old-age pensions, and there was abundant evidence before the Commission to prove that the establishment of a Commonwealth system would relieve each of the States of expenditure to the extent of some thousands of pounds. In the circumstances, we thought it would be a better plan to allow the Commonwealth, to retain from the three-fourths of revenue from Customs and Excise now returned to the States a sum sufficient to pay Commonwealth old-age pensions, and the States Parliament might, by using their powers of direct taxation, or in any other method they thought fit, make up any deficiency, if any were created. I point out that if that plan were adopted, New South Wales, so far from having to meet a deficiency, would make a considerable saving. </para>

That proposition made by the Royal Commission came before the States Premiers and Treasurers at the Conference held in Sydney in April, 1906, and was fully discussed by them. It was a- tangible, concrete proposition, and the result of their discussion of it, which will be found at page 34 of the report of the proceedings of the Conference, was that the following motion, submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kidston,</inline> was agreed to : - </para>

                            <para>- It is significant to note that all through th'e discussion of the matter at the Conference taxes upon tea. and kerosene were mentioned as suitable for this purpose. I should make an exception of the Premier of Tasmania, Captain Evans, who declared himself against the suggestion, not because he objected to taxation upon those articles, but because he considered that the financial condition of his State was such that the revenue which would be derived from such taxation was more urgently required in Tasmania for other State purposes than for the payment of old-age pensions. </para>

                            <para>- But every one of them discussed the question of the taxation of tea and kerosene, and Captain Evans, of Tasmania, on the ground I have stated, was the only member of the Conference who raised any objection to that taxation. There appears to be a considerable misapprehension as to what would actually be received from the taxation of these articles. I have gone to the trouble of getting the Customs returns for 1905, and working out the imports of" those articles, in order to find out what might be realized from their taxation. I find that the imports of tea for 1905 amounted to 28,353,903 lbs. The imports of kerosene for the same year were 16,41.6,734 gallons. I have found also that a .duty of 4d. in the. lb. on tea represents an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty  nf  about 60 per cent, on the declared value of the article at the Customs House. A tax of 4d. per gallon on kerosene represents an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty of 60 per cent, on the declared value of kerosene at the Customs House. I remind honorable senators that the returns given by the Commissioner are based upon the imports for 1904. I find that a duty of 3d. per lb. </para>

                    <para>On tea <inline font-style="italic">on the</inline> imports for 1905 would produce a revenue of £.154,423 ; and a duty  Of  3d. per gallon on kerosene a revenue of £205,209, or a total revenue of £559,632. Fourpence in the lb. on tea, which would be a dutv of 60 per cent, <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem,</inline> as I have explained, would realize £472.564: and 4d. per gallon on kerosene £306,945, or a. total of £779,509. A tax of $d. per lb. on tea and 5&lt;3. per gallon on kerosene was suggested by some of the witnesses who came before the Royal Commission, and 5d. per lb. on tea would realize £590,705, whilst 5d. per gallon on kerosene would realize £408,681, or a total revenue of £999,386. I wish, in justice to my own State, to direct the attention of honorable senators to a singular position which would be created if these special duties were imposed. The Western Australian imports of tea represent one-tenth of the total imports of the article, so that if the tax imposed on tea were 4d. per lb. Western Australia would contribute £47.256. Western Australia's imports of kerosene represent one-eleventh of the total imports, and that State would contribute £27,904 if a duty of 4d. per gallon were imposed on that article. This would give a total contribution from Western Australia of £75,160. <inline font-style="italic">Coghlan</inline> estimates that on 30th June, 1904, taking New South Wales, and New Zealand experience, the number of eligible persons who would claim old-age pensions in Western Australia was 1,677. and £23 16s. per head of this number would represent £40,000, the amount which would have to be devoted annually to the payment of old-age pensions in that State. So that the taxpayers of Western Australia would be contributing through taxation on tea' and kerosene £75,160, and receiving in the shape of old-age pensions only £40,000. </para>

                            <para>- I recognise that possibly old people in the eastern States might be the parents of children in Western Australia, and I therefore do not think that we should ask that the bookkeeping provisions should be applied to the old-age pensions fund. I have, however, thought it only fair to my State to point out that the special taxation suggested would hit that State more heavily than her pension requirements would necessitate. According to the Budget papers circulated by the Treasurer, it is estimated that, in the coming year, of the one-fourth of Customs and Excise revenue which may be applied to meet new expenditure, including the amount required for penny postage, there will be a surplus in the case of Western Australia of £311,228. It is true that penny postage is estimated to cost £200,000, but no practical politician will, contend that that proposal is likely to pass this session. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know what has happened within the last half-hour, but there is very little chance of the proposal being dealt with this session. This would give us a surplus of £511,228, and in Western Australia we should be able to meet the expenditure involved by an old-age pensions scheme out of our existing revenue. In view of the passing of this Bill to provide for the levying of special duties of Customs, I have taken the trouble to look through our import returns, and I find that tea and kerosene are by no means the only articles upon which we should be justified in levying duties for the purpose of making up any deficit which might be caused by the payment of old-age pensions. I have picked out twenty or thirty items, representing over £10,000,000, but I only propose to take six items, representing nearly £3,000,000 in value. Under the head of " apparel," there are on the force list various items, the annual imports of which amount in value to £211,324. </para>

                            <para>- No ; the largest item is dynamite, which represents over. £300,000. I do not wish to be regarded, as advocating the imposition of a duty on these articles. I am only citing them as articles which, perhaps, it would be as justifiable to tax as tea and kerosene. The other items are - Bags and sacks, £841,000; books, £445,286. </para>

                            <para>- I suppose that the man who was nearest to the animal would prefer to have free tea. Another item is cameo's and precious stones, the imports of which amount to £103,000. Here is a singular item, which I wonder my protectionist friends allowed to slip - perhaps it is another tribute to the power of the press - and that is printing paper and paper n.e.i., amounting to no less than £718,514. </para>

                            <para>- Perhaps not. There is a number of other items which I could quote, but I only picked out the items over- £100,000, amounting in the total to £2,845,396. A tax of 10 per cent. on that sum would realize £284,500. On looking through' the free list, I saw a number of articles which did not seem to me to be raw material. and which could justifiably be taxed if indirect taxation for this purpose can be justified. I know that arguments could be brought against every one of the lines, but I could also bring arguments against the taxation of tea and kerosene. I could easily convince myself that those articles should not be taxed. I consider that if there is a special reason why Customs duties should be imposed to raise money for this purpose, there are items other than tea and kerosene which we might well tax, and thus keep down the tax on those articles to a reasonable limit. Let us assume that a tax on the articles I cited would realize £284,500. A Customs duty of 3d. per lb. on tea and 3d. per gallon on kerosene would realize £559,000. The surplus, after the " fourth " was returned to the States, would be £511,000. </para>

                            <para>- My honorable friend will see that, so long as the Commonwealth returned that surplus - and it will be very much smaller this year than it was last, year - when we are dealing with a tangible proposal we have a right to consider the money which is now in our hands. Of course, if there are other services which would have to be carried out by the Commonwealth in the future, and we should not have the necessary money, other taxation would have to be imposed ; but we ought not to make the mistake which, I think Victoria made, of adopting a scheme without first making sure that the money was available. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, but it is allowed by the Constitution. That would still leave a deficiency of £146,000. I hope that at the coming elections the electors will return to the Parliament a majority of members who will be pledged to support a progressive land tax. If it were enacted on the lines laid down by the Labour Party, then, judging by results in other places, I think it would realize £500,000 to the Commonwealth. With that sum we should have not only enough to make up the deficiency, but a fair amount to meet other charges. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, but still it would be a- good deal above the deficiency of £146,000. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> devoted considerable time to pointing out the special troubles of Tasmania in this regard. I think he said that the State raised £250,000 by Customs and Excise duties. But the Budget papers show that for 1905-6 the indirect taxation in that State yielded £326,395. Then, in order to draw a comparison!, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> said that Tasmania raised by direct taxation £247,000, meaning to imply that in each case the percentage was about 50 per cent. While he did not give credit for the full amount raised by indirect taxation, he took too much credit for the amount raised by direct taxation, because he included in the latter the item of licences. On page 665 of his <inline font-style="italic">Year Book</inline> for 1904, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coghlan,</inline> who is, I suppose, one of our best authorities on matters financial and statistics generally, includes that item in indirect taxation. </para>

                            <para>- In that year the ability tax was not charged. In South Australia - the State which more nearly approximates to Tasmania in regard to conditions - the direct taxation in 1904 was 1 8s.1d. per head. The indirect taxation was £1 19s. 9d. in Tasmania, £5 13s. 8d. in Western Australia, and £1 19s. in South Australia, so that while the indirect taxation in South Australia and Tasmania was practically equal, the latter was paying 2s. 11d. more per head in direct taxation than the former. </para>

                            <para>- No, except so far as they were given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> today. He included in his figures of direct taxation a sum of £56,000 from income tax, and I think £60,000 from the ability tax, which I may mention has been levied since 1904. In his <inline font-style="italic">Year Book</inline> for 1904, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coghlan</inline> draws attention to the fact that in Tasmania the income tax is largely derivable from companies, including licences to the conductors of lotteries. </para>

                            <para>- Very well, sir. I think that the figures I have given will show that the taxpayers of Tasmania would not be so badly hit as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> would have us believe. It has to be borne in mind that Tasmanians are not abnormal consumers of tea and kerosene like the 'taxpayers of Western Australia are. Therefore, the probability is that the revenue derived from a tax on those articles in Tasmania would be spent there, and possibly a portion of the £30,000 which the people of Western Australia would contribute would go to Tasmania to make up any deficit. Tasmania. I think, is not in any specially bad position in that regard. We are in an awkward position on this question of old-age pensions. There is the financial difficulty staring us in 'the face. I should like to make it up by direct taxation, but I am not in a position to do so. </para>

                            <para>- The Government can only do what its majority will let it do; and, unfortunately, apart from the Labour Party, the supporters of the Government are mostly against the imposition of direct taxation at the present time. The leader of the Opposition, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid,</inline> has been recently going through the Commonwealth denouncing proposals for direct taxation which have been initiated by the Labour Party. Therefore, we are brought up against the position that there is no possibility of securing, at any rate, sufficient direct taxation to pay old-age pensions. Even the moderate proposal of the Labour Party, if it were carried in its entirety, would not yield sufficient revenue for the purpose. Are we then to say to the old people of Australia, " We have been promising  you old-age pensions for five years, but we ask you to wait another three years, until we can persuade the people to consent either to a direct Federal tax on incomes or on land values." I think it would be cruel for us to take up that position. I have seen old people in my own State, away up on the gold-fields, who ought to have been taking, their ease in their old age. ekeing out a living by dry-blowing ; and I am not going to say to them, " We had an opportunity in the Federal Parliament to raise sufficient money to pay old-age pensions, but we rejected it because in three years time we hope to obtain the revenue by direct taxation." </para>

This Bill affords one solution of the problem. We have, at the same time, to remember that the Bill has to pass both Houses, and to go before the people for their consent. If the majority of the people in each State agree to this method of raising taxation, the measure will become operative. </para>

If the majority of the people of Australia say that they want old-age pensions, and are prepared to find the money by taxation, this Bill gives them the means. While I regret that I am forced into this position, still I recognise that I am so forced by the logic of facts. I want to give old-age pensions to the people within the next three years, and I recognise, therefore, that the only course open to me is to vote for the Bill. </para>

                        <para>. - I believe, with the last speaker, that we all sympathize with the object in view in granting old-age pensions to our indigent poor. But this Bill introduces a new principle, which may extend indefinitely, and which, it seems to me, is a very dangerous principle indeed. In fact, it reverts to an old system of raising special taxes and ear-marking them for special purposes. It is a system that is still in vogue in Turkey and China, but I fail to see why this Commonwealth should go to those countries for an example. </para>

                            <para>- That is true, but it is none the more acceptable on that account. When I spoke on the Address-in-Reply at the commencement of the session, I indicated what seemed to me to be a practical way of getting out of the difficulty. New South Wales is paying something like £500,000 a year in old-age pensions, whilst Victoria is paying between £220,000 and £300,000. I suggested that, if the other States were agreeable, an arrangement might be made for old-age pensions to be paid throughout Australia by means of a Federal Commission until the Braddon section expired by effluxion of time. I cannot see how any other system is at the present time practicable. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has told us that, so far as he can judge, we can only raise something like £559,000 a year from tea and kerosene duties. It is anticipated that in the coming year the surplus revenue above the three-fourths returned to the States will be £500,000. The Treasurer has told us that he expects a surplus of only £300,000 over the three-fourths ; but, in addition to that, there is the sum which the Commonwealth would lose by conceding penny postage, to which I strongly object at the present time, and which I hope will not be sanctioned. Let me put the matter in this way. New South Wales, with a population of 1,500,000, contributes £500,000 towards old-age pensions. Victoria, with a population of 1,250,000, contributes £300,000 a year. Therefore these States together contribute £800,000. The population of the other four States of Australia is, in the aggregate, approximately equal to that of Victoria. Therefore, on the same basis it would cost an additional £300,000 a year to pay old-age pensions in those States. If they chose to come into such an arrangement as I have suggested, the total payment on account of old-age pensions would be £1,100,000. Why should not that be done? The Treasurer seems to take it for granted that the money paid by the Commonwealth on their account will be saved to the two States which now pay old-age pensions. But when Commonwealth Customs duties were imposed in New South Wales, though it is true that in the first year the income of New South Wales was increased by something over ,£1,000,000 a year, we found that the result was simply to make the State Treasurer more extravagant. The more money goes -into the hands of the States Treasurers the more they will spend. I believe that if the States that are at present paying old-age pensions were relieved of those payments the taxpayer would not be relieved in the slightest degree. The Treasurers will find other means of spending the money. Another point in regard to this matter about which I have heard no opinion expressed is as to who are to constitute the pensioners. Are pensions to be paid at the age of 55 or at 65 ? I hope also that it is not intended that we shall pay pensions to persons who have relatives who are in a position to support them. It has been shown in New South Wales that numbers of persons in fair positions have actually allowed their parents to become pensioners. In one case a doctor allowed his father to become an old-age pensioner. </para>

                            <para>- There is, no doubt, a great deal of truth in that observation. If we had a joint Commission such as I have suggested to manage the payment of old-age pensions for the States/each State would bear its proportion of the expenditure. I fancy that Western Australia would come out of such an arrangement very well indeed. But if we impose special taxation, I am satisfied that Tasmania cannot very well afford to pay her share. I cannot understand, therefore, why the Tasmanian senators should not be unanimous in opposing this Bill. It appears from the action of the local Legislatures that only two States in the group desire to have an old-age pensions law. However, I do not think that there is the slightest chance of this Bill securing the required statutory majority when its third reading is voted upon; though the second reading may be agreed to, .and the measure may get into Committee. At the same time, it must not be understood that those who vote against it do so because they are not sympathetic towards the object in view. All of us, <inline font-style="italic">1»</inline> am sure, desire that our aged poor should be made comfortable, and New South Wales has shown, by what she has done, that she is as sympathetic in this regard as any State in the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>. - As pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> last night, the action of the Government in introducing this Bill has placed many honorable senators in a very peculiar position. I have advocated the payment of old-age pensions for a number of years in Queensland. I have always believed that they should be paid out of the Consolidated Revenue. I have to go to Queensland presently, and shall have to tell the people there exactly my position regarding this measure. I am going to oppose it because I think that it is based upon a most pernicious principle. I know very well that I shall be told that the measure has to be sanctioned by a referendum. But I am not going to make a fetish of the referendum. I believe in. the principle of any proposed alteration of the Constitution being submitted to the people, but, surely, that is no argument why all sorts of measures should be dumped down upon the table of the Senate, altogether ill-considered, ill-digested, containing "just a few clauses hastily ' put together, and thrown before us by a Minister who says, "You need not worry about this; it is all right; push it through, and' let it go to the people; it went through the other House all right, and why should we trouble about it up here?" All that affords no reason why honorable senators should not take an interest in business which affects their States. In what position should I be if I adopted the view of the Minister, swallowed this measure on his assurance that it is all right, and were then asked by my constituents why I had voted for it? What ridiculous nonsense it is to commend the Bill to us on such grounds. Why should I be prepared to say to the Government, " I will vote for any measure you like to put before me because it has to be submitted to the public before it becomes operative " ? If a measure has been submitted to both Houses and fully considered, we are likely in Committee to come to some understanding which will enable Parliament to put that measure to the referendum as one which has been passed unanimously. or nearly so. But this measure has received scant consideration in another place, and has been thrown down here at this late hour of the session. Some honorable senators are asked to go back on the principles of a lifetime in order to give their adhesion to the Government, and they then may <inline font-style="italic">no</inline> out and advise the electors not to vote for this particular proposal. But if I support a measure in the Senate as being in the best interests of Australia, I shall certainly advocate that measure when before the people. I am opposed to the principle of this Bill, which I understand to be that whenever this or any other Government desires to carry out some proposal they may come to Parliament and ask that duties may be imposed on certain articles, not included in the Tariff, in order to raise the necessary funds. This Bill need not be confined to old-age pensions ; next year money might be wanted in connexion with defence - for the building of vessels, and so forth. So far as the Bill is concerned, we have no guarantee that it will be applied only to old-age  pensions,  there being nothing to indicate that it relates to any one particular object. No one knows what special tax the Government may consider it necessary to impose under this Bill. The excuse is that the Premiers of the States have agreed to the breaking of the Constitution by means of this Bill, which we are asked to swallow without any particular consideration. As a rule, the States  Premiers  and Treasurers are not much inclined to agree to anything of the sort when it touches their financial interests. At the Hobart Conference the Premiers distinctly refused to agree to any special duties being raised by the Federal Parliament from Customs and Excise, unless the conditions of the Constitution were complied with, and they received three-fourths of the revenue raised. Is there anything in the resolution passed at the last Conference of Premiers to show that they are prepared to sanction any proposal of the sort embodied in this'  Bill?  The resolution merely says that if the Commonwealth . Parliament believes it necessary to pay old-age pensions it must raise the necessary money without trenching on the three-fourths of the revenue which has to be returned under the Constitution. That resolution does not say that the Premiers are prepared to sanction ai Bill which will in all probability deprive them of three-fourths of £1,000,000. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has told us that there are quite a number of articles on the free list, in addition to tea and kerosene, which, if taxed, would return something like £1,000,000; and I do not think that the Premiers would be prepared to abrogate the Constitution to such an extent as to entail a loss of three- fourths of that amount. At the present time the States Treasurers require as much as they can possibly get returned to them from Customs and Excise. This question has to be regarded from a' number of aspects. It is all very well to say that certain duties will produce a certain amount, out of which old-age pensions may be paid. We must not forget, however, that estimates of revenue are very often wrong. In the States, and even in the Commonwealth, mistakes have been made in this connexion. I can remember Queensland having a deficit of nearly £500,000, and of course, there have been instances in, the State of surpluses of, perhaps, £100,000. The Federal Government may be acting in perfectly good faith when they estimate that they will be able to raise the money necessary from the sources named ;. but what is proposed to be done if the revenue does not come up to expectation? Are the Government then to be allowed to make up the deficiency from the Consolidated Revenue? I am in favour of old-age pensions, but not of pensions which depend on any special duties of Customs and Excise. In my opinion, old-age pensions ought to be paid out of the Consolidated Revenue year by year, and a guarantee thus afforded to the pensioners that there can be no failure in funds - that, whatever straits the Government may be in, the pensions must be paid, short of legislation to the contrary. Of course, we can understand this sort of legislation with regard to trust funds, where revenue is raised from particular sources, and may only be used for certain limited purposes. I am speaking of money contributed by a certain class, and confined to certain uses j and have in my mind stock taxes and other taxes which are paid into a special trust fund. For instance, the Pacific Labourers' Fund, in Queensland, may be used only for certain purposes. In the Bill before us, however, there is nothing definite. All we are asked to do is to take power to impose certain special duties which, it is estimated, will bring in a certain amount of money annually. If that amount is not raised annually, are we to cut down the pensions of the old people? In a case of that sort, we could not draw on the Consolidated Revenue for services which are not included in the ordinary services of the Government. A number of funds connected with the public services have got into difficulties in Australia. In Queensland there is a Police Superannuation Fund; and years ago. when it was instituted, it was almost demonstrated that it could never become insolvent. </para>

                            <para>- When that fund was instituted, the amount which the prospective pensioners had to pay out of their salaries was fixed, and it was arranged that considerable sums of money, such as police rewards and a portion of the fines, should also be paid into the fund. Yet a few years ago the Government came down, and pointed out that years before certain liabilities had been created ; and year bv year large sums of money had to be taken out of the Consolidated Revenue to make the fund good. After a considerable agitation there was an actuarial investigation, and it was reported to Parliament that the fund was insolvent to the extent of £430,000 odd. I certainly believe, as I say, in old- ' age pensions, but I am not prepared to indorse the system proposed, because I do not believe that the old people, who have done a great deal of work in building up Australia, would be safe for a moment, if they had to depend on the imposition of special duties on special articles. I suppose that every member of the Senate is in favour of something being done for old and infirm people. It has been argued that, under the scheme proposed, we shall be able to relieve the States to a very great extent of their expenditure in connexion with charitable institutions. I think that is very doubtful. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think they could be done away with. There are a number of people in every State in the Commonwealth to whom a pension of 8s. or 10s. ,a week would be of very little use, if they had not friends and relatives prepared to look after them. In the institutions referred to there are men and women who are practically helpless, and who, if they were outside, and dependent upon a pension of 8s. or 10s. a week, would not be able to get the attention they require. These people must be looked after in an institution. I know that there are some who say that, . if we had an old-age pensions scheme established, we could do away with charitable institutions ; but I do not agree with that for a moment. It appears to me that this proposal takes us back to the English system of many years ago. In its effects it would be very much like the poor law system; in England, under which people in the .poor districts were called upon to support their own poor, whilst the people who lived in villa residences, and in districts in which there were very few poor, had no poor tax to speak of to pay. </para>

                            <para>- I say that the bulk of the revenue derived from the taxation proposed would be contributed by the people who will eventually have to fall back upon the old-age pensions fund. I admit that in Australia, as in other new countries, there are many ups and downs. I personally know men. who five or six years ago were worth £200,000 or £300,000, and to-day some of them are receiving charitable relief. But these are exceptional cases, and I say that the bulk of 'the money, under the system proposed, would be paid by the people who will eventually require. to fall back upon the old-age pensions fund. How much kerosene is used in Melbourne, with its big gas and electric light works? If honorable senators walk down the street, they will find that very little kerosene is used. </para>

                            <para>- No. I say I believe that the bulk of this taxation would be paid by people who will eventually require assistance from the old-age pensions fund, because throughout life they are unable to make provision for their old age. These are not the people who have electric light installed in their houses,, who have gas stoves to warm their feet in winter, and who do their cooking, by gas. The well-to-do people who have these conveniences will not contribute a penny towards the special duties proposed. People in the back country of Australia, who are doing most for the development of the resources of, the Commonwealth will be called upon to pay this taxation. Kerosene is the cheapest and best illuminant which the man in the bush can get, and even some of the small towns in the back districts of Queensland, and I suppose also in, other States, have their streets lighted, with kerosene lamps placed on the top of posts. </para>

                            <para>- The statement was made in my hearing, not long ago, that the land values of Collins-street amount to more than those of the State of Western Australia, and yet the owners of property in Collins-street would escape this special taxation. I cannot swallow such a proposal at all. I am prepared to go a long way to secure old-age pensions for the people of Australia, but I think there should be a majority in the Federal Parliament prepared to support, and in fact to compel the Government, if necessary, to carry legislation to provide a fund for old-age pensions by direct taxation rather than by this miserable method of collecting the bulk of the fund from the poorer people, who will ultimately require to look to it for relief. Why should we be told that if we sink the principles which, we have been advocating for years and allow these special duties, in which we do not believe, to be imposed, we shall be able to continue to agitate for a land tax, and for other direct taxation ? I should prefer to be able to tell the people of Queensland that, if they wish to have old-age pensions established, they must send to this Parliament a majority prepared to compel the Government to bring in legislation to impose direct taxation to provide the necessary funds. </para>

It is all very well for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie to interject, but only a little time ago we were told that Western Australia possessed the cream of the population of Australia; that the adventurous spirits had congregated there from all portions of the Commonwealth - the men who hold strong radical opinions on public questions. It is nothing wonderful that a band of radicals selected from the whole of the Commonwealth should return radicals to Parliament. It seems to me that that is what we might have expected, but when radicals go amongst a population the majority of whom are absolutely conservative, and still make progress, they can claim some credit for the work they do. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think so. Victoria and New South Wales, which have a system of old-age pensions, might not be able to remove the land tax at once; but there are other ways in which they could ease the taxation. So far, there has been no complaint about the ability of either State to stand the present land. tax. In the case of either South Australia or Western Australia I contend that those who are getting a return in increased value from the labour and energy of those who have now to ask for old-age pensions should be called upon to pay the greater portion of the cost of the Federal scheme. </para>

                            <para>- I admit that, without resorting to sophistry to prove that I am prepared to sink my principles with the. object of getting old-age pensions during the next three years, when there Is no guarantee that it would be obtained from the enactment of this Bill. The Government are merely asking for a power which would enable them to submit to Parliament a measure. Are we to believe that there will always be in Parliament a majority prepared to go back upon the work which they did three or four years ago? I remember that when, with the waving of flags and blaring of trumpets, Queensland's representatives returned after the Tariff was passed, and said, " See what we have been able to do. We were not prepared to allow the necessities of life to be taxed more than was absolutely necessary." They were cheered to the echo on every platform where I saw them. </para>

                            <para>- I decline to go back upon my principles merely because the Government have thrown upon the table an ill-digested scheme, and asked me to sup-, port it. as it would have to go to a referendum of the people. The revenue derived from the imposition of special duties would be of a fluctuating character, but the demand for old-age pensions would be fairly steady. The number of persons who fall out of work year by year is not on the decrease. In proportion to the population, there are in Australia to-day more persons who would be entitled to an old-age pension than there were twenty years ago. Therefore the amount required for financing a scheme would be ever increasing. We have no guarantee that the revenue from special duties would increase or decrease. But we do know that, so far as the Customs revenue generally is concerned, it fluctuates. No one is able to gauge its amount with any exactitude. </para>

                            <para>- When the sitting was suspended I was replying to an interjection by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> that the articles which I had mentioned were not the only ones to which special duties should be applied. I then said, as one who believed in protection, that nearly all the articles that were specially exempted under the Tariff were the raw materials of certain industries carried on in Australia, and which could not be carried on profitably otherwise. In most cases they are materials which we do not produce. Some of them we could not produce. Since the adjournment I have looked up the Customs Tariff Act, and find under the exemption heading in the third column quite a number of articles which are not produced in Australia. The reason why they are upon the free list is that it was not desired to handicap the industries in which they are used. </para>

                            <para>- It is the case with nearly all. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> looks, for instance, at the item " Apparel," he will find upon the free list such articles as binding, buckles, buttons, body and skirt steels, and other things which we do not produce. Those articles are part of the raw material used in industries that are conducted in this country. Is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> prepared to put a handicap of 10 per cent, upon goods which are essential to the carrying on of certain Australian industries, and thereby to handicap the industries in which they are used? I d'o not think that would be a wise thing to do. Ac the Premiers' Conferences some of the members said that there were duties on tea and kerosene in some of the States before Federation, and they pointed out that, as their States were not getting back from the Commonwealth as much Customs and Excise revenue as they required, it would be a fair thing to reimpose those duties. But they did not ask for a Bill like this, under which they would receive nothing. The Premiers of the States did not say that they were favorable to the Commonwealth imposing tea and kerosene duties for the purposes intended by the Government. The Treasurer of the State of Queensland strongly objected to anything like this. I know that there was not much formal opposition to it, but at the same time the Premiers have never given their adhesion to the principle. I have no doubt whatever that if the Bill is submitted to the country, the members of the Queensland Parliament will strongly oppose it simply because it supersedes one of the basic principles of the Constitution. I intend to quote some passages from evidence taken bv the Royal Commission in Queensland from men whom I knew personally, and who are strong supporters of the old-age pensions proposition. They are also members of the Labour Party, and have taken a prominent part in making it what it is in that State. I will first quote from the evidence of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. George</inline> Jackson, who is at present Chairman of Committees in the Queensland Legislative Assembly. I should like to say this for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jackson</inline> : That, having known him and sat beside him in the Queensland Parliament for a number of years, I am safe in saying that, if there is a man connected with that Parliament who has made the old-age pension question his own, it is the member for Kennedy. By the way, I may mention that he is a gentleman who has no very strong opinions in favour of land taxation. I do not know whether that is because he happens to own a fair quantity of land himself. I impute no motives to him; I would tell him exactly the same thing if he were here. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jackson,</inline> in giving evidence before the Old-age Pensions Commission, on the 14th June, 1905 (page 135 of the report, question 2850), was asked - </para>

                        <para>I should think it quite fair and legitimate for you to do that. It is for you to decide how to raise the money. If you grant old-age pensions you should have the courage to raise the revenue. You ought not to be afraid of facing the situation. If in Queensland we were to establish a pension of ios. a week under Act of Parliament, we should have to find the money. I for one should cheerfully face the situation, and I do not see why you should not. </para>

                    <para class="block">That is the position which I take up now. I believe that the Commonwealth Parliament and Government should face the situation; and should determine that those who are best able to bear the taxation necessary to provide for the necessities of the old people of Australia are those upon whom fresh taxation could be imposed. I wish to quote from another Queensland witness, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> P. Colborne, President of the Trades and Labour Council, Brisbane, who was examined on the 14th June, 1905, and whose evidence is to be found on page 142 of the Commission's report. I take it that this witness was well able to voice the opinions of the Labour Party in Queensland. I, as a member of that party, am voicing its opinions here. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Colborne</inline> gave the following evidence: - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>A proposal has been made that one method of raising part of the revenue would be to impose taxes on tea and kerosene ; are you favorable to that method ? - Certainly not. </para>
                        <para>Why not? - Because tea and kerosene are practically necessaries of life. In one way they are not necessaries, but if a workman is not to give up the standard of living to which he has been accustomed all his life, he is supposed to get tea and kerosene. I think there are very few instances in town where men in this country do not get those articles. </para>
                        <para>Is kerosene used in the average workman's home in Brisbane? - Kerosene is used in nearly every case. Kerosene is also used in the bush. </para>
                        <para>What is generally used in the homes of richer people? - Kerosene principally in the bush, but in the towns I suppose that gas is generally used, and in a few cases electric light. But I do not think that the electric light is used very much in private houses in Brisbane. Outside of Brisbane it is very little used. </para>
                        <para>Tea is the usual beverage of the working people, is it not? - Yes, more particularly in the bush. </para>
                        <para>Do you regard it as a luxury? - I could hardly think it a luxury ; I look upon it as a necessity if people are to live up to their accustomed standard. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">Then the witness was asked several questions on the subject of direct taxation. </para>
                    <para>Do you think that a tax of id. per <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> on the unimproved value of land is a very fair method? - I am a strong supporter of a land tax, but under present circumstances I venture to think that such taxation should be reserved for State exigencies. There is no land tax here at present. When Customs revenue is taken from the States, as will probably happen in a few years, it is only fair that the States should have this source of revenue left open to them. </para>
                    <para>If the Commonwealth Government were to relieve the States of a large amount of revenue which is now paid to charities, would it not have the same effect as if we left them the land tax? - If the 'Commonwealth imposed a land tax for the purpose of old-age pensions until the time arrived when the Commonwealth took the whole of the Customs revenue for its own purposes, it would be a fair thing ; but I think that when that time arrives that particular source of revenue should be left to the States. </para>
                    <para class="block">This man, I take it, represents the views of, to say the least, the big majority of the working people of Brisbane, and of Queensland generally. There is no doubt that he regards a land tax as the best means of raising money for the purpose of old-age pensions, being of opinion that otherwise the burden will fall on the bulk of the poorer classes and the average worker, with the result that, to some extent, the standard of living will be lowered. I am not here to vote for any legislation that will tend to lower the standard of living, as we know it in Australia to-day. Our object is not to lower, but to raise that standard - to spread that divine doctrine of discontent which makes people realize that there is a higher plane of living to which they can attain, and that by methods of production it is possible to live a better life from the point of view of material wealth. </para>

We desire something fixed and definite, so that the people who are entitled to old-age pensions will know that the money is always there, whatever may be the fluctuations of the Customs revenue. </para>

But that applies to other outside States such as Western Australia, Queensland, and I suppose the best part of South Australia. </para>

                            <para>- Evidence was give* before the Royal Commission by the Statistician of Queensland, who gave figures showing the proportion to the total population in each of the States of persons aged at sixty-five and upwards. In Queensland the proportion was 2.57 ; New South Wales, 3.45 ; Victoria, 5.50, or more than twice the proportion in Queensland; in South Australia, 4. 12 ; in Western Australia, 1.80, the lowest of all', and in Tasmania, 4.07. I am opposed to the system suggested, because those States which contain the most old people, and people who are not so well off, will be called upon to bear the largest proportional share -of the cost of old-age pensions. I know that, as new expenditure, this will be calculated according to population; and I have no particular .objection to that. But we must remember that Victoria at the present time is very prosperous, with a surplus of £500,000 or £600,000, and that New South Wales has a surplus of £700,000 or £800,000, while, on the contrary, other States have deficits, or have just escaped deficits. Yet these latter States will be called upon to pay the largest proportional share of the proposed duties, and I think it is time for some of us. to pro-, test. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coghlan,</inline> the sum necessary to be raised is about ,£800,000. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coghlan</inline> was supplied by the Royal </para>

                        <para>As to the amount of the pension, what is your idea? - I think the pension should be fixed at 8s. a week, and any State desiring to pay more might do so. Thus, the New South Wales Government could supplement the Commonwealth pension of8s. a week by the addition of 2s. a week, in order to bring up the pension to. the maximum now granted. </para>
                        <para>What would be the cost to the Commonwealth of pensions at 8s. a week, according to the New South Wales scale? - Excluding persons under 65 years of age, and making the pension purely an old-age allowance, the cost would be £1,180,000. </para>
                        <para>What could be obtained by duties on kerosene and tea ? - From <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner's estimate, I understand that these duties would yield £800,000 and a stamp duty of 2d. on wages would yield about £428,000, 'or from the two sources there would be a revenue of £1,278,000. That would allow £48,000 for working the system, which no doubt it would cost. </para>
                        <para>Do you see any advantages to be gained by the levying of a special tax for pension purposes ? - I think the levying of a special tax in the form that I have suggested, namely, a stamp duty on wages, would have the effect of maintaining a certain respect for those on the pension list, who could claim to have provided the money out of which their pension is paid. At the present time a large number of persons in destitute circumstances, and entitled by residence, by age, and other qualifications named in the law, do not take advantage of the pension system, because they look upon it as a charity, and would consider themselves paupers if they accepted relief from the States. The case of these persons would be entirely different if their pension was paid for out of the proceeds of special taxes. </para>

                    <para class="block">I do not know whether that opinion recommends itself to honorable senators who are supporting this legislation. It is really an opinion that if the fund were provided by taxation paid by the workers, they would feel relieved from the sting of charity if they had ultimately to fall back on the old-age pensions fund. I think I can take far higher ground than that. It is the duty of the Commonwealth to provide for its aged poor, and to do so without extracting most of the money necessary for the purpose from the pockets of the people who will require eventually to fall back upon the fund. It is the duty of the Commonwealth, in my opinion, to take a considerable proportion of the amount necessary from the people who have most of this world's goods. I think that is a reasonable proposition. I am satisfied that the proposal now before the Senate will not commend itself to the people of Queensland. So far an old-age pensions scheme has not been established in that State. I think such a scheme should have been established there. I voted for it every time it was submitted in the Queensland Parliament by motion. We were never able to get a Bill dealing with the subject passed through that Parliament, but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jackson,</inline> to whom I referred before, submitted a motion on the subject year after year, for, I suppose, the last ten years at least. Those who were in favour of Federation believed that the Federal authorities would be able, by direct taxation, to raise a fund without bearing too heavily upon the poorer classes of the community. I shall vote against this Bill, because it is not in the interests of the party to which I belong, and because it is opposed to the principles I hold. If the Government succeed in carrying the measure, when I go back to Queensland to give a hand to some of my friends to retain their seats in the Federal Parliament, I shall use every endeavour to induce the electors of that State to reject this proposal. I believe that the principle of it is vicious. If the Government are given a general power in the way proposed to raise special duties, they may or may not exercise it, and there is nothing in this Bill to prevent them next year, if they have a sufficient majority behind them, proposing to raise money by this means for some other purpose. I am prepared to tell the people of Queensland what I have done in the matter, and to take full responsibility for the action I take in endeavouring to prevent this Bill from becoming law. </para>

                        <para>.- I receive with great respect the opinions expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley,</inline> whilst I am unable to follow the line of reasoning which has induced him to come to his present conclusions. I look at the matter in this way : We all regard it as the duty of the Commonwealth to provide for its infirm poor. The Government, feeling that that is acknowledged, not only by members of the Federal Parliament, but almost universally by the people, wish to make some general proposition whereby a scheme of old-age pensions may be established. They very naturally say, " Oh, what use is it to offer suggestions for the establishment of an old-age pensions scheme unless we have a substantial fund available for the purpose." The difficulty of providing the means for the payment of old-age pensions is the one they have to meet. In the circumstances they have naturally listened to a suggestion which has been received, if not universally, at least by a substantial section of the community, that there are two articles the taxation of which would prove a substantial foundation for a fund which would enable them to formulate an effective scheme. Tea arid kerosene have been mentioned, I suppose, because, so far as tea is concerned, it is a beverage that is universally used. Kerosene is not used so universally, but there is a very large consumption of the article by a big section of the community. It is admitted that the duties on these articles would produce a revenue of £750,000 or £800.000. That would be sufficient to provide the foundation for the necessary fund, and we know that it would not be difficult to find the balance required to make up the sum of £1,200,000, which is the estimate of the amount required to give effect to a Commonwealth old-age pensions scheme. </para>

                            <para>- Various suggestions have been made. It might be made up by the imposition of taxation to the extent of to per cent, on articles in the existing free list. That, of course, must be done with very great discretion; but there are many items in the list which would bear taxation. Again, we could fall back upon the balance of the one-fourth of Customs and Excise revenue which we have the right to retain. We could certainly make up the balance of -the £1,200,000 from that source. The great matter is to secure the foundation of the necessary fund, and it would be secured by the taxation of the two items to. which I have referred. </para>

If the people are satisfied that the taxation proposed would "be unequal in its incidence, they will reject the Bill when it is submitted to them. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> will admit- that we have so far never discovered any means of taxation which is perfect in its incidence, and I agree, with the honorable senator that the proper course for us to follow would be to pay the money required for old-age pensions out of the Consolidated Revenue. As we will lie unable tr&gt; do that for three or four years, we should take the next best course, and that is to levy taxation, which will provide a substantial fund from which we can pay old-age pensions. That is what is intended to be done. I, as one who" favours the earliest possible consummation of a scheme for this purpose, am prepared to take this practical means of solving that difficulty, rather than embark upon methods of taxation which have more or less support, but which at the same time would involve great delay. My honorable friend has referred to a land tax. </para>

                            <para>- Of course it should not ; but my honorable friend will see that the proposal of the Government commands a sufficient support to justify its submission to the people by the fact that it has been received with a considerable degree of popularity by the people, and that that feeling has been echoed by a representative Chamber. The latter fact alone, to my mind, is a justification for the submission of the Bill to the electors. I admit, with my honorable friend, that we should not be justified in submitting to them a flimsy, ill-considered proposal. </para>

                            <para>- It proceeds - in order to give us security in regard to our three-fourths of the revenue, it is a wise thing on our part to make it clear to the Federal Prime Minister that that request for an amendment of the Braddon section is to be taken as being in perfect accord with their imposing certain Customs duties for the purpose of raising revenue for Old-age Pensions. I am exceedingly doubtful as to the precedent, but it is owing to the peculiar circumstances in which we find ourselves. The Federal Parliament may say to us, " If you go in for perpetuation of the Braddon section, there can be no Old-age Pensions." </para>

                        : - " That it is incumbent on the Federal Government if it adopts an Old-age Pension scheme, to provide the revenue required to finance it without trenching upon the 'Customs revenue now returned to the States."

                        Yes, but that does not indicate that they might do it by means of the Customs duty ; that implies that they might raise it by an income-tax or a land tax, or some other tax.

                        We might add to that resolution, so as to make it clear, the words, " In the event of special Customs duties being imposed for this purpose the States will waive their claim to their three-fourths of those particular duties."

                        There might be great danger in that. If they impose special duties on certain things and allocate them, they might afterwards take off duties on other things and reduce our three-fourths.

                        They could do it only for that special purpose, therefore they could not take off other duties without reducing what they required for other purposes.

                        It is well to have it made clear that if the Federal Government adopt this method of raising revenue for Old-age Pensions the Slates Governments are quite prepared to waive their claim to three-fourths of that special "revenue.

                            <para>- The fact that the proposal has not only received the sanction of the other Chamber but has also met with some approval from the States Premiers, is a justification for its submission to the mass of the people. Is there anything unfair or unreasonable in asking the electors whether they approve of this method of providing a fund for the payment of old-age pensions? If they hold the view that the proposed tax would be unequal ' in its incidence they will only have to reject the Bill. Surely, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> will see that that is a substantial advance on the part of the Government towards the consummation of a proposal which has been so much talked about ! Are the Government to be reproached because they have made a practical suggestion which has met with such popular and representative approval? I think not. In his thoughtful speech, and in his advocacy of the land tax for this purpose, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> is running the risk of losing the substance while he is grasping at the shadow. Theoretically, his land tax may commend itself to him. But. if he introduced his proposal, certainly he would not meet with large support- from his present allies, who are seeking to secure the rejection of this Bill. </para>

If we desire to get a substantial advance towards the consummation, of an old-age pensions scheme, we should accept the substantial proposal which is submitted rather than seek to deal with theoretical proposals which are not within reasonable means of consummation. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> will see that, in regard to a land tax, there is no unanimity. The party to which he belongs had advocated a progressive land tax. But the progressive land tax which he advocates is quite opposed to the kind of land tax which was advocated by the Old-age Pensions Commission. </para>

                            <para>- That is for the people to say. Next, I urge that the States themselves have so far regarded the land as a source of local taxation. In some States there are substantial land taxes at present. If it is suggested that there is to be a Federal land tax in addition, honorable senators will begin to realize the difficulties associated with its imposition for the purposes of old-age pensions. In all these circumstances, I cannot help feeling that when a substantial proposition is placed before us it is our duty to take advantage of it, particularly as it means the submission of the question' to the people themselves. It has been argued that even if the Premiers have approved of what is proposed, there is, so to speak, a sort of conspiracy on the part of the Federal and States Governments for the purposes of breaking the Constitution. I cannot see the matter in that light. There is no suggestion to break the Constitution. All that is proposed is to alter it in a legal way. </para>

I further point out to my honorable friends who oppose this Bill, that when they can induce the people to support a land tax for the purpose of old-age pensions then, and then only, will it be time enough to revoke the taxation which it is proposed to raise under this Bill. But at present this is the only practical means of dealing with the question. </para>

I feel that, from the point of view of those who desire to bring about an old-age pensions scheme as rapidly as possible, this is our only way of effecting our purpose. If the Bill is rejected, there does not seem to be much chance of consummating an old-age pensions scheme for many years to come. </para>

                        <para>. - There is no place in which one realizes the truth of the old saying, "Many men,' many minds," so much as in a House of Parliament. I find that the very reasons that have been urged against this measure are those which induce me to support it. I am not going to quarrel with my honorable friends who take a different view. I admit that there is room for difference of opinion on the subject, though I cannot make the same admission with regard to every question, in which some of my honorable friends are interested. For years past I have cherished the hope that it would be possible to find sufficient money for purposes of old-age pensions by means of a tax upon the unimproved value of land. I have not yet abandoned that hope. It is still possible to realize it. But, the longer I am in this Parliament, the more fully I become acquainted with parliamentary procedure, and realize how slowly the political machine moves - how it can be prevented from moving at all, how it often moves in, the wrong direction, and frequently in avery erratic way - the more the probability of realizing, my hopes within a reasonable time seems to diminish. It is for that reason that I feel impelled to vote tor a measure which. I believe is brought in for the purpose of finding at least some of the money that is necessary to provide an old-age pensions scheme. I should feel that I was doing a wrong to the old and well-deserving poor of this country if I were to vote against a Bill which certainly offers a possible chance of securing the measure that they have been so long waiting for. At both the elections which I have contested in Western Australia I have advocated the establishment of ah old-age pensions scheme by the Federal Government. Owing to the effect of the " Braddon blot," which, still has some time to run, the Commonwealth Parliament is restricted in its means of financing an old-age pensions scheme. As for the prospects of land taxation, even the moderate scheme propounded by the party to which I belong would not. if it were in working order, yield sufficient revenue to provide the fund that we require. When I find that even the most advanced party in politics does not advocate a system of land taxation which, if it were in operation tomorrow, would suffice for the purpose, I are compelled to turn to other sources of revenue to consummate the object that I have in view. I was very pleased when, a few years ago, I had an, opportunity in the Senate to vote against a tax which it was proposed to levy upon tea. Upon that occasion some of those who are now opposing this Bill voted for a tea duty. Why? To raise revenue to be devoted to general purposes. There is a great difference between a vote such as I am about to give on this Bill, with the ultimate object of permitting a tax to be imposed on tea for old-age pensions purposes, and a vote for such a tax for the purposes of the general revenue. But I question very much whether, after all that has been said about the advantage of allowing tea to be imported duty free, the consumers are getting the benefit of free tea. I believe that a great deal of the profit is finding its way into the pockets of the tea merchants, and that we are <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> a considerable extent losing revenue, while the consumer is no better off. </para>

                            <para>- I think I could quote tea merchants who are of quite a different opinion. However, that is a question on which we might argue all night without arriving at any conclusion. But, at the same time, I am inclined to think that the benefit of free_tea goes to the merchant, and not to the consumer. According to the figures collected by the Royal Commission on old-age pensions, Western Australia would not derive any benefit from the duties which are contemplated. The people of that State would have to tax themselves to the extent of <inline font-style="italic">f,z</inline> for every £1 spent on old-age pensions, because, while a sum of something like £75,000 would be collected on the tea and kerosene duties, only about £40,000 would be required for old-age pensions in that State. I do not vote for this Bill with any parochial motives, but simply because I believe it to be in the interests of the deserving poor of the whole of the Commonwealth. We are now considering the question of a tax on a foodstuff, because tea mav be regarded as one of the necessaries of life. According to the Budget papers, I find that at the present time a considerable amount of revenue is derived from duties on foodstuffs, and that that revenue is used for general purposes, not one of which can be described as more worthy than that contemplated by this Bill. In the case of sugar alone we tax ourselves to the extent of £122,000; in the case of agricultural products to the extent of £750,000: and in the case of apparel and so forth to the extent of £ 1. soo. 000. Amongst agricultural products are included butter, cheese, coffee, biscuits, eggs, jams, milk, potatoes, and so forth : and the money derived from the duties is devoted to every imaginable public purpose. </para>

                            <para>- I am prepared to justify the vote I intend_to give; and it is just as easy to justify a duty on tea as_ a duty on any of the articles I have mentioned. We spend a great deal of our revenue on defence, and surely no one will say that that is a more worthy object than the care of our aged poor. I felt that I could not- give a consistent vote on this important matter, especially after the debate we have had this afternoon. If I voted against the 'possibility of securing pensions for the poor people, who have so long expected them, I should have some difficulty in justifying my action. Some honorable senators have said that they are prepared to wait until the Commonwealth can find the necessary money bv means of direct taxation; but it is very easy to take up a heroic attitude of that kind while the poor fellow outside is doing the suffering. We have now an opportunity to do something for the aged poor; and the Bill shall have mv support. </para>

                        <para>. - A little while ago we listened to a speech which, if it had been made by a member of the other branch of the Legislature, would have caused thirty-five members of the Senate to rise in protest. Until I heard that speech, I should have said that thirty-six members would have protested against such sentiments; but I have come to the conclusion that there is one member of the Senate who has absolutely failed to grasp the fundamental fact that this is not a subordinate Chamber under the Constitution. The statement that this Chamber is less representative than the other branch of the Legislature appears to me to show that </para>

                        if he will allow me te say so, has not yet studied with profit the Constitution under which the Senate moves and has its being.

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> said that the Senate is less representative than the other Chamber. The honorable senator said that this Bill had passed the other place; and what was the good of telling us that unless to impress on us that, therefore, we need not deal with it so carefully. And he went on to say that the Senate is less representative than the other Chamber. I absolutely deny that statement; and I go further, and say that if there is a matter in which the Senate is called on to exercise its special functions, it is one which affects the States finances. I claim, both for myself individually, and for the Chamber as a whole, that when we deal with States finances, the Senate is called upon to exercise particular vigilance in seeing that the interests, not merely of particular States, but of the Federation as a whole, are conserved. Another argument of the honorable senator, if I may so term the statement he made, was that this Bill merely sent the question on to the people. Such an argument seems to me to be a shirking of the responsibility which rests on' this branch of the Legislature. Is every proposal which anybody likes to make to be sent on, and, if not. where are we to draw the line ? The line must be drawn by every one of us. Unless we are convinced that a proposal is for the good of the people, and that there is an overwhelming majority of public opinion in its favour, it is not dur duty to put the country to the trouble and expense of a referendum. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> had something to say on the interesting subject of allies; and he spoke somewhat despairingly of an alliance with honorable senators on this side. Let me inspire the honorable senator- with a little hope, and, in doing so, I shall make only one brief reference to quite modern history.. Not long ago, when the honorable senator sat in alliance with myself, when a proposal to tax kerosene was made, he decided with me that it was an imposition which would fall unfairly on the poor of the community, and he voted to keep it free. I am not now discussing the question of whether it is right or wrong, but I want to assure my honorable friend that he need not despair that in the whirligig of politics he will find himself once more in alliance with those who have, so far, upon this point, been absolutely consistent. The honorable senator informed the Senate that he believes, with a great many of those who have criticised the Bill adversely, that old-age pensions should be paid out of the Consolidated Revenue. Believing that, and in order to give effect to his belief, he proposes to vote for a Bill which will insure that old-age pensions, which he thinks ought .to be paid out of the Consolidated Revenue, shall be paid out of the special fund proposed to be collected under this Bill. </para>

                            <para>- We do not mix it up with the revenue from Customs and Excise. Because the sovereigns are put in the same till, does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> mean to tell me that we mix up the receipts from one Department with those from another? Let the honorable senator consult the Auditor-General on the point, and he will find that that gentleman is able to account for every pound received through each of the Departments. In this case a special precaution is taken, and the Minister is only fooling the Senate in making these interjections, or else he should explain what he means by asking us to pass a Bill which provides for the imposition of special duties expressly for specific purposes. How can he specify the sum which is to be devoted to the specific purpose if he loses the run of the money ? It can only be done by ear-marking the money. </para>

                            <para>- Is this to be only bookkeeping also? Are honorable senators who are voting for this Bill in order to secure provision for old-age pensions to find that they will not get the money received under the measure for that purpose? Are the Ministry going to raise money under the plea that they are raising it for the payment of old-age pensions, and then say that it cannot be devoted to old-age pensions because they have lost the track of it ? </para>

                            <para>- This money will not go into the Consolidated Revenue any more than does the money which is contributed to trust funds. The papers which the Minister must "present to the Senate in a few days will show exactly what will happen. They will show that there must be a special revenue fund as distinct from the general' revenue. I must express my profound regret that ' a measure opening up so many channels of thought, and providing opportunities for so much discussion, to say nothing of the fact that it involves a reference to the people, and the possible amendment of the Constitution, should be submitted to the Senate for consideration when, metaphorically speaking, the Governor-General is here for the purpose of closing this Parliament. Is it at all likely to lead to an effective discharge of our duties if measures which are so important are brought down at the last moment. I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> that there was a time in this session when the Senate adjourned for three weeks because there was no business for us to do. It cannot be said that it was not possible to bring on these measures before, or that we were fully occupied. There has been ample time in which we might have dealt with it. Nor can it be ,said that the Government were not aware of the demand that something should be done in this direction. We have been waiting here kicking our heels for lack of something to do, and now, in what was supposed to be the last week of the session, the Government come down with these proposals to amend the Constitution. Apart from the fact that this measure proposes an amendment of the Constitution, honorable senators will recognise that it touches the financial question, and such a measure cannot be received in one moment and disposed of in the next. If we touch one brick in the financial edifice, we know that the whole structure may fall to the ground. Before we can sanction the amendment of the Constitution proposed by this Bill, we must ask what the effect will be upon the financial position of the States as well as of the Commonwealth. The Government have not given the Senate reasonable time in which to consider such far-reaching proposals. I had hoped that some advantage would have been taken of the very commonsense suggestion made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> in dealing with another Bill proposing an alteration of the Constitution as to the form in which such measures should be presented. The honorable senator suggested that, instead of submitting a Bill proposing that we should omit one word from a provision in the Constitution, and insert another, an entirely new provision should be submitted so that the proposed amendment might' be put before the electors in such a way that they could understand it without a reference to the Constitution itself. I ask honorable senators to say whether, when they received this Bill, they could tell exactly what was intended until they had compared it with the Constitution? One would have thought that the Government would have seen the necessity, in proposing an alteration of the Constitution, of submitting an entirely new provision. As they have not seen fit to adopt that course, may I suggest that, if this measure ever reaches the stage at which it will be submitted to the electors, in addition to putting forward this Bill, they will put forward on the voting papers the existing section of the Constitution, and the section as it would read if the proposed amendment is approved. That is the best way I can suggest to overcome the difficulty. - I again express the hope that if any further amendments of the Constitution are proposed, they will be submitted in the form of entirely new provisions to take the place of sections of the Constitution which it is proposed to amend. I regret _4 that, in this matter, the Government, by the method in which they propose to proceed have mixed up two entirely different things. One is old-age pensions, which appeals to the heart, and the matter with which it is mixed up, the question of finance, appeals absolutely to the head. ;I: join with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> in objecting to be placed in a position in which I must give a vote for what I regard as a faulty financial measure, in order to advance a beneficent movement in which I believe. Placed in this position, I am compelled to vote against the Bill for reasons which I shall briefly set out. First of all, I say that this measure represents a breach of the compact made with the States when they joined the Union. We al! know that the financial difficulty was the real lion in the path. The States that were weak financially could not see their way to join the Union, unless they could be given some assurance that their financial position would not be jeopardized. It was that feeling on the part of the weaker States that! really led to the adoption of the Braddon section, which was provided to secure to them 75 per cent, of the revenue from Customs and Excise. When that provision was adopted it was never dreamt that a proposal would be made to ear-mark certain portions of the revenue from Customs and Excise outside the provisions of that section. I affirm that this is a breach of the compact then entered into. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> shakes his head, and I may be met with the statement that after all this matter is to be settled by a referendum, but I say that that will not prevent its being a breach of the compact. </para>

                            <para>- Of course, they did. This proposal may be agreed to by four of the States, and may not be agreed to by the other two. One of them may be Tasmania, a State that has made an heroic struggle with her financial difficulties. Tasmania, I venture to say, would never have joined the Union unless she had received a guarantee that her financial requirements would be respected. What is the position now? We have Tasmania in the Federation, and it is now proposed to take from that State what she would never have given up. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> said that it will be no breach of the compact, because it will be legal. It is possible to ruin a man legally as well as illegally, and I say that it is a breach of the spirit of the compact if we now, by a reckless amendment of the Constitution, seek to take from any State what that State cannot afford, and would not be disposed to give up. </para>

                            <para>- It is a gross exaggeration of the actual position to say that they are agreeable to this being done. What they have said, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> pointed out a dozen times, is that while they do not affirm that old-age pensions are desirable, or are not, if the Commonwealth wishes to establish a system of old-age pensions, it must find the necessary money in some way which will not trench on the States' proportion of the Customs and Excise revenue. When invited several times to make suggestions as to how old-age pensions might be provided for, the States Premiers said, " No, we will not dictate or suggest to the Federal authorities how it should be done. That is their function. All we say is that they must not trespass on that proportion of the Customs Excise revenue which comes to us." But even though the States Premiers have agreed to this proposal, whilst I have every respect for the unanimous opinion of a number of gentlemen occupying such responsible positions, I have a right to ask myself whether there might not have been something in the circumstances in which they found themselves, which led them to believe that the course proposed would be beneficial to their States, whilst it would not be injurious to the Commonwealth. I pass from that for a moment, but I shall submit the case of a particular State wherein I think that, whilst the State Premier may, by reason of his surroundings, be favorable -to a certain course of action, I, as a representative of the State, am entirely opposed to him'. It has been pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> and others that all that we are asked to do by the Bill is to anticipate by three or four years a position which will automatically arise under the Constitution. That is quite true. But those who argue in that way overlook a very important point. All through the negotiations which have taken place it has been found difficult - in fact, impossible - to arrive at a satisfactory agreement with the States Premiers, in spite of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford's</inline> assurance to the contrary. In dealing with the subject, not long since, his own colleague pointed out that it was impossible to arrive by negotiation at a satisfactory solution of the problem. But, if we wait until the Braddon section is about to expire, the Commonwealth will be in a different position to negotiate. It is absolutely powerless to-day to negotiate with the States ; but it will not be powerless when that section has expired, and we are approached by the States, as we shall be, to know what future arrangement is to be made for the distribution of the Federal revenue. Therefore, the mere waiting for three or four years would have this abundant advantage, that we should be in a far better position then to negotiate with the States than we are in to-day. We should then have a very much clearer knowledge of the revenue to be derived from Customs duties than we have now. I wish to urge one or two objections to the imposition of special duties. I take it that every man in public life is prepared to adopt a scheme of old-age pensions as early as it can be adopted. It has been suggested that Customs duties are to be imposed on kerosene and tea. The great objection that I see to the imposition of special duties for the payment of old-age pensions, rather than making them payable out of the Consolidated Revenue, arises from this fact - that we never can determine that the revenue from the special duties would be equal to the demand to be made upon it. It might be too little, or it might be too much. What is almost certain is that it would always be fluctuating. It appears to me almost a certainty, from the nature of our circumstances, that the revenue from a duty on kerosene and tea would steadily decrease, whilst the demand on the pensions fund would steadily increase. It has been pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> that, in order to raise a fund of £1,500,000, it would be necessary to impose a duty of 8d. per gallon on kerosene, and 8d. per lb. on tea. It will be observed that I have doubled the figures he gave, in order to provide twice the sum he mentioned. It is quite clear that, if we imposed a duty of 8d. per gallon on kerosene, within a very few months not .one gallon of the article would be imported. In New South Wales we have in process of development a very large shale deposit. A company with an enormous capital is constructing a railway and doing the tremendous amount of preliminary work which is necessary in all large mining undertakings, and shortly it will be turning out shale. </para>

                            <para>- With a large shale deposit, and with a company controlled by men with capital and enterprise, it is inevitable that, if we imposed anything like a substantial duty on kerosene, with the idea of raising revenue at all adequate to provide a fund for our wants, the effect of its imposition must be to stop importations and create a local industry, which might be good or bad; but, by killing importation, we should absolutely dry up the source upon which we were depending for the money for old-age pensions. I think it is possible that, if we imposed a very stiff duty on tea, we should find a diminution in the consumption of the article per head. It is a recognised fact that, in proportion as the cost of a commodity is increased, its consumption is also decreased. While I admit that Australians are liberal tea-drinkers. and that their consumption of the article would for some years to come be on a scale excessive as compared with that of other nations, still, if we imposed a heavy duty on tea, and at the same time granted a bounty upon the production of coffee, it is quite probable that we should find the position in Australia more nearly approximating to that in America. In Australia the people stand out as great tea-drinkers. In America, where coffee to a very large extent takes the place of tea, the consumption of the latter article per head is not so great as it is here. That, it seems to me, would be the effect of the policy which is advocated. While the diminution of revenue was going on, it is inevitable that, as the population increased, the number of applicants for old-age pensions must also increase. Is that a scheme which is financially sound, or well thought out? Ought we to be asked tq sanction a proposal so utterly crude that even its warmest advocates, like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> only claim that under its operation we could raise half the amount which would be required, and which, as I have pointed out, would be almost bound to be a diminishing quantity ? It has been urged that the Bill contains no reference to kerosene and tea. I quite admit that it does not, but there can be no objection to the opponents of the Bill taking those items, seeing that they have been brought forward by its advocates, as well as by the Prime Minister, its responsible sponser,  as the two articles aimed at. Every one who has - spoken in the early portion of this debate, every man who has spoken on this question, either here or outside or at the Conferences, has had in his mind those two articles. It is not unreasonable for us, then, to take them for the purpose of illustration. If any one objects to our act, what articles can he offer in substitution? What other items of general consumption are likely to yield any appreciable revenue ? The fact that no one has ventured to suggest any other items shows that we are entitled to regard kerosene and tea as the two items which it is proposed to tax if the Bill should become law. There is nothing in the measure to insure that the revenue from the special duties to be levied thereunder would be devoted to the payment of old-age pensions. Although only " special purposes " are set out in the Bill, still, it is not denied bv the Government, or any one else, that the revenue may be collected for any purpose other than the payment of old-age pensions. Under the Bill it would be possible for the Government to get the sanction of the electors  to  the proposed amendment of the Constitution, and then ultimately to use the power for the collection of a special revenue for a purpose other than that of old-age pensions. We ought not to play with the sentiment of the people in order to obtain a power which would enable the Commonwealth to collect a revenue that they never contemplated, and to spend it in ways which, if consulted,  they would never sanction. I propose when we get into Committee to move an amendment to insure that ,the revenue to be collected from any special duties shall be allocated to the payment of old-age pensions, and to nothing else. That would prevent any Government from applying a power to a purpose other than that which was intended. New South Wales has a very elastic revenue at the present time. It is paying about £500,000 in old-age pensions. It is generally assumed that if the Commonwealth instituted a scheme of old-age pensions New South Wales would be a gainer to that amount. That is quite correct if the discussion were confined entirely to the Federal Treasurer and the State Treasurer. But it is not a light matter to ask me. as a representative of the State, to impose upon its taxpayers an additional burden equal to the amount which they are now paying away in old-age pensions. I have a right to ask myself whether I ought to be the instrument of levying that additional burden. Pro.bably I shall be met with this answer: "  If  we pav old-age pensions, your State Government can remit that amount of taxation." Elsewhere I have heard that argument v'erv often, as we all have, but I can only point to what is happening now. In the  pre-Federal  days we were told that if New South Wales had to submit to Customs duties its Government would of course remit other taxation, and the people would be only taxed to the same extent. But what has happened? New South Wales has had to bear a very large amount of additional taxation. I forget the exact sum, but it ranges from £1.250,000 to £1,500,000, and at the same time not a penny of other taxation has been remitted. We know the  infirmity  of ali Governments. </para>

                            <para>- Both <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> are perfectly correct. New South Wales has not borrowed as much during the last year or two, but since Federation she has borrowed the amount which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> stated. If New South Wales, is not borrowing today, verv little credit is due to her public men for that position. Owing to lavish borrowing, she got into a condition when the Englishman would not lend any more money. I see very little virtue in a State which abstains from borrowing when there is no one ready to lend. That appears to be very much -the position of most of the States. They get a spasm of economy when the Englishman buttons up his pockets. I cannot see that it is my duty to vote so as to impose additional taxation to the amount of £500,000 on the people of New South Wales. We have not yet exhausted either our power of negotiation with the States or our taxing power under the Constitution. Victoria is in much the same way. With a surplus of, I think, £500,000, she is paying a substantial amount in old-age pensions. Yet we are asked to collect from the State special taxation equal to that sum. Surely we ought to pause before we attempt to place upon the taxpayers of those two populous States that heavy load of additional taxation. We shall soon have an additional means of dealing with the matter. That means is at hand. Every day is bringing us nearer to the time when the 'States themselves, in their <inline font-style="italic">own interest,</inline> will be glad to make some arrangement with the Commonwealth, because of the fact that the Braddon section will shortly expire. One special objection to this proposal to tax tea and kerosene - especially kerosene - has been pointed out bv <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley.</inline> It is that it is a tax that will fall particularly upon the poorer classes of the community. I do not think it necessary to emphasize that point, because when we had a debate in the Senate upon a proposal to put a tax on these articles, it will be remembered how eloquent members of the Labour Party in particular were in opposition to it, how they denounced it as being entirely opposed to their ideas of equitable taxation, and as necessarily operating harshly upon the poorer members of the community. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> has pointed out that under this proposal, if it were carried out, the very people who require the assistance, and who are likely to be applicants for old-age pensions, would contribute most towards the fund. That is undeniable, and in itself would make what is projected not an old-age pension at all, but a species of insurance, the recipients of the benefits of which would practically contribute most of what they would subsequently' receive. </para>

                            <para>- Well, then, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> is in very good company when he uses that argument. Quite a number of other honorable senators have said the same thing. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs, Senator McGregor,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie denounced a duty on tea from the same point of view in 1902 ; and I was rather surprised to find <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie to-day supporting the Bill, and urging in favour of it that the benefits of free tea have not been reaped by the consumers. In addition to the fact that the projected duties seem to me to fall harshly upon the poorer classes, a further objection is that it not only discriminates between the richer and the poorer people of the community, but also between the city and the town population. A duty on kerosene, would be essentially a duty upon the country people. In New South Wales, half the population is living in towns of over £,000 inhabitants. Such towns have their own gasworks, and many their own electric lighting establishments. We may therefore assume that half the population of that State have the advantage of a superior light, and are not obliged to use kerosene. But that means that in my State - and the position is much the same in Victoria - the country people are to be called upon to provide an undue share of the fund for the payment of old-age pensions. That does not appear to be at all equitable. With regard to tea, also, the proposal is equally inequitable from the point of view of the country population. Not that the people in the country are necessarily the biggest consumers of tea, but on an average per head of the population it is fair to say that they consume more than do the people in the towns. I therefore say that the people in the country districts would be more heavily penalized bv these proposals than would the dwellers in the towns. No doubt it will be said that while that is true with regard to the items in question, other people in the community contribute to the revenue in respect of other commodities more largely than do the people in the country districts, but these two duties would fall with particular sharpness upon the residents of the country districts. I was never one to raise the cry of town <inline font-style="italic">versus</inline> country, which is altogether out of place in the Federal Parliament ; but if there is one class in the community which is entitled to our special sympathy, it is those who do not enjoy all the social and other advantages of town life, those who have gone out into our often uninviting back-blocks, where they are practically isolated. If we are to show any favour at all, those people are entitled to the utmost consideration which we can extend to them. I wish it to be understood that I am as anxious as any honorable senator can be to see the adoption of a practical scheme of old-age pensions. But the scheme of the Government does not commend itself to me in any way, while it has the objections which I have pointed out. It may be said that the alternative is that we shall have no old-age pensions scheme at all. Nothing of the kind is the case. If this Bill passes the Government could not expect to carry an old-age pensions scheme through Parliament for twelve months. By then we shall be within a very short period of the time when tins Parliament will have to consider what is to take place when the operation of the Braddon section expires. We shall have to consider that question in the next Parliament, and that is the time when we shall have the whole financial position of the States and the Commonwealth under review, and when we can reasonably ask ourselves where we are to get the revenue to carry out a desirable scheme of old-age pensions. It will be better to do it  then  than under a defective scheme, which offends all our preconceived ideas of sound finance by levying special duties for special purposes, and offends our sense ' of justice by imposing taxation upon the class of the community least able to bear it. For these reasons I intend to vote against the second reading of the Bill, and if it is not defeated by the Senate I shall do my best at the forthcoming elections to induce the electors of New South Wales to reject it. </para>

                        <para>.- After giving the measure before the Chamber full and serious consideration, I fail to see why it should not be carried unanimously. Every member of the Senate who has addressed himself to the subject to-day has warmly approved of the principle of old-age pensions. But, whilst some honorable senators favour the creation of a pensions fund, they are not disposed to trust the people by passing this Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has argued that the special duties proposed to be levied will fall very heavily upon the majority of the people of the Commonwealth. But in their denunciation several honorable senators have simply shown themselves consistent in their inconsistency. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons,</inline> in particular, has pleaded that the duties would fall harshly upon the poorer sections of the community. But when the Customs Tariff Bill was before the Senate in the year 1902, there was no warmer advocate of the imposition of tea and kerosene duties than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons.</inline> Honorable senators will recollect that tea was placed on the free list by the House of Representatives. When the measure reached the Senate, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> pointed out that Queensland was, under Federation,' receiving a much less sum from Customs and Excise than she hari done before Federation. A lengthy discussion ensued, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons,</inline> in supporting <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey's</inline> proposal, said - </para>

                    <para class="block">Yet we have <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> to-day vigorously ' denouncing the imposition of such a duty, on the ground that it would fall heavily upon the poorer section of the community. He also condemned the proposition to tax kerosene. Yet in 1902 there was no warmer advocate for the imposition of a kerosene duty than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons. Senator Dobson</inline> to-day likewise urged that it was a wrong course to pursue to tax necessaries such as kerosene and tea. But in 1902, when duties of 3d. per gallon on kerosene and 3d. per lb. on tea were proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey, Senator Dobson</inline> warmly supported him. He said that he considered them fair proposals - probably because Tasmania before Federation had imposed a dutv of 6d. a gallon on kerosene. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> talks about the serious loss which the State of Tasmania has sustained by Federation, amounting last year to £150,000, he appears to be forgetful that about £22,500 was taken away from that State by the removal of the taxes on kerosene and tea. and that the people of Tasmania, in consequence of the removal of these duties, are obtaining tea and kerosene cheaper under Federation than they did before. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey's</inline> proposal for the imposition of a duty of 3d. per lb. on tea was negatived by 17 votes to 9, and his proposal to impose 3d. per gallon on kerosene was negatived by 16 votes to 6. It is remarkable that one senator who professes to be strongly in favour of protectionist principles voted at the time for the imposition of tea and kerosene duties, though it appears to me that no conscientious protectionist was warranted in doing so. On this occasion, however, there is a special reason for the imposition, of the duties. The Victorian senator to whom I allude is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser.</inline> I shall be curious to see what position he takes up in regard to the measure we are now discussing. In New South Wales, as has been frequently pointed out during the course of the debate, a fair measure of consideration was given to the aged poor, the maximum pension being ros. per week. But the difficulties that an Australian citizen undergoes in respect of that pension are very great indeed. A person is supposed to live in New South Wales for twenty-five years before being entitled to an old-age pension. </para>

                            <para>- If a person lived in New South Wales nineteen years and eleven months, and then, owing to circumstances over which he had no control, went to one of the other States, arid there did not succeed as he anticipated, he would be debarred from a pension on return to his own State, although we are all supposed to be citizens of the Commonwealth. In Victoria, there is an old-age pension, which is rapidly becoming a charity dole. There have been innumerable cases cf persons who, because -in a moment of anger they have used a swear word, have been deprived of their pensions by a magistrate; and other cases where poor men, with wives and children to support on 30s. or 35s. a week earned at precarious employment, have been ordered to pay 4s. or 5s. towards the support of their parents. Such cases are truly regrettable, because,- while I believe there is no man in any part of the Commonwealth who has not a strong love and affection for his parents, anc would be proud to do everything possible to sustain them in the winter of their lives, it is exacting too much to compel them to make up a sum which the State ought to be well able to pay. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> expressed the opinion that £1,500,000 will be inadequate for old-age pensions as the years rolled on. As a matter of fact, however, pensions are not increasing, but decreasing, in Victoria; and for more reasons than one. It is true that at the inception of the movement in Victoria many difficulties arose which have since been removed. 1 feel strongly in regard to the principle of the referendum though, perhaps, not so strongly as do some honorable senators who represent States where there are no old-age pensions, and I am of opinion that this matter should be submitted to the people. If the people are of the same mind as a majority of the senators evidently are, then we, and the members of another place, will know exactly what the public opinion is. But that the people desire the establishment of old-age pensions goes without question ; and those who oppose the Bill will find themselves on the horns of a dilemma. We have heard repeatedly inside this Chamber, and outside, the statement that the people ought to be trusted ; but where is the consistency of honorable senators who are afraid to trust the people? </para>

                            <para>- Does the honorable senator think that the people will be called upon to express an opinion on a blank piece of paper? The Government consist of men of life-long experience of parliamentary government, who would not make themselves a laughing-stock by submitting a question which the people could not grasp and understand. Doubtless, the question will be presented in a very simple form and the people will be called upon to express their opinion in regard to the advisability or otherwise of an old-age pension scheme. The Government will, in all probability, indicate the commodities on which it is proposed to levy special duties ; and I have no doubt there will be a great majority in favour of the proposal. But if not, then the proposal can only be rejected. Those who oppose the referendum take a very undemocratic attitude. There is not a senator who does not believe in majority rule, and in any case, we know that finality cannot be reached until the proposal has been approved, not only by a majority of the people, but also by a majority of the States. Believing in old-age pensions, and in the principle of the referendum,, I cannot understand why the Bill should meet with such vigorous opposition, especially from those who express so much sympathy with the old people as deserving consideration in the winter of their lives. Some of the very members who oppose the Bill, and talk so much about the poor people, desired in 1902 to tax those poor people, simply for the purpose of getting revenue for their particular States. If there was any justification for their action on that occasion, there is justification for the creation of old-age pensions. I cannot see how <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> makes out that the scheme will cost Tasmania or any other State £60,000 per annum. It is proposed to levy duties on articles which are at present free. </para>

                            <para>- I absolutely believe in direct taxation. Between Senators Stewart, Givens, and Turley on the one hand, and myself on the other, there is an honest difference of opinion. We know the difficulties there are in the way of the land tax ; but if those honorable senators are right, there can be no harm in submitting the question to the people, because then the supporters of the Bill will be proved to be wrong. On the other hand, if the people approve of the Bill, it will not show that those honorable senators are wrong, but that the people are not prepared to wait for land values taxation. I do not desire a wrong impression to go abroad. I have said that I thought I would be placed in a quandary in regard to this proposal, which I felt to be intricate and complex in regard to certain matters. But I have thought seriously over the whole of the circumstances, and I have come to the conclusion that it would be wise and beneficial to pass the measure, which, therefore, shall have my support. </para>

                        <para>. - In the words of an ex-member of the Senate, if I may be permitted humbly to address this, assemblage, I should' like briefly to put my views on this question before honorable senators. I do not propose to address my remarks to any very great extent to honorable senators opposite, because, although they have expressed sympathy with the old-age pensions movement, by their speeches and actions, they have indicated that they are not going to materially assist the passage of an old-age pensions scheme until the expiration of the operation of the Braddon section. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has just declared that we shall have only a little while to wait, but if the honorable senator were over the age of seventy, and in straightened circumstances, he might consider three or four years a very long time. In such conditions it is probable that he would hardly expect to live even for that short period. It has been stated that in the next Parliament we shall have to deal with the Braddon section. That is very questionable. There will be no necessity to deal with it in the next Parliament, because if we do not do so it will continue as at present; and we can deal with it afterwards when we please. However, it is to the members of the party to which I belong that I should like to address a few remarks. Something has been said about direct taxation. I have always been in favour of direct taxation, and probably as strongly in favour of it as have any representatives from any of the other States. But one honorable senator from another State who is in favour of direct taxation has stated that for twelve years the effort has been made to secure the establishment of an old-age pensions scheme in that State by means of direct taxation. </para>

That would not suit the Opposition, but it ought to suit the members of a party that is always advocating that the will of the people should prevail. The more power we give to this Parliament, the better it will be for the majority of the people. It is be cause this and a previous measure which we dealt with would have the effect of giving this Parliament more power that I so ardently support them. If we pass this measure, in what position will it place the members of the Labour Party? Will it compel them, if they are strong enough in the next Parliament', to adopt duties on tea or kerosene, or any other article, to provide funds for old-age pensions? If they are strong enough, will they not have the power to pass the direct taxation they talked so much about to-day, and to avoid the necessity for the indirect taxation to which they object at the present time? </para>

If they reject this Bill, and will not have the power in the next Parliament to carry a measure of direct taxation, will they then have the power to assist the aged and indigent people whom they profess now to be so anxious to serve? Certainly not. The Federal Parliament has. been in existence for nearly six years, and the reason why we have not been able to secure old-age pensions up to the present time is that we have laboured under the disadvantages of the " Braddon blot," and have had to return to the States three-fourths of the revenue derived from Customs and Excise, whilst we have not had the power to impose direct taxation. </para>

                            <para>- I am surprised at the honorable senator's interjection. It does not matter how strong the honorable senator might imagine himself to be, he is not strong enough, nor is the party to which he belongs strong enough, to force the Federal Parliament to give him the direct taxation which he advocates, and we find that he is prepared to ally himself with the very people who will always resist it. The Government say we cannot get the money out of the Consolidated Revenue at the present time. Here I might deal with the question whether the revenue from this special taxation will go into the Consolidated Revenue or the money paid for old-age pensions will come out of the Consolidated Revenue. Of what use is it to argue it? It is a technical question probably, but I say that if we are ever in a position to pass a vote for old-age pensions I have no doubt it will be included in a Supply Bill. We must appropriate the money at some time from the Consolidated Revenue, and whether we get it through the medium of a tax upon articles that are not dutiable at the present time, or in some other way, is a matter of indifference so far as we are concerned. But if we do not pass this Bill we shall be absolutely compelled to wait for another four years unless we can force direct taxation, and if we are in a position in the next Parliament to force direct taxation we shall be able' to say that we will not submit to these heavy duties on articles at present free. We shall then be in a position, by the will of the people of Australia, to secure direct taxation and to put the Consolidated Revenue fund in a position to supply the money necessary for old-age pensions. I know, as well as does any member of the Labour Party, that it we had the numbers we could do it very easily. There is over £60,000,000 in land values in Australia held by absentees. Twopence in the £1 on that would give us nearly £500,000. If the scheme which we are proposing to the country at the present time were adopted, estates valued at from ,£15,000 to £30,000 would yield us nearly another £500,000. Honorable members of the' Labour Party -&gt;\ho are 'opposing this Bill can see that the source of revenue is there, if we could only get at it. We have not been able to get at it during the last six years, and if we can get at it within the next three years we can have old-age pensions without a duty on tea or kerosene or any other article that is now duty free. There might be a necessity for this Bill within the next four years for other purposes than for old-age pensions. If the four years had expired there would be no necessity for the Bill at all, but it is introduced so as to make it possible for poor old people to get some benefit from a system of old-age pensions within a shorter time than four or five years from the present. Seeing that the avenues for obtaining revenue are so restricted that we cannot obtain the money to provide for old-age pensions, the Government in this measure ask that they should be given an opportunity of appealing to the people of Australia to say whether they are prepared to permit the Federal Parliament to impose taxation to provide the money necessary to give them old-age pensions. If the people say " No," and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> be successful in New South Wales,and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> in Queensland, in persuading the people of those States that this is not a wise measure to pass, it will probably be rejected, even though it should pass both Houses of the Federal Parliament, and things will be as they are now when we meet in the next Parliament. Senators Givens, Stewart, and Turley, will still have to fight for the direct taxation from which the money should be provided, and then we shall see whether their new allies will assist them in that direction in the same way as their old friends would. </para>

                        <para>. - At this hour I do not propose to do more than briefly indicate the reason why I am opposed to this Bill. I shall not follow the example of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> by importing a great deal of heat into the few remarks I have to make, nor will I make any personal remarks. It has been said that there is a need for an amendment of the Constitution in order to provide a fund to pay old-age pensions. That is the only excuse put forward for this Bill. There has not been a single member of the Government Party or of the Labour Party who has supported the Bill who has not put that forward as the only excuse for the passing of the measure and its submission to the people. That is an absolutely incorrect view to take, because there is no necessity to amend the Constitution in order to enable the Commonwealth to provide a fund for old-age pensions. We have unlimited power of taxation. </para>

                            <para>- I wish to state briefly why, in my opinion, this referendum should not be taken. I have always been strongly and irrevocably opposed to increasing the burden of indirect taxation. It has been my ideal, if I possibly could, to always reduce the amount of indirect taxation which the people are called upon to pay, because I recognise, as I think most members of the Labour Party do, that it is the greatest engine which the wealthy and privileged class have for placing an undue burden upon the shoulders of the poor, and freeing themselves from the responsibility which should rightly be borne by them. It will be remembered by every student of history that indirect taxation is of comparatively modern growth. In olden days in the United Kingdom there was no such thing as indirect taxation. The land bore the whole burden of taxation. Every landowner held his land in fee from the Crown, and he had to provide a certain amount of revenue for the Crown, and to maintain men-at-arms always ready to fight on behalf of the Crown, and in defence of the country. As industries spread, as population increased, as society became a little more complex, the landowners began to see that if they could induce the poorer people to pay taxation, they could free their own shoulders from a burden. What was the consequence? They knew that the people could be robbed while they were asleep, without their knowledge, by imposing indirect taxation. I think that every member of the Labour Party will agree with me that that is a fair statement of the- case. </para>

                            <para>- When the honorable senator was speaking just now he addressed most of his remarks to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley, Senator Stewart,</inline> and myself, and therefore I think I am entitled to show him that we, at any rate, have some justification for the course we propose to take. From that date until now the burden of indirect taxation has been continually increasing, and the people to whom the burden rightly belongs are enjoying an immunity. They are escaping their due and just share of the taxation. We - a party which do not believe in indirect taxation - are asked, because an excuse is put forward that the money is required for a purpose which we favour, to weakly consent not only to an expansion of the system of indirect taxation, but to the breaking of the Constitution in order to accomplish that end. </para>

It is only stern necessity which will ever force the hand of a Government to resort to direct taxation. So long as they can get money easily through the Customs-house, so long as they can rob the people while asleep by means of indirect taxation, so long will they refrain from imposing direct taxation, </para>

                            <para>- Yes. Who is to be asked to provide the money for old-age pensions? Is it proposed to compel those who derive a benefit from the pioneering of the old people, to compensate them for their years of toil and strenuous striving on behalf of the country? Undoubtedly not. It is proposed to raise the money from the poor people themselves. </para>

                            <para>- Of course there is; but no one ever supposed that a bond entered into for a definite number of years would be attempted to be altered before that term had expired. To abrogate that condition before the expiration of the time would be a distinct act of repudiation. The Premiers' Conference was utterly opposed to this being done. The Premier of Queensland, for instance, very strongly opposed it. Not that I am disposed to place too much reliance on what the States Premiers say in their Conferences. </para>

                            <para>- I maintain that it is a distinct act of repudiation to alter it in this respect. The Commonwealth should be extremely careful before it sanctions anything of the land. Let me point out also what this indirect taxation means. Those who have studied Commonwealth statistics will agree with me that the amount which, on an average, each individual contributes in Customs and Excise duties to the revenue of Australia amounts to about £2 3s. Let us say, in round figures, that it amounts to £2 per head of the population. What does that mean to a working man who has a wife and two children to support? It means that he contributes £8 per annum to the revenue. Most of the working men whom I know do not, on an average, earn more than £2 per week. In fact, I doubt whether they earn as much. It means, therefore, that a man who is earning £2 per week has to contribute-no less than four weeks' work per annum to the revenue of the country. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister will remember that I have deducted 3s. from the average contribution per head, so as to be on the safe side. Now, what does a man with an income of £1,000 per annum contribute? A simple calculation will show that he does not contribute one week's income towards the government of the country. Where is the equality of sacrifice? Looked at in every possible way, it will be seen how unequal the contribution is. Moreover, the man who has an income of £1,000 per annum derives far greater advantages from government than does the man who earns only £2 a week. Much of the cost of government is incurred by maintaining and administering the law and Law Courts, which are chiefly occupied in hearing cases and filing records referring to disputes about property, and administering the law relating to property. The man who has to contribute four weeks' work per annum towards the cost of government has no reason to avail himself of many of the agencies which the State maintains. Let honorable senators look at the matter in another light, and they will see how much worse the position of the working man is. Every one will remember that there has been a great outcry about the need for more population in Australia. There has also been an outcry about the diminishing birth rate. What do we do by means of our Customs and Excise duties ? </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator professes to be a protectionist, but he does not seem to understand the first principles of protection. A protective Tariff, carried to its logical conclusion, will bring in no revenue. There has been a great outcry about the low birth-rate and the need of population ; but, when we tax everything that the people, eat, use, or wear, we tax a main for every additional child he has, whereas the man without children - who, indeed, may be an absentee - escapes scot free. Where is the logic, justice, or fairness in such a policy? </para>

                    <para class="block">Yet honorable senators, with sophistical arguments, endeavour to justify an increase of the burden of indirect taxation. It is monstrous that in the twentieth century we have not a more enlightened idea of how to raise revenue than that embodied in this outworn system. The taxes contemplated in the Bill will, if imposed, be unjust in their incidence. Why should there not be a tax on the electric light and on gas? The main, in the back country, who, in his, pioneering, exploring, and producing works, is bearing the heat and burden of the day, will have to pay a tax on his kerosene, whereas the man in the town, who has sim ply to turn on the gas tap or touch the electric button, escapes. Tea is one of the necessaries of life of the poor people. In the bush there is not the choice of cocoa or coffee, and, very often, there is no milk; all that can be obtained is tea, and yet it is proposed to impose a duty of 5d. or 6d. a lb. on this commodity. To do this we are asked to amend the Constitution, while, as a matter of fact, if we had the courage to insist, there is ample power, without any amendment, to raise more than sufficient to pay all the old-age pensions that will ever be required in the Commonwealth. So long as we palter with the question, and are weak enough to acquiesce in anything which the Government propose, so long shall we delay reform. </para>

                            <para>- I am not. The vast majority of the members of both Chambers, when before their constituencies, expressed themselves in favour of old-age pensions. They did not say that they were in favour of providing old-age pensions when the Braddon section ceased to operate, ' or when there had been an alteration of the Constitution, but that they were in favour of pensions here and now. Not only the members of the Labour Party. but a majority of the members of other parties, said that they were in favour of an old-age pension scheme at. once; and the only thing lacking is the courage to insist on a scheme. If we had set our energies to work in the right direction, instead of frittering our strength over a lot of paltry questions, we might have accomplished a great deal more. At this late hour, I shall not detain the Senate longer than to say that I am opposed to the Bill root and branch, because, in my opinion, it perpetuates an evil system. I am prepared on any platform in any part of Australia to justify the position I now take up. I am perfectly certain that the people of Australia, especially the poor people who have been demanding justice for so long, will recognise the soundness of the contention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> SenatorTurley. andmyself. </para>
