                <para class="block">Honorable senators will, no doubt, recollect a somewhat lengthy debate that we had during last session on a motion for the ratification of the contract for the mail service between Europe and Australia, which is now in existence. In moving that motion, I took the opportunity of making reference to the provisions which had been in existence for a considerable period1 of years in connexion with the communication between Australia and Great Britain. It is, therefore, absolutely unnecessary for me, at this stage, to enter Into a consideration of those provisions. It will be remembered that at that time neither I nor any other honorable senator who addressed himself to the motion, or any of the amendments thereto, was able to give an unqualified approval of the terms of the existing contract. I think it was recognised on all sides that it had been entered into under conditions which were very highly favorable to the contracting. company, and somewhat disadvantageous to the Government of the day. We recognised that that Government was in the grip of unfortunate circumstances. We found that, in response to the invitation for tenders, only one tender had been received ; that the amount then asked for carrying out the service was &#163;170,000 per annum, and that in the course of negotiations it was reduced, first, to&#163;150,000, then to &#163;140,000, and, finally, to &#163;1 20,000. It was mentioned at that time that in the course of protracted negotiations, the contracting company endeavoured to force other concessions which the Government could not see its way to make. &#39; And, realizing, as we all did, the difficult circumstances in which the Government was placed in carrying out the negotiations, an opinion was freely expressed all round this Chamber that, though we were ratifying the provisional contract, it was desirable that, before the end of January last, we should exercise our right to give the necessary notice of our intention to terminate the agreement. A further expression of opinion was given to the effect that a mistake had been made in connexion with that contract in not making it purely postal. The Queensland Government, recognising the fact that the contract, if it did not expressly provide for something more than a postal service, at any rate contemplated such, claimed that Queensland should receive certain consideration. Otherwise it was urged the Commonwealth Government would be dealing unconstitutionally with certain States - that is to say, it would be discriminating in regard to one State disadvantageously in comparison with other States. In pursuance of that intimation, and in conformity with the wishes expressed both in the Senate and in another place, information was conveyed to the Orient Company of the desire of the Government to terminate the existing contract on the 31st January, 1908. As soon as possible general conditions of tender were drawn up and&#39; published, and tenders were invited for a new contract, which was to commence at the termination) of the existing contract with the Orient. Company, namely, at the end of January,. 1908. Honorable senators have had an opportunity - and doubtless they have availed themselves of it - of perusing in detail those general conditions. The efforts to secure a contract that would be advantageous to the Commonwealth both from a postal and a general point of view, have on this occasion, I think it will be admitted, been attended with considerably more success than were the efforts made a few years ago.. We have not had one tenderer only. We have had five tenderers. It will be seen from the papers presented that the tender which has been accepted is for a sum of &#163;125,000 per annum. The tender next above that was one for &#163;150,000 per annum ; and the next in order was a tender for &#163;185,000 per annum for the same services. </para>

                        <para>- The existing contract with the Orient Company imposes upon us the necessity of paying a subsidy of &#163;120,000 a year. The contract is for the carriage of our mails fortnightly by the Orient Company from Australia to Europe, certain provisions being made for the disembarkation of a portion of the mail matter at Naples, and the carriage of the remainder by steamer from Naples to Great Britain. The Orient Company also carries mails from Great Britain to Australia at poundage rates. Its service dovetails in with a fortnightly service of the Peninsular and Oriental Company that is conducted under contract with the British Post Office for the conveyance of English mails to Australia; and the ships of the Peninsular and Oriental Company on their return voyage from Australia carry mail matter from this country to Europe at poundage rates. When we were dealing with the existing mail contract Vast year I pointed out what were the contract times in the case of the Peninsular and Oriental Company with Great Britain, and in the case of the Orient Company with Australia. We saw then that the Orient Company&#39;s contract allowed a period of transit some hours longer than did the contract with .the Peninsular and Orient Company. </para>

                        <para>- The period in the contract with the Peninsular and Oriental Company was 662 hours, and the contract time with the Orient Company was 686 or 696 hours; but, although those were the specific periods of transit, in every instance the companies ran their boats in less time. I think that in the case of the Orient Company the average extending over ten or eleven voyages was shorter than the contract time by something like eleven hours. </para>

                        <para>- That may have been the case a year or two ago, but the <inline font-style="italic"> Cuzco</inline> and some of the older vessels have since been replaced. As against the existing contract, that which the Senate is now asked to confirm, provides, not for a period of three years, but for a period of ten years, for the duration of the contract. The reason why ten years has ken adopted instead of the shorter term is because it was only by offering to the tenderers a period of at least the duration mentioned that they could be induced to embark their capital in the construction of the vessels that will be necessary for carrying out this enterprise. The amount of annual subsidy which we, shall have to pay is very little in excess of the subsidy which we are at .present paying to the Orient Company. It will be &#163;125,000 per annum. The Mediterranean port and Adelaide will, for all purposes, be the terminal mail ports, because the port of Brindisi will be that at which the letter portion of the Australian mail will be landed, and Adelaide will be the terminal port at which the English mail will be landed, .the period of transit between the two ports will be 636 hours - a considerable reduction upon the present contract time of 696 hours. In regard to that reduction in the period of transit alone, I think we are making a <inline font-style="italic">very</inline> excellent bargain when we recognise that we have to increase our subsidy only by &#163;5,000. Not only shall we be assured an accelerated mail service, but the contract gives to the Postmaster-General power to require the company during the term of the contract still further to accelerate the speed of its vessels, and to establish a transit period of 612 hours instead of 636. As the existing contract stood, some doubt was expressed a little time ago as to whether, when the Postmaster-General tendered a request like that, there would be any obligation upon the Orient Company to comply with it ; but one of the amendments added to the contract now under discussion will, at any rate, make it sufficiently clear that if the Postmaster-General does request a reduction in the period of transit to 612 hours, the tenderers will be under an obligation to comply. Of course, provision is made for increasing the ,&#163;125,000 subsidy in such cases by the actual extra cost entailed upon the company by the increased consumption of coal and in other directions. The extra cost having been ascertained, it will be added to the subsidy paid by the Postmaster-General to the company. That extra cost, whatever it may be, over and above the &#163;1.25,000, will not be fixed in an arbitrary manner, but will be ascertained by actual calculation. There is another provision which I may mention while I am referring to the period of transit, namely, that during a certain period of the year that is perhaps better known to the Western Australian senators than to others - the period of the south-west monsoon - the company shall be allowed an extra period of thirty-six hours. </para>

                        <para>- Of course, it will be remembered that the vessels of the contracting company are to carry our mails once every fortnight ; and during the period of the south-west monsoon, they are to be allowed some latitude in respect of the time of transit. One of the conditions which the Orient Company endeavoured to have inserted in the existing contract was that all payments should be made in London, and that any further transactions that might from time to time take place between the Commonwealth and the company should be conducted in London. As compared with that request preferred by the Orient Company - which, of course, was not granted - the contracting company with which we are now dealing, has preferred to establish conditions in connexion with its business in Australia. It will contract that the vessels that are to be built - which, I may mention, are not to be of less than11,000 tons registered tonnage- </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> asked me who is the present representative of the Commonwealth in London. I have replied that he is Captain Collins. But that does not mean that Captain Collins will necessarily be the person delegated by the Government to act as its representative in this matter. The Government may delegate any individual whom it chooses to act as its representative for this purpose; and I presume that the Government will be seized of the importance of selecting some fit and proper person who will be capable of giving it sound advice in regard to the plans. Captain Collins, if I remember rightly, was an officer in the Royal Navy. But it is not necessary to discuss any individual in connexion with this matter. </para>

                <para>Sydney, has indicated the three different kinds of tonnage that are recognised; and I presume that honorable senators,- who have a closer, and, certainly, a longer, acquaintance with shipping than I have, will take the opportunity afforded them in the discussion to enlighten the Chamber in this regard. All I know is that registered tonnage is the term that is used, and 11,000 is the figure that is fixed in respect of each vessel. I am given to understand, and I am prepared to believe, that, as a result of this stipulation, a larger and better class of vessels will necessarily have to be built under this agreement than are at present engaged in the mail service between here and Great Britain, either under the contract with this Government, or the contract with the British Government. There is a proviso in the contract that, with regard to the first six months, at any rate, the company shall have the right to use vessels of the Orient class so far as tonnage is concerned, always, however-, being liable, even while they are employing such vessels, to comply with the conditions as to the transit period. </para>

                        <para>- I mean vessels of the tonnage of those employed under the existing contract. There is another very important provision to which, I think, I should direct attention. In case there is any loss of earnings, or any increase of expenditure, which either of them, or both taken conjointly, lessens the revenue of the company by &#163;5,000 at least, and the loss is occasioned directly by the legislation of the Commonwealth in regard to shipping - directly in regard to shipping - it shall be competent for the Postmaster-General to Increase the subsidy by that amount. </para>

                        <para>- It is; and honorable senators will recognise that in many respects the present agreement is an advance on the existing contract, and that the differences, are manifestly to the advantage of the Commonwealth. When the general conditions of tender were issued some time ago, the Government had the benefit of the advice of a large number of people in Australia. That advice, which, I may say, was altogether unsolicited and gratuitous, was to the effect that it was hopeless to consider that there would be any tenders under such conditions. But we find that not only this company, but four other companies have tendered. The conditions have been complied with, and they are conditions which, I venture to suggest, no one in this or the other Chamber last year, when the existing contract was under consideration, would have dreamt of so soon obtaining. We all expressed the belief that better terms could be arranged than were then under our notice. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so ; we must give something if we are to get increased advantages. As I say, we all expressed the hope that a strong effort would be put forward to obtain better terms. The Government have endeavoured, so far as they could, in the interests of the Commonwealth, to secure the best terms in connexion with the conveyance of our mails to Europe. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane</inline> reminds me, the term in this particular instance has been extended to ten years; and by that extension, the Government are enabled to obtain advantages which no company would be able to afford if the period were three years, or much shorter than that of ten years. Reference has been made to the question of guarantees. On referring to the general conditions of tender, which are contained in the latter pages of the papers that have been circulated, honorable senators will find, according to condition No. 38, that the successful contractor is to be bound in a sum equal to one-fifth of the annual subsidy. As the annual subsidy is &#163;125,000, one-fifth is &#163;25,000, and the Government have an approved guarantee to that amount in London, and, further, a deposit of &#163;2,500 in Australia. Honorable senators will see from the subsequent condition, No. 39, that the prospect of a company tendering which had no vessels, but would have to build them, was in contemplation. To provide for such a contingency, it was set forth that if the successful tenderer happened to be a person who would require to build the necessary ships, the Postmaster-General would have every opportunity to inspect the vessels while they were building, and that, if the Postmaster-General, at any time during the building;, was not satisfied with the progress made, or with the <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> of the attempts to provide necessary and properly equipped ships, he would be empowered to ask for another &#163;25,000 guarantee. That is to say, the Postmaster-General could raise the general guarantee from &#163;25,000 to &#163;50,000 if he saw fit. </para>

                        <para>- Our contract is only for the conveyance of mails from Australia to Europe. I was pointing out that in regard to the period of transit, penalties are always attached for the non-fulfilment of the conditions. In this connexion, we are in a most curious position at the present time. If the Orient Steam Navigation Company happens to be one hour, two hours, or twelve hours late, there is no penalty ; it is absolutely necessary at present, before penalties attach, that the vessels on the particular trip shall be at least&#34; twenty-four hours late; in other words, penalties are provided for the number of days the vessels are late. &#39; In the general conditions of tender for the agreement under discussion, we seek to remove that disadvantage. I shall now indicate to honorable senators the provisions which deal&#39; with this point. The provisions do not appear in the terms of the contract itself, but in the general conditions of tender. At the same time, these conditions are part and parcel of the contract, because the first part of the first article of the contract indicates that the general conditions of tender, except as modified by the specific provisions of the contract itself, shall be deemed to be part of the contract. In other words, these conditions are not repeated in the contract ; and I deem it my duty, therefore, to draw the attention of honorable senators to the fact. If honorable senators look&#34; at general condition No. 25, they will see the penalties to which* the contractors may be liable under certain circumstances. Should the company, after the completion of the contract, fail to commence to carry out the provisions of it, they will be liable to a penalty of &#163;500 for each day of such failure ; but they are not to be liable for any greater sum under such a heading, than &#163;20,000 in the aggregate. Our existing contract terminates on the 31st January, 1908; and the company, under this agreement, will, on a certain date in February, have to commence operations in pursuance- of the obligations imposed by the agreement. If it is a day late in commencing its operations under the contract the company is to be liable to a penalty of &#163;500, and a further penalty of &#163;500 for every succeeding day during which the delay continues. </para>

                        <para>- That is another matter. , I am dealing now with the penalty imposed for delay in commencing the services under the contract. As honorable senators are aware, in order that this contract shall be properly fulfilled, it will be necessary, not only in the interests of the contractors themselves, but also in the interests of the general public of the Commonwealth, that a schedule of times for the departure of the steamers shall be fixed. Such a schedule will be arranged, and in the event of the contracting company failing to provide a boat to sail from Adelaide or Naples, in accordance with the scheduled time, they will be liable to a penalty of &#163;500, and a further penalty of &#163;too . per day for every day during which such failure shall continue, but the aggregate penalty imposed for such a breach of the contract is not to exceed the subsidy applicable to that particular voyage by more than &#163;1,000. That provision is limited to some extent. It does not apply in the case referred to in clause 20 of the general conditions of tender. That clause contains a provision to which I have not <inline font-style="italic">yet</inline> referred, and enables the Postmaster-General in certain circumstances, if he should deem it desirable in the public interest to do so, to vary the route. In addition to the penalties to which I have already referred, the general conditions of the tender provide for a penalty in the case of boats being late. I have just indicated that before we can impose a penalty against the Orient Steam Navigation Company under the existing contract, it is absolutely necessary that a boat shall be late to the extent of twenty-four hours. We have altered that condition in the general conditions of tender governing this contract, and we propose the imposition of a penalty regulated by the hour. We propose here the imposition of a . penalty of &#163;5 for every hour occupied by a vessel in excess of the aggregate period of transit which the contract entitles the company to take in the voyage from Adelaide to Brindisi. </para>

We make provision that where the cause of delay is1 ; beyond the control of the contractor - the&#34;&#39; act of God, the King&#39;s enemies, and so on, in accordance with the usual provisions&#39; - to be found in bills of lading and marine contracts - the contractor shall not be liable to the penalty. Although we make these very stringent provisions with regard to- &#39; penalties, it is also provided that they shall be liquidated damages, and recover-&#39;&#39; able as such bv the Postmaster-General. It is * further provided that, even although the penalties are enforced, the Postmaster-General shall not be deprived of his right to void the contract for a, breach of its provisions on the part of the company. I do not think that there are any other matters of importance contained in the general conditions of tender to which I need direct the attention of honorable senators. </para>

The contractors come to the Post and Telegraph, Department of the Commonwealth and say, &#34; In consequence of your legislation of last session we have had to increase our expenditure,&#34; or, &#34; Our earnings have been diminished,&#34; or &#34; As the result of increased expenditure and diminished earnings our revenue is now less than it was by &#163;8,000.&#34; If the Postmaster-General were not satisfied with that, the resort of the company would be to take the matter to Court, where they would claim, that the Postmaster-General had broken his. contract, and was bound to pay the &#163;8,000 They would then have to prove that the loss of &#163;8,000 had actually occurred as the result of additional expense and diminished earnings, and they would further have to prove to the satisfaction of the Court that that was due directly to the legislation of the Commonwealth in relation to shipping-&#39; There are one or two other matters in connexion with the general conditions of tender to which honorable senators might direct their attention. One is that contained in clause 30, in which there is a. provision which is commonly found in contracts, and particularly in contracts involving a lease. It is provided in this clause that the contractor shall not assign or sub-&#39; let the contract without the consent in. writing of the Postmaster-General. As honorable senators will see, that is a very important provision&#34;. When, as I said be fore, the Government some little time ago&#62; received from all sides gratuitous and unsolicited advice to the effect that these general conditions were such that there would&#34; be no tenders at all, they very soon found after the result of the tender had been disclosed, and the terms of this contract bad been made public, that information was forthcoming, in many instances from the same quarters. to the effect that it was not likely that the contractors would be able to carry out the contract. </para>

                        <para>- With the consent of the Postmaster- General. I have already suggested that the Postmaster-General has power in certain circumstances to alter the route. When the general conditions of tender were first drawn up, Naples was fixed upon as the particular Mediterranean port at which the letter portion of the mail matter should be landed and embarked. At the same time, it is stated that any other approved port might be substituted. As the contract is now drawn up, it is decided that the terminal port in the Mediterranean, so far as the letter portion of the mails is concerned, shall be Brindisi. In other respects, the general conditions of the tender, so far as I can see, have been adhered to; but the&#39; Postmaster-General has power, under clauses 19 and 20, to alter the terminal port on three months&#39; notice, and also to alter the route on notice. It might be necessary in certain circumstances, in the public interest, that the route should be altered. It might be on account of complications caused by war, or on account of danger to the travelling public, or to the Commonwealth from the importation of any disease prevailing at a port of call. It would be necessary, in such circumstances, that there should be power to deviate from the route, and provision is made to enable the Postmaster-General in such cases to alter the route, and to make the necessary adjustments of payment which are to be settled by mutual agreement, and failing that, by arbitration.  </para>

                        <para>- I have not said anything as to what is to happen in the sixth year. The provision with respect to that is of considerable importance. In order that we shall not, at this juncture, absolutely tie ourselves to certain conditions in the face of the fact that improvements may take place during the period of ten years, we provide for fixing, the sixth year as a determinant year, and that, if other companies have established communication between Europe and? Australia by a better class of shins than those which are contemplated by this contract, we may take certain action. </para>

                <para class="block">The general conditions of tender are in some respects similar to those which have been issued on former occasions. They have been improved, notably in the particular instances to which I have referred. The improvements have been effected by reason of past experience. I think that if honorable senators will give to the motion and to the contract their fullest consideration, they will realize that we are about to secure those better terms tor which we all expressed a wish when we were dealing, last year, with the provisional contract with the Orient Steam Navigation Company. I think it will be admitted that the Commonwealth is to be congratulated upon securing such advantageous terms, even though, in order to attain that end, it has been necessary to extend  the period of the contract from three to ten years. The contract into which we entered in conjunction with the British authorities for a mail service to and from the United Kingdom was for a period of seven years, so that, after all, this period of ten years is not a very great departure from the terms of pre-existing contracts. I think, too&#39;, that honorable senators will recognise that we have followed the right course in providing that, from the Commonwealth point of view, this shall be a mail contract and nothing else. We provide for the&#39; subsidy, or subvention, to be charged against the Department of the Postmaster-General. It is only right and fair that it should be charged with nothing further than the obligation of transmitting, as speedily as possible, mail matter from Australia to Europe. </para>

                            will see that the stipulation to which he refers is part of the contract. When we asked the world to tender for a contract we had no stipulation&#34; or condition as to the tonnage of the vessels to be employed!. This particular company offers to carry our mails, in ships of 11,000 tons. Are we going to be so blind to the interests of the States that compose the Commonwealth as to say that we do not want them?

                <para class="block">That letter was written ten days after the previous letter, and it refers purely to cargo steamers. The replies received with regard to the suggestions in that letter were similar to those which I have already read in connexion with the proposals as to mail steamers, with the addition of an intimation from the Premier of Victoria that &#34; it is felt that nothing can be done in the matter until a definite offer has been received.&#34; Honorable senators will, therefore, see that the Government has been mindful throughout these negotiations of the necessity of entering into what is wholly and solely a postal contract; but, at the same time, it has recognised that it is at any rate possible, when arrangements are being made for a postal contract; to be able to assure to the contractors certain other possibilities, or certain conditions, which will enable them to provide a better class of vessel at much more reasonable cost to the Postal Department than if they had not those other sources of income to look to. I think it will be admitted that the Government was perfectly right in following that course. Now we are about to enter into this purely postal contract; and, although we stipulate for nothing further than that the voyage shall be from Adelaide in South Australia to Brindisi in the Mediterranean, we know, as a matter of fact, that, for its own convenience and profit, the company&#39;s vessels employed in fulfilling the terms of the contract, will go further east than Adelaide. </para>

                        <para>- Of course, merely from the business point of view, it is not to be supposed that these vessels will depend upon the income of &#163;125,000 which they are going to receive from the Post and Telegraph Department. For that reason alone, it is evident that they will visit Melbourne and Sydney. Honorable senators will recollect, however, that the Premier of Queensland last year,, put forward a claim that the Commonwealth was discriminating as against his State, and it was urged that the Queensland people were entitled to have the mail boats calling at Brisbane fortnightly at the cost of the whole Federation. We have been mindful of our experience in this regard, and have, therefore, made the contract under consideration a purely postal contract. I think that honorable senators who have perused the papers will recognise that, although the amount of the subsidy is larger than that we are at present paying, we are securing terms and conditions that are distinctly superior, not only to those in the existing contract, but to anything that, twelve months ago, it was considered that we could hope so soon to obtain. </para>

                        <para>- I am speaking from recollection of the information supplied to me last year. In the course of the negotiations with the Orient Steam Navigation Company, which resulted in the existing contract, one of the conditions which the company wanted to claim from the Commonwealth Government was that it should receive the benefit of the poundage paid, and not the Government ; in other words, in addition to the &#163;120,000 paid in subsidy, it was claimed that the company was entitled to get the benefit of the poundage paid to the Government. But the Government of the day would! not agree to that, and, as I said before, the net result, if my memory serves me rightly, is that there is a balance of &#163;10,000 per annum in our favour. </para>

With these remarks - which have been to some extent disconnected, mainly by reason of the fact that many honorable senators have wished for different information at the same time - I think that I can safely commend to the kindly reception of the Senate the contract, the terms of which are now before it; and I shall now content myself with moving, in accordance with the notice on the paper, the motion standing in my name. </para>

Whether it will be very advantageous to the contractors is quite another matter, though it is certainly one of the points which we ought to consider, inasmuch as sureties are provided for. There are, however, one or two points which I should like the Senate to consider, and which appear to me to be important. </para>

I do not intend to move an amendment, but I wish to suggest certain improvements, leaving it for the Government to make amendments if they choose. One of the points which I wish to raise is with regard to clause 6 of the agreement. I do not think that the Minister gave quite so clear an explanation of what is meant by the clause as honorable senators would have liked. It provides that the Commonwealth may increase the subsidy to the contractors for providing an accelerated service, upon the conditions that - </para>

So that we might very easily be landed on the horns of a dilemma, and our contract might be found to be for a very much extended period. There is another point which I suggest for the consideration of the Minister. In clause 11 of the agreement, it is provided that the steamers of the contracting company &#34; shall be of at least 11,000 tons registered tonnage.&#34; The Minister this afternoon, like the Prime Minister in another place, was very cautious in his explanation of what &#34;registered tonnage&#34; meant. </para>

                        <para>- The Merchant Shipping Act, section 7, requires that the registered tonnage shall be cut into the beams of the vessel. That condition is carried out in the case of the vessels owned by the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company by the registered tonnage being cut and painted on the beams in indelible letters; and that is the only register officially recognised. It is the tonnage on which the vessels pay their dues. Section 77 of the Merchant Shipping Act mentions how that register tonnage is to be arrived at. The matter is also dealt with in section 79. It is provided that to ascertain the registered tonnage certain deductions shall be made from the space included in the measurement tonnage. Other sections dealing with the matter follow, leading to the natural assumption that there is only one &#34;registered tonnage,&#34; and that is the net registered tonnage of a vessel. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. Therefore, when this contract says that the registered tonnage of the vessels shall be 11,000 tons, it means, if it means anything, net tonnage; that is to say, vessels about twice the size of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company&#39;s steamers which visit our ports. If we are going to leave this provision as it stands, it will be open to any one to commence legal proceedings against the contractors if these steamers are not up to the registered tonnage specified. I have no wish to see this contract made null and void. Therefore, I shall not move the insertion of either the word &#34; net &#34; or the word &#34;gross&#34; ; but I suggest that some alteration in this direction is necessary. Some years ago, under the States laws, Chinese Immigration Acts were passed limiting the number of Chinamen introduced to one for every 500 tons register of the vessels which brought them. In South Australia, some of the steam-ship owners held that they were entitled, in this connexion, to have regard to the gross tonnage ; but that was objected to by the South Australian Government, and it was held in law that it should apply to the net registered tonnage. I am aware that in former years, in Victoria, some Chinamen were admitted on the gross tonnage ; but we need not go into these matters, because the Commonwealth now prevents Chinese immigration under different conditions. When the Prime Minister says that the vessels under the agreement are to be much larger and better than any which now visit Australia, he evidently ha&#34;s it in his mind that the term &#34;&#39; registered tonnage &#34; means the net registered tonnage. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. I understand that most of those other firms are not ship-builders, but engine-builders; and, no doubt, they would be only too glad to get contracts on condition of&#39; taking a few shares in the mail company. That, I take it, is the reason for their association with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir James</inline> Laing and&#39; Sons. These associated firms are not directors in the contracting company, which, so far as we know, have no ships of their own at the present time. </para>

                    <para>. - As previous speakers have pointed out, there seems to be a general consensus of opinion that the agreement is one on which the Commonwealth is entitled to congratulate itself. I am not going to .dispute that opinion at present, because it seems to me that, in connexion with the agreement, &#39;there are certain- matters on which we have not been enlightened, and that we shall have to leave to time the determination of whether we are entitled to self-congratulation. Certainly, if the agreement is carried out in the way presented to us, the Commonwealth may conclude that it has made an excellent bargain. But, having one or two doubts in my mind, I am compelled to suspend my, judgment until we see the contract fairly at work. At the same time, I think the Government may say that they have done&#39; the only thing possible under the circumstances. The Government appear to have sought all the information .available, and. believing that information to be reliable, they have made what they no doubt regard as an excellent bargain. I have mentioned that there are certain matters which I shall not say make me suspicious, but which raise in my mind some measure of doubt. For instance, the Government are unable to tell us what is meant by &#34; registered tonnage.&#34; When the Prime Minister was asked a question on the matter, he replied, &#34; It mean&#39;s what it means.&#34; It hardly requires the Prime Minister of a country, where education is free, and supposed to be compulsory, to tell us that. But the reply did not help the debate forward, while it showed that even the Government responsible for the agreement are unable to say exactly what they think they are getting under its terms. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> is evidently under the influence of the same doubt. When he was asked a similar question by interjection, all he could say was - I cannot pretend to repeat his words, hut they were to this effect - &#34; I am not going to determine the agreement, but a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Paxton</inline> has written to the newspapers, and told us that there are three definitions of registered tonnage, and practically you are at liberty to interpret the term for yourselves.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- That does not affect the matter at all. The Minister&#39;s interjection actually shows that he is not prepared to say whether the registered tonnage is to be gross or net, or whether it refers to the space, available for cargo under the deck - to which of three classes referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Paxton</inline> it belongs. I mention <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Paxton</inline> because he was the authority mentioned by the Minister. If the tonnage is to be that set out in the British Merchant Shipping Act, as referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane,</inline> it means that the new vessels will have to be between 15,000 and 16,000 tons gross. </para>

                        <para>- No ; that is the gross tonnage : the registered tonnage that the present shipping companies advertise is the gross tonnage. I should be delighted if I could think for a moment that we were going to get a service of vessels of the kind I have indicated, but I very much doubt whether that will prove to be the case. I am inclined to think that what is meant in the agreement is the second class of tonnage to which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Paxton</inline> refers. But whether I be right or wrong, to whatever class of tonnage it is intended the agreement shall apply it is clearly the duty of the Government to know what is meant, and the Government ought to be in a position to give the Senate the benefit of the information. To come here and ask us to accept an agreement, without being able to tell us what is meant by one of the simple terms employed, appears to me to be the reverse of business-like. If the Senate feels any doubt in the matter, it is not too late to make the meaning abundantly clear by the insertion of a word. I should have no hesitation in submitting an amendment, but for the fact that a number of honorable senators will follow me, who may take that step, if. in the meanwhile, the Government are not prepared to enlighten us on the point. I refrain from submitting an amendment in the hope, and with the request that the Government will, before the debate terminates; make such a statement as will set the matter entirely at rest. If not, I trust that some honorable senator who follows me will endeavour to do what the Government have failed to do. When the representative of the Postmaster-General referred to that portion of. the agreement which stipulates that the vessels shall carry white crews. I could not help thinking of the measure of hypocrisy which underlies all that is; supposed to be embodied in the clause. In accord with the Post and Telegraph Act, we have, in this agreement, determined that we shall make a contract only with a company which employs white crews. Immediately after having told us of that stipulation, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> informed us that the proposed service will alternate with one supplied by the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, who will carry our intermediate mails to Europe on poundage rates. I can see very little on which we may plume, ourselves. If we are setting put to make the ocean white, and we have a contract one week with a company </para>

                        <para>- There is no other option but not to send our mails by that line. Is the morality of the honorable senator of the kind that is only maintained in. the absence of opportunity for immorality ? The honorable senator appears only to require temptation to evil. I pass on to another matter. The member of the Government who introduced the motion referred to the fact that this is simply a mail contract, and I rather gathered from the honorable and learned senator&#39;s remarks, that he took some credit to the Government, for the fact that it is a mail contract only. I can hardly see how the Government can take any such credit, seeing that they made strenuous efforts to make the contract something more. They communicated with the Governments of the States, asking them to take joint action which would enable them to make this a mail contract plus a contract for the carriage of refrigerated cargo. It it was desirable that arrangements should be made with this company for the supply of refrigerated space for the carriage of produce, if cannot be equally desirable that the contract should be limited solely to the conveyance of mails. One or the other course was certainly the better, and for the Government to say that it is beneficial that this should be limited solely to a mail contract, after they have done everything in their power to make it something more, seems to me to be a. little inconsistent. Personally, I see no reason why the Government should not have made a contract which would be more than a mail contract, if they thought fit to do so, nor do I see any reason why they should not have limited themselves to a mail contract. The whole question was, what was the best arrangement they could make? If they could have secured an equally good mail contract with other advantages by the payment of a merely nominal sum in addition, the Government would have been very foolish if they had not taken advantage of the opportunity to do so. On the other hand, they would have been equally foolish if they had hampered a good mail contract by the addition of provisions of an undesirable character for the transport of frozen produce. </para>

The Prime Minister wrote not one, but two letters to the Governments of the States, and it is quite clear that if the Government could have arrived at an arrangement with the States, they would have endeavoured to enter into a contract which would have included the carriage of produce. </para>

                        <para>- I am not finding fault with them on that account, but it seems somewhat inconsistent that after trying to do this, one of the members of the Government should stand up here, and, with a certain measure of pride and glorification, refer to the agreement before us as only a mail contract, and as though it were an achievement for the Government to have secured such a contract. We are not now called upon to consider whether a contract solely for the conveyance of mails is necessarily better than a contract with something else added to it. This contract must stand on its merits, and, assuming that it will be carried out, I think that the Government have made an excellent bargain. The only point about which I feel some doubt is that in spite of the fact that the names of some reputable persons have been mentioned in connexion with the matter, the weakness of the position has been indicated by am interjection that there does not appear to be any measure of responsibility attaching to those persons. So far as the deposit is concerned, I ask any honorable senator who has any knowledge of big commercial transactions, and particularly of mining transactions, to compare the deposit which has to be paid for mining options, where a much smaller amount of capital is involved, with that which is demanded in this case. The sum of &#163;27,000 is somewhere about3/4 per cent., of what is stated to be the capital required to place this service under steam. I ask&#39; honorable senators to refer to their own knowledge of what takes place every day in the mining world, and to mention if they can any big mining proposition the option of which has ever been placed under offer on so small a deposit as that provided for in this contract. Ten per cent. would represent much more nearly the average deposit asked for in transactions of the kind. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; in connexion with contracts for Government works, involving an expenditure of a few hundred pounds, deposits of 5 and10 per cent. of the contract price are required. I do not wish to impugn in any way the <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> of those who are said to be behind this contract. Their names stand for themselves; but I must say that negotiations appear to have been carried on, not with a number of responsible firms, but with one gentleman here, and, in view of the smallness of the deposit, and the fact that the contract does appear to be an excellent one from our point of view, I shall watch the progress of events for the next few months with, a considerable amount of expectation, to put. it in a mild wav, but certainly with a firm hope that the contract will be carried out.,.. If it is carried out it will be the best, contract that Australia could hope for in. the circumstance&#39;s. </para>

                    <para>.- I have carefully examined this contract, and, if everything connected with it transpires as we hope it will, I do not know that we shall have a great deal to complain of. However, had I been the adviser of the Government in any way in this matter, I should have insisted upon the ships going on from Adelaide to Melbourne and Sydney, as the Orient Steam Navigation Company&#39;s boats are bound to do under the existing contract, and possibly to Brisbane also. I believe that it would not have cost the Commonwealth a farthing more to have made this important stipulation. It seems to me that that would have been a wise thing to have done. As matters stand, there is no power on earth that can compel the new mail company to bring their ships beyond Adelaide. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to believe, and I do believe, that the boats of this company must come on from Adelaide to Melbourne and Sydney, but they are not bound under this contract to do so. If they could be so bound, without any further expense, surely it would have been a prudent thing, in the interests of the Commonwealth, to have them bound in that way. Now that they are not bound, the company may make excuses, and there is a remote possibility that the boats will slip across to New Zealand, and it may be contended that they will earn as much money in that way as they would earn by coming on from Adelaide to Melbourne and Sydney. New Zealand is only three or four days&#39; sail from Adelaide. If what I suggest had been provided for the producers of Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland could have made better conditions with the company for carrying on their export trade than they will be able to do under this contract. </para>

                        <para>- I should have been delighted if, under this contract, the new company had been compelled to bring their boats on to Melbourne, Sydney., and Brisbane, because it would have been of immense advantage to the producers of Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland to know that they would be able to take advantage of a ship leaving every fortnight from Brisbane for the home land. Under the existing contract with the Orient Steam Navigation Company, that company is not only obliged to bring the boats on from Adelaide to Melbourne and Sydney, but to provide freezing chambers of a certain capacity, and self-registering thermometers in those chambers to insure the carriage of perishable produce under proper conditions. There are no such conditions provided for under this contract. Even though the boats of the new company should come on to Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane, without provision for the facilities I have referred to, the producers of the Commonwealth may suffer great loss. The danger is that the new company may take advantage of the looseness of this contract to squeeze from Australian producers better terms than they could otherwise get. </para>

                        <para>- It is provided for in the Commonwealth agreement with the Orient Steam Navigation Company, of the date of 5th September, 1905, if I recollect it rightly. Honorable senators will remember that the subsidy was raised in the last contract to &#163;120,000, and under that contract the Orient Steam Navigation Company are obliged to carry frozen produce subject to the conditions <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> which I have referred. We are now about to sanction a contract involving the payment of a subsidy of &#163;1 25,000 per annum for ten years, with a possible extension of ten years more without parliamentary sanction, though I am not quite sure that I am right as to that. </para>

                        <para>- I submit to expert, opinion in that regard. The Orient Steam-. Navigation Company are now carrying on a very satisfactory, service for a subsidy of &#163;120,000 per annum, and are complying, with the conditions to which I have referred in supplying frozen space and self-registering thermometers in their freezing, chambers. This company is to get a subsidy of &#163;125,000 per annum for a period of ten years. That is certainly a very great advantage. The Orient Company is carrying out a very successful service for a subsidy of &#163;120,000. But the boats of the new company need not go to Melbourne or Sydney, and it is not bound to provide any freezing space or registering instruments. It is just possible that it may arrange with- the Government of New Zealand to carry all its frozen produce, and pick up the Australian mails at Adelaide. Moreover, its. boats would not be obliged to go to London. If they get cargo, it could&#39; be transhipped at Brindisi. It would not be possible, however, to tranship frozen butter. </para>

                        <para>- I believe I am right in stating that the company need not send its boats beyond Brindisi. Certainly they should go to an English port. With regard to the term &#34; registered tonnage,&#34; whether it be net or gross tonnage which is meant, I am quite satisfied that there is not much in the&#39; objection made. It might, however, be cleared up. The new boats of the present mail companies from England are supposed to be 10,000 tons each. If we get what the ordinary layman understands to be ships of 10,000 or 11,000 tons, I think that there will be nothing to cavil about. </para>

                        <para>- A layman recognises other tonnage besides registered tonnage. A ship of the Orient Steam Navigation Company which is, 10,000 tons nominal register, may be only 7,000 tons net register. One ship which has been built to steam 20 knots may be very narrow, and yet mav be registered as 6,000 tons ; whereas another ship may be built like a tub, with the same tonnage, but with twice or three times her carrying capacity. So that the term &#34; registered tonnage &#34; does not tell us very much. Can the Minister say whether <inline font-weight="bold">Sir James</inline> Laing and Sons will be bound bv the agreement? </para>

                        <para>- It was not prudent on the part of the Government to take the signature of an attorney when it was possible to get a cablegram or an assurance from the actual contractor. I should say that the firm ought to be bound by the agreement, and that no attorney should have been allowed to sign it when a message by cablegram could have been obtained&#39;.

                        <para>- That is satisfactory. I do not propose to move any amendment. I believe that the Government are anxious to do the best they can. but I am very sorry that the States did not see their way to meet its view, because, after all, it is the producers upon whom the mail contractors will have to depend for their reward. In view of the occurrence of droughts and other difficulties, it is very easy to understand the attitude of the States Premiers. For instance, in Tasmania, last year, there was a very small apple crop, and naturally the Government did not like to be bound by any agreement as to the amount of freight to be contributed&#39;. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Col. NEILD</inline>
                    (New South Wales) &#91;4.36&#93;. - I am very much more than dubious about &#39;the advantages to be derived from this service. Ta begin with, I am very dubious as to whether there is any contract worthy of the name, or any contract in law. It is well known that in important matters an incorporated company! as we are told the firm of
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Sir James</inline>
                    Laing and Sons is, cannot delegate its authority except under seal. What proof have we that any resolution of the shareholders of this firm, or of its board of directors has ever authorized any of the proceedings connected with the proposed transaction ? What knowledge have we that its seal has been attached to any document authorizing the carrying on of these negotiations, let alone their completion ? It is well known to every experienced .man that a resolution of an incorporated company under seal is absolutely essential to give validity to any proceedings of great moment. If we look into this document we find that it really is not a contract beyond that a sum of ^2,000 has been paid by some one to somebody somewhere. When I pressed the Minister this afternoon he could not say who had paid or received that sum. It is said by some persons that it was deposited by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Croker,</inline>
                    and by others that it was deposited by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Sir James</inline>
                    Laing and Sons, but practically no one knows who made the deposit, or where the money is. When the Government propose to let a contract for the erection of a weather-board post office in the back blocks it requires a hard cash deposit of about 10 per cent, of the value of the building. What have&#39; we in this case? We have an allegation of a deposit of ^2,000&#39; somewhere and a bond. When I asked the Minister this afternoon if he had seen the bond, he said &#34; No.&#34; He does not know what it contains. What is taking a bond by way of security ? It may be the best possible method of buying a law suit if the contractors fail to carry out the obligations of this option. I wish particularly to emphasize the fact that this is not a contract for a mail service, but merely an option to enable somebody at the other end of the world, but not very clearly defined, to traffic for eighteen months on the Stock Exchange to see whether he, having risked a couple of thousand pounds, can form a company to carry on this work.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline>
                    has pointed out how utterly insignificant is the security. I forget now whether he was referring to the deposit or to the bond. $

                        <para>- It represents, only three-quarters per cent, of the value. The Ministry do not know what the bond contains. Apparently they cannot tell us who gave it. We cannot get any information except that, possibly, it may be held by a bank &#39;in London for the Commonwealth. It cannot be a document made wholly on one side. I suppose that the Commonwealth was a party to the acceptance of the bond. How d:d it give its assent in order to give validity to the transaction? Was it given by Captain Collins, who, after all is said and done, seems to be a kind of superfluous officer of the Commonwealth ? He is superfluous as a Secretary for Defence, if he can be in London for years. We did not know that he was going to London in any capacity other than to deal with war stores. I think that the members of the Senate had no idea that he was to be a kind of general representative of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- That is the only supposition which is possible. This afternoon he was named by the Minister as being concerned in the matter. When our assent was given to Captain Collins going to England, we had no idea that ;he was to be concerned in the manipulation of important Commonwealth matters. There are several points about this business which I think are very unsatisfactory. For instance, there is no agreement for cold storage. Why did the Commonwealth require the use of steam-ships of 11,000 tons net register to carry mails? Why, sir, an ordinary despatch boat would be sufficient to carry all the mails, and might have been obtained at a third of the price. </para>

                        <para>- Why did not the Government stipulate for at least a maximum rate of freight for cold storage? It is of the greatest consequence to the butter-producing interest in Australia that the date of the arrival of shipments in. England should be known with certainty. The date is known in connexion with the mail steamers now employed in the service between Australia and the old country, but the date is net known in connexion with steamers of the tramp class, nor even in connexion with so important a service as the White Star Line. The date of arrival in London of shipments of butter is a matter of very grave consequence to the trade. We know perfectly well that the arrival of a shipment a day late makes a very important alteration in the price obtained. Accuracy of date in the delivery of a cargo so easily damaged as butter is of grave consequence j and I think that when the Government was providing for the construction of - steamers which, I will show directly, are to be, under the law - not in accordance with the fanciful idea of any one, but under the law - 11,000 tons nett meaning 15,000 tons gross- </para>

                        <para>- My honorable friend may say what he pleases, but I will read the law to him directly, and that will satisfy him that I know what I am talking about. The Government, in obtaining the service of vessels 15,000 tons burden gross, or 11,000 tons net, for the carriage of mails, leaves absolutely out of account the certainty- that something else is intended in regard to the use of those vessels. It is evident that they are fo be put to some other purpose than the carriage of mails ; and my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser,</inline> hit it off very correctly when he said just &#171;now - giving expression to something which I have on my notes - that the probabilities are that the steamers will not only traverse the Australian coast ; but after delivering their mails at Adelaide, there is a probability that they will go off to New Zealand. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> did not say what I am going to suggest, namely, that in all probability the New Zealand Government will pay a very handsome subsidy to get those steamers to cross over to New Zealand rather than that they shall - traverse the southern and eastern shores of Australia. And these contractors - :if the thing ever becomes a going concern - will, in .pursuance of the subsidy granted by the New Zealand Government, cause their steamers to cross the ocean, and obtain the advantages of a satisfactory cargo, plus a&#39; Government subsidy which they cannot get by going along the south and east coast of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- The Government has been hypnotized by this gentleman, and has accepted and entered into an agreement, but the dear, good people thought that they were inaugurating a Commonwealth mail service, whilst they were doing nothing of the kind, but only granting an option. Reference has been made to the deposits required in connexion with Government contracts. Let me draw attention to what States Governments have required in connexion with carrying out public or semi-public works by private individuals. I might take a case such as the laying down of a few miles of railway in connexion with a coal mine. </para>

                        <para>- I think it is very probable. I might refer to a case where Parliament grants right by Statute to carry out some work of a semi-public character, such as the construction of a harbor or the carrying out of irrigation works or waterworks. Let me instance one or two cases. A Bill was passed through the New South Wales Parliament - I had charge of it - for the purpose of supplying Broken Hill with water. It was necessary, under that Bill, for the promoters to pay to the Treasury of New South Wales - not a bond which could be litigated upon by-and-by, but hard cash, to the sum of &#163;10,000, within, I think, three months of the Royal Assent being given to &#34;the Bill. , The same thing happened in connexion with a Bill to enable a company to make a harbor. In that case the deposit was the same. The harbor was never made, and the Treasury Accounts were flushed by the &#163;10,000 deposited. I need not occupy the time of the Senate by quoting other instances of the same kind. But surely, in the face of such instances, there is something to be said against the mere payment of &#163;2,000 by somebody, to somebody, somewhere, particulars of which we have not been able to ascertain. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator has not seen any document to that effect. He does not know of his own knowledge that the money has been guaranteed. He must, as a lawyer, have had before him in his professional capacity instances where guarantees have been made the subject of very extensive and expensive litigation. The honorable senator will not dare to tell the Senate, either as Minister or as lawyer, that a guarantee or bond is equal to hard cash. Never a law term passes but there are actions upon guarantees and bonds. Cases of that kind are amongst the commonest known to the law. We have had litigation in Australia extending over three, four, and five years, and eventually going to the Privy Council, in regard to guarantees and bonds. In this case, the bond is one which, if it ever has to be enforced, is held at the other end of the world. That bond ought to be here. It is a most unsatisfactory document, inasmuch as we know nothing about it, except that we have the bare assertion that it exists. We do not know anything about its terms. All that we are told is that a bond has been entered into by some one, and that the sum of &#163;25,000 is mentioned. I say that such a deposit as &#163;2,500, with a bond somewhere or other at the other end of the world, is a guarantee altogether at variance with &#34;the practice of the States Governments when they grant to private individuals or public companies, extensive public or semi-public rights. There is another feature of this matter that has not been mentioned, but is of some consequence. There is a condition in the contract that enables the Commonwealth to take over the line of steamers at any time it chooses. But we are told that Messrs Laing and Sons are to be the builders of these ships. Clearly there is no obligation upon them to build the ships except in their own way, on their own terms, and at their own price. They can value them at whatever figure they like. </para>

                        <para>- What is to prevent the nominal value of those ships being swollen by well known methods, so that if ever the Commonwealth desires to take them over the owners will be able to set up a claim for a much higher price than they were actually worth? If they were to be built by contract, we should know what the real value was. But they are to be built by the contractors, who are to place their own price upon their own work. What is to prevent a sum of as many thousands of pounds a year as you like to name being debited to these ships by way of management, or on account of chairman of directors, president of the board of management, or whatever you please to call it. Charges can be made to the extent of many thousands of pounds a year for fictitious or semi-fictitious services. The nominal cost of the ships may be piled up in that manner, in a way that would be eminently disadvantageous to the Commonwealth if it desired to purchase them. I do not think that I quite finished - by reason of interjections - saying all that I desired with reference to the failure of the Government to fix a maximum charge for the carriage of refrigerated cargo. The butter trade has grown to such an extent that while the freight some years ago was no less than 3d. per lb., it is now down as low as1/2d. or3/4d. per lb. That fact shows how immensely important the trade is. I may state, with all humility, but at the same time with a degree of certainty concerning the truth of my utterance, that the Government has lamentably failed in protecting one of the primary industries of Australia, in not&#39; fixing in this agreement or option a reference to the rate of freight which this company - if it ever commences operations - will be entitled to charge. We know that the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation and the Orient Steam Navigation Companies have been working on the same rates of freight. But if this new company comes into being, the Orient Steam Navigation Company will probably be out of the way ; and there wilt be nothing to prevent a new arrangement being entered into between the new company and the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, under which the only two companies with a regular delivery in London &#39; will be able to charge whatever rates of freight they please for the benefit of their shareholders, but to the detriment of the producers of Australia. It is all very well to say that it is only a question of1/4d. a lb., or something of that sort. But by the time the butter is delivered on the London market, it may mean much more than1/4d. a lb. A difference of1/4d. per lb. freight may make a material difference in the price which the farmer gets for his goods. I desire now to clear away from the mind of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser,</inline> or any other honorable senator any doubts there may be as to the meaning of &#34; registered tonnage.&#34; </para>

Let me say, in passing, that many years ago there was a great controversy as to the fixing of registered tonnage for the purpose of levying dues on vessels which passed through the Suez Canal : and after the point had been settled by, I think, an international tribunal, the method of measurement set forth in the Act I have just mentioned was agreed to, and has been acted on ever since.

                <para class="block">I could elaborate by reading more, but I think I have read amply sufficient to make the point clear to honorable senators. These sections show most conclusively that in the case of screw steamers - and no doubt the vessels proposed in the agreement will be propelled by screws - all the space required for engine-room, boilers, screw shaft, accommodation for captain and crew, stores of all kinds connected with the working of the ship, and, as provided later on, also the space between double bottoms, if any, is to be deducted from the gross measurement of the ship before the registered tonnage is arrived at. It will be seen that materially more than one-third of a vessel&#39;s gross tonnage has to be deducted in this way ; and therefore, if, for the sake of dealing with round figures, we suppose a vessel to be 15,000 tons gross, some 5,000 tons must be allowed for, leaving only 10,000 tons as the &#34; registered tonnage.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator is surely forgetting the many vicissitudes that have overtaken people who have innocently entered into contracts they believed to be good and sound, but which have produced an aftermath of litigation such litigation as that in which &#34;the legal gentleman concerned in this option would shine, as he did before the Butter Commission. I have pointed out what I conceive to be serious objections to a contract, which, if it: be given vitality in the future, will possess some elements of possible advantage. At present..&#171;however, the agreement is surrounded with much uncertainty, and there is a lack of, I shall not say legal proof, but common-sense business proof, as to the <inline font-style="italic">iona fides</inline> of those concerned. After all, what we have before us is merely an agreement for an eighteen months&#39; option in favour of certain people at the other end 0^ the world, to whom a well-known firm mav possibly have allowed the use of its name, in prospect of getting a glorious job in the construction of vessels - a finer prospect, seeing that the vessels are apparently to be all on the same model, than, perhaps, exists in the minds of any other ship-builders in the . United Kingdom. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Croker,</inline> or somebody else, has deposited a very small sum of money in Australia, but we have no other proof of <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> beyond a statement that somebody has given to somebody else, somewhere, an alleged bond, and that somebody has despatched a cable from England to the Commonwealth Postmaster-General. Yet we are trading away, with all the solemnity of parliamentary sanction, an eighteen months&#39; option .to enable the persons who are manipulating this business to see how much money they can make out of it in financial circles in London. There is the prospect that if the option does eventuate, the steamers may never call at any Australian port after Adelaide, but mav, under a subsidy from New Zealand, proceed to that important Colony - a prospect that we may see no more of the steamers than their arrival in and departure from Spencer&#39;s Gulf. I do not think that this contract, or, rather, this option arrangement, furnishes the Commonwealth with any material basis for jubilation. On the contrary, I am afraid that it is an option agreement, which, in the first instance, is very likely to come to nothing. I see that this transaction is being boomed in the newspapers at Home for flotation purposes. Every one with any knowledge or experience of financial methods, is aware that it only requires a certain price te create a boom in certain monetary journals in the city of London. We have all heard of the thousands of pounds which had to be disgorged not long ago bv certain newspaper writers in England in connexion with a scandalous flotation. The new mail arrangement is now being hailed as a great success ; and if the booming is only done industriously enough, some capital will be raised, and. probably a company formed. But the&#39;e is another drawback, which, I am sorry I did not mention before. Under the agreement, it is open to the Postmaster-General to permit the assignment of this option to anybody. </para>

                        <para>- That ought not to be allowed; it should be subject to the approval of Parliament. I make no suggestion of impropriety, either at present or in the future, but I do say that the transfer of a great contract like the one proposed is too great a responsibility and power to be exercised by the gentleman, whoever he may be. who, for the time being, occupies the position of Postmaster-General. Indeed. I think it is too great a responsibility to be exercised bv even the Ministry of the day. If the Government may not enter into an option bargain of this kind without the sanction of Parliament, why should the greater power I have indicated be given to a future Ministry, or even the present Ministry, if the latter last Jong enough, which I do not think likely? I cannot be accused of saying anything personal, because I cannot form any opinion as to who may be the successors of the present Government. If the present Government feel that this agreement option for eighteen months is a matter of such importance that they cannot deal with it, and must seek parliamentary sanction for it, that is proof enough that any succeeding Ministry should be required to come to Parliament for the sanction of any transfer of the bargain to any one else. If this is James Laing a:nd Sons&#39; contract or option, they are, we understand, responsible parties, but while there is nothing in this agreement to prevent such a thing, there is, on the other hand, every provision in it to enable the Postmaster-General of the day to consent to the transfer of the contract or option to anybody - to any parcel of monetary sharks or adventurers calling themselves a company with capital, actual or alleged, and probably alleged more than actual. I think there should be a clause in this contract to provide that it shall not be transferred or assigned to any person, body, or company, except with the approval of Parliament. I have said what I have, because it seems to me that the matters I have mentioned are of paramount importance, and I have not taken up the time of the Senate for a moment longer than I have thought necessary in the discharge of my public duties. </para>

                    <para>. - I think that, it is a very great calamity indeed that some understanding with regard to this contract was not arrived at between the States and the Commonwealth. The result of their failure to come to any agreement on the subject is before us in this contract. Which is of a hybrid character. It is neither fish, &#34;fowl, nor good red herring. The representative in the Senate of the Postmaster-General told us, in moving the motion, that this is a mail contract pure and simple. Looking at the contract purely from the Commonwealth point of view, I should say that the Commonwealth ought not to trouble itself with anything other than the conveyance of mails. Put when we come to consider it with reference to the large producing interests of Australia, we are bound to come to the conclusion that a mail contract ought to be combined with a contract for the carriage of produce, and that, from my point of view, can only be done with the consent, concurrence, and co-operation of the States. </para>

                        <para>- What I said was this, and I stick to it : I said that the Commonwealth as a Commonwealth should not concern itself with anything but the carriage of mails. I hold to that opinion now. I say that if any subsidy is to be given to a shipping company for the carriage of produce, that subsidy should&#39; be paid by the States interested, as States, and not by the Commonwealth. But while holding that view, I never expressed the opinion that the Commonwealth should charter ships only for the purpose of carrying mails, because that, in our present stage of development, would not be satisfactory in the&#39; interests of the Commonwealth. I held before, and I hold now, that a contract for the carriage of our mail sought to be combined with a contract for the carriage of produce, but that while the Commonwealth should be solely responsible for the carriage of the mails, the States should&#39; pay for the other services rendered&#39; under the contract. </para>

                        <para>- My objection to the present contract is that it is a com- . promise contract. It is an attempt, and a very ineffective one, to provide at once for a mail and a produce service. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> as I have already said, has declared&#34; that this is a mail contract and nothing else. If it -is, why have we this provision for vessels of 11,000 tons register? </para>

                <para class="block">Peninsular and Orient Steam Navigation Company. I have no objection whatever to that. I have no objection to the size proposed for these vessels. I say the bigger the vessels the better. What I object to is that we are subsidizing a cargo service in this contract, in addition to a mail service. The Commonwealth is being placed in this very peculiar position : That, because the Government would not insist on the vessels going to Brisbane, in addition to Melbourne and Sydney, the vessels, under the contract, cannot be compelled to go past the port of Adelaide. My objection to the whole thing is that we are actually subsidizing a cargo service while professing that it is purely a mail service. The members of the Government have, I suppose, come to the conclusion that, in any case, these vessels will call at the ports of Melbourne and Sydney, and1 that there is, therefore, no need to mention those ports in the contract. They naturally came to &#39;the conclusion that if they had included those two ports in the contract, the representatives of Queensland would insist on Brisbane being added. They think that they have provided under the rose &#34; for Melbourne and Sydney being served by these vessels, but have we any guarantee of that? Several honorable senators have already pointed out that these vessels might proceed to New Zealand for cargo instead of going to Melbourne and Sydney. </para>

                        <para>- There is no compulsion under this contract on the company to fake their vessels to either Melbourne or Sydney. If they can get cargo in New Zealand that will pay them better, they may go there ; and, if there is the development in the meat and butter trade within the next ten years that I think every one of us expects there will be, the new company may actually be placed by this contract in a position to extort unfair freights from the ports east of Adelaide. I think that is quite on the cards under this contract. This is my objection: We are paying for something under this contract which the contractors are not bound to give us. If it is purely a mail contract, why this provision that the vessels must proceed to a port in the United Kingdom? The mails -may be sent on by smaller boats to Naples and Brindisi, whilst the mail-ships proceed to a port in the United Kingdom. If this is a mail contract pure and simple, why should not the voyage of these ships begin at Naples and end at Adelaide? </para>

                        <para>- Surely it would be cheaper to send the mails and packages overland than to incur the expense of sending these ships right round from Naples to London, or whatever port in the United Kingdom may be decided on? All that I have mentioned goes to prove that this is something more than a mail contract. That being the case, I am decidedly of opinion that it will be to the advantage of Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland if the new company is compelled to carry out&#39; the work it is, going to be paid for under this contract. </para>

                        <para>- We are discussing a question of very much greater importance, I think, to Australia than that survey. Somehow or other we ought to combine an efficient mail service with an efficient cargo service. I have always held, as I hold now, that the mere carriage of mails between Australia and Europe is of comparatively little consequence. What does it matter to the average citizen whether he gets his mail from Europe one day or two days, or three days, or even a week late? What really does matter to the great mass of the people is that our produce, should be carried regularly, and in the best possible condition, to the London market. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. My contention is that we ought to try to get the very best possible cargo and mail service. The attempt made in the contract to combine the two services is a most ineffective one, because it does not give us a cargo service while agreeing to pay for it. The vessels might not go beyond Adelaide; on the contrary, they might go from Adelaide to New Zealand, get loading there, and even hold up the Commonwealth during a time of stress, when probably there was a verv large quantity of frozen meat and butter to be sent to European markets. By the mere threat of not going to Sydney and Melbourne they might be able to inforce increased rates. I think it would be much better for the Commonwealth to pay the company an increased subsidy, and to compel them to send the boats to Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane. </para>

                    <para>.- The reason which induces me to formally second the amendment is that I am desirous of impressing upon the Government the necessity of securing for the Senate more definite information than has been supplied. It has a right to be supplied with exact information before it is called upon to give a vote. The agreement in its present form is lax and defective in many serious particulars. As the parties are here, it is quite competent for the Government to secure an addendum which would enable the two Houses1 to know definitely the terms of the contract. In regard to the subject-matter of the amendment, it has been urged bv several honorable senators that there is no possibility of doubt that the intention of the company is to send its boats to Melbourne and Sydney. If that is the understanding between the parties, is it not most desirable, in view of contingencies which might happen, that it should be included in the terms of the agreement? So far as New Zealand shipping is concerned, some extraordinary things have taken place, particularly in the matter of freights&#39;. At the present moment there is going on in that Colony a warfare in which the Government is to some extent interested, because it is assisting one large company as against certain other shipping companies! which have hitherto traded there. In view of the freights which might be picked up in New Zealand, there is a reasonable possibility that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir James</inline> Laing and Sons might find it most advantageous to . send their boats to New Zealand. The only consideration with the company would&#34; be which trade was the more likely to yield a profit. If the advantages of trade with New Zealand surpass those offered bv the Commonwealth, in whose interest this contract is being actually entered into, we may take it that New Zealand will be selected in preference. I am, therefore, urging that there should be greater certainty in regard to the terms of the contract. My honorable friend, the Minister, may say in answer to the amendment which has been submitted, that if we attempt to alter this agreement, it may be put an end to altogether. </para>

                        <para>- My answer to that is what was urged by myself in connexion with the Eastern Extension Company&#39;s agreement - and it appears to have been somewhat prophetically urged in that case. It is acknowledged that once an agreement has been entered into, although it is subject to ratification by Parliament, no alteration of it can be made without the consent of the other party. </para>

                        <para>- When Parliament ratifies, it does so, of course, subject to its own views, but if the other sides did not choose to fall in with the terms of Parliament, undoubtedly, the result would be that the agreement would be at an end. The agreement is, no doubt, so far as its fundamental principles are concerned, satisfactory, and &#34;desirable. We should desire to see it consummated. But serious objections to it have been raised. There is, for instance, the question of tonnage. On the face of this agreement, we understand it to mean that the net tonnage of the vessels is to be 11,000 tons. The Minister says that there is no doubt that that is the intention. Surely, if that be so, it might as well be stated so that there may be left no room for doubt. This Parliament should definitely know what the contract actually is, and it should firmly and definitely set out the wishes and desires of Parliament. I am urging these matters as points in which the contract might be amended for this reason. First of all, the Government itself has to go to the other side, that is, to the representative of Messrs. Laing and Sons, in order to secure the confirmation by him of its own proposed amendments. What I urge is that when the Government goes to the representative of the contractors, with its own amendments; it shall at the same time ask him to agree to certain amendments which, so far as I understand the representations and arguments used in the Senate, ought to be made before this agreement is actually confirmed. If, having done so, the Government comes back to Parliament and says that the other side is not prepared to consent to the amendments asked for, it will be for us to reconsider the matter. I for one will give the Government every assistance in order that a satisfactory arrangement may be made, and that the contract may be carried out. Perhaps the most important objection to the contract in its present form has yet to be referred to by me. It has already been mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser, Senator Macfarlane</inline> and one or two other honorable senators. I refer to the ambiguity of the clause having reference to the extension of the term. On glancing through the contract hastily, as I came into the chamber, I thought that what was meant by clause 6 was that the extended term referred to was to be a term within the fixed period of ten years. But, on closely reading the clause, I do not think it means anything of the kind. I think, moreover, that it would be quite competent for the Postmaster-General to give notice extending the contract for twenty years, and Parliament would not have a word to say. Parliament is not empowered to say a word - either yea or nay - to an arrangement of that kind, because automatically the matter is fixed by the tribunal mentioned in the general conditions of tender. </para>

                <para class="block">This means, so far as I can understand it, that notice has to be given by the Postmaster-General that he wants an accelerated service to commence at a particular time, and he has to offer an additional annual subsidy. That extended service might last for twenty years. If there is any disagreement between the parties, the whole question is to be determined by arbitration, under a provision of the general conditions of tender. So that the result would be that, if a twenty-knot boat was required, and an extended period of twenty years, in the opinion of the Postmaster-General, should be given, he might, in the most irresponsible way - I say irresponsible advisedly - give this particular notice; and, if once that notice was given, Parliament would have no say in the matter whatever, because a tribunal is fixed for the purpose of ascertaining definitely the terms and fixing the subsidy. It will be observed that, according to clause 1, the general conditions of tender are incorporated in the articles of agreement. Of course, my honorable friend the Minister might refer me to clause 27 in reply to my argument. Clause 27 of the general conditions of tender says - </para>

                <para class="block">My honorable friend may urge that this would enable us definitely to terminate the contract upon giving twenty-four months&#39; notice. But I do not think that that is so, because it will be observed that clause 1 of the agreement provides that the general conditions of tender - shall be deemed to be part of this agreement, and that the Postmaster-General and the contractors shall respectively perform and observe each and every of the conditions, covenants, stipulations, agreements, and provisos on his and their part to be performed and observed, as the same are set forth in the &#34;General Conditions of Tender,&#34; except where such conditions, covenants, stipulations, agreements, and provisos, or any of them, shall be inconsistent with or modified by the special covenants and the provisions hereinafter set forth. </para>

                        <para>- I understand the Government to say that the extended period is to be within the period of ten years. If the Government understands that the extended period is to be the limit of ten years, and if the contract obviously says the contrary - or if there is such ambiguity about it that honorable senators and the Government are not at one as to what the true interpretation is - it is clear that we should endeavour to ascertain what it really does mean. Under these circumstances, I urge my honorable friend to adjourn this debate, with the object of seeing if it is not possible to get an addendum signed, first of all, definitely dealing with the question of the extended term - as to whether it is to be within ten years, or whether <inline font-style="italic">some</inline> limit is not to be placed upon the term. Whether it be ten years or fifteen, let it be firm and definite. Do not let us be in the position in which we were in regard to the Eastern Extension Company&#39;s contract, which nobody understood, and the ambiguity of which caused an indefinite amount of heart-burning. </para>

                        <para>- I was going to suggest ratification by Parliament, but I see an objection to that. The agreement, in its present form, would have to be altered, because it says that the term and the amount of subsidy are to be fixed by arbitration. If they are to be fixed by arbitration, the determination could hardly afterwards be a matter for ratification by Parliament. There is a little difficulty in that regard. I had jotted down on my notes &#34; Consent of Parliament should be sought.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- Undoubtedly the Postmaster-General was not obliged to put such a provision in the original conditions of tender. Such strong interest was taken in this subject, as honorable senators are aware, that not only was this matter made the subject of question, but it was clear that Parliament would have insisted on having the right of ratification. </para>

                        <para>- The answer would be that in the agreement itself there was a provision that the Postmaster-General was to be at liberty, on his own responsibility, to enter into an arrangement to extend&#39; the term. I admit that the Postmaster-General had the right to insert such a provision. If there is no objection to an arrangement of the kind being ratified by Parliament, all I ask is that the ratification be provided for in the agreement. </para>

I have no desire to go behind public utterances in any way, because what is said to the Senate is what Ministers are responsible for. The only point I make is that I was justified in concluding that the Government were under the impression - and I hope I may be forgiven if I in any way misconstrue the intentions of the Government - that the extended term was to come within the period of ten years. If I am wrong, I, of course, will accept correction at once. </para>

                        <para>- I freely admit that the clause, with other clauses, is most ambiguous; and I am glad that the Minister now accepts the view that has been urged. If that be so, is it unreasonable to ask that some further negotiations shall take place with the representatives of the contractors, so that we may definitely know the exact terms of the contract into which we are entering? If after further negotiations the Government come to this and another Chamber and say that the terms are the very best they are able to secure, it will then be for Parliament to say definitely whether or not we shall enter into the contract. What I am urging is that we have a right to know the exact terms before we ratify, the agreement. Ministers must recognise that the Senate is sympathetic, and desirous to help them in every way. The criticism that is being offered could not be objected to, because its purpose is to assist the Government ; and when we are told definitely what the contract is. I am sure it will receive the most generous consideration. Again urging that the debate should be adjourned, with a view to obtaining a supplementary arrangement, I ask that that arrangement should definitely deal with the matter of the extended term, with the question whether the contractors are prepared to make any stipulation as to the boats proceeding to Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane, or as to which other ports they are willing to bind themselves to call at, with the questions whether &#34; registered tonnage&#34; means the net registered tonnage, and whether Parliament should not have a right to sanction any assignment that may be made. These are the points in regard to which I see serious objections, and on which I, along with others, desire to be enlightened before we are called upon to ratify this agreement. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> has, in my opinion, put his finger on a very important objection to the contract in its present form. Apart from the period fixed, the contract, so far as I am able to understand it, represents a very satisfactory arrangement. My only objection is to so long a period as ten years, and that objection will be considerably strengthened if it be open to the Postmaster to hereafter extend the term indefinitely. Ministers ought to make themselves clear on this point. With the constant improvements in steam navigation, it is impossible to foresee what the conditions of transit may be ten yearshence. </para>

                        <para>-Quite so. I remember, many years ago, one of the principal engineers on the Clyde, in delivering a lecture, being asked when we were likely to see an end to the improvements in steam navigation, and he replied that he could not imagine any limit. On that I agree with the engineer; and, if there is any limit, it will not be in regard to speed, and so forth. There may be a limit as to the size of the boats that our harbors and ports will accommodate, but it is not possible to forecast what improvements may take place in other directions. I do not think there is really so much as is imagined in the stipulation as to the tonnage of the vessels to be used under this contract. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has given shipping matters a closer study than, I suppose, has any other honorable senator; and I know that he will not agree with me when I express the opinion that the stipulation in the agreement as to the registered tonnage may refer to the net tonnage of the boats, the gross tonnage, or both. As a matter of fact, both tonnages of Australian shipping are registered under our present law. </para>

                        <para>- And I suppose that, in a sense, that is what the contracting company under this agreement are doing when they place this clause in the contract. I feel quite sure that there is no likelihood&#39; of the contracting company ever giving us vessels with a net registered tonnage of 11,000 tons. There are very few ships afloat of such a tonnage, and certainly no boats of the kind are coming to Australia. Even the <inline font-style="italic">Grosser Kurfurst,</inline> which is the largest vessel trading to this country, falls short of that in her registered tonnage. If we get vessels of a gross tonnage of 11,000 tons, I hold that we shall get a much better class of vessels than are at present carrying our mails to the old country, and that seems to be admitted by all &#39;honorable senators who have spoken. I do not see why we should raise so much objection to a better class of boats, because there is some indefiniteness as to the meaning of &#34;registered tonnage.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- I have yet to learn that Adelaide has a harbor of any kind. I hold that the question raised with regard to the control of freights is of very much more importance than the question of the exact tonnage of these vessels. The Government might contend that in making a contract purely for the carriage of mails it would not do to include any provision regarding the regulation of freights, but it should be borne in mind that, in&#39; common with other parts of the world, Australia has suffered more or less from the operations of shipping combines in the control of over-sea, as well as of Inter-State, freights. There have been continuous complaints against the exorbitant freights charged by shipping companies in the combine. We know that the shipping combine in the old country, which is known as the Shipping Conference, has controlled freights to such an extent that the people of Fremantle have had grave cause of complaint &#34;in the high freights charged to that port. </para>

                        <para>- No doubt the merchants of Fremantle are as keen in business matters as are the merchants of Adelaide, but that does not justify a continuance of inordinately high freights. We are now concerned in securing for Australia as good a steam-ship service as we can possibly get. If the tender received from the new company is a genuine one - and I think it is - under this contract the company will be free to join the shipping combine, and to raise freights to the extortionate rates we have heard so much about, in the past. The action of the Government in the matter would have been more consistent if legislation in the direction I have indicated, and which is proposed in a Bill under consideration by this Parliament, had been taken advantage of in this contract. We have anti-trust legislation! now before Parliament, and why the principle of that legislation should have been lost sight of when this contract was being drawn up I am unable to understand.- Australian industries have . suffered in the past from the combination of shipping companies to raise freights above a reasonable, rate, and I am therefore very sorry that there is no clause in this contract for the regulation of the rates of freight to be; charged by the vessels engaged in this service. </para>

                        <para>- Fair from it. There is much graver cause of complaint against the Inter-State freights than there is against the oversea freights. The action in this respect of the oversea shipping companies is extremely &#34;fair when compared with the action of our own InterState companies. When the last mail contract was under consideration in the Senate, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> directed attention to the labour to be employed upon the boats engaged in the service. I am not now referring to the colour of the labour, but to the question whether it should or should not be union labour. At the time the honorable senator proved that the action taken by the Orient Steam Navigation Company was undoubtedly hostile to union labour. They were taking advantage of the operations of a shipping federation in the old country, which is an employers&#39; association, that practically led to the boycotting of members of the seamen&#39;s unions of the old country. It is an important omission from this contract that no provision is included to deal with that kind of thing. Seeing that the matter was discussed in connexion with the last contract, and that the complaint made was justified, the Government might very well have borne it in mind in making this contract. They should have seen to it that the British sailors who are members of the seamen&#39;s unions, comprising the best seamen leaving the old&#39; country, would be given a&#39; fair deal so far as employment on the boats to be run under this contract is concerned. It has been said that the new company may hawk this contract about with the object of assigning it to some one else - that, in fact, the contract is not a genuine one on their part. I do not think there is much danger of that, because I do not see that the company would have very much to gain from trickery of that kind. Believing that the contract is a desirable one, I do not think we should be justified in deliberately refusing to take advantage of all the good which may follow from it, simply on the ground that some one believes that some trickery on the part of the new company is intended. I do not agree with those who say that the proposed contract is too good to be true. I believe that it is a desirable contract, and I believe also that the persons who are parties to it will be honest enough to carry it out. The&#34; suggestion that they are not likely to carry it out has probably originated with some disappointed tenderers. If the new company do not carry out the contract, their action will only afford a further argument in support of the contention that the only course which will go to the root of the trouble will be the establishment of a national line of ships, over which we should have full control. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser,</inline> when referring to the terms of the present contract with the Orient Steam Navigation Company, stated that it provides for cool chambers and the supply of self-registering thermometers in those chambers. I asked the honorable senator at the time whether he was quite sure of his ground in making that statement. He said that he was ; but I have since looked through the contract, and can find no such provision in it. The contract does make provision for cool storage, but there is no reference in it to the supply of self-registering thermometers. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot find any reference to it. It must be borne in mind that in the contract before us we are not making provision for the carriage of any kind of cargo. This is a mail contract only, and in making such a contract I think that the Government have acted wisely. I have been sorry to find that some honorable senators, who, when we were dealing with the Orient Steam Navigation Company&#39;s contract, complained that it provided for more than the carriage of mails, now assert that this contract should be something more than a mail contract. That is an inconsistency which they will find it hard to explain. With respect to the term of the contract, I think very little objection can be taken to it. I intend to support the Government, but I hope they will take steps to make it clear that the term will not extend beyond ten years. </para>

                    <para>.- The Senate would have done well, I think, if it had requested the Minister to move the motion in Committee, as we could then have criticised the contract more fully, and moved any amendments we might think necessary. I fear, however, that it is almost too late to take that course now, and that we must try to make such amendments as we can. Regarded as a postal contract alone, it offers many advantages to the Commonwealth, and I shall be very, glad to see it ratified. I have been reminded of the very great facilities which now exist for sending our produce to the markets of the world by large cargo vessels. I admit at once that some of the large cargo boats take our products quite as quickly as do the mail-boats ; but nevertheless I think that the Government would have done well had it put in some stipulations with regard to the space in the cold chambers, and to the boats calling at the various ports. I am inclined to think that we shall have no peace on this point until they do call at Brisbane. I am quite certain that the representatives of Queensland, headed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> will not let the matter drop. But if the company are to be compelled to call at a port there ought to be in the contract a proviso to the effect that there shall be enough freight forthcoming to pay the expenses of the journey to and fro. I do not think that the Government are called upon to compel the steamers to call at a port unless the .shippers at that port undertake that there will be enough cargo to pay bare expenses?. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> should carry his amendment, I propose to add to it the words &#34; and at the port of Hobart during the season for shipping fruit to Great Britain.&#34; I am aware that the Prime Minister made every possible effort to get the States to take united action with regard to securing a certain amount of cold storage for their products, but they did not appear to fall in with his ideas. I am inclined to think that they gathered from the correspondence that they would have had to guarantee so much freight. In Tasmania, for instance, we would have had to guarantee so many thousand cases of apples, and Victoria would have had to give a guarantee in respect of fruit, butter, and rabbits. I suppose that the States shrank from giving a guarantee of that description, because they feared that circumstances might occur which would not enable them to fulfil the obligation. In Tasmania last year there was a very bad fruit season, partly owing to a frost, and partly owing to very dry weather. Instead of having a full crop of apples, we had only half a crop. I believe that two growers who had engaged space for 20,000 cases had to plead with the company to be let off with supplying (5,000 cases, and I understand that in some instances shippers in Hobart had to pay for space which they did not occupy. I imagine that had the Government called for alternative tenders they would have made slightly better terms. They might have called for tenders to provide cold storage at the present market rates, or at slightly above those rates. In Tasmania when the shippers commenced to ship apples they had to pay a freight of 4s. 6d. a case, but it is now down to 3s. 3d. Considering that fruit is constantly bought for the English market at 3s. 3d. and 3s. 6d. a case, it is very hard indeed upon the shippers that they should have to pav a freight of 3s. 3d. a case. When outside boats call freight is often quoted at 2s. 6d. a case. </para>

                        <para>- I admit that it might be a mistake for the Commonwealth to bind the shippers to pay 3s. a case for the carriage of apples, because they are now carried for 2s. 6d. a case, except on the mail-boats, which charge 3s. 3d. a case. A stipulation might just as easily have been put in the contract about the rates for cold storage, as about the ships themselves. If we had a right to demand that the company shall supply a new fleet in order to provide the accelerated and more advantageous service, surely we had an equal right to say. that the freight should be reduced according to market rates. I believe that if the Postmaster-General had called foi alternative tenders with regard to taking our produce home in cold chambers, at a rate not exceeding a certain sum, he would have got additional advantages for our producers. I have nc particular liking for a mere postal contract, because it does not give to the public the benefits which they have a right to expect. To scores of places in the Commonwealth a chaise cart or a boy and a pony would be able to carry the mails, but the Department provides that the contractor shall supply a waggonette or a coach in order that&#39; the public, quite apart from&#39; postal advantages, may derive a benefit from the contract. I do not see why that principle should not have been applied in the case of this ocean mail contract. I believe that clause 6 of the articles of agreement is so momentous that it will never be acted upon. It appears to me to be perfectly certain that if the extended period for which the improved and accelerated service is to continue be left to arbitration, without imposing any limit, it will rest with the arbitrators to fix upon any period which they may think fit. It might be argued that, as ten years is the period mentioned in the contract, they could not give a second term of ten years, but I do not believe that the Court would interpret the clause in that way, because it is absolutely unlimited. It appears to me that if an accelerated and better service than the one being provided should be given in the sixth year of the contract, it would be at an enormous additional cost to the contractors, and, naturally, they would require an enormous additional consideration. I do not think that any arbitrators would think it fair to require the contractors to recast the whole of their arrangements and to build new ships capable of travelling at an increased speed unless they did get an additional term df ten years, though I quite admit that it is a very important matter to the Commonwealth. One can see that, in ratifying this contract, we might be binding the Commonwealth for a period of sixteen years, and that Parliament would have nothing more to say about it until the expiration of that period. Suppose, for instance, that in the sixth year we were to ask the contractors to give us an accelerated and better class of steamers, I take it that the arbitrators would probably give them an additional term of ten years. </para>

                        <para>- No; I think it is fair to say that the contractors are proposing to build the boats now on a ten-years&#39; contract. In my opinion, the chances are as fifty to one that clause 6 will never be put in force, and that the contractors will have only a ten-years&#39; term. But if six years hence we should ask them to provide a service equal to the best in the world, it would be imposing great additional responsibilities upon them, and any arbitrators would give them a greatly increased subsidy and advantages. That is one of the amendments which I should like to see made in the terms of the contract. I think that paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> of clause 6 ought to be altered to read as follows: - </para>

                        <para>- I quite admit that the contractors should be allowed a reasonable time in which to get ready for rendering the better service. If they required two years&#39; notice, then there would be eight years of the contract gone. No arbitrators would compel them to make that provision without giving them an extended term of eight or ten years. There is nothing, however, to prevent the arbitrators from giving the contractors a term of fifteen years. After the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> is disposed of, I should like to move an addition to paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> of clause 6. </para>

                    <para>. - I can quite understand tiny member of the Senate who has glanced at this contract coming to the conclusion that it is, practically speaking, too good to be true. I have spent some time listening to the criticisms upon it, and I have come to the conclusion that there is much of it that requires very careful attention. I am going to point out some serious flaws in it. I will deal first, as the question has been very much debated, with what is meant by &#34; registered tonnage.&#34; On that point I should like to offer this criticism: That it is the first and &#39;foremost duty of the Government clearly to understand what is intended by a contract that it puts before Parliament. To me it does not much matter whether the gross tonnage of the vessels to be built by the contractors is to be 11,000 tons, or whether, as seems more likely, it is to be something approximating to 15,500 tons. But the Government should come here with a distinct and clear understanding of what the words in the contract mean. They would be able to state explicitly and directly that 11,000 tons registered tonnage means so much in terms that can be understood by every honorable senator. I listened carefully to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> and I gathered that he does not know what is meant. I have not heard him indicate what is meant. We have listened to many arguments as to what the words are intended to convey. But it ought not to be necessary for any single member of the Senate to have anything to say on this point, which ought to be expressed in language so clear that we could understand it at once, without having to debate what the real meaning of the agreement is. I am inclined - and I am sure many honorable senators are - to think that there are many things in this contract which are to be viewed with suspicion. Whether I am right or wrong, it appears to me that what the contractors have probably had in their mind&#39;s is the possibility - and I defer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> in saying this - of a registration in Australia which does not conform to the registration at Lloyds in England or under the Merchant Shipping Act. </para>

                        <para>- Possibly I am wrong; but we know that this company will have to pay heavy dues and charges on its boats coming through the Suez Canal on their registered tonnage. Our ports also impose charges and- dues in respect of registered tonnage. Consequently, it is practically certain that the company will make the registered tonnage of its vessels as low as possible. I have also secured this information during the adjournment - that the registered tonnage of the <inline font-style="italic">Mooltan,</inline> one of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company&#39;s vessels - which is advertised as being 10,500 tons - is about 4,900 tons.

                        <para>- I have a grave suspicion that if the company adopts the same system of registration as the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company adopts - taking the <inline font-style="italic">Mooltan</inline> as a sample - its boats will be nearly 22,000 tons gross. I do not imagine that these contractors are less astute than are the managers of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation. Company, and if that company can run a. boat of r 0,500 tons, and pay dues only on 4,900 tons registered tonnage, I think we may take it for granted that these contractors will do the same. If that be the case, the vessels are going to be of a gross, tonnage of about 22,000 tons. I think I am justified, therefore, in suspecting something behind this description of I I.000 tons registered tonnage. I venture to think that we are all entitled to have suspicions about it. Coming, to the contract itself, I do not think that clause 5 has. been touched upon. It deals with the possibility of &#39;attaining! increased speed by the payment of ai further sum of &#163;25,000- per annum. We have here - there is nothing in the contract to indicate it clearly,, but I think it is apparent - the possibility that these boats may be turbine steamers.. I wish to point out that the Government may have been caught napping with regard&#39; to this clause, if the vessels are to be turbine steamers. It is almost a matter of common knowledge that the economical rate of speed of turbine boats is very much higher than the economical rate of speed&#39; of steam-ships driven by any other method. I do not mean to say that this observation applies actually to the boats referred to in this contract. But let me give an instance. We have running in Australian waters theLoongana,. The economical rate of speed&#39; of that boat is 16.6 knots per hour, which means that, if the <inline font-style="italic">Loongana</inline> is to be run&#62; at a payable rate  to  her owners, she must </para>

                <para class="block">Tun at 16.6 knots per hour. The distance from Adelaide to Brindisi is, I have ascertained, 8,815 miles and the rate at which these boats are to run - allowing eighteen hours for stoppages - averages alittleover14milesanhour. I can conceive it to be quite possible, if they were turbine boats, that it would be just as cheap for the company to run them at the additional rate of speed provided&#39; for in clause5, as it would be to run them at a lower rate. </para>

                        <para>- The company may say, &#34; We are going to run these boats at a payable speed, and we ask&#39; you to give us so much more money for doing so,&#34; -whereas the fact may be that the additional increased rate will involve no more cost. In other words, the Commonwealth will be paying&#163;25,000 for nothing. </para>

I have worked out the rate of speed at which they will have to run to reduce the journey to 612 hours, as provided in clause 5. The average will be under 15 miles an hour.

                        <para>- No; but the salient feature of all turbine boats is that they can run at a higher rate of speed than their economical rate. The turbine is only suitable when a high rate of speed is desired. That is the essence of it. Now I come to clause 6 ; and here I wish to give notice of an amendment that I think ought to be moved. My first criticism is that I am unable to ascertain for what reason the Government has hit upon the sixth year of the fixed period of ten years, for ascertaining whether there is a better line in competition with the mail steamers affected by this contract. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> gave no explanation, and on the face of it, one may well wonder why the sixth year has been chosen&#39;. Why not the fifth or the seventh? I see no reason to limit it to the sixth. I see no reason, if we are going to get a better service, and if it is desirable that we should get a better service, why we should limit ourselves to a period, when the fifth year of the contract has gone by. This is one of those arbitrary selections which have to be made, but which nothing in particular can justify. </para>

                        <para>- Possibly it has been chosen because it represents one-half of the contract period. Expressing purely my own opinion as to the construction of clause 6, I have not the slightest doubt whatever that the extended period&#39; referred to in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> means a period beyond and over the fixed term of ten years. I have been informed that the Attorney-General in another place said distinctly, clearly, without any reservation whatever, that that extended period would not go beyond the original fixed term of ten years. But I have heard that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> now admits that it does. I have no doubt what ever that on a strict construction, this extended period could mean nothing, but some period of time over and above the fixed term of ten years. Unless we put that interpretation upon the clause, I fail to see how we could interpret the extended period, and what meaning we could possibly give to paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c.</inline></para>

                        <para>- There is absolutely no limit. The question we have to consider is whether there ought to be an extended period over and above the ten years, or whether it is desirable that the period of the contract should be strictly limited to the ten years. As the clause reads, there is power to give the contractors a further period of ten years, or if you like, twenty years. That power is placed entirely in the hands of the Postmaster-General, acting on behalf of the Executive. The introduction of the power to arbitrate clearly indicates that it is to be placed altogether outside the province of this Parliament to say for what, if any, period the contract shall be extended. I do not think that it is the desire of this Senate that the contract shall be extended under any circumstances beyond the ten years, without the ratification and authority of Parliament. If that be so, and assuming that that is the intention of the Senate - and I hope the intention of the Government - 1 propose to move an amendment to paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c.</inline></para>

                        <para>- I do not think so. The Standing Orders provide that an amendment may be moved by an honorable senator, and that in moving that amendment, . he may speak to the original question and to the . amendment. When the amendment so moved has been disposed of, other honorable senators, who have not spoken, may move other amendments ; but honorable senators who have spoken cannot move further amendments. Otherwise there would be no end ; an honorable, senator might speak, and afterwards continue moving amendments, and thus the discussion would never terminate. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> wished to move a further amendment after the amendment before us had been disposed of, he need not have spoken, but could have submitted his amendment by-and-by. </para>

                        <para>- We cannot go into Committee now, and those honorable senators who make the suggestion speak without knowledge of the Standing Orders. I admit that on one occasion a discussion was initiated in the Senate and finished in Committee. If that was a good practice, it would apply to every motion. Any motion might be half discussed in the Senate and then be taken into Committee. That is contrary to our Standing Orders; and if we initiate a discussion in the Senate we can not, in the middle of such discussion, go into Committee. I can see no reason why we should go into Committee on this motion. I quite admit that a great many amendments may be moved, and the motion may be discussed at great length, but I see no reason whatever to depart from the fundamental Standing Orders of the Senate in this connexion. </para>

                        <para>- That being your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> I suggest the desirability of postponing the discussion in order to consider some means of going into Committee. The proper consideration of the motion must necessarily be seriously hampered if we deal with amendments in the Senate only. Unless we go into Committee there will obviously be a restriction on the power of honorable senators to improve the contract as they think fit. I suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> that he should consent to an adjournment of the debate, in order, as I say, that you, sir, may consider some means of permitting us to go into Committee. So far as I am concerned, I am willing to refrain from making any further remarks, and to regard myself as being cut off from submitting amendments which I think desirable. I may indicate, however, how, in my opinion, paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> ought to be amended. I should like honorable senators to understand that I make these suggestions on the assumption that they do not approve of an extended term being granted by the Executive, that is to say, by the Postmaster-General, as expressed in the clause. What I should like to move is that paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> should be amended to read as follows: - </para>

                        <para>- Certainly. The position would be that if the contractors wanted to give an accelerated service they could do so at any time after six years, but they could not do so for a longer time than the ten years originally fixed without the sanction of Parliament. Whether honorable senators approve of such an amendment or not is for them to decide ; but, as I say, I submit it on the assumption that we do not desire to extend the period for more than ten years without giving Parliament an opportunity to go into the question. That exhausts my criticism of clause 6 ; and I think I have already expressed my opinion as to clause II, which deals with the registered tonnage. But I may indicate an amendment which, if we were in Committee, I should certainly submit in order to make that clause clearer. I should like to insert words providing that the ships to be employed in pursuance of this agreement &#34; shall for the purposes of payment of dues and charges be of a registered tonnage of 11,000 tons.&#34; If we had such a provision we should know exactly what we are doing; but, again, I am debarred from submitting an amendment in that direction. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator misunderstands me. I am not quarrelling with the provision of 11,000 tons, but with the uncertainty on  the part of the Government as to what their own contract means. I object: to vote for an agreement the terms of which I do not understand. There has been much debate as to what &#39; 1 registered tonnage 1 &#39; means, and I venture to say that many honorable senators do not understand its meaning.. If, however, we insert words to the effect I have suggested, the point will be made clear. If the contractors contended that such a tonnage was too much, they would be exposed as practically endeavouring to induce us to believe that the vessels to be employed would be of 20,000 tons. We certainly ought to have an opportunity to debate this matter in Committee. If it is worth discussing at all, the agreement is worth an honest attempt to improve it. There is another debatable clause, which has so far escaped much criticism, and to which I shall not devote much time. I entirely object to, dissent from, and dislike clause 36 of the general conditions of tender. As honorable senators will notice, that clause is not like a similar clause im the contract made bv the Imperial authorities with the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company or in the contract with the Orient and Pacific Steam Navigation Company. If the power given; were to purchase the vessels for defence purposes in time of emergency and stress I should have no objection. Whether I have to vote for the contract or not, I desire to say that </para>

                <para class="block">I disagree with this clause. I object to the Postmaster-General having the right at any time to purchase the boats at a valuation, and also to his having the right at any time to charter them. This, again, is a power given to the Executive Government, without any provision for consideration bv Parliament. I admit there is pro.bably a safeguard in the fact that a sum for the purpose would have to appear on the Estimates; but I object to the principle. </para>

                        <para>- I do not propose to offer any further criticism1 of this contract. Reluctant as I am to oppose the agreement, I shall have to do so, unless some at least of the alterations I have indicated are made. I cannot consent, for instance, to agree to a contract the terms of which I have to pretend I understand, or on the terms of which I have to place my own interpretation, which may possibly differ from the Minister&#39;s interpretation. I decline _ to agree to even a resolution the terms of which the Ministers themselves openly admit they do not understand. Such a position would be derogatory to the dignity of this or any other Chamber. In this connexion let me indicate what previously happened in the case of the proposed contract with the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company. Honorable senators, I have no doubt, remember that in that proposed contract there was a clause which induced some of us to believe - I merely quote this by way of illustration - that if the contract were agreed to, certain old contracts with the various States Governments would thereupon be annulled, and have no force or effect. </para>

                        <para>- It was pointed out in the Senate that considerable doubt was created by the words of the agreement, as to whether those old contracts would be rendered null and void by the adoption of the new agreement. It was asserted that the Attorney-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Isaacs,</inline> had stated that the operation of the words would be sufficient - that the old contracts would go. But the Senate, I think verv wisely, decided to make the provision clear, and inserted words by which it was specifically stated, without equivocation or doubt, that if the agreement were ratified, the old contracts should expire, and have no further force or effect. We know the sequel. Whether for that reason or some other- </para>

                        <para>- There was; but with deference to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> I did subsequently attach very great importance to the fact that the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company _ refused to ratify that agreement. Rightly or wrongly, I thought their refusal was largely due to the fact that we had provided, in explicit terms, that the old contracts should be of no force if we adopted the new contract. The Eastern Extension Telegraph Company presented a clause which was vague and misleading, and we made it clear. That illustration applies with considerable force to the present agreement; and I urge honorable senators not to support too hastily, an agreement which has much to recommend it, but to make certain that we clearly understand what the contract is we are allowing the Government to enter into. </para>

In the circumstances, I suggest that if it is considered by the Senate that it is advisable to discuss this matter in Committee, the present debate should be adjourned, and, before the time fixed for its resumption has arrived, a motion might be made, after notice, that the motion be referred to the Committee of the whole Senate. If that is d&#39;one, the amendments of the motion now before the Senate will disappear, because they will not have been moved in the Committee, and the whole question will be considered afresh. If it is the wish of the Senate that that should be done, it can be done in accordance with our Standing Orders, but it will be necessary to get rid of the debate in the Senate first of all. If the debate is adjourned, the Minister in charge of the matter, or some other honorable senator, can give notice of a motion that the matter should be discussed in the Committee of the Whole. </para>

                    <para>. - We referred by way of anticipation to this clause when dealing with&#39; sub-clause 3 of clause 25. I then pointed out that this clause came within the division of the Bill headed &#34; Compensation,&#34; which in itself is complete. Honorable senators are aware that under the Acts Interpretation Act the headings of divisions and sub-divisions form part of a Bill. It is for that reason that this clause 32, with all its particularity as indicated in paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of sub-clause 2, finds its place here rather than in Part III. of the Bill, although it refers to damage in every case where the owner or occupier is affected by acts done under the powers conferred by Part III. Subclause 2 specifically deals with cases where owners are damaged by reason, not of the acquisition of particular land, but of the temporary occupation of land in connexion with the acquisition of adjoining land. The clause applies wholly to the powers under Part III. of the Bill, and with special force to any damage which may be occasioned by the exercise of powers given under clauses 23 and 24. I think that it covers, so far as Part III. is concerned, all that is required, and, so far as clauses 23 and 24 are concerned, all possible cases of damage that might arise under them. </para>

                    <para>. - I think I indicated the reason for the alteration in moving the second reading of the Bill. In actual practice it has been found that in some instances claims for compensation have not been furnished within the time prescribed by the existing Act, and, owing to the hard-and-fast rule applied!, it is now necessary for a claimant desiring an extension of time in a meritorious case to go to the High Court, a:nd incur the costs and delay involved in making his application. The alteration referred to in this clause is to enable a claimant to secure assent to an application for an extension! of time, without any necessity for recourse to that tribunal at all. </para>

                    <para>. - Might I point out to the honorable senator that the only thing that would follow in the case he supposes would be that the Minister would have to go through the procedure provided for in clause 40, as if no claim were made. It would cause him additional trouble if he refused the application! for an extension of time, whilst the claimant&#39;s rights would still be conserved. </para>

                        <para>. - I wish to draw attention to the fact that this clause makes an alteration in the existing law which is, I think, of some importance. In section 20 of the existing Act it is provided that in all cases where compensation is awarded, or costs are adjudged to be paid, the money shall be paid by the Commonwealth within one month from the determination. In this clause, however, there is no stipulation as to any period within which compensation shall be paid. The rate of interest to be allowed on the sum which has been awarded, or which is payable to the individual is limited to 3 per cent. That can hardly be called an adequate recompense for keeping a man out of his money. If the percentage were that which is ordinarily allowed in law courts, namely, 5 per cent., perhaps the proposed alteration of the existing law would not be of so much importance. But, seeing that we are asked to limit the rate to 3 per cent., which I admit is the same as the rate prescribed in the existing Act, I think that in the clause we ought to set out the period within which the Commonwealth shall pay the money. Bearing in mind that the interest allowed for neglecting to make prompt payment is so miserably inadequate, I ask the Minister if he will agree to the re-insertion of the provision making the amount payable within one month from the date of the determination ? </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator, of course, gauges my object, which is to have a reasonable limit fixed. I am not wedded to one month any more than to six weeks. It seems to be that where all the formalities have been complied with, and, by the Court or some other machinery, a determination has been arrived at, a month&#39; from the date of the determination is a sufficiently reasonable period within which to ask the Commonwealth to make payment. It may be that the acquisition of the land has taken place many months previously, but the interest payable on the amount of the compensation is only to run from the date of the determination. I ask the Minister if he has any objection to insert sub-section 1 of section 20 of the existing Act, or any amendment which would achieve that end. That sub-section reads as follows : - </para>

I would suggest to my honorable friend that possibly it would be better, if he desires a similar provision to be inserted, to have it inserted, not as an addendum to this clause, but as a new clause, either to precede or to follow clause 41. If he is prepared to follow that course, I shall offer no objection at the recommittal stage, of the Bill to an opportunity being afforded for the consideration of a new clause to that effect. </para>

                    <para>. - I thought that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> was going, to call attention to the fact that 3 per cent. is a very low rate of interest for the Commonwealth to give. I ask the Minister whether he thinks it is fair to give only that rate? I find that in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of clause 42 31/2 per cent. is mentioned as the basis of the actuarial calculation to be made thereunder, and as no State can now borrow at less than that rate, it is rather unfair to the land-owner to make him take 3 per cent. Whether it is to be 3 per cent. or not, it should run from the date of the acquisition of the land, because the first thing that the Government do is to enter thereon. In Tasmania, for instance, some land was taken just below Hobart for the purpose of a fort. The land-owner came to me to complain that very nearly twelve months before that time the Commonwealth, by surveyors and others, had entered upon his land, and that he had heard no more about the matter. For nearly a year he was in a state of anxiety and uncertainty as to whether he was going to be the owner of the land or not. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so; but my honorable friend will observe that the Bill already provides that the person shall be compensated, not only for the land actually acquired from him, but for any damage which may be occasioned to him by virtue of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by Part III. If, therefore, the officers of the Commonwealth enter upon any land for the purpose of viewing it and considering whether it is desirable to acquire that particular piece or any adjoining land for a public purpose, and if, by reason of their entry, which possibly may precede by a lengthy period the actual acquisition of the land, the owner is in any way endamaged, he will recover compensation for the land. This, however, is a provision as to the rate of interest. We have decided that in cases where the land is actually acquired the compensation shall bear interest as from the date of its acquisition or from the time when the right to compensation arose. If it be a question of entering upon the land for the purpose of viewing it the right to compensation will arise from the time of incurring the actual damage. So that there is no necessity to specify that in every instance it shall arise from the entry upon the land. The actual damage occasioned by the entry will ground a claim to compensation, altogether apart from the compensation for any land which might be acquired, and the interest on that portion of the compensation would run from the date when the right thereto arose. I think that my honorable friend will see that it is far better to leave the provision as it is. If the person whose case he cited did suffer any damage his right to compensation would arise at the time when it was suffered!, and the interest would run from that date as regards that portion of his claim. </para>

                    <para>. - With regard to fixing a time limit, I am quite content to adopt the Minister&#39;s suggestion to allow the matter to stand over until the recommittal stage is reached. But as he has already undertaken to get certain amendments drafted in respect of clauses which he has agreed! to recommit, I would ask him if he will get the draftsman to draft an amendment to carry out my suggestion. I am entirely with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> with regard <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> the rate of interest. It is an anomaly to say that we will resume the lands of a State and pay it31/2 per cent. interest on its money from the time when payment is due, whilst, when we resume the property of an individual, we will allow him only 3 per cent. The rates of interest should be uniform. In cases which come before the Courts&#39;, I have never heard any one object to 5 per cent. being allowed in commercial transactions. The whole of a private individual&#39;s capital may be involved. The Commonwealth Government looks it up and pays him only 3 per cent, upon it. _ It seems to me that if the Commonwealth Government, for the purposes of a post-office, takes a portion of a man&#39;s land, and perhaps a little shop which he has upon it, representing his sole wealth, it should at least treat him as liberally as it treats a State. It is not even logical to allow 3 per cent. to an individual and31/2 per cent, to a State. I move - </para>

                    <para>. - I hope that the Minister will not accept the amendment. There is a good reason why a distinction should be made between an individual and a State. If the individual were to sell his land, it is not probable that he would get an immediate investment. He would probably put his money in the bank. If he deposited it on current account he would get no interest. If he put it in the Savings Bank, he would get only 3 per cent. </para>

                        <para>- In Victoria, where the largest Savings Bank business is done, the interest allowed is not more than 3 per cent. The Government is not likely to hold the money of an individual when it has to pay 3 per cent, interest on it. The Commonwealth Government is not in the same position as a State Government, which runs payable enterprises like railways. The Commonwealth Government runs unpayable enterprises, and, until such time as we have a Commonwealth Bank, it would be unprofitable for the Government to retain a man&#39;s money and pay 3 per cent. interest on it. If there were a high rate of interest, it would be an inducement to the individual to leave his money with the Government until he could find a better investment. </para>

                    that there appears to be an inequality in our dealing with an individual and with the States. But one of the objects of this Bill is to facilitate prompt payment, and&#39; to induce prompt acceptance of payment. A low rate of interest would be one means of facilitating prompt acceptance of payment. I look upon it as extremely undesirable that when money is made available, it should be left in the hands of the Commonwealth officers. It would be useless for investment purposes. If the Commonwealth must have the money available at any time when the claimant likes to come for it, it is not of any advantage to the Government to retain it. Very little injury can accrue to the person to whom the money is due. I am inclined to favour a low rate of interest, for the reason that the Commonwealth Government cannot have any use for the money. It will be an encumbrance rather than an advantage to retain it in the possession of the Government, when the person to whom it is due can claim it at any moment.

                    <para>.- This clause seems to provide a backhanded way of arranging the matter. I do not think there is any necessity for clause 45, which provides for the investment of compensation deposited in the Treasury. Why cannot we, in the clause before us, provide that the Minister may deposit the money in the Treasury, the sum so deposited to bear interest at 3percent. ? It appears to me that when money is kept in the Treasury, and an owner cannot be found for it, interest ought to be paid. I advise the Minister to simply provide, at the end of this clause, that interest shall be paid, and to strike out clause 45. </para>

                    <para>. - I think the arrangement of the provisions in the Bill is the better one. The clause under discussion provides when and under what circumstances the Minister may deposit the money in the Treasury, and, further, that he shall, at the same time, deposit a memorandum setting out the material facts relating to the matter. It would not be sufficient to make the amendment suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson.</inline> In clause 45 we propose to provide expressly that the Minister may, at the risk of the person, invest the compensation in the Government securities of either the Commonwealth or the States. These securities might bear interest either above or below 3 percent. ; and the interest that would accrue to the owner would be the actual interest earned by the investment. I think that is a more reasonable provision than to fix the Interest at 3 per cent. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> seems somewhat disturbed about the treatment of the mortgagee under this clause. It seems to me, in reading the clause, and bearing in mind a recent discussion here, that the mortgagee is the one individual specially singled out for favorable treatment. I desire to direct attention to the extremely enviable position in which he is placed as compared with the unfortunate individual on whose behalf I ventured fo say a few words some moments ago. Under this clause we do not merely tell the mortgagee that he shall get 3 .per cent. ; we provide that he shall have all he is legally entitled to, we give him six months&#39; interest in advance, and then - and this is the point to which I specially direct attention - we go to the length of providing that if the interest to which he would be entitled if his mortgage continued in force is higher than the interest he could obtain by an ordinary investment at current rates of interest, the Commonwealth shall make good the difference. </para>

                        <para>- It seems to me that the mortgagee is placed in a particularly favorable position. I do not quarrel with that; but I draw attention to the fact that there is no corresponding clause for the unfortunate mortgagor, nor for the unfortunate individual who must be content to take payment when the Commonwealth chooses to make it, and be satisfied &#34;with 3 per cent. After the recent division I do not propose to press the matter. I find it idle to address arguments to honorable senators, who consistently abstain from listening to them. </para>

                    <para>. - This provision apparently limits the Minister to giving six months&#39; notice, and, in view of what has been said as to the business aptitude of Ministers, is there any necessity to limit the Minister to giving six months&#39; notice ? I see no advantage in tying the Minister&#39;s hands. It might be desirable that he should be able to give nine months&#39; notice. His Department might know that, in connexion with the carrying out of a public work, certain land would be required in nine months&#39; time, and it might be desirable to give a. more extended notice to the owner or mortgagee of the land. </para>

                        <para>- And in the meantime the mortgagor and mortgagee might agree to the erection of a building on the land. I am asking whether there is any advantage to be gained by limiting the notice which the Minister may give. If he knows that in nine months&#39; time he will resume a piece of land, what earthly objection can there be to give him power to notify the parties concerned that it is his intention to do so? Why should he not do that, instead of keeping the secret to himself until three or four months before the time at which the resumption must take place. The Minister, or his Department, may foresee that in nine or twelve months&#39; time it will be necessary, for the purpose of some public work, to acquire a certain portion of land, and I fail to see what objection there can be to giving the persons interested the longest possible notice. Under the clause, apparently, the Minister must wait until six months from the time the land is acquired before he can give notice of the intention to resume it. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. It is not a power given to the Minister, but a duty cast upon him. We provide, first of all, that if any land acquired under the Bill by agreement is subject to a mortgage, the Minister may pay off the mortgage. Then we prescribe how he shall do it, and, in order thereto, we provide that the Minister shall give notice to the mortgagee. If the Minister knows that the land will be required twelve months before it is necessary to acquire it, there is nothing to prevent him giving twelve months&#39; notice of the intention to resume the land. But this provision imposes a duty upon the Minister to give a certain notice. </para>

If the Department had to go and pay the mortgagee&#39;s solicitor for the production of the deed, it would not only be inconvenient and possibly in some instances harassing, but it might be used very often to prevent the Commonwealth from acquiring the land with the expedition which might be necessary. </para>

                <para class="block">The object in making this amendment is because it is intended to insert another paragraph which may be seen on the amendment notice-paper. The present provisions in the clause are that, if any land be acquired under the Act, the Governor-General shall authorize the disposal of it as he thinks fit, and that a return of all lands disposed of under that particular power shall be tabled in Parliament. In the various States the Departments have a number of properties which are not of very great value. For instance, the Defence or Post and Telegraph Department may have an allotment of land upon which there stands a building which is not being used for its purposes at all. A person in the locality may desire to lease or to get the right to occupy that property for a certain specific purpose. In some instances these properties are let to such persons at a nominal rental of 2s. 6d. or1s. or 5s. a week. It is like using a Nasmyth hammer to crack a nut to ask that the Governor-General shall be called upon in each trivial instance to authorize the letting of the property. So it is proposed to give to the Minister the power, in every instance where the lease would not be for a period longer than three years, and where the annual rental would not exceed&#163;50. In an earlier part of the Bill we inserted a corresponding clause to enable the Minister to acquire directly such rights without recourse to the Governor-General. </para>

                        <para>. - It will be remembered that on clauses 10 and 11 there was a good deal of discussion. It was pointed out that in clause 10 it was provided that the purchase money might be paid to the person who, under the Act, was empowered to sell and convey the land. We had already provided in clause 9 that persons having limited interests should have the power to sell and convey the land. We provided in clause 10 that the purchase money should be paid to such person, but there was no reference made as to the application of the purchase money by such person amongst those others who might be, perhaps, more interested in the land than he himself, although he held the legal estate. Then in clause11, we had this provision - </para>
