            <para class="block">The short title, I think, should agree, as far as possible, with the long title, and the object of the Bill. It is a Bill for the acquisition of lands by the Commonwealth, and consequently we want to so frame the short title that the uninitiated may readily understand what the object aimed at is. The short title merely compresses the long title into the fewest available number of words. The term, " Eminent Domain," is misleading in that it covers a very great deal more than the acquisition of land. Eminent Domain " is not what is being dealt with by the Bill. It is a mere theoretical expression which indicates the source from which power is derived for the purpose of enabling a sovereign authority to take lands forcibly, if need be, from: the individual for the good of the community. That is a power which rests necessarily in every sovereign authority, because the interests of the individual must be subordinated to those of the community. " Eminent Domain " is not a familiar expression to any of us, and even those who are' trained English lawyers are unaccustomed to it. It is not known to the municipal law of England or the British Empire. It is used by public writers on international law, as indicating that condition of things in relation to an independent sovereign in his own territorial dominions, ' which precludes any other sovereign from exercising domain within them. That was the origin of the expression. It was a phrase used in international public law. Within the last twenty-five or thirty years it has been adopted in America to . indicate that the United States, in the exercise of their power as a sovereign people, were entitled to acquire forcibly, if need be. not merely the lands of private persons, but all their personal property. Everything which was supposed to belong to private individuals in the community was liable, as it is under any sovereignty, to be taken over for State exigencies or necessities. The term is used in that country, but it is not known to the English law. It does not define the object of this Bill. If " Eminent Domain " is to be adopted as a doctrine here, and the subject of enactment, it ought not to be used as a short title. A Bill which is for a limited purpose to deal with the acquisition of lands only should not be covered by such a short title as though it were dealing with the acquisition of all property which belonged to private individuals, and which was intended to be taken for the benefit of a State. I think it will be plain to -honorable senators that that will be undesirable. The Bill docs not deal with those principles, even as they are understood in America, which are covered by the theoretical expression " Eminent Domain." It only covers the acquisition of lands. We should make the short title of the Bill intelligible to the casual reader. Then I have a strong objection to our importing terms with which we are not familiar. </para>

                    <para>- This is one of the exceptions to the rule. When I find a good thing being offered to me from outside, I am prepared to take it, but when I find a toad thing, or a thing which is not applicable to our conditions, then I think that the better plan is foi us to keep it out. Again, by the use of the expression " Eminent Domain," we are raising grave doubts as to what the scope and intention of the Bill is, even in relation to lands. The Bill is not intended to deal .with sovereignty or domain over the lands taken bv the Commonwealth. Whatever the jurisdiction mav be, it will exist independently of the Bill, until it is dealt with bv a special enactment. The Bill is not intended to change in any way the law which will operate on lands taken over by the Commonwealth under powers therein contained. But if we use the expression " Eminent Domain," it may be. open to doubt . whether we do not intend to enlarge in some way the Commonwealth jurisdiction. It might be construed in order to justify a claim which would give jurisdiction to the Commonwealth over whatever lands it acquired in a State, so that the local law should no longer run, and this position of affairs might be open to argument. We know how easy it is to raise subtle arguments on points of that kind. When an offence was committed on an area acquired by the Commonwealth, it might be argued that it was like a sort of reserved territory, in which an arrest for the offence could not be made under the State authority. I do not say whether to that extent it world be effective or not, but questions of that sort might easily be raised. Difficulties of many kinds are suggested by the use of a new expression, which it is unnecessary to employ. Finally, if honorable senators will look at what the title is, they will see that it is quite unnecessary for us to adopt a new-fangled expression like " Eminent Domain." </para>

                    <para>. - After listening very carefully to the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> both yesterday and this morning, I venture to suggest to the Committee that he has not advanced any solid reason why the title he urges should be adopted in preference to the short title of. the Bill. No doubt we all aim at getting simplicity in titles. The title of the present Act - Property for Public Purposes Acquisition Act - is' very cumbersome. The title which is suggested by the amendment is " Lands Acquisition Act." In all the States there is a number of Acts on this subject. Here, for instance, is a volume of Tasmanian Statutes, in which I find following close upon one another a Land for Public Purposes Acquisition Act 1884, a Lands Resumption Act 189-1, and Lands Resumption Act 1902. There is another Act bearing on the same subject which does not seem to have any particular short title. Then there are the Lands Vesting Act 1898, and the Lands 'Clauses Act 1857. All these Acts have their parallels in the Statutes of the different States. There is one way of indicating to the people of the States who will be affected by legislation of this character, which is analogous to States legislation, the difference between the enactments of the Commonwealth and the corresponding enactments of the States. </para>

                        <para>- They have no patent right in it, and the fact that they have adopted it should not influence us in the direction of being scared at the novelty of the term, so far as Australia is concerned. It is advisable that we should have, wherever we can, a short title for our Bills, and' we should also, if we conveniently can, have as a short title, wherever there is a corresponding subject in States legislation, one that will clearly indicate to those who will be the subject of both classes of legislation, the distinction between Commonwealth and State laws. The object is that they may know, when either class of legislation is being put into effect, whether it is State or Commonwealth legislation. For these reasons, I think that the title is one that I can fairly ask the Committee to let stand. I shall therefore ask honorable senators, if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> will not withdraw his amendment, to assist me in maintaining the title as it appears in the Bill. lt is a title that clearly expresses the class of power which the Commonwealth would be exercising. lt indicates that under the provisions of this measure the Commonwealth would be exercising its power for the purpose of acquiring land. It would te for public purposes that the Commonwealth as a sovereign power would be resuming property, and it would be resumed subject to that provision which is incident to the exercise of "Eminent Domain" - that is, according to the individual who is deprived of his property with adequate compensation. </para>

                    <para>. - In our legislation we should, I think, always consider the interests of the public, and in a special decree the interests of persons who are likely to be affected. We have now to consider the case of a man who is the owner of land which is likely to be taken away from him by the Federal power. He has a right to be placed in a position in which he can find out the easiest possible manner under what conditions his land is to be taken away. I know that it is almost impossible to hope that, generally speaking, a layman will be able to understand the law when he sees it. </para>

A layman whose land is to be taken away by the Commonwealth will probably procure a copy of the Commonwealth Statutes.

He will naturally assume that there he will find the law on the subject: nor will he ever suspect that that Act has been repealed1 'by another bearing the title " Eminent Domain Act." </para>

                        <para>- We have in all the States Acts dealing with the resumption of land, and in every case in the short title there is something to show what is the subject-matter of the Act. The Minister in charge of the Bill has expressed the fear that the amendment would give rise to confusion as between the Commonwealth Statutes and the States Statutes on the subject. It must be remembered, however, that any person sufficiently interested to search the law on the subject would know that it was to be found in a Commonwealth Statute, seeing that a Federal power was to be exercised, and, therefore, I cannot see that any confusion could arise. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon*</inline> has made it abundantly clear that the short title of the Bill is not the most appropriate that could be selected. I support the amendment on the ground that our Statutes ought to be made as clear as possible to the public, especially those members of the public who are particularly affected. That end can best be attained by adopting a short title which clearly indicates the subject-matter of the Bill, and directs the attention of the public to the fact that the Act which was passed in 1901 has been repealed. </para>

                    SYMON (South Australia) [11. 2]. - I do not know that, in an ordinary case of a short title, I should be disposed to say another word, but this matter is much more important than perhaps some honorable members imagine. It could not possibly be suggested that I submit this amendment with any intention to be troublesome; my sole object is the simplification of the Bill. I am in no way scared by the use of a term that bears an American mark. We have substantially, and certainly in principle, derived our Constitution from that of the United States; and I have

                    objection to any constitutional or municipal law phrase which may be brought from America, so long as it is applicable, and understandable of the people. The Honorary Minister has given no reason why we should not adopt the simple non-technical expression, " Lands Acquisition Act," as a short title. " Eminent Domain " is, in essence and on its face, a technical expression, and I am bound to say, without doing any injustice to their learning or knowledge, that there are scores of lawyers in Australia who, if they tumbled across the phrase in an index of Acts of Parliament, would have to refer to one of the many dictionaries consulted by the Minister, in order to ascertain what was meant.

                        <para>- That is so. If a lawyer were looking into the matter at the instance of a client, he would, after having ascertained the interpretation of " Eminent Domain," have to explain that the Act did not deal with the subject of Eminent Domain:, but simply with that part of it which relates to the acquisition of land. He would have to explain that the Act had nothing to do with that great part of the doctrine relating to the acquisition of all the property of an individual, if the necessities of the State demanded. </para>

                        <para>-Yes; what becomes of the unfortunate layman, for whom we are legislating? We are not legislating in order that, on the very threshold of the Act, the fortunate or unfortunate layman shall be sent to a lawyer. There e.re difficulties enough in the substance and the sections of Acts of Parliament, without making it necessary for a layman to consult a lawyer as to the very meaning of a title. The point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> requires one word more of emphasis. Four years ago we passed an Act with the same object that it is desired to achieve by reason of this Bill. The present legislation is supposed to be an improvement, and, therefore, I ask, why should we change the short title? This Bill, when it gets on the statute-book, will be indexed under the heading of " Eminent Domain," and nobody will know that it is practically the same legislation, or has any relation to the legislation, passed some years ago. The argument of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> is irrefutable, if we are to take into consideration the interests of the community, and not put the Statutes in a state of inextricable confusion. As a lawyer, I do not need the honorable Minister to instruct me as to the original meaning of " Eminent Domain.' The meaning is the assertion of the theory or doctrine that the sovereign authority is entitled, in case of national necessity, to take the property of any individual, whatever that property may be. The doctrine was imported from another public law into America, because in that country there was no sovereign, and, therefore, no expression to meet the case. The expression is not used in any English Act that I am acquainted with, but, of course, the doctrine exists in practice in the old country and finds expression in the Land Clauses Consolidation Act. Our legislation on the subject goes further, and requires the word "acquisition," so that the title of the present Act is correct. </para>

                        <para>- I am making no complaint on that score. The reason that we cannot use the title "Land Clauses Consolidation" or "Lands Compensation " is because the Bill also gives the power of acquisition. The long title, therefore, is quite proper, because it indicates that the legislation gives the power of 'acquisition, and also provides the machinery by which the acquisition shall be carried into effect. We must have a short title, to indicate, as far as possible, the substance of. the measure, and I suggest that, instead of going abroad for a technical phrase, we should use absolutely the simplest and most intelligible. In England the term "Eminent Domain" has never been adopted. In the States there is an expression more elaborate. </para>

                    <para>. - I have listened to the arguments in regard to the title of the Bill, and have been endeavouring to summarize them. So far as I understand the position, this title has been suggested, <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> the first place, because no one knows its meaning, and, in the second place, because, if some industrious person endeavoured to ascertain the meaning he would be sure to find that it was inapplicable, inasmuch as it embraces more than is embraced by the Bill. Further, it is clear that another reason why we are asked to. adopt the title of "Eminent Domain" is that when it had to be indexed, the index would be of no value to an ordinary person, who would never connect the phrase with the acquisition of land. If there were a fourth reason possible, it must be that if we do not use a title like this, no one will imagine it to be a Federal law instead of a State law. At any rate, these are the reasons which, I gather, are presented by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> for the use of the words " Eminent Domain." When I hear arguments for the adoption of a title so extraordinary, I think there must be a fault somewhere; and I shall vote against the use of the words " Eminent Domain." </para>

                    <para>. - I hope the Committee, in view of the reasons advanced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake,</inline> will decide to make an alteration in the title. No one who takes an interest in public life can fail to notice that legislation is becoming more and more confusing to the people; and it is our bounden duty to make our Acts of Parliament, and other public documents, so clear that they shall speak for themselves. It ought to be possible for any one who desires to look up Commonwealth legislation on a particular subject, to place his finger at once on the right Act. If anybody should support such a policy, it is the lay senators opposite. Those who have hitherto spoken on the question are representatives of the law, who may be trusted to find their way in the dark; but, in the interests of people outside the legal profession, our legislation ought to be made as simple as language will permit. </para>

                        <para>- It is possible that by that time I shall have lost all opportunity to make an amendment to meet the difficulty. Under the existing Act conditional purchasers in New South Wales and in the other States are regarded as the owners of the land, and if the Commonwealth thought fit to resume their land, they would have to be dealt with directly. But by the definition of " Crown land " in this Bill the Commonwealth, in acquiring land of this description, would not deal with the men who are the equitable owners and in occupation of the land, but with the State Government, and the unfortunate conditional selectors would be left to fight for whatever compensation they could get from their State Government. I know of no other part of this Bill in which it would be proper for me to debate this question, but I shall not object to the postponement of the definition clause if the Minister will indicate any other provision of the Bill on which the matter may be discussed, or, if he cannot do that, will give me an assurance that he will not oppose a recommittal, or the adoption of such other course as will enable the difficulty to be brought fairly before the Committee. </para>

In replying briefly yesterday on the second- reading debate, I indicated that I thought he need have very little apprehension on the subject, because, in my opinion, the definition of " land " taken in conjunction with the definition of " Crown land " will entirely overcome the difficulty. The definition of " land " includes any estate or interest in land, legal or equitable. </para>

When we come to deal with clause 57, the honorable senator will see that " a part of any land comprised in a lease" does not necessarily refer to a lease from a private person. We give in this Bill a definition of " Crown land " first of all, and what we do desire to cover is land which is purely the subject, so to speak, of a promise on the part of a State to sell to a third person. </para>

In asking for the postponement of the definition clause, I am but following the usual custom. It is possible that some amendment made in the Bill will involve the insertion of new definitions, and in the circumstances it is desirable that the definition clause should be considered after the other clauses have been dealt with. Honorable senators may be aware that it is the usual practice in Great Britain for definition clauses to appear after the other clauses of a Bill. Here we have adopted a contrary practice, but it has been our custom to postpone the definition clause until after the consideration 6f the other clauses. </para>

There is no necessity to deal wilh both subjects in the same Bill. I pointed out the desirability, out of courtesy to the status of the sovereign States of passing a separate Bill, and said that I intended to move an amendment upon the second definition in the clause. I do not wish to raise difficulties in the way of postponing the clause if that opportunity will be open sufficiently at a later stage. Here it would come conveniently, because if the definition of "Crown lands." were eliminated it would indicate that the Senate desired that the provisions with regard to the compulsory taking of Crown land from a State should be dealt with by a separate Bill, and that a nicer method if possible should be adopted, than that of merely putting a notification in the
                    <inline font-style="italic">Gazette,</inline>
                    and stating that such notification should take the land away from the State, and vest it in the Commonwealth. There is another point which arises out of the definitions of " land" and " owner,"- which terms include a State. We now have an excellent opportunity qf dealing with that subject, but if the Minister will indicate that it may be sufficiently done elsewhere, then, of course, I shall offer no objection to the postponement of the clause. Then with regard to tho definition of "public purpose" he intimated yesterday, as we all expected, that it is not intended that the provisions of this measure should a D p 1 v to the land for the Federal Capital Site. I propose to make that quite clear by inserting an exception in the definition of " public purpose." Mv honorable friend knows that I entirely accept his assurance, but an assurance is not an Act of Parliament.

First of all, he gives us an assurance that there is no such intention, and then he thinks that under the powers of the Bill it might not be done, but as I pointed out yesterday in the clause with regard to compensation, the significant words " subject to the Constitution." are introduced. That is to say, a State cannot get any compensation for land which it has to part with for nothing, and the only lands which a State has to part with for nothing are those which may be taken for the purpose of the Federal Capital. I should like these points to be disposed of as early as possible. If my honorable friend will indicate where they may be conveniently raised, I shall offer no objection to the postponement of this clause. </para>

                        <para>. - If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symondesires</inline> to separate the provisions empowering the Commonwealth to acquire the Crown lands of a State from the machinery clauses, the best place for him to test the question will be on this definition clause, because I think that afterwards, in _ making provision for compulsory purchase, we enable the Commonwealth to acquire, in a certain way, the lands of an owner, and according to the definition the word "owner" includes a State. The three definitions to which the honorable senator has referred would have to be altered in order to enable the Crown land of a State to be dealt with differently from the mode proposed by the Bill. I refer to the definitions of "Crown land," "land," and "owner." My honorable friend has again referred to the possible acquisition, under the terms of this measure, of land in New South Wales for the purpose of a Federal Capital. Yesterday I said that, as far as I knew, it was never intended to use its provisions for that purpose. I explained then that 1 used the qualification " as far as I know," because it was not until about a minute before that that the idea was ever suggested to me, and that was by an honorable senator who was engaged at the table in making some notes. But, upon looking through the Bill, I do not think that it could very well be used for that purpose. My recollection, when the point was raised yesterday, was that it was raised in connexion with the Bill of 1901. </para>

During the postponement of the clause, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symonmay</inline> give his consideration to this feature of the Bill, that it simply provides for acquiring the legal estate in the land in a State, the title of the Commonwealth to which will be registered subject to the laws of the State in the records of the State. But. as regards the land acquired for the Federal Capital, that will be the territory of the Commonwealth, and independent of any jurisdiction as to registration, or anything of the kind, in the State. I am only drawing attention to this matter for the benefit of those who think that the Bill might be utilized for such a purpose. I give them an assurance that it is not intended by this Government, and never was intended, I believe, by any Government, to use the law for such a purpose ;that, on the other hand, it is intended to acquire the legal estate in the land as contradistinguished from the acquisition of Federal territory. </para>

                    SYMON (South Australia) [11.40].- I knew quite well that when the Minister of Defence applied his mind to the subject the difficulty would be solved at once. " If you put in two or three words," he says, "that will make it clear, and will absolve the Government from a promise." No Ministry likes to give an assurance which, when they happen to go out of office, as they all must do some day or other, may not be honoured.

                    knows that in the case of the Federal Capital' Site, not merely Crown land, but also private land, will have to be acquired. Whatever may be the case with Crown lands, there is no differentiation if private lands are required for that purpose. Of course, the legal estate will be vested in the Commonwealth, and the registration will be absolutely the same as if it were a private owner. The only difference will be that it will exercise sovereignty over the whole of the area, and the private lands will then become Crown lands of the Commonwealth. I do not think that that would remove the difficulty. The right solution is that which the Minister of Defence has offered to us, and which. I hope we shall all accept. As regards the definition of " Crown land,"

                <para>That is the simple power given to the Governor of a State by virtue of the Act, to sign the document. That, of course, is purely a, Ministerial act. In this Bill a very grave departure has been made. There is no comparison between the clause and the section, although the marginal note of the clause refers to section 5. Under this provision there is a distinct interference with the self-governing powers of the State. It relates, as was said yesterday in the course of the discussion, to' the selling of land privately - that is, not to taking it by compulsion. It declares that the Governor of a State may sell or lease to the Commonwealth any Crown land - by force of this Act, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the law of any State. </para>
                <para class="block">That is to say, suppose a State Parliament had passed an Act forbidding the alienation of any particular piece of land, the Executive, owing no responsibility to the Commonwealth, owing responsibility only to its own Parliament and its own electors, would be entitled to set the State Act at defiance, and enter into an agreement to sell that land to the - Commonwealth. I say, first of all, that, if anything of that sort is to be done, it must be done by the Executive of the State under its responsibility to its own Parliament and its own people. If land subject to an Act of Parliament of that kind is required by the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth can, of course, obtain it by compulsory taking under the subsequent provisions of this Bill. But it is not necessary that the Commonwealth should insert a provision enabling the State Government to set the State laws at defiance. The point is that this provision takes away the responsibility of a. State Government to its Parliament, by enabling the State Executive voluntarily to do something in defiance of an Act of its own Parliament-' under the authority of a Commonwealth Statute. I venture to think that no State would willingly submit to the Commonwealth Parliament imposing upon the Executive of the State duties of this kind, and taking away its responsibility to carry out the State laws. The Commonwealth power under the right of Eminent Domain, or sovereignty, may take the lands of a State, no matter for what purpose they have been dedicated, or reserved, or restricted bv the operation of a State Act. But the Commonwealth Parliament has no right to take away from the States Parliaments their control over their own Executives, and to relieve them from the duty of consulting their own Parliaments on the subject. Honorable senators have only to read the clause to see how far-reaching it is. I do not know why it should have been put -in this shape, and why the old section should have been changed/if the object was merely to enable the Governor of a State to do a Ministerial act by signing a grant without an agreement having been entered into. Of. course, a State Executive can enter into an agreement voluntarily, but subject to its responsibility to its Parliament. But if this clause were passed, its action would not be subject to its responsibility to Parliament at all, because here it is said that, notwithstanding anything in the law of any State, the Government of a State may sell, lease, or grant land to the Commonwealth. If the Commonwealth is not to interfere with the self-governing powers of the States, it would be better to restore the clause to the form in which this provision stands in the existing Act, enabling the Governor of a State to execute the grant ; or else it would be advisable to strike it out altogether, because the mode of executing a grant, or by whom it is to be executed, depends upon the local law. I doubt whether we 'have power to direct the Governor of a State, or to empower him to execute a grant. That, however, is a more or less harmless point. The real point is that we do not want to see an interference with a State power, or to lessen the responsibility of a State Executive to its own Parliament by a Commonwealth law, unless it is absolutely essential. </para>

I read together sections 3 and 5 of the existing Act. Section 3 provides that - </para>

                </quote>
                <para>Then, in order to carry out that provision, section 5 is supplementary-, and says that the Governor of a State may execute the necessary documents for the purpose. It is a matter of fact that if there is an agreement between the Governor-General representing the Commonwealth and the Governor of a State to acquire any State land, essentially the Governor must resort to the local laws for the purpose of enabling him to carry out that bargain. It is a bargain on the part of the. Commonwealth, on the one hand, to purchase land belonging to the State, and it is recognised that that property must be dealt with in accordance with the law of the State. Consequently my first view is that I do not think it is necessary that there should be any alteration whatever. But if an alteration is proposed, I am1 certainly disposed to agree with my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> that this clause is put in a rather unfortunate form - it may be unintentionally. It does seem to me to be very extraordinary that we in the Common wealth should set to work to legislate as to what the Governor of -a State shall do. It is unusual, and it is especially unnecessary in the case of a matter of mutual agreement. I suggest that there is an abstract principle involved! which may result in some friction.. It may be resented bv the States that we as a Commonwealth should say in- this clause that the Governor of a State, acting with the advice of the Executive Council thereof,, may do so and so.. The States may say,. " Thank you for nothing; we do not want you to authorize our Governors what to do and what not to do." We did not attempt to put it in that form in the old Act. We did not pretend to say what the Governor of a State might do: We did- not pretend' to give novel powers. The last case of the kind was the Meteorological Bill, which' was before us a little while ago. In that Bill there was inserted a clause enabling the Governor-General and the Governor of a State to come to a certain agreement. We did not attempt to say in the forefront of .the measure that the Governor of a State might do so and so. We enabled the Governor-General to enter into an arrangement with the Governor of a State, relying upon local powers and abilities for the purposes of carrying out that agreement. In the existing law it is put very plainly that the Governor- General may agree with the owners and with any State where the land to be acquired is the Crown land of a State. In the existing law t'he State is specifically mentioned; Certainly, even in the existing law, section 5 was not necessary, because when it says: that the Governor-General may enter into an agreement with respect to the purchase of Crown lands with a State, the Governor of a State has the power to enable him to carry that out. Therefore, seeing that the Government can achieve the same object in a manner involving less friction, and can enable the Governor-General to enter into agreements, relying, upon the local power which must necessarily exist, I would ask my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> to consider whether he cannot recast the clause, in order that we may follow precedents, and avoid any possibility of friction and resentment on the part of the States. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> point out what I think is a very curious matter in connexion with this clause, and one that is especially worthy of consideration in a legislative body like the Senate. It is in one respect an ordinary provision, which would appear in any Land Resumption Act of a State, dealing with the transfer of any property acquired by such a State from any private individual in it. But the position which we are confronted with is verv different. We have to consider, not merely the means by which the Commonwealth can acquire the land that is at present the property of private persons : but also the means whereby the Commonwealth shall acquire the land of a State. Such a case cannot exist in any ordinary State law. The persons at issue there are simply the State itself and private individuals. Here there is a very different issue. In my opinion, it is extremely desirable that the provisions for acquiring lands for the Commonwealth from private individuals and from States should be kept separate. We ought to have two Bills, one dealing with the acquisition of property from private persons, and the other with the acquisition of property from the States. Of course, it might be possible, bv a different arrangement of the Bill, to disentangle the two matters, so as to make the distinction perfectly obvious to any one interested, whether he be a member of a. State Ministry, a member of a State Parliament, or a private citizen, and, to show clearly how each class of land is dealt with. As it is, we have only to look at the definition clause to see how hopelessly the two matters ar.e confused. The simple definition of the word "owner" is quite sufficient to indicate what I mean ; we are told that " owner " applies equally to a private citizen and to a' State.' I do not say that it is necessary as a matter of courtesy, but it is certainly desirable to embody in a separate measure the provisions we are proposing to put into law wilh reference to the compulsory purchase of State lands. I wonder that the point has not previously occurred to the Minister in charge of the Bill ; but it does occur to me that the States might properly demand, as they really deserve, that consideration. I do not think it is fair to treat the States with no more consideration than is extended to private citizens. </para>

I do not care to use the word ''sovereign," which- is often misleading; but what I .have stated is the position. It may not be much for a single State to assert a similar authority -in the case of an individual; but when the Commonwealth proposes to compulsorily take land from one of the federated States, surely <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> can see-.- - </para>

                        <para>- But surely it would be more courteous to differently frame the clause, the language of which appears very harsh, as affecting State lands. The Federal Parliament has nothing to do with the control, and so forth, of the lands of the various States, though, of course, there is power, with the consent of the States, to take land for certain purposes. It appears to me as if, in this clause, it was proposed to override the States, seeing that we have the words " notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the law of any State." I do not know whether legal senators regard the matter as I do; but it strikes me as being rather objectionable language to use when we are dealing with the lands of a State. </para>

                    <para>.- I hope that the Honorary Minister, when he replies, will let us know whether it . is intended by this clause to go further than does the present Act, or, in other words, to effect any new purpose, or give any power cot conferred in the present Act. We desire to know whether the Bill simply puts the powers of the original Act in a different form, or whether a change has been made. The more I study it. the more strongly I feel that this is a case in which it would have been better to have had an amending, instead of a repealing measure. On the surface, the number of alterations appear to be comparatively few, though they may be very important, for all I know. In any case, it would have been better to have had an amending Bill, so as to show exactly the alterations that are proposed. As I read clause 6, it simply provides for the acquisition of land which the Commonwealth, under the Act, has power to compulsorily resume with compensation. If that be so, the power seems to be the same as that conferred by the original Act ; but I agree with the honorable senators who have preceded me, that the clause is most unfortunately drawn. If it be intended that the power shall be exercised in the way indicated, the intention could have been expressed in a much more agreeable manner. At present the clause has all the appearance of instructing the Executive of a State as to its duties. </para>

                        <para>- That is done in another part of the Bill: and where, therefore, is the necessity! for clause 6 in its present form, which, as I say. appears to instruct the Executive of a State as to the State's powers over lands ? I think that thephraseologyoftheActof1901was much better. That Act confers on the Governor-General - which means ourselves -the Dower to enter into negotiations, and make a bargain with a State, and provides that if terms cannot be arranged, the Commonwealth shall have power to compulsorily resume. </para>

Under the present law of the Commonwealth, if it requires Crown land, it can acquire those lands by agreement or compulsorily. In every instance, hitherto, in which the Commonwealth has acquired Crown land for public purposes, the State concerned has been approached with a view to negotiation. When approached in this way the State points out that, while the Commonwealth Act empowers the Governor of a State to grant land in the name of the King, the State law requires that he shall do so subject to certain reservations and conditions. For instance, one condition that is attached to grants in Western Australia is that, within twenty-one years from the issue of the grant, the State may resume, without compensation, for certain specified public purposes, if no improvements shall have been made on the land. In one particular instance, a deed from one of the States purported to grant land to the Commonwealth, subject to the reservation that the State itself could, within twenty-one years, under certain circumstances, resume the land as against the Commonwealth. To such a condition the Commonwealth, of course, objected, and it then appeared that the State had no desire to have that condition imposed, but that the condition was compulsory under the State law. </para>

                        <para>- Not at all. I could give quite a number of instances. In &gt;Jew South Wales, in nearly every instance, the Commonwealth has been forced to exercise its compulsory powers ; and why ? Because, while the law of New South Wales empowers the State Governor to grant the land, the. State law requires that there shall first of all be selection or an auction. The Commonwealth, under such circumstances, is asked whether it is willing to have the land subjected to auction, and, of course, a negative reply is given. Thereupon, the State, which does not desire to with hold the land, expresses willingness to let it be transferred by the more speedy process of compulsory purchase. It is said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> that this defect is overcome by clause 17, but that clause applies only to acquisition by compulsory process. </para>

                        <para>- We do not propose to repeal local Acts. As I pointed out on the second reading of the Bill, in connexion with this clause, we rest the authority of the Governor of a State when dealing with the Commonwealth in these matters entirely upon our legislation. This legislation is within our sphere. It is in the exercise of one of the powers conferred upon us by the Constitution. When legislation within our jurisdiction is repugnant to any local legislation upon the same matter, to the extent of the repugnancy 'and to that extent on lv the local legislation is avoided. That is all that is required. It is required to avoid any local legislation that would interfere with the interests of the Commonwealth, and only to that extent. This is not proposed out of any spirit of hostility to the States. The whole object is to enable the acquisition of land from the States to be carried out by negotiation rather than by the compulsory process. I am probably correct in saying that all the advisers of the Federal Government are of opinion that the law as it stands at present enables the Governor of a State to transfer property without any reservations which a State law might impose. But there has been a doubt raised in the minds of the advisers of some, at least, of the Governments of the States. They are not indisposed to give the lands we require, but they say "To set the matter beyond all doubt, you had better exercise your compulsory power," and in New South Wales to this day we have been exercising our compulsory powers of acquisition. Is it not much more desirable that we should acquire State lands by negotiation wherever possible, and should resort to compulsion only in cases where we have vainly exhausted all the possibilities of negotiation? The amendment of section 5 of the existing Act here proposed is to set aside any doubt as to the authority of a Governor of a State, and to meet the views of those States in which such a doubt has been raised. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know that they have agreed to the clause itself, but I understand that all that they require is an amendment of the section in respect to which some doubts were raised as to the authority of the Governor of a State. Honorable senators must see that the whole object of the clause is to enable negotiations between the State and the Commonwealth to proceed. So far from being anything like an aggravation or interference with the States, the object is to substitute negotiation for compulsory acquisition. If we use our compulsory powers we may, of course, acquire any property we desire. Our relations with the States so far have been harmonious, but who knows that hereafter it may not be said in some of the States that whenever the Commonwealth acquired property from those States it always resorted to the compulsory method, although it had an alternative to negotiate ? </para>

                        <para>- The State authorities say to us, "We cannot give you this land without the right to resume it within twenty-one years." We say, " We cannot take the land from you and give you the right to resume." They reply, " We have no wish to impose that condition upon you, but the State law imposes that condition, and therefore you had better acquire the land compulsorily." Why should the Commonwealth be driven to the constant practice of compulsorily acquiring land from a State when we can negotiate in the case of private individuals? </para>

                        <para>- Even then we should be adding one step to the process of acquisition, and, so far as the Commonwealth is concerned, we should be also placing ourselves in a position that would very likely hereafter be seriously misunderstood. Because it might be said, in the case of some State, that in every instance every inch of ground acquired from the State had been acquired by compulsory purchase. Who could dispute it? It might also be said that the Commonwealth had the alternative of negotiation. Honorable senators must see that the clause is aimed at what we all desire, namely, , that in all these transactions the utmost harmony shall prevail between the Commonwealth and the State whose land is acquired. </para>

                    <para>. - I listened yesterday very patiently to the objections raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> to this particular clause, and today I have listened patiently to all that has been said. But the very objection which has been raised to the clause constitutes the argument which should be used in favour of it. Honorable senators urge that, so far as we possibly can, we should approach the States in the most cordial way, and should do nothing in the direction of aggravating the States authorities; that we should never exercise the full powers of the Commonwealth, or of any Commonwealth Act, until we have exhausted every other means of arriving at the desired end. That is what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has been saying for hours. Yet in this clause it is so evident that that is the intention of the Government that I am unable to understand why any honorable senator should oppose it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has said that in the past the Government have found that there are difficulties in negotiating with the States, and they have had to resort to compulsion. The honorable senator has given instances, which I could multiply, and honorable senators must see that they might easily be made more numerous in the future than they have been in the past. It would be possible in any State for a law to be passed that no land should be acquired by anybody except through some particular agent. </para>

Honorable senators, a few minutes ago, were trying to make us believe that they desired that the States should be treated in a conciliatory manner. That is what the Government are proposing to do. In this clause they say that, instead of exercising the power, which it is admitted we have, we desire to negotiate, and to acquire properties from the States in the most friendlymanner. </para>

                        <para>- It says, " Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the law of any State"; but it is to get over that difficulty that this clause is inserted. If the Executive of a State has the slightest objection to override any State law, they have only to say to the Commonwealth, '"We will not do it," or, "We cannot do it; you will have to exercise the powers you have, and take the land compulsorily." Then honorable senators opposite get up and talk about the difference between' a private individual and a State in this matter. I cannot imagine any difference. Is it not as great a crime to do an injustice to an individual as to a number :of individuals ? If we do an injustice to a State, we do injustice to a number of individuals ; and if we do an injustice to a land-owner, it is just as criminal as if we did it to a State. If we acquire land from an individual, we have at the same time to acquire the rights of the State in respect of that land. That is the only difference, and honorable senators have entirely overlooked it. Where the Commonwealth acquires land from an individual, with that acquisition should go all the rights which the State has thereto. But in this clause we are simply asked to enact that where any law of a State prevents the State, in a technical sense, from negotiating with the Commonwealth, if the Governor, through the Executive, is prepared to enter into negotiations with the Commonwealth for the transfer of the land, the Commonwealth is prepared to do so in the way which may be most agreeable to the people of the State. But honorable senators on the other side say "No; you must fall back upon your absolute right of compulsory purchase. We shall not give you the opportunity through the Governor of a State to acquire land for the Commonwealth." As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating;</inline> has said, in years to come the authorities in a State may say - " That is the way in which we have been treated. Every piece of land which has been acquired by the Commonwealth has been forcibly taken from us; we have never been allowed an opportunity. to negotiate." Who is preventing that from being done? It is only honorable senators on the other side who are seeking to place an obstacle in the way of the Commonwealth doing what they argue ought to be done. I hope that they will read the clause, endeavour to understand what is really meant by it, and believe that,, instead of doing an injustice to any State, it is only providing a means whereby the most harmonious relations may exist between the States and the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- Nobody has suggested for a moment, either directly or indirectly, that in the future it should become necessary to compulsorily resume any land from a State. If such a practice has, for the purposes which have been mentioned, been resorted to in the past, now is the time to put an end to any difficulty which has existed. Clause 6 of the Bill' says in specific terms that the Governor of a State, acting, on the advice of the Executive thereof, may do certain things. It has been urged that it is unfortunately framed, and that, in order to achieve the same end, in a previous Act we said that the Governor-General might negotiate with the State to do certain things, in this case, to purchase land. In these circumstances, it will be seen that we have not taken upon ourselves the apparently unfair position of prescribing what the Governor of a State should do. On the contrary, we have provided, as we did recently in the Meteorological Bill, that the Governor-General might enter into an arrangement with the Governor of a State, and the State laws have always been sufficient to enable the Governor of a State to carry out any such agreement. </para>

                        <para>- That is what the Minister has suggested. I want him to realize the serious principle involved in passing the clause in this shape. Of course he will have the right to give us the justification for this departure, but I submit that the seasons which he has already advanced are totally inadequate. If everything which is sought for can be achieved in a. nice -way, instead of introducing the unfortunate principle to which I have referred, what is the objection to recasting this clause for that purpose? The Minister has said, "Yes, that would be all very well; but then we have to bear in mind that in some instances the Governor of the State has only the right to make grants subject to certain reservations." </para>

To begin with, why should we alter the phraseology of the existing provision? If it is defective, there is a way of amending the defect. If we prescribe what the power of the Governor of a State shall be, the provision may appear inoffensive in this Bill ; but there may be times when, if the precedent were followed, it would bear quite a different aspect, and lead to friction. I have proposed a reasonable and effective means whereby the difficulty suggested by the Minister could be overcome. </para>

                    <para>. - The clause as it stands appears to me to be highly offensive to the States, and I have no hesitation in saying that it would be so regarded by New South Wales. I wish to draw attention to a remark made just now by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> because I think it will explain a little error into which he has fallen. He said that the. wording of the clause would enable some technical defects to be overcome. When it bestows upon the Governor of a State the power of making an arrangement with the Commonwealth contrary to the law of the State, it goes far beyond the mere correction of technical defects, and it is that to which I object. I hope that a very clear amendment will be made, so that what at present is very highly objectionable may be removed. I cannot understand the representative of any State seeking to pass a clause worded as this is. Although I have no doubt that it was drafted with very good intentions, still it is capable of very evil results. </para>

                    will begin to have a glimmering of understanding as to what the clause means. He undertook, at the close of his animated but not very clear speech, to lecture honorable senators1 on this side of the Chamber as to their lack of understanding of the meaning of the clause.

                        <para>- The honorable senator wastes the time of the Senate with senseless interjections more than any other member of it. I always find that those who are in the habit of suggesting that others do not understand provisions are themselves wandering in a kind of Cimmerian darkness. I wish to enlighten <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> a little, because I believe that he is a man who is occasionally susceptible of instruction. I will point out what he has entirely overlooked - that in this Bill there is in the first place a power for the acquisition- of land by mutual agreement, and, in the second place, a power for the acquisition of land by compulsion. This provision is not intended to have any relation to the acquisition of land by compulsion. It has relation to the acquisition of land by agreement. The power of a person to dispose of land by agreement depends upon his ownership and interest in it; and if he is a person occupying an official position, like the Governor of a State, it depends upon the authority given to him by the Parliament of the State, and no one else. In a self -governing country the authority of the Governor is derived from the Parliament of the State. He has certain instructions from the Sovereign, who appoints him to his official position, but his power to deal with Crown lands is now, under the self-governing Constitutions which we possess, dependent upon the approval of Parliament. In relation to negotiations for the acquisition of land which may be entered into by the Commonwealth with a State. all that the Commonwealth can do is to empower its agent - using that term as applicable to the Governor-General - to do what we think he ought to do. If at present power to enter into an agreement to acquire State land, or land held by a State Government, is not vested in the Governor-General, we can confer that power by legislation. But we cannot confer that power upon the Governor of a State. The authority of the Governor of a State to deal with the land of the State depends upon the power the State Parliament gives to him. The State has its rights, just as the Commonwealth has its rights, and we have no power to instruct the Governor-General to give directions to a State Governor. He must receive those instructions from the Parliament of the State to which he owes allegiance, subject to and in accordance with the allegiance that he owes to the Sovereign who appoints him. The vice of this provision, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> has pointed out, is that it involves an assumption bv thi* Commonwealth of an authority to confer the power of selling and disposing of State lands upon the Governor of a State. I say emphatically that we do not possess that power, and cannot exercise it. We- have no right to do it. Further, if we could do it, I do not believe that we ought to do it. We have no right to dictate to the States Parliaments and Executives. And even if we had the power we ought not to exercise it in this particularly offensive manner. My honorable friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> has said that he does not see that it is offensive. He says that it is particularly harmonious. The particularly harmonious way in which we are acting is for the Commonwealth Parliament, without so much as a "by your leave" to the people of a State, to say to the Governor of a State that he is to enter into an agreement with the Commonwealth to part with the lands of the State in spite of the provisions of any local Act of Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- I am talking of the legislation which we in a high handed manner are seeking to pass for the purpose of pretending to give power to the Governor of a State to do something which only the State Legislature can authorize him to do. We can, by virtue of the law, say that, when we acquire land under the Constitution, all dedications and all reservations shall be wiped away, and that we require it in absolute unconditional fee-simple. But we cannot give a power to the Executive of a State to override the Acts of Parliament of a State in the way that we are asked to do. It is a silly thing to attempt. It is a contemptible thing for this Parliament to put upon the statute-book something which, if it is not effective, is useless. </para>

I am here representing one of the States, and I say very emphatically that we ought to be extremely solicitous to adopt a form which will carry out our intention without creating offence. We are all agreed as to the desirableness of mutual arrangements. But it will be impossible to carry out those mutual arrangements if we have the impertinence to interfere with a State Parliament, by saying what power the State Governor shall have in selling State lands. If we could do that, it would be a very serious thing. I contend that we cannot. This clause has been inserted inconsiderately. There can be no question about that. </para>

                    <para class="block">I wish, at the outset, to state, what is already well known to honorable senators, that this Bill has received a considerable amount of attention in another place, where it passed without a division, so far as either the second reading or the third reading was concerned. The Bill deals with trusts, monopolies, and the practice of dumping. In the first place, I propose to say a few words in regard to trusts, and then to refer to similar legislation passed in other parts of the world, concluding with a few general observations. Trusts, combinations, and pools, when they become monopolies, which is always their object, can be carried on either to the advantage or to the disadvantage of the public. Honorable- senators who are well versed in ancient history know that there was once a philosopher of the name of Thales, who was told by the business men of the city of Athens that he was only a dreamer - a poor philosopher - and did not know anything about commerce. Thales, however, succeeded in making a " corner "in olives, which at that time was a necessary and much-used food of the people; and the result was that he , got a monopoly which enabled him to sell at his own price, and make considerable gains. In this way he showed the business men that, although he was a. " poor " philosopher, he still possessed, at all events, some knowledge of the art of acquiring money by means of a monopoly. Then honorable senators who have a knowledge of Biblical history will remember the " corner" in corn and other cereals which was established by Joseph in Egypt. </para>

                            <para>- It is a very proper illustration of the evils which can be accomplished by a monopoly, whether conducted by the State or by private persons. Even a State monopoly, which results eventually in the degradation of the people - in depriving the people of their lands and possessions, and practically making them slaves - is an evil ; and, as I have said, the effects of Joseph's operations may be seen in Egypt to-day. At the outset, honorable senators very naturally ask What is a trust? On that point I hold in my hand a paper, prepared at the instance of the Premier of New Zealand by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tregear,</inline> Secretary of Labour in that Colony. </para>

I remember the late Marquis of Salisbury, at a dinner at which I was present in London, saying, " We are all Socialists now," although he was leader of the Conservative Party. If a man tells me that he is a Socialist I do not know what he means ; but I do know what a man means if he tells me that he is a Communist. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know the extent to which Socialism may carry a man, but I know that we are all Socialists. Society is founded on Socialism; every law we pass is socialistic, and the most advanced Conservative or hide-bound Tory will admit that we must pass laws for the government of the people. But the laws are socialistic nevertheless, though some men go to extremes. One man may say that he is a Communist; I know what he means. Another may say that he is an Individualist ; I do not know what he means. But I am satisfied of this : that Individualism carried to extremes leads to Anarchy, and that Socialism carried to extremes leads to Communism. </para>

                                in the first place, quotes the dictionary definition, and then proceeds to divide that definition into the three parts I have mentioned - pools, rings, and trusts, all of which act in different ways, although their object is practical lv the same, namely, to get a monopoly. Trusts are not necessarily all bad, in the sense that in their operations they produce injurious results to the public. It entirely depends on how a trust is conducted whether or not a bad effect is produced. Trusts naturally desire to get as- much profit as possible - that is human nature - but all trusts are not worked' absolutely to the injury of the public.

To strike down industrial or commercial combinations, with the result of closing factories and mines, and turning workers by thousands into the streets, would' be a calamity whose extent could hardly be imagined. </para>

                        <para>The trusts are not a cancer in the body politic : they are not an excrescence on the body politic; they are a part of the vital principle of the body politic. They need to be properly regulated and watched and controlled, just the same as any vital organ of the body needs to be ; but, in like manner, they need to be guarded' from violent injury. </para>

                    <para class="block">In the conduct of business it often happens that, by means of combination, expenses may be very considerably reduced. By this means, the cost of production maybe cheapened, and it may be possible to supply the particular article at a lower rate than that which prevailed before the combination took place. If that be so, who is to complain ? The working man ordinarily likes to be employed by a big combination, because, as a rule, big combinations pay the highest rates of wages. If the public are not injured, but benefited, by a combination, as a result of a reduction in the cost of production, who is to complain ? Nobody ; because under such circumstances the community as a whole benefits. </para>

                    <para class="block">In reference to the question of patents, we have only one monopoly that is recognised by law, and that is the monopoly of patentees. They may sell their rights to manufacturers, but it has been found that trusts are sometimes formed to defeat the object of a patent. They may actually pirate the patentee's invention, and, having done so, defend their action in the Courts against him, or offer him some ridiculous price for it, and otherwise injure him very considerably. I do not know that I need quote anything further on that particular point. These are the charges that are brought against trusts. I quote now from page 8 of this paper - </para>

                        <para>One of the methods employed by trusts to raise the va,lue of their properties and depreciate those of others has been the illegal use and misuse of patents. Combinations have used their political and pecuniary influence to prevent patents applied for being granted, and in order that they might use the invention as being unpatented. A Court case disclosed that associated railway companies made an agreement for the purpose of restraining individual owners of patents from freely negotiating sale of interests in their patents, and from collecting compensation from any member of the association who has appropriated a patent invention. The combination was to use all means against any person bringing a suit against one of these members, was to collectively "boycott" or refuse to negotiate with the patentee, and not to settle a suit or claim so long as a similar suit or claim was maintained against any other member of the association ; this, of course, to cut off " the sinews of war " from the opponent. (See Pettibone, the. United States, 13 " Supreme Law Reporter," 542,1893.) Thus, any competition for a patent is suppressed, and the combination either uses the patent without payment or purchases it at its own price. As the law of the United States declares that there shall be a fair and open market for patents, such acts as those, spoken of are plainly in " restraint of trade," and are illegal. </para>

                        <para>In the early part of this year it came to the knowledge of the President that great railway systems in the Middle West, upon which every section of the country is dependent for the movement of 'breadstuff, had entered into unlawful agreements to transport the shipments of a few favored grain buyers at rates much below the tariff charges imposed on smaller dealers and the general public. This injustice prevailed to such an extent and for so long a time that most of the smaller shippers had been driven from the field, and the business formerly enjoyed by them absorbed by a limited number of persons who received secret and preferential rates. In a word, there was practically one buyer on each railway system, and the illegal advantages he secured from the carrier gave him a monopoly of the grain on the line with which his secret compact was made. </para>

                            <para>- I have been speaking with regard to trusts in the United States. Singular to say, in the experience of the United States these corporations appear in almost all cases in the form of. trusts and combines, but when we come to consider the experience of Europe, we find that there they take the form of pools. A number of independent manufacturers form a pool. They agree to a certain output and a certain price, and if one manufactures more than he is entitled to manufacture under the agreement, he has to pay something to the others in the pool for so doing. </para>

                    <para>Coming to the question of legislation in regard to industrial combinations, we find that so far back as1870 a drastic measure was passed in which it was declared that any agreements between business firms to raise prices are invalid. As an example of the working of the law may be cited a case in which an agreement regarding sales having been broken by one of the parties recourse was had to the Court. The decision of the Court was that not only was the agreement invalid, but that it was not necessary to prove that the price of goods had increased, for such prices might have increased without the agreement. The agreement could not become the subject of any valid contract, and, therefore, no penalty consented to by parties to the agreement among themselves could be inflicted. Even the institution of a selling bureau, a very common institution among Austrian pools, has been held to be invalid, and any violation of its contracts cannot be punished by legal methods. These decisions, making the adherence to such agreements entirely a question of personal honour, have tended somewhat to discourage the formation of trusts. </para>
                    <para class="block">Honorable senators will see that in Austria they have a law under which a man may enter into whatever agreements he pleases, but so far as they are in restraint of trade they are invalid. It might be contended, that if a certain manufacturer manufactures more than the quantity of goods agreed upon by arrangement with others in a pool, or sells his goods at a lower price than that agreed upon, he is liable, under his contract, to a certain penalty, but, under the law, it is impossible to enforce that penalty, and in this way trusts have been to a very considerable extent discouraged in Austria. In Germany the law on the subject is very uncertain. As a matter of fact, the Prussian Government are themselves in a trust, and operate a trust. Public feeling in Germany is not specially hostile to trusts, but the publicity given in that country to the operation of corporations militates against their establishment. In the United States, this position arose in connexion with the formation of these corporations. There are in that country a number of separate States, and the Federal power can interfere only in connexion with inter-State or oversea commerce. It cannot interfere with the internal legislation of what are practically sovereign States. The result has been that when one State has passed a stringent corporation law compelling any business corporation to issue a yearly or half-yearly balance-sheet, and to give publicity to its operations in order that the public might, know exactly how its business was carried on, another State, anxious for the establishment o£ that corporation within its borders, has modified its' law by giving facilities to the corporation to avoid the publicity enjoined by the law of the first State. A corporation would, therefore, naturally establish itself in the State which afforded the greatest facility for the carrying on of its business in the dark. The State of New Jersey, opposite New York, is noted for the very lax way in which it allows corporations to be formed, and a great many of the corporations and trusts of the United States have been incorporated in that State. In England, and in Europe, as a whole, such publicity in connexion with the operations of corporations and trusts has been insisted upon, that, amongst other things, the watering of stock has been largely prevented, and that is one of the great abuses of trusts in the United States. As a consequence, trusts have been discouraged in England and in Europe to a much greater extent than in the United States. I stated just now that in Germany, the people do not trouble very much about trusts and combines, and that, in fact, the Prussian Government is a party to a combine. I may quote the following on the subject from page 24 of this report: - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>In the case of the potash combination, its products were formerly wholly obtained from mines belonging to the Government, but private mines were opened, and agreements made, in which the State itself (Prussia) is a party. The State had factories of its own to work up the products of the mine, and upon forming a pool with other mine and factory owners made certain rules, which, being agreed to, bind mine owners not to supply to outside factories, or these factories to buy from independent mines, but the Government retains the power of regulating the amount of output, and even of making special concessions in price for the benefit of German agriculture. </para>
                        <para>There can be little reason to consider the Stale as being a partner in an evil combination, when on many occasions the rights reserved to itself have been productive of enormous advantage through its chemists and agriculturists to the nation, lt does not scruple to punish guerilla competition by a competitive war, and has forced private enterprises to desist from business, or enter the combination, but its direct influence has been that of the beneficent aristocrat. </para>

                            <para>- Amongst my papers, and I think amongst the papers which I laid upon the table, there are some extracts which show that, next to the United States, England is the great country of trusts. Our free-trade friends say, and say loudly, that the trusts and combinations which are supposed to work so injuriously in the United States, are the product of protection, and that trusts and combinations are not so prevalent in other countries. In Europe, France is one of the most protectionist countries, whereas, the only free-trade country is England. France, the protectionist country, has hardly any trusts, but England', the freetrade country, has more trusts than any protectionist part of Europe. The argument of our free-trade friends, therefore, will not hold water. </para>

                            <para>- If protection is the cause of trusts, then France ought to have more trusts than England has, whereas it has fewer. In America there is a certain party which is constantly affirming that trusts are the result of protection, and the protectionists deny the statement. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tregear</inline> sums up the position by stating that in certain cases, protection does assist trusts, but that, taken as a whole, it is not the cause of trusts, because they are found in free-trade England to a larger extent that in protectionist France. </para>

I desire now to refer to the anti-trust legislation which has been enacted in various parts of the world.

                            <para>- It was found that these pools and combinations, when they became sufficiently powerful, made arrangements with the railway companies for special rates. In some cases, the special rates were enormously to the advantage of the combinations, and against other people. Take the case of the Standard Oil Company. By means of the enormous rebates which they got from the railway in the carriage of goods from the Pennsylvania oil-fields, they were able to compete with all their rivals, and in a. short time, to compel every one of the owners of the oil-well sin Pennsylvania to go into their combination until they got an immense monopoly. </para>

                            <para>- I do not say it does apply. I am only pointing out that the Inter-State Commerce Act was one of the first Acts passed in America for the purpose of preventing the monopolies which were obtained! under the rebates and concessions granted by railway companies. We have no fear of anything of that sort arising here, and therefore we have not made any provision in that regard. In the Commonwealth Constitution we took the power to create an Inter-State Commission, which, would have the right of regulating this kind of traffic between the States. Before our Constitution Act was passed we had discriminating rates on the States railways. Victoria granted rebates on the carriage of wool from the border of New South Wales to Melbourne. South Australia had special rates with regard to the carriage of wool on her -railways, and New South Wales also had special rates from part of Riverina. Because we had the power to create an Inter-State Commission if we desired, the Railways Commissioners met together, and, I understand, came to an arrangement bv which no such rebates are now granted. Therefore, as far as we know, there is no necessity for the appointment of an Inter-State Commission. </para>

The Commerce and Labour Act of -1903 provides an official agency to obtain information with a view to better regulation and legislation. The Expedition Act and the Elkin Act, passed in the same year, are machinery Acts to simplify the taking of proceedings under previous Acts.

                            <para>- That is the definition in the Canadian Act, and we have adopted it to a considerable extent. Canada had to protect her own manufactures against American trusts, many of which are very large concerns. In the United States there is frequently a surplus stock which manufacturers wish to export. They have supplied the whole of their home market, and for the disposal of their surplus the practice to which they used to resort was to sell abroad at a very low rate, sometimes more than 50 per cent, below the price at which they supplied their goods to people in the United States. When these goods were imported into Canada, the importers used to claim that they had a right .to pay duty <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> at that reduced price. What Canada has done is this: She says, "We will take no notice whatever of your price, whether you say it is a cash price or not. We will go to the place where the goods are manufactured, and ascertain the price charged by the manufacturers in their own country. We will make you pay dutv on that." That system was found necessary in order to contend against dumping. </para>

                    <para class="block">That is a fine list of monopolies ! These trusts are able to charge the public, not, perhaps, exactly what they like, but considerably in excess of what is a fair price. This they do for the purpose of putting an extraordinary profit into their own pockets. Another important question dealt with by this conference was as to the effect which combinations had had upon distribution - that is, the effect upon the small storekeeper who distributes goods to the consumer. On this subject the following statement is made in the report: - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>One hundred and ten say it is injurious, because it decreases their business and profits, and lends to eliminate them, and forty-nine wholesale dealers think they have been benefited by the formation of combinations. </para>
                        <para>In answer to the question what effect combinations have on the consumer, one hundred and five think consumers are injured, while only twenty-four think they are benefited, and forty-one think there is no difference. </para>
                        <para>The items of information about prices aggregate five hundred and six. Four hundred and fifty-two were to the effect that prices rose after combinations were made, twenty-four that (hey fell, fifteen that there was no change, and fifteen that they were fluctuating, two hundred and ten do not specifically assign trusts as the cause of the change (increase in most of these cases), and forty assign other causes, usually increased demand, rise of raw materials, or the Tariff. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>I quote this to show, in the first place, the effect of these monopolies, and the number of articles which they monopolize. I also quote it to show that, in the great majority of cases, those who are able to speak with any degree of knowledge on the subject consider that in the long run trusts are injurious. There are, it is admitted, good trusts and bad trusts - those that have done injury, and those whose operations have been attended with a certain amount of good. The replies to the circulars sent out showed that in certain cases the trusts had done some good. Now I wish to quote a passage from the final report of the United States Industrial Commission of 1902. The report is very valuable. The Commission was appointed toy the United States Senate. There were to be upon it five members of the Senate, to be appointed by the presiding officer, five members of the House of Representatives, appointed by the Speaker, and nine other persons, who should fairly represent the different industries and employments, to foe appointed by the President by and with the advice of the Senate. The Commission was appointed in 1898. It sat for a number of years, and, after collecting an immense amount of evidence from all parts of the United States, brought up a report embodying its conclusions. The gist of that report is to be found in the following recommendations : - </para>

                            <para>- I am not quite sure whether it applies to foreign trade also. Honorable senator's will notice the very drastic proposals there made. It will be observed, also, , that we have followed the United States laws pretty closely in drawing up this Bill. Now I wish to refer to the measure itself. I will call attention to the principal clauses in it, although I shall not attempt to go through it exhaustively. The first matter in the Bill to which I wish to call attention is the definition of the term " commercial trust." It is defined to include - </para>

                    <para>This provision has been very carefully considered by the Attorney-General, who has had regard to the different decisions that have been given, particularly in the United' States Courts, in the various actions that have been brought against trusts and combines. Some of them have been able to escape punishment in consequence of the law not having been as carefully worded as it might have been. The Attorney-General has endeavoured, and I believe he has succeeded, in framing a definition under which it will be very difficult for trusts and combines to defeat the law. The term "commercial trust " will include all combinations that have been attempted up to the present time. Clause 4 relates to individuals. It provides against - </para>

                    <para class="block">In the United States laws on this subject, those words, " to the detriment of the public," are not included. Consequently, some trusts, although their operations have not been proved to be to the detriment of the public, have been punished simply because they came within the law. For instance, there is the case of the <inline font-style="italic">United States</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Coal Dealers' Association of California,</inline> an outline of which is as follows : - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>Practically all the coal used in San Francisco was mined in Washington, Oregon, and British Columbia. A very large number of the coal dealers in San Francisco formed themselves into an association, agreeing not to sell coal below certain prices. The association entered into a contract with the producers of coal in Washington, Oregon, and British Columbia, whereby the producers agreed to co-operate with the association to carry out its purposes, and the producers agreed not to sell coal to any non-member except for a much higher price than they charged members. United States took action to enjoin proceedings under this arrangement. </para>
                        <para>The Court held that the combination affected the rate of coal as soon as it arrived in San Francisco from other States, and before it had become a part of the mass of property in the State it remained in Inter-State commerce, and, therefore, came under the Anti-Trust Act. It was unnecessary to discuss whether the restraint was reasonable, for the Sherman Anti-Trust law forbids all restraints <inline font-style="italic">whether reasonable or not.</inline></para>

                    <para class="block">Committee, where I shall have the assistance of my legal colleague. Clause 6 deals with unfair competition, and clause 7 provides against any monopoly of Inter-State or external trade. Clause 8 refers to the monopoly of trade by corporations, and includes any foreign corporation or trading or financial corporation formed within the Commonwealth. I desire to call special attention to clause 10, which provides for injunctions. It is laid down by this clause that no injunction shall be granted until there shall have been a hearing and determination on the merits of the case ; in other words, it will not be possible to obtain what the lawyers call an interlocutory order, which is made on a sort of <inline font-style="italic">ex parte</inline> statement to the Judge, often relied' on in ordinary processes of law. The clause renders it imperative that the facts shall be laid before the Court, which must make inquiry before an injunction can be granted. Clause 11, which deals with actions for damages, is taken from the Sherman Act, and I propose to quote a case in order to show how that Act works in operation. The case is as follows :  - </para>

Plaintiffs in that case claimed that they had been boycotted by the Trust, and were unable to purchase goods except from members of the combine at " list prices," which was 50 per cent. higher than was charged to members of the combine. Plaintiffs obtained treble . damages. </para>

                    <para>Honorable senators will notice that in this clause any person who is injured may sue for treble damages, as in the case which I have just quoted. In regard to suing under the Bill, it is provided that where imprisonment is involved, the case shall be heard before a Judge and jury, but that where it is purely a matter of a fine, the decision shall be left to a single Judge of the High Court. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know ; I should not like to express an opinion on that point. There are provisions regarding second offences, followed by clause 15, which deals with the public notification of the term of contracts or combinations, but to which, though a long provision, I need not refer to further. Part III. of the Bill has for its object the prevention of dumping. When this part of the measure was originally drawn, it was provided that a Board should make the necessary inquiry into any case of alleged dumping, but, in another place, a Justice of 'the High Court was substituted, to the improvement, I think, of the Bill. We are more likely to get careful, legal, and consistent decisions from a' single Judge, than from the members of any Board. </para>

                            <para>- The figures represent the difference between the home prices and the prices at which the goods are sold to people abroad, and the average difference, I should say, is considerably over 50 per cent. The list will give honorable senators some idea of the dumping that was going on. We know from the action taken in Canada that it is being practised, and we know that dumping is taking place here. Any one who paid attention to what was done by the Harvester Trust will know that when they first brought their goods here they valued each harvester at <inline font-style="italic">£26.</inline> When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLean,</inline> as Minister of Trade and Customs in the Reid-McLean Ministry, raised the valuation to £38 or£39, they paid duty on that valuation without a word. Since then the value of these machines for duty has been still further raised, and I believe the importers are. kicking against that decision, and are bringing an action against the Minister of Trade and Customs on the subject. But that they have been, dumping their goods here at an unfair price and in unfair competition with our own manufacturers, and evading duty by a low valuation of their machines, there can be no mistake at all. </para>

                    <para>I think that no honorable senator can object to that. Clause 18 provides when competition shall be deemed to be unfair. It will be unfair if - (a)Under ordinary circumstances of trade it would probably lead to the Australian goods being no longer produced or being withdrawn from the market, or being sold at a loss, unless produced at an inadequate remuneration for labour ; or </para>

                    <para class="block">In the second part of this clause it is provided that, in certain cases which are set out, and which I need not read, because we shall consider them in detail in Committee, the competition shall be deemed unfair unless the contrary is proved. Then I come to the proceedings which are to be taken under these clauses. There will be a Comptroller-General, who in all probability will be <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Wollaston,</inline> the present chief of the Customs Department. It is provided that whenever he has received a complaint in writing, and has reason to believe that any person, singly or in combination with any other person within or beyond the Commonwealth, is importing into Australia goods with intent to destroy or injure any Australian industry by unfair competition with Australian goods, he may certify to the Minister accordingly. The certificate of the Comptroller-General shall specify the imported goods, the Australian goods and industries likely to be injured, the name of the importer, the grounds for assuming unfairness in the competition, the name, address, and occupation of the person upon whose information action is taken, and any further statement which the Comptroller-General may see fit to make. He will then give the importer an opportunity to come before him and show cause - to answer the complaint which has been received in writing from the person who claims to be aggrieved. The certificate of the Comptroller-General will then be submitted to the Minister, and on receipt of it the Minister may, by order in writing, refer to a Justice the investigation and determination of the question. He will notify in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> that the question has been so referred, and forward to the Justice a copy of the Comptroller-General's certificate. Provision is then made as to what the Justice shall do. He is to be given power, as set out in a clause containing nine sub-clauses, to fully investigate every matter, and when he has prepared his decision he is to forward it to the Minister. Clause 22 provides the action to be taken upon the determination of the Justice, and then there is provision in relation to a bond. These are the provisions of the Bill, and I contend that they are manifestly fair. The other branch of this Parliament took immense pains in dealing with the subject, and a great many alterations were made upon the Bill as at first introduced. We have received the measure after the wisdom of the House of Representatives has been applied to its consideration and amendment. </para>

                            <para>- I think there must be some kind of telepathy between the honorable and learned senator and myself, because that is just what I am coming to. I have a note " to refer to other reported statements that trust laws are a dead letter in the United States." I know that that is an old cry. It is true that there have been many cases in which the laws have failed to be effective, but there are many others in which they have been successful. I propose to refer to some of the cases in which the law has been successful in dealing with trusts. The Attorney-General has very carefully looked into those cases in which the law has failed. He has noted the reasons for the failure, and in this Bill we have protected ourselves as far as possible against a similar unfortunate result. </para>

                            <para>- It was one of the big trusts of America, but it certainly does not exist as a trust now. There may be some understanding amongst those engaged in the business, but I dare say the President of the United States is looking after them pretty sharply at the present time, and if there is any understanding between them it is likely that they will fare badly. I call the attention of honorable senators now to the note I have in connexion! with the case <inline font-style="italic">United Slates</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Swift,</inline> 122 <inline font-style="italic">Federal Reporter,</inline> 529 April, 1903. Swift was a member of the Beef Trust, and the case was tried in the United States Circuit Court, in the northern district of Illinois. </para>

                            <para>- I know that that has been stated, but I do not know that it has been proved. Whether there are men of honour among these people I am unable to say. I have four typical cases which show that in the United States the anti-trust law has been enforced. It may be said, in fact it has been said, that in the Commonwealth there is no necessity for this Bill. Some time ago I stated that I did not intend to allude to individuals or to corporations. But I expressed the belief that there were trusts and combines in existence in Australia. I will not say for a moment whether those trusts and combines are injurious - whether, like chips in porridge, they do neither good nor harm - or whether they are beneficial, as in some cases they may possibly be. I do not lay stress upon that aspect of the matter as one of the reasons for bringing in the Bill, but I submit that, in the absence of a restraining law, it is inevitable that sooner or later we should have trusts and combines working here which would be injurious to the public. It is a great deal wiser, therefore, to pass such legislation as this before any injury has been done than to wait until some of our citizens complain. We cannot pass retrospective legislation. We can only deal with cases which may arise after the passing of the law. It is wise, therefore, to legislate in advance. In this connexion I wish to quote some words which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hoar</inline> addressed to the Senate of the United States on the 6th January, 1903, when it was considering certain proposed anti-trust legislation, and when he was arguing in favour of such legislation being proceeded with immediately. His statement is a wise one - and is worthy of being quoted. Speaking on the subject of the regulation of trusts or corporations, he said - </para>

                    <para class="block">That is the position I take up in regard to this Bill. Honorable senators may say that there is nothing in the nature of trusts and combines in the 'Commonwealth which demands the enactment of such legislation ; I do not care whether there is, or is not. Looking at what has been done in other countries in this respect, and remembering the injurious effects which trusts and combines have produced, more or less, in different parts of the world, I submit that it is a great deal better for us to place this measure upon the statute-book now than to wait until the evil actually exists. I contend that if it be enacted, we shall be able to deal with any case which may arise before much mischief can be done. I believe that it will have a deterrent effect, in that it will prevent trusts and combines being formed which would be injurious to the public interest. </para>
