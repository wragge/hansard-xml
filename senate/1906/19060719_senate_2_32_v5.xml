                        <para>That, in the opinion of this Senate, a limited number of press, messages on matters of public interest should bc carried free over the Pacific Cable in order to increase the knowledge and community of interests between the various portions of the Empire linked together by the cable. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">I objected to the motion being taken as ' formal " because my object is not so much to carry a motion as to initiate a discussion upon what I conceive to be a matter of considerable importance.' .The Pacific Cable Company is, so far, the greatest commercial enterprise undertaken by the various portions of the British Empire. It is one which I believe has resulted in great benefit to the four portions of the Empire, which are linked together by this submarine cable. The total expenditure up to the 31st March was £1,993.993 - practically ,£2,000,000 sterling. Working expenses, the cost of the repairing steamer, salaries, and matters of that kind, amounted to £51,000 for the year ending the 31st March last, and the total receipts came to ,£82,000, showing a net profit of £31,000. The annual contributions to the sinking funds - and there are various sinking funds - necessitated a payment by the partners in the cable of £75,849; and the Commonwealth share of that, which is one-third, amounted to £25,283. I might say here that the Pacific Cable is paying better than the cable owned by the Eastern Extension Company, which' communicates with the the Commonwealth of Australia, because that company's cable, at the present time, I learn' on the best authority, does not pay much more than working expenses. It is an undoubted fact that the Pacific Cable has reduced the cost of cabling for ordinary private message from 9s. .(.d. to 3s. a word. The saving thus effected to the commercial community of Australia has been enormous. Eliminating press and Government messages, about 2,000,000 words are sent every year over the various cables connected with Australia. The difference in cost between ps. 4d. and 3s. a word means an annual saving to Australia of ,£600,000 per annum. The people of the Commonwealth, in conjunction with their brethren in New Zealand, Canada, and Great Britain, have assumed this liability, and have brought into existence this great Inter-Empire ser- vice. The service was created for the common good of the inhabitants of the countries which are thus linked together. But, as a matter of fact, the cable up to the present has been of special benefit only to a few thousands of people in the Commonwealth - those who use it for commercial and other purposes. While I approve of that advantage, and while I believe that there has been an indirect advantage to the whole Commonwealth, I yet think that it would be possible to add to the beneficent effects of the cable by enlarging the ambit of its usefulness. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Sandford</inline> Fleming, in a communication published in pamphlet form, and issued by the Board of Trade of Canada, laid down the object of this Inter-Empire Cable. He said - </para>

                    <para class="block">That was the object for which the cable was laid d'own. The proposal now before the Senate is that we should enlarge the usefulness of the cable service by carrying over the line certain press messages of national interest free of cost. The messages which I have in mind would relate to the national development of the countries concerned, and the industrial and commercial development of the Empire, as well ais to matters which are of general interest to the public. If those messages were supplied to every newspaper throughout the Commonwealth it would give us a better and fuller knowledge of the conditions that obtain in other parts of the Empire, and would consequently be of great advantage lo tHe communities represented within the Empire. This proposal of mine is no novelty. Tt was proposed by that great statesman, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Sandford</inline> Fleming, the man who inspired the construction of the Pacific Cable, and who, for many years, fought strenuously until he brought the scheme to a successful issue. He urged that the co-operation of the press would be an immensely beneficial factor in relation to the cable. He said, in his report on " State Cables and cheap Telegraphy " - 1 </para>
                    <para>It has been suggested that for high Imperial reasons the co-operation of the press should be sought. The press has much in its power to promote unity and progress; its highest functions are to spread knowledge, enlighten the people and mould their destiny. But the press must have freedom, and it should enjoy advantage in performing its beneficent work which science can. devise. </para>
                    <para class="block">Further on he said - </para>
                    <para>I am thoroughly satisfied that the cable, during a portion of each day could not be turned to any better account. Two hours a day would easily admit of 10,000 or 12,000 words being transmitted each week. This full volume of news published simultaneously in the chief centres of the Empire would have a wonderful influence. The good to result from a mutual interchange of information and sentiment is beyond calculation. </para>

Excluding Sundays, that is equal to more than 9,000,000 words per annum. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator STANIFORTH</inline>SMITHOpinions on such matters change in democratic countries, and it is quite possible that after another election the decision of the people will lead to the reversal of what has been done. In the meantime my proposal is of a more practical nature - that we should at present- inaugurate a partial application of the system which I advocate between Vancouver in Canada and Southport in Queensland. That is the object of the motion, because I deal only with State-owned Empire cables. I understand that England, Canada, and New Zealand are favorable to the idea, and it only remains for Australia to express approval in order to enable the scheme I have suggested to be carried out. lt is a matter of very serious regret that at the present time we in Australia receive practically no cable news from Canada. The Dominion is an immense territory, inhabited1 by people who are amongst the most progressive in the world, and whose ideals are very much the same as our own. The same remark may be applied to New Zealand ; and we have much to learn from both countries in connexion with political problems and industrial and trad'e development. At present we receive cable news from Canada only about once a month, and we are not kept as fully informed as is desirable on matters of national interest in the sister Colony of New Zealand. As <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Sandford</inline> Fleming has pointed out, the Pacific Cable is not in use for twenty hours out of the twenty-four; and, seeing that the cable was inaugurated for the benefit of the portions of the Empire which it serves, there is no reason why, during those idle hours, when the operators are merely waiting for any messages which, may come to hand', informative press messages should not be conveyed without expense. Of course, if a scheme of free press messages be devised and carried out, they must be despatched from an unbiased source in each country. I admit that there is possible difficulty in the creation of a body or tribunal which would not only be unbiased, but fully informed in matters of great public interest. However, this seems to me to be a difficulty of detail which is not insuperable - a difficulty which could be got over by those who have an intimate knowledge of cable matters in connexion with the press. It is probable that the various Agents-General would be the tribunal chosen to decide on. the messages to be sent from England to Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, and to receive in return cables for circulation to the British" press. The messages from Australia might!, of course, be sent to a press agency in England for distribution there. As to Canada and New Zealand, I think it probable that the Commonwealth Government will find it necessary to appoint commercial agents in the two latter countries; and these gentlemen might form the nucleus of a body to supervise the transmission of free press messages dealing with trade, the opening of new markets, the state of industries, and so forth. However, at present mv only desire is to give some broad idea of a scheme which would prove of immense advantage to the Empire, and be attended with very little cost. I do not even desire to press the motion to a division, if honorable senators should think such a course inadvisable. I think, however, that free press messages of the kind would prove of great benefit in relation to our trade and commerce, our industrial progress, legislation, and1 general development, and I suggest to the Government the advisability of referring the matter to the Pacific Cable Board and the Board's representative here, in order that, if possible, some arrangement of the kind may be made. </para>

I further suggest that this question should! be brought forward at the Imperial Conference to be held in London next April, when other matters connected with the general welfare of the Empire will be discussed.

In regard to Australia, I suggest that 2,000 or 3,000 words per day should be received at Southport in Queensland, and that then the responsibility of the Commonwealth Government should absolutely cease. The hundreds of newspapers of Australia might have a press agency or representative at Southport, who would distribute the messages in the same way as private cable news is distributed at the present time.

                            <para>- I cannot say ; I am relying on the statement made by a reliable authority that the only person on the Board who objected was the representative of Australia. I am now merely making the broad suggestion that the Government should obtain from the Pacific Cable Board, through its representative here, an expression of opinion as to the practicability of the scheme - as to whether the difficulties which have been suggested by myself, and by others in interjection, can be overcome. I further ask the Government to consider the advisability of making this a subject for discussion at the Imperial Conference to be held next April. </para>

                        <para>. - The proposals made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> are in many respects alluring, but, like many other alluring proposals, they may probably lead to a good deal of disappointment. The honorable senator talks about the free transmission of 2,000 or 3,000 words every day; and that number I believe, represents about two columns of any of our great daily newspapers. </para>

                            <para>- They pay for a certain amount of matter; that payment they would cease to make, and the revenue of Australia would be correspondingly decreased. If they are to be presented with messages which they receive from Europe at the present time, we shall have a greater amount of loss to make up on the operations of the Pacific Cable. That does not seem to me to bc a very good move to start with. From my experience of the press - and I know a great deal about press matters in Sydney and elsewhere - I am certain that the pressure on the space of the great newspapers is so great that those conducting them watch very closely everything that is put into them, and they put in only what their readers desire. I am very sorry to have to confess that newspaper proprietors say that a very great deal of matter of first importance is sacrificed for matter of secondary importance, because their readers look for the latter. I feel sure that very little of the mass of matter which the honorable senator suggests should be collected from all parts of the Empire would find a place in our newspapers. </para>

                            <para>- They would publish a little, no doubt. But if information from Canada were published and were not read, the proprietors of the newspapers would say, " Why should we continue to insert this matter?" If there is anything damned as a matter of news it is that which costs nothing. If we could afford to do so it would be very wise to considerably reduce the cost of cabling, so that whenever any event of importance were transpiring the press could supply their readers with information concerning it at much less cost than they are able to do now. But to arrange for a certain mass of telegraphic matter day by day, whether there is anything of vital importance transpiring or not, is not a course which commends itself to my judgment. I think that we are indebted to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> for ventilating the subject. It is one which might very well be further considered, not only in the light of the information the honorable senator has supplied, but from the points of view I have mentioned. I should be delighted to see a greater ventilation of the affairs of the Empire. Nothing would  Please  me better than to see a great public demand for it. But I apprehend that the true course for us to adopt is to try to reduce the cost of cables to the lowest possible point. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> made some reference to a body with whom would rest the exercise of discrimination as to the news which was to be forwarded. This is really a verv grave matter. If certain people are to select the matter which is to be sent, it may well be that their selection will not be considered suitable, and that news which many people here would desire to obtain may be overlooked. Even from this point of view I very much doubt whether the proposal would be likely to eventuate successfully. The matter is one which may very well be debated at the Conference to be held in London next year, and if anything can be done to draw the various parts of the Empire more closely together by an easier and cheaper promulgation of news, a step in advance will have been taken. However, I do not think that is to be secured by the circulation of a huge mass of telegraphic matter day by day, absolutely free of cost to the newspapers. </para>

                            <para>. - I take it that the honorable senator who is responsible for the introduction of this motion has now fairly achieved the object with which he set out when he put it on the notice-paper. We may take it from the honorable senator's concluding remarks that what he really aimed at was to bring under the notice of the existing Government the necessity for establishing closer communication than already exists between. Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom. The honorable senator's concluding remarks would lead us to believe, at any rate, that all he desires is that this matter shall be further considered, and, if possible, shall form a subject of consideration and debate at the forthcoming Imperial Conference. </para>

Not only recently, but some years ago; it was brought under the notice of the Pacific Cable Board. Whether it was on account of the particular difficulty suggested bv the honorable senator, or other difficulties suggested by the interjections of honorable senators during the course of his speech, the Pacific Cable Board, at any rate, has been averse to the establishment of any such system as is contained in this motion. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> has said that our partners in the Pacific Cable enterprise - Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom - are agreeable to the establishment of some such scheme. He was pertinently asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> in what particular way the United Kingdom, for instance, had indicated agreeableness. I am at a loss to understand in what way the United Kingdom has signified its willingness to accept such a scheme. </para>

What evidence the honorable senator has of that I do not know. So far as I have been able to ascertain by looking through the papers on the subject in the possession of the Government, they contain no evidence to that effect. So far as Canada is concerned, she occupies a position with regard to the Pacific Cable totally different from that occupied by the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth owns and operates the whole of the telegraphic systems throughout the States - that is to say, all the land wires. That is not the position of the Canadian Government. Although <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> may fancy that the Canadian people at an early general election will reverse the established policy of the Dominion in this respect, much as I should like to agree with the honorable senator, I feel that the facts do not warrant any such assumption. </para>

Again, the 'connexion between Canada and the United Kingdom is held by one or more of the Atlantic Cable companies. So that, so far as messages from the United Kingdom <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> the Pacific are concerned, the press rates of is. per word contribute to. the revenue of a number of distinct bodies - the Atlantic Cable Company, that takes the message; the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, that transmits it across the Dominion; the Pacific Cable Board, who transmit the ,message from Vancouver to Southport ; and then the Commonwealth Government. These messages, aS I have said, cost is. per word, and that cost is distributed as follows: - Of the is., Australia receives 2d., the Pacific Cable Board 4d., the Canadian Pacific Railway Company id., and the Atlantic Cable Company and Great Britain receive sd. So that, in fact, if we were to ask the Pacific Cable Board to remit their charges in respect of press telegraphic messages, they would still have to pay 8d. per word, because we could not induce private corporations like the Canadian Pacific Railway Company to remit their charges. </para>

If it is proposed to load the Pacific Cable, quiet though it may be during certain hours of the daw with an extra 2,000 words per day, and if the Pacific Cable Board is to transmit these messages for nothing, they will derive no benefit, while the auxiliary corporations with which it must work in the transmission of -these messages will continue to derive considerable benefit. In other words, the proposal would increase the revenue of the Canadian Pacific Rail-. way Company and the Atlantic Cable Company, and, of course, the revenue of the Commonwealth Telegraphic Department ; while the Pacific Cable Board will be the one administration of them all that will get nothing out of the proposal. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly ; that is just what I. am coming to. In a paper sense, it may not be paying in comparison with similar undertakings in other parts of the world ; but the defence of the Pacific Cable Board - and it is a legitimate defence - is that they provide sinking and amortization funds, which do not find a parallel in the management of other corporations. That is the point, and it is therefore correct to say that the Pacific Cable Board is run on business lines, and should continue to be run on business lines. If there is one thing which will ever sap the foundation, of such a huge public enterprise as that which has been entered into by Great Britain, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia, it will be when it is conducted! on unbusinesslike lines. We all agree that many advantages would be gained. If we could get increased traffic over the line it would bring us closer to our brothers in Canada, and to our cousins in the United States of America. But we cannot afford to sacrifice the interest of this huge enterprise, and at the same time to give private undertakings which are carried on conjointly with it, so to speak, a considerable increase in their revenue, which would . make the contrast between the two classes of enterprises all the more striking, and all the more disadvantageous to the Pacific Cable Board. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> referred to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Sandford</inline> Fleming's statement as to the possibility of using this line for such a purpose as indicated in his motion, I asked what was the date of the representation, a:nd he said that' it was made in 1905. I asked the question for a purpose, because so far back as 1903 this matter was considered by the Pacific Cable Board. That will go to show that} so far as the partners in this enterprise are concerned, it has not escaped their notice and consideration. The Pacific Cable Board! then decided that it would be inopportune and inexpedient to adopt such a system as is indicated in the motion. I do not know' how that came to be considered by the Board, but if I remember rightly, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Seddon</inline> contemplated a project of this sort, or at any rate the newspapers announced that he did. He may have communicated directly with the Board, or his intentions may have been communicated in another manner, and the Board mav have considered the practicability of carrying out such a proposal ; at any rate, so far back as 1903 they decided that it was inopportune and inexpedient. Since then we have the testimony of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Sandford</inline> Fleming, who was, I believe, a projector1 of this cable, quoted bv <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline></para>

                    <para class="block">The fact is, as I have pointed out, that the Pacific Cable Board, by increasing the traffic over their line from which they would get no revenue, would at the same time be considerably increasing the traffic over privately-owned lines, which would receive the ordinary revenue for that increased traffic, and would thereby be placed in a position which would be very disadvantageous to a very great public enterprise. It cannot be forgotten that, so far back as 1903, when this matter was first mooted, the Pacific Cable Board urged, as one of the reasons why they could not fall in with such a scheme, that by one of its rules the International Telegraph Union prohibited the differential treatment of messages over the same line, and that objection was alleged to be insurmountable. 1 mention these facts in order that honorable senators mav see the difficulties which confront this enterprise in carrying out such a scheme as is suggested in the motion. They will see that it has been under consideration, and that it is open to objections, some of "which are said to be insurmountable, and others of which fend to show that it would be very disadvantageous for the Pacific Cable Board to carry out the scheme unless in conjunction with private corporations. I feel sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith,</inline> \ifter having ascertained the view of the Senate generally, will see the wisdom of adhering to the course which he indicated that he might follow, and that is asking leave to withdraw the motion. </para>

From a national aspect, it is possible that the land lines of Canada might agree to carry the messages free. I do not know whether they would, but I should imagine that they might do so, for the sake of the nation, and in the hope of increasing the trade between Australia and Canada. But the cable between Canada and London is on a very different footing. </para>

                                <para>- If that line be left out there will be less objection" to the motion, because undoubtedly the owners of the cable between Canada and England would not give their consent. They look upon the transmission of messages as a business transaction, and it would interfere with their other work if they were to render a free service. I doubt whether the. lines in Canada would transmit free messages. Evidently there is not much trade between Canada and Australia. If there was much trade between the two countries there would be plenty of cabling done. No doubt in the Empire sense there is a strong community of interest. Of course, if there were a British-owned cable from Australia to Canada it would be a very proper service to render, and could not be objected to. But there are difficulties in the way at the present time. </para>

Between New Zealand and Canada, however, there is considerable traffic, because the boats are running constantly. I do not see much hope of the trade between Australia and Canada increasing. It will be remembered that if a cable is sent to Canada <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> London the cost is greatly increased. I do not suppose that there is  any  traffic of that kind.

No doubt that is a very important fact to the prisoners, but I do not see how it affects the people of Australia. Then we have a cablegram about the death of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beit</inline> - I suppose one of those poor, miserable, down-trodden South African millionaires who were ruined by Kruger. It appears that this gentleman has left a fortune of between .£25,000,000 and £30,000,000. I do not know why that fact was cabled to Australia, unless it were to make us envious of the riches which, unfortunately, he could not take away, perhaps on account of the climate to which he was going. </para>

                                <para>- Then . we have a cablegram about a Native Rising in Natal, Musical Copyright, and Charlemagne. I do not know if many of the people of Australia know who Charlemagne was, and I suppose that a great many more do not care. Then we have a cablegram which is of a little interest - about the Education Bill and Welsh Home Rule. There is a cable about the canning of meat. It appears that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Lipton, that great bacon cure and tea merchant, is about to enter into the meat-canning business. Then we have cables about some fighting republics in South America, about amateur cricketers, gypsies in England, and so on, and so on. I think it must be clear to all of us that the cables that are sent out to Australia day by day are lacking in interest to the people of this Continent. </para>

                                <para>- They are not the kind of cables that the people of- Australia require. They are not selected by a Socialist, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> interjects. I suppose that the news is sent out by some gentleman who moves in select aristocratic circles in London, and Ave in Australia are. supposed to read it with awe and reverence. If .the cable service is unsatisfactory at our end, I submit that it is much more so at the other end. The people of Great Britain get very little reliable information about Australia. What they do get, if we can believe what we hear, is poisoned bv the enmity of the people who send it from this end of the cable. </para>

The effect is that Australia is depreciated in the eyes of the British people, and that, instead of there being a friendly feeling existing towards us, there is an attitude of semi-hostility. In short, nothing like the truth is known about us or told about us. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith's</inline> proposal were adopted, and if we had a good editor at this end, we could daily send to Great Britain, Canada, and Europe, news of an important character regarding Australia. We could send news as to our industrial developments, mining, squatting, agricultural, and as to our various commercial activities. We could also keep the people in Europe well posted with regard to social and political matters. In that way we could present to them day by day a comparatively honest picture of life as it at present is in Australia. </para>

                                <para>- Well, I do. In any case, I have no doubt that the people of Great Britain would be very much interested to know that St.' George had set out to assail the dragon of Socialism in Australia, and was surrounded by great gatherings of people, who came from afar, if not to laugh with him, at least to laugh at him, in his extraordinary endeavours to slay that dreadful monster. In short, 1 believe that probably the best way to develop Australian interests would be to adopt the suggestion thrown out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith.</inline></para>

Of course,, every one would expect the Pacific Cable Board to object to a proposal of this kind. But we ought to remember that we are shareholders in the Pacific Cable, and that our contribution towards the loss in carrying on the business is about ^27,000 per annum. We ought to have something for our money. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> has told us that the cable is idle for about twenty hours out of every twenty-four. Ought we not to insist upon getting something for the ^27,000 that we pay? It would not add to the cost of running the business to send through a thousand, or a couple of thousand words per day. </para>

                                <para>- Even if that were the case, I think that the profit to Australia would be very much more than it is at present. We should have all the advantage of the additional information with regard to the Continent of Europe being circulated in this country, and we should have the advantage of information regarding Australia being circulated in Europe and America. That information would be much fuller, much clearer, and much more honest than it is at present. Surely, that advantage would be sufficient to balance any loss of private business that might occur. Looking at the whole matter broadly, I think that the adoption of the proposal would be advantageous to Australia. It is a highly .socialistic proposal, and for that reason it commends itself to me. Then, as I pointed' out at the beginning, it would insure messages of greater interest to the great mass of the community being - transmitted If rom our end of the cable. The information would be unbiased from both ends, and that is more than can be said at present. </para>

With the rapid communication that exists nowadays between countries, I am of opinion that no man could continue to send unfair or untrue messages for any length of time. He would very soon be found out, and, if he did not do his duty honestly and 'fairly, would probably be speedily dismissed. </para>

                                <para>- Dismissed by his employers - the Government. We have no guarantee now. We are absolutely in the hands of private individuals. The messages, we know, are coloured every day. How does it happen that the various Agents-General have continually to be writing to the press in London denying slanderous lies circulated about Australia by pressmen from this end of the cable? That is the case at present. I do not say that the system proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> would be perfect, or that absolutely perfect results would be achieved by it, but we should have some control over the news sent over the cables from both ends. The advantages appear to me to be so abundant that the Government ought to do everything in its power to persuade the other partners to the Pacific Cable to do something on the lines suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith.</inline></para>

                            <para>. - The last speaker has expressed the confident opinion that the important and practical difficulties pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> could be overcome if those upon whom the obligation rests addressed themselves to the task. I am forced to an entirely different conclusion. It seems to me that the statement of the Minister, pointing out the actual facts of the case, leaves very little room _ for hope that a practical working scheme can be devised by which we can give effect to this motion. But I am not going to point <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> those difficulties again.' The Minister dealt with them very 'fully and very lucidly. But I do wish to affirm this - that even if we could overcome those commercial and practical difficulties, we should only be face to face with what, after all, would be our grave danger and our great difficulty, and that is as to the messages to be sent, and the control over them. I have always held, and I do not think that there is any one in this Chamber who will dispute the opinion - that one of the greatest privileges enjoyed by a free people is the possession of an absolutely free press. We have only to contrast our press with the official organs to be found in most of the continental capitals of Europe; to see that the advantage we have is no visionary one. What will happen if we start with official cablegrams ? </para>

                                <para>- I am reminded that we have one official journal ; and I am not aware that there is any wild rush on the part of the public to secure copies. But let it be decided that we are to have official cable messages; and some one will have to be appointed by the Government, I presume, to collect and send them.b I cannot conceive of honorable senators sitting quietly in their places if the messages happened to come in conflict with their political views. That is the first danger I see. The cable messages received consist, not only of a recital of facts, but very often of expressions of opinion ; and it is most desirable to know, in regard to a public matter, what is the public sentim'ent. Some event, for instance, happens in Australia, and the chronicler or reporter, whose duty it is to record it, is frequently also called upon to suite what is the public view- in the locality. Supposing that an official sent to England a report of some fact, and also stated that the public opinion in Melbourne or Sydney was so and so; I venture to. say there would be two opinions in this Chamber - probably more, but certainly two- as to whether he had accurately represented the public view. </para>

                                <para>- Exactly. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> supports my contention that there would be great difficulty in employing any one to send messages under official control, without there always being a suspicion of colour or bias. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> interjected, it is quite conceivable that an appointment which would commend itself to one Government might seem obnoxious to another Government. I hardly think, for instance, that if the members of the Labour Part)', as members of a Government, had to make an appointment of the kind, their choice would fall on the sarnie gentleman that I should select. We see at once the difficulties which would present themselves when we started to depart from the golden rule of an absolutely free press. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has referred to misrepresentations which frequently take place in the private cable messages now sent, and to the fact that the Agents-General have frequently been called upon to correct those misrepresentations. Let me remind honorable senators that not long since it became the duty of the Government of New South Wales to restrain its Agent-General from presenting too florid a view of conditions in that State. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coghlan,</inline> undoubtedly with the best of intentions, allowed his zeal to outrun his discretion, and made such representations in the public prints regarding certain matters in New South Wales, particularly relating, to land settlement, that the Government were called upon to intimate to him that' they did not desire him to go to such advertising lengths as he appeared inclined to go. There is a danger illustrated in a very simple way. I feel that if we had State cable messages sent by an official under the control of the Government, there would always be a tendency to, and ground for, very strong suspicion that they were largely coloured, not by the political views of the individual sending them, but by the. views of the Government to whom he was responsible. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator STANIFORTH</inline>SMITH (Western Australia [4.5]- - The Honorary Minister has referred to difficulties connected with the private ownership of the cable between Great Britain and Canada. I remind the honorable gentleman, however, that that matter does not come within the scope of my proposal, which is that those portions of the Empire, already linked by cable, should be able to communicate with each other on matters of national, commercial, and industrial importance. The honorable gentleman also pointed out that great difficulty would arise in sending messages over the privately-owned land telegraph lines of Canada; and I do not attempt to deny the fact. I believe, however, that the difficulty would not be insuperable, in view of the fact that the cost of press messages is very small. What would be the cost, for instance, of sending 2,000 words across Canada? Without possessing exact knowledge, I venture to think that the cost would be no larger than that of sending a similar message across. Australia. </para>

                                <para>- The cost of sending messages over the land lines, if borne by the Government of Canada, would be very small. Canada has adopted a very different outside policy from that of Australia. The Dominion pushes trade in every quarter, and, unlike Australia, appoints commercial agents in various parts of the Empire. Therefore, there is ground for belief that the Canadian Government would be willing to pay the cost of sending the messages over the land lines, if these messages were free from Vancouver to New Zealand and Australia. However, that is a matter which requires consideration, and in regard to it I am not able to express more than an opinion. As to the nature of the information to be sent, I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has mentioned an undoubted difficult tv - namely, the difficultty in creating some body which, in the first place, would be absolutely unbiased, and, in the second place, would be possessed of sufficient knowledge to supply national information of real importance to the various portions; of the Empire. But I do not think the formation of such a body presents an insurmountable obstacle. At the present time, the press supplies special cable messages- relating to political, commercial, industrial, and sporting matters. These messages are sent out every day, and are distributed lo press organs of diametrically opposite views. Yet I have not heard any complaint that the cable news is biased. </para>

                                <para>- I read the files of the English newspapers, and I think that usually the information cabled out is fairly good. If private individuals, who are paid salaries by newspapers, can collect and send out information without laying themselves open to any serious charge of l&gt;ias, surely it is not impossible for the Government to do likewise in connexion with official bodies. The Agents-General in London have their offices, I believe, close together, and they could send out information regarding trade and commerce day by day. Of course, , on some days it might be necessary to send only a few hundred words, whereas on other days thousands of words might be of advantage. That suggestion could be carried out only when the Government line was extended from the Pacific to Great Britain ; but with regard to New Zealand, the Government have already considered the question of appointing commercial agents, and these gentlemen could cable useful information. As to political news, no question could be raised in regard to matters of fact, and as to matters of opinion, any difficulty could be overcome in exactly the same way as by the press of Australia. </para>

                                <para>- So far as cable news is concerned, I do not think that it is biased, but that it is generally a correct representation, in very limited language, of' events in various parts of the world. Our trade with Canada, is exceedingly small. Last year our imports from the Dominion were represented by £231.000, and our exports to Canada reached the wretched value of only £43,000. Canada is as large as' Australia, and is situated in another hemisphere, with seasons differing from ours ; and there ought to be an immensely larger trade. One reason for the small trade is, I believe, the absence of information likely to stimulate inquiry ; and if there were a free press service on matters of general importance, and a Commonwealth Commercial Agent in Canada, the trade would, in my opinion, be increased fourfold. The general tendency of nations to-day - especially progressive nations like Germany - is to use every possible agency in finding markets. Some of the Australian States have been taking steps in that direction recently in connexion with Oriental countries, but there has been no general effort to find markets for surplus products and manufactures. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir JOSIAH</inline>SYMON (South Australia) [4.15] - In moving the second reading of this Bill, the Honorary Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> said that it is very complicated and intricate. I do not think that that was an exaggeration in describing the nature of the Bill. It was certainly no exaggeration in that it sufficiently described a measure which requires in its preparation care and experience, and in its consideration at the hands of honorable senators, patience and judgment. I think we may all feel that it is a merit of this Parliament, as it is of most English Parliaments, that measures of this description - and, indeed, all measures of important public concern - are proceeded with with a great deal of care and patience, and that as a general rule very few are passed as  the result of mere impulse. Very often, . where that does happen, as no doubt it sometimes does, the result is unsatisfactory, and we find undone in one session what was done in another We have in this particular Bill an example and a warning. It is barely four years since a Bill for exactly the same purpose, so I understand, was placed on the statute-book as one of the machinery Bills required to be passed for the purpose of enabling the Commonwealth engine to work satisfactorily and promptly. If there are defects in that measure I dare say that some, if not all, are due to the fact that most of us treated it as largely a machinery Bill, and relied largely upon the care which we supposed had been devoted' to its preparation by the Parliamentary Draftsman, and to the care and consideration, which we assumed had been given to the scheme embodied in it by the Government of the day. This particular Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> says, is in substitution of that measure of 1901, on two grounds - one, that the drafting of the earlier measure was not so up-to-date that the ordinary reader could easily understand its provisions ; and, secondly, that it had been found that in operation it inflicted many hardships. I really have some difficulty in understanding why this Bill has been introduced. I am not complaining of its introduction. If it is necessary that a Bill passed even last session should be revised from top to bottom in this session, whilst that may not be exactly reasonable or a precedent that should be encouraged, it is right that it should be done in order that the statute-book may be purged of defects, inaccuracies, and inconvenient enactments inadvertently made. But the mere inartistic drafting of a Bill in one session would scarcely justify the introduction in the next session of a long measure of similar purport and enacting a similar scheme. If t'here were hardships inflicted under the original measure, they should be redressed, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> did not refer us to any of the hardships that he might have had in mind as inflicted upon the citizens of the Commonwealth under the existing measure. There may be such, but the honorable and learned senator did not point them out in moving the second reading of this Bill. It may be that when we get into Committee some of them will be brought under our notice. It is, however, remarkable, that, so far as the Senate is concerned, no particular instances of hardship arising under the existing measure, and towards which any new provisions of this Bill are directed have been brought before us. It is therefore difficult to understand for what particular reason this Bill has been introduced. I have a sort of feeling that there is some purpose, which at the moment mav not be very apparent, in some of the provisions of this Bill, which is the moving reason for its introduction. So far as hardships are concerned, there are two things observable about this Bill. In the first place, I am afraid I must say that the marginal notes exhibit a considerable degree of carelessness in their insertion. A large number of them do not accurately describe the provisions of the Bill from which they purport to be taken. I propose to mention a few, not in any spirit of mere criticism, but because, relying upon the information that we receive, we are in the habit of asking that marginal references shall be placed' in Bills in order to facilitate their consideration. It is extremely important that this should be done, but it ig of still greater importance that 'the marginal references when they are supplied shall be accurate. I particularly desire to direct the attention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> and other honorable senators to a few of the marginal references in this Bill, in order that in future greater care may be taken to see that such notes are accurate and not misleading. I refer honorable senators first of all 10 clause 5 - the definition clause. The marginal note to that clause is "Of . 1, No. 13, 1901, s. 2." That is to say, " Compare section 2 of the Act of 1 90 1." That does not assume that every one of the definitions in this clause are the same as those in section 2 of the Act of 1:901. The greater number of these definitions are new. The definition of "owner" and of "land" are altogether new, and the definition of "land"' extends beyond and emphasizes, what honorable senators will see, when I come to refer to one or two of the other clauses, is at least a very important portion of this measure. Clause 6 is said to be identical with section 5 of the Act of .1901. That is misleading, because it is very greatly different from that section. Clause 8 is said to be identical with section 4 of the Act of 1901, but it is different. </para>

The honorable and learned' senator will see that where it is not indicated that the clauses are identical, the note used is "Cf." - that is, that we should .compare the two provisions.

                        <para>- That is so, but I am dealing at present with what is certainly evidence <inline font-style="italic">df</inline> carelessness in the preparation of these marginal notes. Yesterday, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> properly, and I think, instructively, directed attention to a large number of variations to be found in clauses of this Bill, which purport to be copied from the existing Act. I may say that that is the reason why yesterday, although upon points of principle in the Bill I had intended following my honorable and learned friend at once, I thought it, was due to him, in consequence of the care he had taken in referring to certain alterations in the existing Act thai1, before speaking on the second reading, I should take an opportunity of comparing them myself, which I did. The marginal notes to clauses .11 and 32 are misleading, since they show that these clauses are identical with the sections of the existing Act referred to. Clause j 6, which contains a highly important provision, is not merely section 6 of tho existing Act, as the. note would indicate. In the marginal note to sub-clause 2 of clause 16 we have the very expression <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has referred to - "Ib s. <inline font-style="italic">6,"</inline> and yet this sub-clause differs from the section of the existing Act referred to, and not only so, but as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> explained yesterday, it omits the provision in the section requiring the publication of the notification in a 1 newspaper as well as in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette.</inline> Sub-clause 2 of clause 17 contains a highly important departure from the existing Act, and yet is noted " lb. s. 8." Clause 18 is noted " lb. s. 1:1." and yet it is different from that section. The marginal note to clause 1.9 omits the expression "Ibid," and uses the "Cf"- "compare." That is a fair suggestion that a comparison should be made, and that this clause should not be accepted as absolutely identical with the section of the existing Act referred to. Again, the marginal note to clause 20 is " Ib. s. 12," though the clause verv seriously differs from the section referred to, because it omits the provision under which the owners of land shall be entitled to compensation for any damage which they may have suffered by reason of the intervention or of the exercise of the powers of the Minister consequent thereupon. So on, with the marginal notes to other clauses. I refer honorable senators, for instance, to clause 22. </para>

                        <para>- There is a provision, but whether it goes to the same extent or not is a different matter. What I am pointing out to my honorable and learned friend is that it really would be better that we should not have these marginal references at all than that they should lead us improperly to assume that certain clauses are identical with the sections of an existing Act, when, in fact, they involve very serious departures from them. There may be other clauses which make up that part of the enactment, or there may not. They may have the same effect or a different effect. I merely mention these as instances - I daresay there are others which I have not had an opportunity of seeing- which show that, at any rate, greater care might well be taken in regard to Bills affecting important and complicated matters, and which are to supersede Acts of Parliament. We should be able to rely implicitly upon marginal references as indicating whether or not the clauses are identical with existing provisions. My honorable friend has not pointed out any of the existing hardships which are sought to be remedied. There appear to me to be instances where, if the existing law bears hardly upon individual owners, the Bill bears even more hardly, in so far as these specific enactments in regard to compensation and damage are concerned. There are omissions which may be sought to be remedied by other clauses, but which are not so clearly indicated for the guidance of those who are not skilled in examining and analyzing an Act of Parliament. For instance, clause 20 omits the specific compensation for damage done which is provided by the existing Act. Later on in the Bill there is a general provision which mav or may not cover that matter. It is open to consideration whether it was not better and more intelligible to the individuals affected that it should be set out in the same section which enabled Parliament to declare void the notification of the taking of the land, that compensation would be payable if what was done under the notification produced injury to the individual. In clause 2?, again, it is expressly provided, in connexion with the making of surveys, that any damage occasioned thereby should be made good to the individual owner of the land. Clause 16 omits the notification in a newspaper of the taking of land by the Commonwealth, and limits the notification to the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette.</inline> As the Minister mentioned yesterday, this provision was the" subject of discussion when the Bill of 1901 was before the Senate, and it was decided here that, in fairness to the individual owner, it was desirable that the notification should be inserted in the ordinary newspaper, where he was more likely to find it, rather than be confined to the mysterious pages of the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette.</inline></para>

                        <para>- Of course there might. All I am pointing out now is that we have not had pointed out the hardships which have occurred under the existing Act, and that here is an instance of omitting a provision in favour of the land-owner. So that, instead of there being hardships to cure, apparently there are hardships being imposed ; that is, hardships as far as they go. Then, also, in clause 24, there appears to me to be a very serious disadvantage to the owner. This is the provision which empowers the Minister to take clay, earth, stone, and so on, from certain lands. It is declared in the existing Act that that power is not to be exercised in respect of a quarry or place belonging to an individual proprietor, which is " commonly in work." That provision, is omitted from this Bill, and the power is limited - that is to say, it may be exercised by the Commonwealth against the will of the owner if at the moment that it is exercised it does not happen to be in actual work. </para>

                        <para>- I think it would not be unreasonable to use these words - " which at the time of the exercise of such power, or at the time of the taking of the land." If the clause were left in its present form, a natural .interpretation of the words would be "in actual work at the moment of the exercise of the power," and if the owner had stopped operations the day before, or the week before, simply because there happened to be no demand for the particular material to be supplied from the quarry, this power could be exercised in spite of the will of the owner, who would be deprived of the opportunity of working the material with his own men, and selling it to the Commonwealth, if he chose. </para>

                        <para>- the money is there, and it is entirely at the will of the Commonwealth whether it shall be invested or not. If it is invested, it is at the risk of the claimant. That is the only alteration made in the existing Act. That, in itself, would not be a reason for the introduction of this Bill. I wish honorable senators to try to find the reason why the Bill has been brought in. I do not think that they can find it in the making of that alteration, because, although the existing' Act does not contain the words " at the risk of the individual proprietor," it leaves the matter open as to whether the investment shall be made entirely at the determination and will of the Minister. I do not think that, <inline font-style="italic">so</inline> far as draftsmanship is concerned, this Bill is any improvement whatever upon the existing Act. It contains alterations which certainly do not improve our legislation. I will give one or two reasons for thinking so. This is not the kind of Bill which ought to be dumped down before a drafting clerk, so that he may work his own sweet will upon it. It contains principles of a very far-reaching character, which I strongly feel ought to be embodied in a measure which is the result of the most careful consideration, not only by the law officers of the Crown, but by the Government as a whole. The principles of the Bill involve a grave departure from what we have been accustomed to in measures of this description. I will mention one more instance. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> has led me to mention one, namely, the investment at the risk of the claimant. That imposes a liability upon the owner to which he was not subjected before. That liability may be rightly or wrongly imposed. I merely mention the fact. Clause 25 says that where there is temporary occupation of land under a power conferred by the Act -  the Commonwealth shall pay to the owner or occupier of the land, as the case requires, a rent for the occupation of the land. </para>

                <para class="block">That is not a very adequate provision. It is new, and it departs from existing provisions of this description. The existing provisions require that the occupier shall be paid the value of any crop or dressing that may then be on the land. That is omitted in the present Bill, and it is simply provided that the Commonwealth shall pay to the owner or occupier a rent for the occupation of the land. There is another provision to which I will draw attention - that </para>
                <para>Nothing in this section shall take away the right of any person to compensation for damage sustained by reason of the exercise of any power under this part of this Aci. </para>
                <para class="block">How far that is a sufficient provision for the protection of the individual owner is very obscure. I hope that in Committee we may have it elucidated. Let us look at the substance of the Bill. I quite agree, and we must all agree, with what the Minister said, that a measure of this description is essential for the good government of every State. The rights of the individual proprietor must, when necessary, be subordinated to the interests of the community as a whole. It is in order to give effect to that principle that we have Acts of this description existing, I think, in every State of Australia, and in every country where there is government upon the "British model. </para>
                <para class="block">Section 51 of the Constitution provides in paragraph 31 for the making of laws with respect to the acquisition of property " on just terms ' ' - following in that respect the American Constitution - from any State or person, for any purpose in respect of which the Parliament has power to make laws. </para>
                <para class="block">The title of this Bill describes it as a Bill- relating to the acquisition by the Commonwealth of land required for public purposes, and for dealing with land so acquired, and for other purposes connected therewith. </para>
                <para class="block">Then there is a short title to which I take very grave exception. It is called "The Eminent Domain Act 1906." .The expression " Eminent Domain" is one which is not known to English municipal law. It is a term which is known to international public law as expressing in theoretical terms the sovereignty of an independent sovereign over his own territory in which no other sovereign has jurisdiction. The term has been applied in the United1 States to the theoretical source of the power of the Government of that country to take land for public purposes within its particular territory. The origin of its use in the United States was due to die fact that in that country there is no sovereign. The phrase was adopted to express the power of the United States, not merely to take land, but to take every kind of property, from the individual. The expression in this Bill is misleading because it is altogether inconsistent with the long title. This is not an Eminent Domain Bill, because it is confined to a certain portion of the subject-matter of that which is affected by the power that theoretically has its source in the United States in the doctrine of " Eminent Domain." In the next place, the use of the term is complicated here by the mixing 110 of State lands and the lands of individual owners - a condition of things that does not exist, as honorable senators are aware, in the United States. The difference between territorial ownership and jurisdiction in the United States of America and in the Commonwealth of Australia, is, that here the public lands are owned by the States, whereas in America it is otherwise. Here, by virtue of our Constitution, Ave have a new departure which does not exist in America. It is extreme v doubtful how far the term applies in Australia, and whether it does' apply at all to lands which are owned by the States. As I have said, there is no reason why Ave should use the term " Eminent Domain," which even. to the initiated, who have subjected this matter to study, is new tangled; whilst by the uninitiated, to whom the short title of a Bill is of importance - the object of a short title being to guide the' eye and1 the understanding of the casual reader - it would certainly not toe understood. It does not express even as applied in its technical meaning what this Bill is intended to carry out. There is a long title which expresses the object of the Bill, and I suggest that we should not introduce these Yankee notions into our legislation. </para>

The long title of this Bill is not exhaustive of what Eminent Domain is in America ; and I do not see why Ave should not simplify the title, and' call this the " Lands Acquisition Act of 1900." This Bill simply deals Avith the acquisition of land, and not with the doctrine of Eminent Domain. It might be desirable to import that doctrine, but I do not think it necessary, because the power is already inherent in the Crown </para>

                            <para>- They are part of the land ; whatever is affixed to the freehold is part of the land. But if there were 1,000 bushels of wheat in a bam, this Bill would not enable the Government to take; that wheat. Under the American law of Eminent Domain, however, the Government, in case of public necessity, could take that wheat as well as the land. The law of Eminent Domain is altogether inapplicable in Australia, where the inherent right lies in the Crown ; and the reason it was imported into the United States was, in the absence of the sovereign, to attribute the power to the sovereign people- I should also add, for the information of honorable senators, that even in America the law of Eminent Domain has only become a subject of treatises, and so forth, within the last twenty or twenty-five years. It is not an expression known in our law, and it would be better for us not to use outside terms unless for very excellent reasons. There are three aspects of the Bill which, it seems to me, require the consideration of honorable senators. First, the Bill combines the power to take land with the machinery necessary to the taking. The present Act was similarly drawn ; and it is worth discussing whether it is- desirable to continue the system. Secondly, the Bill provides for the compulsory taking of Crown lands from the States ; and. thirdly, it provides for the taking of land from private individuals. It is a pity, in my opinion, that we have not followed the example of England where there is the Land Clauses Consolidation (Act; - one of the (best [drawn Acts ever placed on any statute-book. It is confined entirely to the machinery for acquiring land. In England the power to take lands is, of course, conferred and regulated 'by special Acts; and the great advantage of that method is that Parliament never loses control of the talking of land, or of the public purposes for which it is to be taken. Under this Bill, the power of taking land is sought to be conferred, so that unless Parliament interferes after the notification is published in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette,</inline> or, if Parliament is not sitting, within fourteen days after it meets, there is no direct control by Parliament of the public purpose for which the land is to be acquired. I submit for serious consider.ation the fact that under the Bill the power of the Commonwealth to take land may be construed to confer that power on any delegated authority. In England, the power all emanates from the sovereign, as the theoretical source, and is conferred by special Acts on companies, and public -bodies ; and the same power might be conferred under this Bil] in cases where the Commonwealth Parliament deals with company law. It may be unnecessary to confer the power by any special Act, if under this Bill, when it becomes law, the authority given to the Commonwealth is construed to include an authority delegated to certain persons or bodies. It would have been very desirable if the Bill were confined entirely to machinery and made a Commonwealth Lands, Clauses Consolidation Act. The power to take land for public purposes, such as railways and so forth, would then be conferred by special Act; but the moment the special Act was passed the machinery Act would come into play. It would be much better for the Common-  wealth,  and the  law would be much more easily understood if that plan were adopted. It would be a pity if the Bill, with all the machinery embodied, were to be construed as not applicable to delegated bodies, but confined merely to the taking of land by the Commonwealth for Commonwealth purposes. Of course, the Bill might be recast, and, in my opinion, time would be well spent with that object, so that the power to take land might be eliminated, to be specifically conferred, in every instance, by the assent of the Legislature. </para>

                <inline font-weight="bold">- Senator Trenwith</inline>is substantially quoting the Constitution on the point. I do not anticipate it would, but the power v might be conferred and exercised in the way suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor;</inline> though, of course, all this is more or less speculative. I am not alluding to matters such as those dealt with under the Postal Act, the Defence Act, and so forth, in connexion with which there is, and ought to be, some general provision for the taking of lands, without the necessity for a special Act in each case. I am making these suggestions'; with no intent whatever to embarrass the Government, but merely, to show the desirability for a simplification of the measure - for making it merely a machinery Bill, leaving the taking of land to be dealt with in general Acts relating to defence or postal matters, or in special Acts relating to special purposes. _ The second aspect to which I draw attention is far more important. We in Australia are in a very different position from the people of the United States, or the people in England. The States which constitute the Commonwealth retain all their powers not expressly delegated to the Commonwealth, and to that extent are sovereign States with the entire ownership of the public lands of Australia. The Bill is a new departure not covered by any precedent or practice elsewhere, and, therefore, it behoves us, in order to keep in harmony with the States, to walk very warily indeed. Whatever justification there may be for taking drastic powers as to private land for public purposes - and private lands are protected by the Constitution, inasmuch as they must be taken on just terms - it seems to me to be unwise and a fatal mis' take to apply to the States the same compulsory and drastic method that is applied to the owners of private land. I shall show honorable senators how very serious this is. It strikes me that it is due to the States that provision should at least be made for the taking of Crown lands by a separate Bill. It would be only fair that they should be, I will not say consulted, but apprised of what the Commonwealth contemplates doing. </para>

                            <para>- Yes ; but I propose to show the honorable senator the way in which it is provided that we shall take it under this Bill. With every word that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> has said I thoroughly agree. In every other country enactments of this description deal only with the lands of private individuals. Australia is the first country to establish a precedent and rule of procedure in this matter, and it has occurred to me that, to prevent irritation and friction with the States, it would be well that they should be communicated with as to the best or smoothest methods by' which the compulsory taking of land, if it should become inevitable, shall take place. 'Being an entirely separate matter, it would be a good thing if it were dealt with in a separate Bill. There is no reason for mixing it up with this. What I plead for, as a State representative, is that, where the Crown lands of a State are required, the State should be, I will say, consulted. </para>

                            <para>- Of course, the public interests of the Commonwealth must be provided for effectively, but I am pointing out that there are different ways of doing it. I wish, from my place here, to make the States understand, and my own State in particular, the kind of measure which is being put upon the statute-book, under which, by means merely of a notification: in the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Gazette,</inline> and a notice to the States that it is to be done, the Commonwealth Government can take land without consultation with a State, and irrespective of what the authorities of that State may or may not desire. Let honorable senators look at what it will involve. I ask their attention to clause 6. Of course, it may all be very proper with regard to individuals; but surely some courtesy must be shown to the sovereign States who own the lands, and have the sole power of dealing with their lands, except in so far as it may be necessary that part of them shall be taken for the public purposes of the Commonwealth.

This is a new provision introduced into this Bill, which practically enables the Executive of a State to override any existing law of the State, and makes that authority responsible to the Commonwealth, instead of to its own Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- But my honorable friend must see that, while we should make provision for the acquisition of land that is required for the public purposes of the Commonwealth, we have no right to legislate in such a way as to say that the Governor and Executive Council of a State may do certain things, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any law ' of the State. That takes away the responsibility of the Executive of the State to their own Parliament and laws. </para>

                            <para>- What <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has said shows that this point has not been considered. This is in the nature of an agreement; and the Bill provides a power to enable the Executive of a State, bv force of this measure, and in defiance of any existing State Act, or State Parliament, it may be, to enter into an agreement and convey lands to the Commonwealth. I say that no Executive has the right to do that without the authority df its Parliament. It may be that the Commonwealth, if there were any trouble, should exercise these compulsory powers, but this is intended to have effect, as the Minister says, in cases of mutual agreement, and clause 6 is a declaration that by a Commonwealth Act a State Executive may give the go-by to its State Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- I am. sure the Minister will forgive me for being a little suspicious on the point. If there is one thing more than another in connexion with which the power to acquire should be dealt with by a special Act it is certainly the acquisition of the Federal Capital Site. If we are to remain an harmonious Commonwealth, it would never do to seek, insidiously, by some expressions introduced into a B il,1 such as this, the power to take that land bv riding roughshod over New South Wales. I have no sympathy with many things which have been done in connexion with this matter, but it would be intolerable to most of us that anything of that kind should be done. It is for this reason that I put the question to the Minister, and I am glad to hear that he will be able to give the Senate an assurance upon the point. </para>

                            <para>- I am merely repeating what was talked about out of doors when I say that it was stated that the present Attorney-General, in reference to this matter, said last year that he would have an easy way of overcoming any difficulty on the score of acquiring the land. I certainly entertained a. fear lest, in the expanded phraseology of this Bill, it might be intended to cover anything of that kind. I hope we shall have a positive assurance to the contrary from the Government. In any case, the matter could easily be put beyond doubt by the insertion of two or three words in the Bill. That was 'one of the first clauses which attracted my attention in that regard, because it says, " Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the law of any State." In Part II., there are only two provisions to .which I wish to call attention. Clause 16 provides what does not appear to me to be a very nice method of compulsorily taking lands from a State.

                            <para>- A camp would not be permanent; it is not likely that the Commonwealth would require a big area for that purpose. I merely ask each honorable senator whether he thinks that his State would like this particular method to be applied. In America there is a proceeding that takes place, and' certainly it might be applied to State lands.. Whether it ought to be applied to individuals or not, I do not know. The proceeding is that an application is made upon petition to have what is called an order of condemnation, that is an order declaring that the land is wanted for a public purpose, and that it ought to be withdrawn-' for that purpose, and then there is an opportunity for the State to be heard upon application before a Court, showing that that area was subject already ' to public interests or public requirements, and that there was other land' adjoining, or somewhere else convenient which . might be adapted to the requirements of the Federation. It is only proper that there should be an opportunity afforded to two sovereign bodies - each sovereign within its own sphere - to discuss and, settle a matter of that kind. If they could' not settle it between themselves, then some body, as in America, might be called upon to intervene, and judicially determine the point at issue. I do not pretend to have thought out carefully the proper course which might be adopted. But whatever method is adopted, certainly it is not very courteous to the States that this method should be embodied in our legislation, intimating to them that at any moment the Governor-General can notify in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> that a certain area of land, without limitation, may be taken for some particular public purpose, that by means of that notification it will be taken, and that the State will be merely in the position of a claimant for compensation. If we refer to clause 17, what is the result ? </para>

We might have an honorable senator saying that it would be desirable to have a post-office in the middle of our park lands in Adelaide - I admit that it is not likely - and there might be pressure brought to bear. Why should that be done? In clause 28, there is an expression which made me very suspicious as to whether it was not likely to be applied to the taking of the Capital Site. It says - </para>

                    <para class="block">That is quite different from the law in the United States, where, of course, so far as lands are taken - not lands that are ceded, but lands that are compulsorily acquired - the jurisdiction and law of the State prevails just as much as it does in regard to other private land's therein. In this sub-clause it is assumed that the rights 'df dominion taxation, or revenue, are to be taken away. If that is ,so, surely there ought to be some compensation to the State in that respect. We do not know what the area is. Why should the State be excluded from compensation ? And, again, why should it be deprived of the right which an individual has to damage in respect of severance? Surely, the State, as well as an individual, ought to be entitled to compensation in respect of these things ?. They are matters that can be estimated, and it is only just that the State should be paid. But the main point in this connexion is that the Bill seems impliedly to say - and, whether it is right or not. it is a matter ' that requires very careful discussion, and may involve difference of opinion - that the rights of dominion of the States, and their rights of taxation, are to be taken away the moment the area of land is made Commonwealth property. I think that ought not to be. I hold a very strong opinion with regard to the income tax - that there ought to be no Federal immunity from the payment of it ; and, unless there is some very cogent and strong reason, to the contrary, I hold that the States ought not to be deprived of their revenue earning rights, or of their control, so far as their' local laws are concerned, in respect of lands, even when they pass into the hands of the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- It would not apply in, that case. The Northern Territory would then become a Territory of the Commonwealth, to which special laws would, of course, be applicable. It would be Territory of the Commonwealth until it was created an additional State. I am very glad that my honorable friend made that interjection. I hope that some method will be devised before very long by which the Federal Parliament may exercise control over that very valuable part of Australia. So far as regards the last aspect of the question, in relation to individuals, honorable senators may well take exception to the very drastic manner in which private land is proposed to be taken Under the Lands Clauses Acts, the procedure was commenced in a much nicer way than is here proposed. The owner of the land was served with a notice to treat. He then sent in particulars of his claim, stating what he estimated his property to be worth. Then came am offer from the promoter, who might be a Minister of the Crown, or might be a company undertaking the construction of a railway, or whatever the work . might bc. Then came an offer to the owner of the property. That offer was either accepted or declined. If it were declined, the claimant had to take proceedings to get his compensation assessed. Modern developments of the law in that respect were conceived in the best possible spirit. I quite agree with what the Minister said with regard to arbitrations. The arbitrations which used to take place were simply the arbitrations of par.tizans, and they led on very many occasions, in my judgment, to absolute unfairness. It was for that reason that, in South Australia, and in some other States also, I believe, provision was made that these claims for compensation should be settled by a Judge, or by a Judge and jury, if the Judge so decided ; but it was left for him to say whether he would invoke the assistance of a jury or settle the claims himself. I am bound to say that the settlements of claims for compensation in cases of this kind which have taken place under the new procedure have, generally speaking, given satisfaction. Therefore, I think that the old method night very well have been followed in this Bill. By that method, there was an element of fairness in the adjustment between the two parties, before there was an absolute compulsory taking of the property. The method of this Bill is certainly short, sharp, and decisive. The notification goes into the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette,</inline> and the land is then taken and is vested in the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- Why should it not be done in the old way? 1 do not like this high-handed way of dealing. Why should there not be an element of conciliation as between the Commonwealth and a citizen, or between the Commonwealth and a State? I have thought it necessary to direct attention to these points. The main point, to my mind is, that we ought, if possible, to have a Bill dealing with what is a requirement under our Constitution, the compulsory taking of land from the States or from an individual, and we ought if possible, in doing that, to conciliate the States - to meet their prejudices if honorable senators like. It is very advisable that that should be clone. Certainly some of the provisions to which I have called attention require softening - very great softening - in order that every source of possible irritation may be removed, and that the States may not look- upon the Commonwealth when it is undertaking such a thing as this, as holding a pistol at their heads. I shall, on these lines, assist my honorable friend the Minister in charge of the Bill, as much as I can in dealing with the details when we get into Committee; but I would ask him, in the meantime, to consider the matters to which I have directed attention, in order that if possible, that consideration mav lead "to some useful recasting of the Bill, which will not destroy or weaken in any way its efficiency, but may make it more palatable to those who are immediately concerned. </para>

                        <para>. - After the interesting and informative speech to which we have just listened, I do not propose to detain the Senate very long ; but there are one or two matters that were not touched upon by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> to which I desire to direct the attention of the Minister and of the Senate. I should like, before doing so, to emphasize particularly one point which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> raised, and as to which the evidence presented by the Bill shows a strong desire - I presume on the part of the Department, rather than of the Minister - to secure more autocratic powers as against private owners. Whatever mav be said on behalf of those who framed this Bill, there is manifest a desire in many ways - little ways, I admit, though taken together they represent a clear indication - on the part of those who control the matters touched by the Bill, to secure larger and more autocratic powers, as against private individuals. I do not propose to enumerate those particulars. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> referred to some of them, but he did not exhaust the list; and in Committee, I shall take the opportunity to point out various clauses in which these enlarged powers are sought to be obtained. One other matter to which the previous  speaker  referred, was the many instances in which this Parliament has had to amend Bills passed in previous sessions. It may interest honorable senators to know that, whilst the Federation is only six years old, and whilst many of the Bills which we have passed were of a machinery character - which I should have thought ought not so soon to have required revision - we have already had to direct our attention to twelve amending Bills. This one will make the thirteenth. There is something ominous in that number ! <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has referred to this point somewhat in a tone of rebuke. I am not addressing my remarks particular »- to the Minister, because the Senate itself must take its share of responsibility for the necessity for the introduction "of amending legislation, which is due to faulty work. I rather - think, if I may say so, that the tendency is. very often to view a measure from the point of view of the side of the Senate from which it emanates. That remark -applies to both sides. I should also like to say to the Minister, if I can do so without offence, that there is likewise a tendency or. the part of all Ministers to resent suggestions for the alteration of their Bills. They have, perhaps, had to do with shaping them in the form in which they appp.tr before us, and think that they should be passed as a complete whole. They view with suspicion and resentment any proposal for the alteration of their measures; but I think that it is incumbent upon honorable senators to criticise Bills with a view to improve them, and the Minister should he willing to receive an- suggestions made for that purpose. I hope that in connexion with a Bill of this kind any suggestions that are made will be received 1,v the Minister- irrespective of the side from which they come - not as attempts to harass him in any way. but as indicating a desire to make what is really a machinery Bill a perfect measure, which will not require alteration again within SC short a time. I now wish to direct attention -to the definition clause of this Bill. When the Minister was speaking I pointed out by interjection that a material alteration has been made in the definition of Crown lands. Instead of Crown land being defined as - "the property of the Crown, whether dedicated to any public purpose or not, which has not been granted or contracted to be granted for an estate in fee simple," this Bill leaves out the words - which has not been granted or contracted to be granted for an estate in fee simple. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">The significance of that alteration will be seen when I remind honorable senators that in most of the States there are in the land laws provisions whereby an alienation may, be preceded by a con dit on al lease. I know that that system prevails in New South Wales, and I think that a parallel provision is to be found in the Lands Acts of some of the other States. In New South Wales we have our conditional purchase system, and our conditional lease system. A man who obtains land on the conditional-purchase system pays a small deposit and a series of subsequent annual payments until the land becomes freehold ; and- it never becomes freehold until he has paid up the last shilling to the State. A man who obtains land on a conditional lease obtains it for a certain period, but he has the right to pay for the price of the land in order to convert it into freehold. Under the law as it stands in New South Wales that land is regarded as belonging to the man in occupation of it; but under the Bill which is now presented to us it is to be regarded as Crown land. I asked the Minister yesterday for a reason for the alteration ; and, if I understood his reply aright, it was that it had been deemed desirable by the framers of this measure that the Commonwealth, in resuming land, should deal only with the State Government, leaving the selector to look to the State Government for his share of the compensation. That, I think, is hardly desirable or equitable. In the case of a conditional lessee, whose land was resumed, the Commonwealth would ignore the lessee altogether; and the State Government, having nr great or direct interest, would probably not present as insistently or successfully as the lessee, the factors which determine the value of land. But even supposing the State Government did press the matter, and agreed that the </para>
                    <para class="block">Commonwealth should take over the land at the market value of, say, 15s. per acre, the owner of the land might feel absolutely confident that he could have made a better bargain privately. But the State would reply that only 15s. per acre had been received, and that that was all the compensation that could be paid. It would be far better for the Commonwealth to deal directly with the man, who, although not strictly the legal owner of the land, is, to all intents and purposes, the owner, and is so recognised under the Act we passed five years ago. I ask the Minister to seriously consider the advisability of retaining the principle which obtains in the existing law. It is rather significant that, although <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> explained that it is desirable for the Commonwealth to treat with only one party, that principle is not adhered to in dealings with private lessees. In the case of the latter what 1 am advocating is done, clause 17 providing that, as between lessor and lessee, the apportionment of the rent shall be adjusted mutually by the three parties - showing that the Commonwealth takes an interest in those subsequent proceedings - and that, if a settlement is not thus arrived at, a reference shall be made to the ordinary machinery of the Court. That is only right and proper. </para>

                    <para>This clause clearly and rightly shows the intention of the Government to compensate any man whose interests may have been disturbed, minimized, or destroyed by the resumption of land.

In such cases, in addition to compensation paid for the land and buildings, there ought, as was clearly intended, to be compensation to the tenant for his displacement. </para>

If one method is better than the other, which is the better one?

                            <para>- A similar question arises in connexion with mortgagee and! mortgagor. In regard to these, the Commonwealth is prepared to meet both, and endeavour to arrive at an adjustment; and that is a very fair proceeding. I only ask that the same principles shall apply to conditional purchasers, lessees, or tenants of the Crown. To leave a tenant's case to be represented by, probably, a State official is to deny the tenant the right of showing to what extent he is damaged by the resumption. I shall await with interest the Committee stage, when I trust the Minister will he able to give some better explanation than he offered yesterday, or be prepared to accept an amendment which will bring the provision relating to Crown lessees into conformity with the existing law, or with the clauses which deal with private lessees and mortgagees and mortgagors. Knowing the many complications in tenure under the land laws in New South Wales - complications which are largely duplicated else where - I am certain there will be much trouble, litigation, and heart-burnings if operations under the Bill become numerous, and the States Governments are permitted to negotiate the amount of compensation to be paid to a third party not interested in any way. <inline font-weight="bold">"Senator MULCAHY</inline> (Tasmania) [6.12]. - No doubt" the provisions of this Bill can more effectively be dealt with in Committee, but I should like to call attention to the necessity for more ample means than exist at present for dealing with Commonwealth property. Whether this Bill, presents an opportunity for such legislation I do not know ; but by the Constitution itself all the various properties associated with the transferred Departments passed over <inline font-style="italic">ipso facto.</inline> No doubt a great deal of property hao since been acquired by the Commonwealth Government in connexion with the Postal Department and the Defence Department, and I do not know that there is power to deal with that property in any way except by sale; indeed, I am not sure even as to the power tol sell. In the Act which this Bill repeals power is conferred on the Minister to dispose of property in excess of requirements, and it seems to me that there should be the power of exchange. A post-office, for instance, may not be in a very convenient situation, and, instead of requiring the process of selling, and acquiring another site, the Minister should be able to exchange without any money transaction. </para>

                            <para>- In connexion with the acquisition of small areas of land required for railway and road purposes, there is often a determined disposition shown on the part of the owners to bleed the Government in every way, and in Tasmania a very advantageous method of dealing with such cases has been adopted by the appointment of a single arbitrator. As a rule, arbitration cases are settled by an umpire and two arbitrators. The person desiring to acquire the property and the owner of it will not agree as to terras, and they appoint a single arbitrator or umpire, who finally decides the terms. We found the appointment of a single arbitrator in such cases to be a cheap, effective, and expeditious way of determining disputes as to the value of land required for public purposes. There will no doubt be cases in which it will be necessary that the Commonwealth should acquire a small area of land in a country town, on which to erect a post-office, or for some similar public purpose, and it seems to me that by confining the determination in such cases to the Courts, we shall be compelling people to resort to a most expensive means for the settlement of comparatively trivial disputes. With regard to the very effective remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> as to the friction which might arise between the States and the Commonwealth, I must say that I have a, very great deal of sympathy with what the honorable and learned senator said upon the subject. If we go, so to speak, sword in hand, to a State and' demand land in that way, especially at a time when there may be some friction existing between that State and the Commonwealth Government, we shall be likely to create unnecessary trouble. </para>

                        <para>. - I am very glad to have had an opportunity to listen to the criticisms levelled against this Bill. I feel certain that honora'ble senators who have addressed themselves to it have given a great deal of consideration to its various clauses, and have looked very closely into the alterations which it: purports to effect in the existing law. I should like, before the debate closes, to say a few words in reply to some of the criticism that has been offered. At this hour I shall not delay the Senate at any great length. The first criticism indulged in by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> was that the marginal notes attached to the clauses of this Bill are calculated to mislead those who may be disposed to rely upon them. </para>

                            <para>- I pointed out yesterday that this Bill is in many of its provisions really a re-cast of the existing Act. Though the verbiage has been altered the substance in many instances remains the same. I went through the clauses <inline font-style="italic">seriatim</inline> in which any substantial alterations of the existing Act are contained, and explained them to the Senate as clearly and as fully as I could. I thought that honorable senators might, therefore, understand that they need not necessarily take the marginal notes as indicating that certain clauses had been taken bodily from the existing Act. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> also referred to the fact that I gave no instances of hardships to the individual which have been disclosed in the operation of the present Act, and the honorable and learned senator suggested, therefore, that this Bill is not designed to remedy any of them. </para>

                            <para>- There have been hardships; to the Commonwealth because matters have been hung up in many instances owing to the difficulties in the way of coming to a termination of negotiations with persons whose lands were to be acquired. Apart from that, however, I may recount some of the benefits which the Bill purports to afford to individuals. In the first instance it provides that wherever land is being occupied temporarily, that is to say land other than that which is being actually acquired - it may be adjacent land - payment of rent shall be made to the individual for the period of the temporary occupation. </para>

We make provision for adjusting mortgagees' and mortgagors' rights in the case of compulsory acquisition. We enable the individual who has to serve notices upon the Minister in connexion with the measure to do so by post, without having to incur the expense of personal service, either by himself or by paying some one else to serve the notices. These are only a few of the instances which occur to me in which provisions are inserted for the benefit of the individual. </para>

                            <para>- With regard to the other criticism offered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> I think I may deal with it better in Committee. I agree with the honorable and learned senator that there is no necessity on the part of the Commonwealth to impose any such conditions upon the States as might interfere with the harmonious relations which should always exist between them and the Commonwealth. I feel certain that this Bill does not do that, and we shall find that the words used are such as appear in the existing Act. With regard to the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> the honorable senator will find, when we get into Committee, that a conditional lessee of Crown land will stand in. the same position as lessees from private individuals. This is dealt with in clause 57, which deals with the acquisition of land subject to a lease. Although we have defined "Crown land" in the definition clause, as any land the property of a State, we have also defined " land " generally, and have so defined it as to include, amongst other things, " Crown land " that is leased by any contract from the Crown. Lessees from the Crown are therefore entitled to all the ordinary privileges and rights accorded to lessees of land generally under clause 57. This is a matter with which we can deal more fully in Committee, as is also the matter referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy.</inline> It is desirable that the Commonwealth should have power, not merely to sell or dispose of land itself, by way of sale or lease, but also that it should have a direct power to effect exchanges, perhaps with the States, for other land which may be occupied by the States for other purposes. It is desirable that we should have that power directly under this Bill, in order that the negotiations between the Commonwealth and the States may rest on some sure foundation, and may be expedited to the advantage of both. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> is mindful of some transactions of the character which have taken place in the past between the Commonwealth Government and the Government of Tasmania. After what has been a fairly exhaustive criticism of the details of a somewhat intricate measure, I think we should now be able to approach its consideration in Committee with a prospect of some very satisfactory results. </para>
