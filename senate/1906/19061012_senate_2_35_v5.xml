Whenever a Minister lays a paper on the table, almost invariably an honorable senator moves that it be printed, without any conception of its size, or what the cost of printing would be, and when the printing bill comes up at the end of the session the Printing Committee is blamed. If the Senate would adopt the same procedure as is followed in the House of Representatives, of referring all papers, unless of extreme urgency, to the Printing Committee for a recommendation as to whether they should be printed or not, and, before coming to a decision, ascertaining what the cost of printing1 each paper would be, a great saving would be effected, and, at the same time, all necessary printing would be done. </para>
