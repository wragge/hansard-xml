                        <para>. - I think it is a matter for congratulation that the Senate has at last discovered itself. For nearly five years we have sought for a weapon by which we might punish a Government if we so desired. On various occasions we have passed resolutions concerning the conduct and attitude of different Governments towards the Senate, but never until the present time have we discovered any effective method of giving expression to our protest. Our resolutions have been passed by with a most amused remark or sarcastic reference to the powers of the Senate. We have never been able to get the Senate to take very positive action to enforce its view. I dare say that if the time should ever come when the Senate will deem it necessary to reject a Bill, not once but a second time, if the measure is important enough it will stand to its guns. But there are minor occasions on which it is necessary that it should express its opinion. </para>

                            <para>- It might be a funny way to do it in an ordinary Legislature, and it might be a peculiar way in a Legislative Council. I am sorry to think that some members of another place, and a section of the public and the newspapers, have not got over the impression that the Senate is a mere Upper House. It will be well for them and the public generally when they get to realize that it is something more. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir JOSIAH</inline>SYMON (South Australia) &#91;2.45&#93;. - Whilst I thoroughly agree with the sentiment with which my honorable friend opened his remarks - that it is essential that the dignity, the importance, and the power of the Senate should be maintained on all occasions, I am not a;t all sure - in fact, I am convinced of the contrary - that a count-out is exactly the weapon which it ought to use. There are many other and more effective ways in which it can assert itself, and whilst I concur in what my honorable friend has said as to the tendency of late - in fact, during the last five years - to consider that the Senate has not maintained the high place under the Constitution which was anticipated for it, still we have not, I think, utilized the powers; and weapons which are in our hands, and which are much more effective for the purpose than a count-out. A count-out establishes nothing. If the Senate is unanimous, or if a majority of honorable senators so desire, they have other ways of asserting their opinion on the conduct of the Government. I need not indicate what they are, and perhaps it would not be relevant to do so. A count-out, I repeat, establishes nothing, except that in the minds of the few who are in the chamber at the moment there is a feeling that if there is important business on the notice-paper, it is not fair that it should be transacted with a minimum number of senators present. That is all it indicates. </para>

Whilst quite agreeing with what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> said, that we ought, on all occasions, to avail ourselves of every weapon we possess to maintain the control and the power of the Senate, to assert it on the highest possible ground, I doubt whether a count-out is exactly that weapon. It has its uses. There may be reasons for employing it that are not generally known, and it is because of the inability to have them plainly stated in the face of the Parliament and public that I think it will scarcely avail my honorable friend for the high purpose which I, in common with him, desire to see carried out. </para>

                            <para>- Several honorable senators, including myself, asked, perhaps in rather a heated way, that certain information should be given to the Senate on a vital question of policy. I was one of those who objected to certain action which the Government had taken. Without going into the merits or demerits of that action to-day, I think it would have been only courteous on the part of the Minister of Defence if, when replying to the debate on the first reading of the Supply Bill, he had given the Senate some reasons for what had been done. Instead of doing that, however, the leader of the Government, as it seemed to me. deliberately and intentionally ignored the complaint of those honorable senators who had taken objection. It was this fact that caused me to feel that the leader of the Government had not done a fair thing, especially as the honorable senators to whom I refer are amongst those who have been consistent supporters of the Government. But whether they are supporters or opponents, the leader of the Government owed it to the Senate to give some explanation, at least, of the action to which exception was taken. But when he deliberately ignored those honorable senators, and further said that he did not think it necessary to reply - he may not have meant all his words implied to me, at least - it seems to me that any course of action that suggested itself, even on the spur of the moment, was justifiable. My reason for walking out of the Chamber on Friday last, and thereby assisting to block business, was my dissatisfaction with what I considered the unfair treatment and want of courtesy displayed by the leader of the Government. </para>

                        <para>. - I think I might ask the Minister of Defence to give honorable &#39; senators some indication of whether or not we shall be able to proceed with business this afternoon. From a statement which appeared in a newspaper recently, it appears that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> affirmed that the business would proceed conditionally on the Labour Party receiving a &#34; humble apology &#34; from the Government. The Senate, I think, has a right to know whether that humble apology has been tendered, and, if so, something of the terms in which it has been couched. </para>

                        <para>. - I hope that the very best of feeling will be maintained in the Senate, notwithstanding what may have happened on Friday last. In fact, we have evidences of that good feeling now, when honorable senators seem prepared to assist in every way to carry out the intentions of the Government, and thereby forward the work of the country. Even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> today exerted himself in assisting the President, when he desired <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> to connect his remarks with the question before the Senate. The very fact that the leader of the Opposition, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> has given expression to the opinion that a count-out is not the best means by which to maintain the rights of the Senate, is another proof of kindly feeling towards the Government. This, of course, must be cheering to the Government <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> but we must not forget that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> was not present on Friday, and is, therefore, not fully seized of the circumstances. The Government must be congratulated on the fact that now, for the second time, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has got up to take their part. </para>

So far as I am concerned - and, I believe, I may speak for other honorable senators - the action taken on Friday last was not prompted by any dislike to the representative of the Government in the Senate. That action was due to the way in which the Government had treated the Labour Party throughout the whole session, and are endeavouring to treat that party now. Evidence of that is very plain here to-day. When the Government do anything that is not in accordance with whatever agreement may exist between them and the Labour Party as to the support of the latter during the session, the Opposition are always prepared to jump into the breach, as they are doing to-day, and defend the Government. </para>

                            <para>- In the discussion on the Australian Industries Preservation Bill we have heard a good deal about what is known as a &#34; gentleman&#39;s agreement &#34; ; and, as the members of the Labour Party are all gentlemen, and endeavour to keep their promises, they look to the other party to any agreement to do the same. The Opposition, some time ago, resented similar treatment at the hands of the Government, and I can remember the indignation which was felt, and even given expression to, by members of the Opposition when certain action was taken before, or when, this Government came into power. We members of the Labour Party are always willing to accept the assistance of the members of the Opposition who are prepared to join with us in protesting against what we consider to be unfair treatment in connexion with any promise that may have been made as to support to be given to this or any other Government. Seeing that a protest has been entered, and that the people of Australia now know why a certain party in the Senate took that action, we are satisfied to support the Government in carrying on the business of the Commonwealth. I think I ought to refer to what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> said with respect to the humble or abject apology which ought to be tendered to the Labour Party by the Government. </para>

                        <para>. - Seeing that there is a disposition this afternoon to act as though the session was to last for all eternity, I might as well take a little part in the proceedings. I was very much gratified .to hear several senators talking as if they were greatly concerned about the dignity of the Senate. To listen to those honorable senators, one would think that the Senate had no dignity ; indeed, after hearing, them, I am almost compelled to&#39; come to that conclusion. If the Senate had any dignity, honorable senators would not be required to protest so often. I am sorry I cannot agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> as to the effectiveness of the wonderful weapon he has just discovered - this wonderful weapon of the count-out. The -honorable senator pointed out that we had long been hunting, like some blackfellow, for a boomerang or spear with which to convince the Government that we disapprove of their action, and that we had at last found the weapon. I ask in all seriousness what has that weapon accomplished? It has been thrown at, and has hit and rebounded off the hide of, the Government, who stand exactly in the same position that they did on Friday. What have we gained by exploding this bomb under the nose of the Government? Have we had any explanation about their defence policy? Have they given us any information with reference to New Guinea? No; we stand in exactly the same position that we did on Friday afternoon. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> is in earnest, and really desires that the Senate shall stand on its dignity and take its place as a live portion of the Commonwealth Legislature, there is one course, and one course only, open to the honorable senator and those who think with him. That course is to vote against the motion of the leader of the Government. By doing so, and by rejecting the motion we shall most effectually bring the Government to their bearings. _ But as to a count-out, we might as well tickle the nose of a crocodile with a feather. The leader of the Government himself was very glad to have a count-out on Friday afternoon. He knew perfectly well that the ire of the Labour Party would subside by Tuesday - that the tiger would by then be as docile as possible. To all intents and purposes, so far as I can discover, that is exactly what has happened. As one who. alone; with other honorable senators, has taken exception to the conduct of the Government on various occasions, I intend to vote against the motion, and to continue taking similar steps until the Government have given as the information and explanation which were asked for by certain honorable senators on Friday- last. If other honorable senators are in earnest, and wish to maintain the dignity, power, and prestige of the Senate, here is a splendid opportunity. Let them stop all discussion on this Supply Bill until the information asked for has been given. The Government would then find that at last they had bumped up against something. I do not know whether the members of the Opposition would assist the Labour Party in opposing the motion ; but, in any case, I shall give them an opportunity to show what they are made of. I intend to carry the feud out to its proper conclusion by voting against the motion. </para>

                            <para>- I replied in other language, and only referred incidentally to the difficulty created by the fact that a great many people had different views on the subject of defence. However, I had received no notice that any reference to the subject of New Guinea was to be made, and therefore, I was not in a position to reply.

                            <para>- No, it was not. His answer having been given, I considered that it was quite sufficient for me to say that I had no further information, and that therefore I did not wish to take up the time of the Senate on the subject. I never had, it in my mind to say anything that was distasteful to any honorable senator. But a Minister is not expected to answer every question on the spur of the moment. Had not <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> an equal right to say that I did not answer every question that he put to me? Had not other honorable senators a right to say that I had not answered them? But I answered those questions relating to my own Department as well as I was able; and I never had the slightest intention to snub the members of the Labour Party, or any other party. If some honorable senators are under that impression, they are doing me an unmistakable injustice. </para>

                        <para>.- I notice in the schedule attached to the Bill that there is a vote for the Administration of New Guinea, and a vote for the Defence Forces. I shall, therefore, be in order in speaking on matters relating to those subjects. As to New Guinea, it will be within the recollection of the Senate that when, last year, Parliament passed the Papua Act, there was a strong expression of opinion from a large number of honorable senators as to what should be the guiding principle for the future government of the country. We were led to believe by the representative of the Ministry that Papua would be governed in accordance with the ideas then expressed. It has been a matter of profound disappointment to a great number, myself included, to find, so far as we can judge from the manner in which the affairs of the, Posses- sion have been dealt with by the Government, that all our desires are being completely ignored. For instance, no expression of opinion could be stronger than that made by a number of honorable senators, that the Administrator of Papua should be an Australian, who would be able to govern in accordance with Australian sentiments and aspirations. But, instead of the Government redeeming the promise then made - because there was an implied promise that effect would be given to that desire - it went out of its way to offer the Administratorship to a gentleman who is not an Australian, and who could hardly be expected to govern the Possession in accordance with Australian sentiment and ideals. The Government, being disappointed in its desire to appoint a certain gentleman, has proceeded to shelter itself behind a Royal Commission, appointed to inquire into the present administration, and into matters connected with the Possession generally. When a Government, by its very existence, acknowledges that there is a man in Australia good enough to be the head of the Administration of this great Continent, it is quite up to that Government to recognise that there must be some other Australian good enough to be the Administrator of that small Possession. If an Australian is good enough to be Prime Minister of this Commonwealth, why cannot we find an Australian who is good enough to govern the only Possession we have outside the borders of Australia? How can we expect to get an Imperial officer, or some person from Great Britain, who has had no previous experience in opening up any new country - much less in opening up a new tropical country - and who has no acquaintance whatever with Australian sentiment, to govern this Possession as we desire to see it governed? It is not possible. The Government should not have run away from its responsibilities, but should have appointed some one in Australia to the position. I know personally, that so far as New Guinea officials are concerned, they are mostly absolute failures, who have been pitchforked into positions over there. Some officers who have been there have been the ne&#39;er-do-well hangers-on of aristocratic families, whom those families were glad to shift away, because, so long as they were nearer home, their relatives were continually afraid that they would be a disgrace to them. It may be satisfactory from the point of view of aristocratic families that they should be able to shift their ne&#39;er-do-well relations&#39; to Papua in this fashion, but it is not well from the point of view of Australians, who have the responsibility of administering the affairs of the country. Perhaps some honorable senators may consider that the remarks which I have allowed to fall with regard to the character of some of these officials are a bit too strong. But they are not strong enough to cover the actual facts. I know of my own certain knowledge that one man was appointed simply and solely on the ground that he had certain highly- placed relatives in this country, and that he had to be run out of New Guinea because of his conduct there. Afterwards that same man had to be smuggled out of Melbourne by his highly-placed relatives to avoid the officers of the law. These are the people who have been appointed to positions within the gift of the Government over there. The sooner we determine to have a better system of management the better. What is the position at the present time? The Government, in compliance with a request made by the. Administrator, Captain Barton, has appointed a Commission to go to Papua to inquire into .the management of affairs generally. We have already had two Papuan Commissions. Last year the Secretary of the Department of External Affairs was sent over at considerable expense to inquire and report. He did so, and his report has been before honorable senators. After the Richmond case another Commission was appointed. Now we have a third appointed at the request of Captain Barton - a request which was read to the Senate yesterday, and which I say is a. very lame document on the face of it. <inline font-style="italic">lt</inline> is a very short statement, saying that there are rumours going round as to dissatisfac-tion with the administration, and requesting that a Commission be appointed to inquire. No details are given. No strong reasons are put forward. But the very moment tha Government received the request it almost rushed into the arms of Captain Barton, and appointed a Commission. To me it looks very much like a &#34; put-up job.&#34; </para>

                            <para>- If he had been giving an order to his valet about going out duck shooting he would have given as many details as are contained in this letter. It looks as though the Commission was appointed simply to allow the Government to shelter itself behind this device, and to run away from its obvious duty. The duty of the Government is to see that the affairs of Papua are efficiently and properly administered. I require no Commission to tell&#39; me that the affairs of the Possession have not been well managed, because it is a self-evident fact. Any one who has taken interest in New Guinea affairs must be aware that the administration is a total and absolute failure. In addition to the revenue produced in the country, it costs this Commonwealth ,&#163;20,000 per annum to administer the Territory, and we know that this money is spent on a little nest of officers who do nothing. There is not even a couple of miles of efficient road there yet. The white population is seething with discontent. In every respect the administration is a failure. Why go to the needless expense of appointing a Royal Commission to tell us so? And even after we have paid the members of the Commission, it is doubtful whether they will tell us the real state of affairs, because reliable evidence will not be placed before them. They will obtain evidence from the Administrator himself, and from his officers, who are absolutely dependent upon him for their positions. It is not to be expected that the Commission will obtain any really impartial evidence. </para>

                            <para>- We know further that there is a sort of reign of terror established in New Guinea at the present time, and that any man who sets himself to in any way thwart the desires of those at present administering the affairs of the country, finds&#39; it made so hot for him that he has to clear out of it. I am personally acquainted with many men living in New Guinea, and. rightly or wrongly, that is the feeling they have. That must be admitted to be a highly unsatisfactory condition, of affairs. There is a very simple way out of the difficulty, and it is for the Government to assume their proper functions, and&#39; to exercise the responsibility which this Parliament has placed upon them. They are unworthy to occupy their present position if they are not prepared to accept that responsibility. It is a lamentable thing to find the Government sheltering themselves on every possible occasion behind some Royal Commission. In my view, the only way in which we can manage New Guinea is the very simplest way, and that is by the appointment as Administrator of an, Australian who will know what ought to be done in the development of a tropical country, and what is necessary to safeguard the interests of the natives of the Territory. We want a person in the position who will do something; by opening up roads, and other such works, for the development of the country, instead of sitting down in an office, drawing a salary every year, and having nothing to show for an annual expenditure of &#163;43,000. That is the present position in New Guinea., and the- longer it is allowed to continue, the worse the position will become. There are plenty of men in Australia capable of administering the government of New Guinea,- men who&#39; have had experience in the opening up of tropical country, in the conditions which there prevail, and who have been in the habit of dealing with aboriginal natives. They are certainly far better fitted for the thousand and one duties which would fall to the Administrator of the Possession, than any hanger-on of an aristocratic family of the old country could possibly hope to be. I hold that the Government are deserving of censure for neglecting to carry out the express wish of Parliament by proclaiming the Constitution of the Territory, and establishing an Administration. When I endeavoured to have certain &#39;amendments inserted in the proposed Constitution, I was told that although a majority of honorable senators were in favour of them, it would be better not to press them, because if I did, we should lose the Bill, and New Guinea would only be so much longer without a Constitution. It now appears that it would not: have made the slightest difference if the Constitution enacted for New Guinea had been delayed for another twelve months, since it has been allowed to remain a, dead letter since the day it was passed. How long is this state of affairs to continue? How long will it be before the Government assume their proper responsibility, and rectify the shameful state of affairs at present existing in New Guinea? I am satisfied that the people of Australia, are not satisfied that things should be allowed to go on as they have been for some time past, and I warn, the </para>

                    <para class="block">Government plainly that unless something is done to rectify the present position &#60;:f affairs, I shall, on every available occasion, be prepared to criticise their action, or rather, inaction, as strongly as 1 possibly can. I hope that in future the Government will accept their proper responsibility in this matter, and will pay some respect to the wishes of Parliament, and, I venture to say, of the country. I hope they will undertake to put an end to the present position by the appointment of Australian officers to administer British New Guinea, in accordance with Australian ideals and sentiment. There is another matter to which I should like to refer, and that is in connexion with the Defence Department. It appears to me that so long as the government of the Commonwealth is conducted as at present, our aspiration to be considered a self-governing people will remain little more than an aspiration or a pretence. Self-government should mean, if it means anything, government by ourselves in accordance with our own ideals. I have pointed out that in the case of New Guinea, instead of the Government endeavouring to govern that Australian Possession by Australians, and in accordance with Australian sentiment, they appear to desire to import Imperial officers to administer the Territory in accordance with Imperial ideas. If that be trie object in view,&#34; why did we take over New Guinea at all? Why could we not have left the Possession to the Imperial authorities to manage it as they &#39;pleased? Having (undertaken the responsibility, the Government have run away from that responsibility, and what in such a case becomes of the principle of self-government? The same thing holds good with regard to the question of defence. The Government, instead of formulating a defence policy for Australia run away to the Imperial Defence Committee, and ask the members of that Committee to formulate a defence policy for us. Is that self-government ? , If we are to go on in that way, we might just as well have remained an appendage of the Imperial Parliament and Imperial authorities. </para>

Whilst owing nominal allegiance to the British Crown, we should exert our rights of self-government to the fullest possible extent. That, however, will be impossible if the Federal Government are content to run away from their responsibilities, and if, because of their own incapacity to formulate a defence policy, they are prepared to shelter themselves behind the report of the Imperial Defence Committee, and the reports of endless committees and commissions of inquiry. </para>

                            <para>- If we are to refer in these matters to the Imperial Defence Committee, self-government with us is but a farce. I am not content, nor is the majority of the people I represent content, that the great Defence Department of the Commonwealth should be conducted in any such way. The people of Australia Have ideas of their own, and desire that they should be put into practice. The sooner Ministers recognise that fact the better for themselves. If they do not, the people will soon find a Government who will. When the last Supply Bill was before us, I made some reference to the necessity for the establishment of an Arms and Ammunition factory in Australia. The Minister pooh-poohed the idea, and contended that the cost would be too great, but I say that no cost can be considered too great that is necessary to insure our safety in the hour of danger, and there is absolutely no safety for us in this respect unless we can manufacture our own arms and ammunition. The supply of arms and ammunition that can be kept in stock is necessarily limited, and might possibly not amount to more than would suffice to meet the requirements of a month or two on a war basis should hostilities actually be commenced. It is quite within the bounds of possibility that our communications oversea would be cut off, and we should then be absolutely helpless, notwithstanding the manhood of the nation, unless we were able to arm our <inline font-style="italic">own</inline> people. There is only one way in which we can be sure of , being able to do that, and that is by the establishment of an arms and ammunition factory of our own. It must be admitted that our provision for defence is farcical if it is not sufficient, and it should be made sufficient at whatever cost. It is somewhat peculiar for a protectionist like the Minister of Defence to contend that we should not establish a local arms and ammunition factory, because it might cost a little more per lb. to manufacture cordite in Australia than to import it, or to make or repair guns in Australia than to import them. I point out that the matter of national defence is one which cannot be governed by considerations of pounds, shillings, and pence ; that no cost can be considered too high to insure our safety in the hour of trial. I object mainly to the fashion which would appear to be coming greatly into vogue in Federal politics of the Government running away from their- responsibilities, and sheltering themselves behind royal commissions on every possible occasion. That has always been the refuge of a Government which have lacked sufficient courage and capacity to tackle any great question on their own. I object for this reason to the appointment of the New Guinea Commission, and to the various Committees, inquiries, and reports in connexion with the Defence Department. Nothing is ever done. The reports are pigeonholed, they have grown to be mountains high, and it would now be a superhuman task for any man to undertake to read them all. Any ideas which the Department of Defence might have had have been covered over with a mass of verbiage. What we require is a plain, straightforward commonsense defence policy, and if the present Minister of Defence is unable to initiate such a policy, the sooner we get a Minister who is capable of doing so the better it will be for the country. My criticism may appear to be somewhat harsh, but I have no desire to be unduly severe upon the Government. My chief desire is to induce them to do what I know the people of Australia desire that they should do. and that is to conduct the government of the Commonwealth, and of New Guinea, in accordance with Australian ideas, and to establish a national system of defence that will be satisfactory to the manhood of Australia. If the Government will do that they can be assured of the support of the country, and of Parliament, and that generous assistance will be given them by Parliament in the passing of the necessary supplies. The Minister of Defence partly promised last session that during the recess he would formulate a defence policy, but the honorable senator has not done so. </para>

                            <para>- It makes no difference whether he is a captain or a sergeant or a lieutenant. He is a man, I suppose, and as such he ought to receive every consideration at our hands, and not to be unjustly or unfairly treated or hounded down. With reference to the charge made by Richmond, there was appointed a special Board of Inquiry, which, if I remember aright, consisted of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan,</inline> the Public Service Commissioner ; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Garran,</inline> who is well known to honorable senators as an annotator of the Constitution in conjunction with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Quick; and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Allen,</inline> who is Secretary to the Treasury. As the result of an exhaustive inquiry, the Board absolutely exonerated Captain Barton from all blame, and fixed the blame upon his accuser, who was disrated, and sent to a more outlying part of the Territory. Meanwhile, as I am informed by the Prime Minister, complaints were coming to him from diggers, storekeepers, and others in Papua more particularly in regard to the administration of the land laws. Although he was not prepared to dispense with the services of Captain Barton, still he felt that if he could get a gentleman who possessed special knowledge, and had Had practical experience in that country, it would be a wise thing, in the circumstances, to secure his services. There was a man who, for years, had been governing it as a Possession, and who was admitted on all sides to be a most highly successful Administrator, and the Prime Minister very properly thought that if he could secure his services he would be doing the right thing. He did not take this course for the purpose of snubbing Captain Barton, because he felt that, although he had never communicated with Captain Barton on the subject, that gentleman would readily retire in favour of a man possessing unique qualifications for the position. Some honorable senators seem to think that it was a put-up job on the part of Captain Barton to apply for a Royal Commission. I am informed that it was nothing of the sort. The Prime Minister says that, so far as he is aware, Captain Barton did not know at the time he asked for the appointment of a Royal Commission that he was in communication with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> McGregor on the subject. He decided to order an inquiry, because he believed that that was the very best way to find out to what extent trouble existed, and how it would be possible to prevent a recurrence of it. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know. I have not administered the Department of External Affairs, and I do not pretend to make definite statements on the subject. It may be not the fault, but the misfortune, of Captain Barton to be surrounded by men who do not act loyally towards him. The honorable senator has pointed out certain officers who, in his opinion, were highly improper persons to be appointed in any circumstances. Being subordinate officers, it can be readily understood that they might make it almost impossible for Captain Barton to govern the Territory. No man can govern a territory, command a regiment or a ship unless he has the loyal support of his officers, and also of his men. </para>

                            <para>- It is a great deal better to have a Royal Commission to inquire into the matter, and to give the Government the best advice on the subject before a Lieutenant-Governor is appointed. I now come to the question of appointing an Australian&#39; to the position. For many years my principle has always been to appoint our own citizens in preference to outsiders in practically every case, except such a unique case as that of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> McGregor. I have no doubt that in the future an .Australian will be appointed to this position, if it is found that the present occupant is responsible for what is called the misgovernment of the Territory. But if he is not, and we cannot get a man with a better knowledge of tropical countries, and with more experience, why should we dismiss Captain Barton and put another man in his place? </para>

If honorable senators will take the trouble to look up a speech which was delivered on the 23rd August, 1906, bv the Prime Minister, in reply to statements exactly similar to those which have been made here by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> they will see the answer which can be given. Senator Givens has charged me, as Minister of Defence, with being in favour of the appointment of Imperial officers. </para>

                            <para>- But subsequently the honorable senator said that I had always been in favour of appointing Imperial officers. I have never been in favour of their appointment. I have been criticised very severely because during my term of office I have got rid of two or three of them. I had placed in the GovernorGeneral&#39;s speech a special paragraph with regard to that very subject, and the Government are now pledged to the appointment of Australian officers to the Military and Naval Forces, and to &#39;the appointment of Australian citizens to positions in the Public Service, wherever favorable and fit men can be secured. The honorable senator also asked why I appealed to the Imperial Defence Committee for advice with regard to the defence of the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- No; we asked the Imperial Defence Committee, not to formulate a policy, but to make recommendations. Our own officers, who possess local knowledge, will be able to say whether they agree with the recommendations or not, but because the Imperial Defence Committee have made recommendations there is no necessity for us to adopt them. When there were in Great Britain Imperial officers who were of the highest standing, and had had the greatest experience - far greater than our own men could possibly have had - when there was a Colonial Committee of Defence, which advised the States prior to Federation, and which has since advised the Commonwealth ; when I received from my officers all sorts of conflicting recommendations, and when, not being an expert, I could not very well decide between them,. I thought that the best thing I could possibly do, in the interests of the Commonwealth: was to ask the highest authority in the British Empire to give us the benefit of their advice. I submit that, taken as a whole, their advice is excellent. Let me take one point on which my officers were not absolutely agreed, and that &#39; is the character of the guns which should be mounted here. The Imperial Defence Committee recommended a uniform type of gun for use throughout the Commonwealth, namely, the 6.7, which is one of the best guns to be procured. An ordinary 6-inch gun is not to be compared for excellence with the 6.7 gun, which contains all the latest improvements. By the adoption of the superior gun we shall be able to save something like ^16,000, while maintaining our fixed defences in a state of equal, and even greater, efficiency. The 6.7 guns require a smaller number of men to handle them, and, because of this, there will, of course, not be the necessity to employ so many permanent members of the force. Other recommendations have been made by the Imperial Defence Committee; and these we shall have to consider. For instance, it is recommended that the fixed defences at Albany, and also at Fremantle, shall be abolished; and it is for us to decide whether that step shall be taken. What I desire to point out is that these recommendations are made by some of the highest authorities to whom we could appeal. At the same time, we are not bound to adopt all their recommendations, and I do not suppose that we shall. </para>

                            <para>- I should say not more than a month. I ha.ve brought matters to a point at which I can lay before my colleagues what I believe should be the policy for the present, and for the near future. I cannot, of course, lay down a scheme for all time, because, in matters of defence, there is constant change, requiring modification in the methods of administration and organization. The Boer war taught the British Generals that there is not that necessity which was previously insisted on for men. to be drilled and dressed up on parade, with a view to going through certain evolutions, but that the best men for the defence of the country are those who, with, perhaps, only a slight knowledge of drill, have received a thorough training in the use of the rifle. It will be seen that an alteration of the kind indicated will, to some extent, do away with the necessity for regular troops ; and a modification in this direction may be seen in the proposals recently laid before the House of Commons by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Haldane.</inline> I think the Government have done quite right in getting the best information possible before submitting a defence scheme to Parliament. The establishment of a factory for the manufacture of small arms and shells was recommended by Major-General Hutton years ago, and has been approved of, I think, by every Government up to the present. No doubt it is exceedingly desirable that the Commonwealth should possess such a factory, though this is not so important as we might be led to suppose from the remarks of some honorable senators. However that may be, there must sooner or later be a factory of this kind in the Commonwealth, though, singular to relate, no proper information has been obtained on the subject. Information is being obtained now. It will be remembered that last year, when the subject was before us, I pointed out that the smallest establishment for the manufacture of small arms and shells would cost at least ^150,000. </para>

                            <para>- This is a much more serious matter than the honorable senator seems to imagine. In Canada the manufacture of small arms for the Government is carried on by a company, which turns out the Ross rifle - a very different weapon to that favoured in the Commonwealth. This manufacture by a company has been going on for only a comparatively short time; and, from the last report which I read&#39;, the venture does not appear to be proving very satisfactory. I do not approve of the manufacture of small arms and ammunition being carried out by a private company. Such work ought to be carried on under Government supervision - that is the best policy under the circumstances. I hope that whoever may be Minister of Defence in the future will be able to lay before Parliament a proposal for the establishment of a small arms factory, which I think must be situated at Lithgow, in New South Wales, where the coal and irqn are on the spot I need not say more than that this is a usual .Supply Bill, making no more than the ordinary provision based on last year&#39;s Estimates. No new appointments or new works are dealt with in the schedule. </para>

        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir JOSIAH</inline>SYMON (South Australia) &#91;4.16&#93;. - This is a clause which enables the Commonwealth to interfere with a trade or undertaking carried on within the boundaries of a State. It is more specific in that respect than the clause upon which a constitutional question has already risen, namely, clause 5. It would prevent a trading corporation or a financial corporation from carrying on its own business * within the boundaries of a State, even although the State law did not apply, and the operations of the company might be beneficial in the estimation of the State. It raises identically the same point as we previously discussed, as to the position in which the Bill places- an individual, or a combination of individuals, who may be guilty of the grossest possible monopoly in the estimation of a State to the detriment of the community within the State. That individual or combination of individuals may indulge in monopoly to his heart&#39;s content, and to the great disadvantage, it may be, of the whole or part of the community, while an incorporated company on the other side of the street will not be able to do so. There will thus be two sets of laws. A combination of individuals in the form of a partnership may do all the evils sought to be cured by this clause, but the same combination of individuals if they choose to register themselves as an incorporated body will Le liable under this legislation. I do ask honorable senators whether, from that point of view alone - without going into any subleties of constitutional law - -the situation commends itself to them ? How could they justify that position when they go before the electors, as a number of us have to do within a few weeks? It would be impossible. We should be rightly accused of being traitors, not to the rights of the States so much as to the rights of the traders within the State. It is impossible for any man to justify to his constituents the making of fish of one and flesh of another by declaring that4 because the registrar of companies has given a certificate as to the existence of a corporate body, it shall be liable to the penalties and punishments of this Bill, whilst, because a number of individuals have chosen to dispense with that certificate they shall be free. Anything more unjust was never perpetrated. _ I feel perfectly satisfied that none of us&#34; can justify either to our judgments or om political consciences the enactment of it on the eve of an election without giving the people of the States an opportunity of saying whether or not they will come under the operation of such a law. </para>

                    <para>- My honorable friend is mistaken. I have a very strong opinion that the Commonwealth has no power of this kind under section 51 of the Constitution. It was never so meant, .and the words of the section do not carry the construction which the Government puts upon them. I could name scores of corporations that are carrying on business in Adelaide and Melbourne, where individuals or companies of individuals are carrying on similar businesses, and could continue to do so with impunity after the passing of this Bill. Take the company of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> is chairman - the Market Company of Adelaide. Under this Bill, that company would be liable to be prosecuted for an offence. </para>

                    <para>- That remark shows that some&#39; honorable senators are not grasping the position. Clause 8 does not relate to corporations carrying on business amongst the States. It relates to particular corporations or trading companies carrying on business within a State under the law of the State. There is, for instance, Elder, Smith, and Company, Limited, in Adelaide, which was originally a partnership. If it remained a partnership, it could not be touched by this Bill. </para>

                    <para>- This is not a question of conspiracy, but of monopoly. I ask honorable senators to direct their minds to what the clause does. It enables a trading company, simply because it is an incorporated body, to be brought up on a charge of monopolising part of our trade and commerce with intent to control - that is the essence of it - the supply or price of any service or commodity. There must be something crooked or wrong in the Constitution if it would permit one law for an individual who is incorporated, and another for an individual who is not incorporated. The Constitution never intended to discriminate between trading persons. The only effect of incorporation is to make a number into a &#34; person &#34;-to make a company a legal entity. Yet we are going to assume the power on the part of the Commonwealth to make a law for one individual that will not apply to another. We are going to make that act criminal in one individual, which, if done by another, would not be criminal. It is not as though it were desired to catch one man and not another. This is making one law for the rich and another for the poor. It is saying that a corporation shall be liable to penalties which are not imposed upon much wealthier persons who are carrying on business without incorporation. I am as strongly opposed to monopolies as any man can be. I detest them, and I should like to have them stopped by an efficient measure. I have always recognised, and I recognise now, that there is very great force in arguments that have been used - I do not say that I agree with them - that if you find some specific undertaking carried on as a monopoly, to the detriment of the public, being mischievous, and you see no cure for it in any other way, the State should take control of it. But that is not this case. This is a case where you say that, although you find that an individual - Jones, we will say - is guilty of a gross monopoly, and doing mischief to other persons engaged in the same trade, he is not to be liable under this Bill. </para>

                    <para>- Not by us. That is the whole point. I ask honorable senators to forgive me if I insist upon this: It is not possible to make an indi&#39;vidual liable, because the ground upon which it is sought to make a trading corporation liable is that the Constitution uses the words &#34; foreign corporation or trading and financial corporation.&#34; I ask honorable senators now, as a serious deliberative body legislating under the powers , of the Constitution, whether they think it is right that they should give an immunity to one man to do a thing which they make an offence in another. I go further, and say that, if the construction put upon the Constitution by the Government - and in which&#39; they are supported by some honorable senators - be sound, it is a mischievous Constitution, and not a beneficial, one. There is no country in the world in which such a thing would be perpetrated as to make it possible for one man to be prosecuted whilst another man doing exactly the same thing was not liable. </para>

                    <para>- I point out that clause 5 is directed to a combination who, either as principal or agent, makes or enters into any contract or engages, or continues in any combination. That combination might be with persons outside a State, and anywhere within the Commonwealth. That is directed simply to foreign corporations monopolizing, or attempting to monopolize, or combining, or conspiring to monopolize. But we might have an individual who, owing to his enormous command of capital, would monopolize some particular trade in a particular town. That kind of thing is going on every day. A man on one side of a street finds a person tarrying on business on the other side of the street, and he says, &#34; I will buy him out.&#34; He buys him out, and later on buys some one else out. The result is that he substantially monopolizes the trade in that particular street, and we cannot touch him under this Bill. But if he happens to be a limited company, or to register himself as &#34; Jones Limited,&#34; he comes under the operation of this Bill as a trading combination. Is that either fair or just, or is it the kind of legislation we should be asked to pass? The constitutional point has already been verv fully debated, but I wish to point out that -the first part of the clause is directed against, not a monopoly of an individual or partnership, but against &#39;monopolies, simply because they happen to have registered themselves as corporations. </para>

                        <para>- I am not so presumptuous as to pretend to argue the constitutional question with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> but, as he was not present when the matter was previously discussed, I direct the honorable and learned senator&#39;s attention to paragraph xx. of section 51 of the Constitution. Whatever may be the meaning of the words as used in the Constitution, they have been introduced into this Bill, and if the Constitution does not give us the power, as the honorable senator contends, the provision with which he finds fault will not be operative. The contention that because we have not the power to prevent every one from doing what we regard as an offence, we should not, therefore, prevent corporations from doing it, is a kind of reasoning which will not go down with the Committee. I am prepared to go as far in this matter as the Constitution permits. If the Constitution does not give us all the necessary power, and what we do requires to be supplemented by the States&#39; Parliaments, we must leave to them the responsibility for their share of the work. If it is agreed that what is here dealt with can be regarded as an offence, and the Constitution does not give us the power to cover the whole ground, the responsibility for making the law uniform must rest with the States Parliaments. </para>

                    <para>.- Some honorable senators do not yet quite understand the constitutional point which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has endeavoured to put before the Committee on more than one occasion. The point, as I understand it, is that under the Constitution we have the power to regulate only trade and commerce with other countries and among the States. Clause 7 of the Bill keeps to that, but in clause 8 we are asked to set aside the words of the Constitution, and in the case of a corporation, to legislate in respect of trade and commerce in any part of the Commonwealth, which means legislating with respect to trade in a particular State. </para>

                        <para>- That does not help the honorable senator in any way, because under that paragraph we have power to make laws with respect to corporations and trading companies. Honorable senators propose to carry that power back to paragraph 1. of section 51, conferring the power to deal with trade and commerce, and to contend that in that way we have the power to interfere with trade in a particular State. There are references in section 51 to bills of exchange and promissory notes. We have the power to enact legislation concerning them. But if the reasoning of some honorable senators be correct, we have only to take that paragraph in conjunction with paragraph 1 of section 51, and claim that we have the power to deal with trade and commerce so far as it is affected by bills of exchange and promissory notes in any particular State. I ask honorable senators to say whether they think we can do that ? We have also under the same section of the Constitution the absolute control given us with respect to immigration and emigration ; but will my honorable friends contend that that, in conjunction with the paragraph1. of section 51, gives us the power to make laws restricting the trading powers of immigrants? In this measure we are being asked to differentiate between a company and a private individual. Do honorable senators contend that in the same way we should have the power to differentiate between an immigrant newly arrived in Tasmania and a citizen of Tasmania who has been in the State all his life, simply because we have the power to deal with trade and commerce as well as the power to deal with immigration? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> should tell the Committee whether he really believes in this clause as it stands. We must have a division upon it, because there are some of us who believe that we should place on record our protest against what we consider to be unconstitutional and illegal. We are bound to protect States rights in this matter, and must have a division on the question. The time will come, and no doubt very shortly, when the High Court will be called upon to decide the point, and it is as well that it should be shown that some members of the Senate have not lost their heads over this business. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir JOSIAH</inline>SYMON (South Australia.) &#91;4.42&#93;. - I wish to say that I quite appreciate the position taken up by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie. It is clear that the honorable senator is impressed with the fact that this measure proposes an inequality in the treatment of different persons, but he says that it must be left with the States Parliaments to make the legislation uniform. I remind the honorable senator that it is our duty to make our legislation uniform, and the Constitution only empowers us so to do. If we are to have legislation that is lop-sided, it must strike any honorable senator either that the Constitution which permits such a thing must be wrong - and that can scarcely be contended with respect to our Constitution- </para>

                        <para>- Even if there is that suits the argument I am putting to the honorable senator equally well. If this is lop-sided legislation, and is not uniform, it is legislation that we should not pass, because the Constitution really empowers us to enact only uniform legislation. It would be a serious blemish on the Constitution if it could be said that it enabled us to provide that in respect of the same act one man should be liable to punishment and another should go scot free. It would be a very sad thing if we were to be obliged to attribute such a blot to the Constitution. I am not putting the matter as a lawyer, but as the man in the street might put it, and as it must appeal to one&#39;s common sense and moral sense. The basis of the Constitution is equality in citizenship and trade. That is its basic principle, and yet we are here asked to give it the go-bye - to discriminate, to enact an inequality, and to leave it to some other Legislature if it pleases to remedy the inequality. I have no desire to press the constitutional question further, but I point out that this Bill is one dealing with trade and commerce. It is introduced for the purpose of enabling us to give effect in a particular direction to that power conferred upon us by the Constitution to make laws with respect to trade and commerce. The only laws we can make on the subject are those which affect trade and commerce with other countries and among the States. But under cover of another power in the Constitution, enabling us to legislate in regard to a particular and specific matter, we are being asked to extend our powers of legislation in respect to trade and commerce. This is not a Bill dealing with foreign corporations or trading or financial corporations formed in the Commonwealth, but a Bill dealing with trade and commerce between other countries and among the States. </para>

                    <para>. - I appreciate the way in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has approached the clause on this occasion. To a certain extent, the question that may arise under clause 8 is similar to that which was threshed out at great length on clause 5, and for that reason the honorable senator, while not altering the opinion which he then so forcibly expressed, refrained from speaking as to the constitutional power of this Parliament to deal with corporations to the fullest extent that has been claimed by us. I do not intend to deal with that matter, but to confine myself entirely to the argument which was used by the honorable senator in support of his objection to the clause. On a previous occasion he expressed his opinion on the constitutional point very emphatically, and other honorable senators, as he says, differed from him. So far as that is concerned I do not intend to refer to it. My honorable friend suggests that if the clause were carried it would lead to what might be considered an anomaly in our industrial life. &#39; For example, he suggests that a trading corporation carrying on business in a certain city and not operating outside the boundaries of the State in which it was situated would come under the penal provisions of the Bill ; while on the other side of the street there might be an individual trader or a partnership or a firm, not being a corporation, carrying on a similar business ; but the penal provisions of the Bill would not apply. I admit now frankly that that would be an anomalous state of affairs. But while I admit that such an anomaly might result from the passing of the clause, I do not think that we can thence necessarily argue that we are exercising powers which are not given to us by the Constitution. Let me assume that in the Bill we did not touch, corporations as such at all, but confined ourselves entirely to individuals, and made penal such a thing as combination in restraint of trade or combination for the purpose of destroying or injuring, by means of unfair competition., any Australian industry ? I leave out of consideration altogether the question of corporations and the power which we assume to exercise under paragraph xx. of section 51 of the Constitution. Of course our powers with regard to individuals are confined to Inter-State trade and commerce, or trade and commerce between the Commonwealth and outside countries. We might have on one side of a street in a city or town a man or a firm carrying on business the ambit of which was Inter-State, and by reason of the fact that he was carrying on Inter- State business, or his business was such that it brought him into trading and commercial relations with the outside world, he would come under the penal provisions of the Bill. On the opposite side of that street we might have a man conducting a business of a similar character, but which was confined wholly within the limits of the State. The Bill could not touch him. Would not that also be an anomaly ? Would any one argue, from the existence of such an admittedly possible anomaly, that we were going outside our powers? </para>

                        <para>- I will assume that in the Bill we made no provision in regard to companies as companies, that we dealt with only individuals, and that clauses 5 and 8 did not exist. We might have Jones and Company, on one side of a street and Brown and Company on the opposite &#187;si de carrying on a similar class of business. The business ramifications of the former firm extend beyond the State, and, therefore, it would come under the operation of the measure, but Brown and Company, who do not operate beyond the limits of the State, would not. Whether that is an anomaly or not, in the sense suggested by. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> is another thing. </para>

                        <para>- Let me now compare that with the other anomaly which has been given as an illustration. On one side of a street we might have Jones and Company, who are carrying on business within the State only, and the Bill would not touch the firm. On the other side of the street we might have Brown and Company Proprietary Limited, carrying on a similar class of business. We say that we can touch that firm simply by reason of the fact that it is a trading or financial corporation formed within the limits of the Commonwealth, or, perhaps, a foreign corporation. That may be an anomaly ; I do not say that it is not. </para>

                        <para>- In the case of the other anomaly, it is a question of one firm carrying on Inter-State trade, and another firm carrying on trade within the State. I contend that neither anomaly argues that we are exceeding our powers in legislating in this way. But they both bring home forcibly to our mind the fact that we are working under a limited Constitution - that the complete political powers of the Australian people are distributed amongst two sets of legislative bodies - the Commonwealth Parliament on one side and the six States Parliaments on the other. In nearly every domain of legislation possible to us, we find that a limit lies somewhere. If we are going to exercise our legislative power up to the limits imposed upon us by the Constitution, there will remain beyond those limits, in many cases, a wide field for possible legislation in the States, and it will remain for the States if they desire to supplement or complement our legislation.

                <para>Sill, the same class of objection was raised. It was said that we were endeavouring to make only certain people honest when we were proposing&#34; to compel them, if they marked their goods at all, to mark them with a correct description so that the public should not be misled. It was objected then that we could deal with only imports and exports, and with InterState trade. We dealt with the subject, knowing that, so far as trade within a State was concerned, the State Parliament might follow our example, or refrain from doing so. The same thing applies now. I do not think we ought to argue in any case that, because what seems to be an anomaly will result, we are necessarily taking a strained or crooked view of our powers under the Constitution. </para>

In each case, he would he a private trader, because his trade would be limited to the one State. It would be only so far as his operations comprehended trade between one State and another that he would come within this measure, and, as I contend, within our constitutional power. </para>

But the anomaly to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> and others have drawn attention would be a real one. That is a case where we should have two bodies, one being a private firm and the other a corporate firm on opposite sides of a street, doing business strictly within the limits of one State. I wonder that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie did not notice that the point of contention is as to whether we have constitutional power to pass the provision in question. The Government contend that it is conferred by paragraph xx. of section 51, but we contend that upon a true interpretation of that paragraph the power is not given to us. </para>

                        <para>- On the power in regard to trade and commerce which is given to us in paragraph 1. of section 51, supplemented by section 98, which expresses the exact limit of that power. It was very admirably pointed out by Senator Millen that we have power in regard to arbitration and conciliation in case of disputes extending beyond a State ; but it has not yet been contended that, because we have power under paragraph xx. of section 51 of the Constitution in regard to corporations of various kinds, we therefore have power to bring corporations within the Arbitration and Conciliation Act. </para>

If the contention be good that paragraph xx.&#39; gives us plenary powers in the case of corporations, so that we may extend the limits of our power in regard to trade and commerce, the paragraph would equally enable Us to include arbitration and conciliation. The reasoning seems to be absolutely complete. </para>

When a reading of the Constitution produces such a startling anomaly as that a man trading on one side of the street is exempt from the law, while a corporation trading in exactly the same way on the other side is within the law, we doubt the correctness of the interpretation. </para>

                        <para>- There is no anomaly if my reading be adopted, namely, that we haw power over foreign corporations and trading or financial corporations within a State, but not so as to enlarge the power conferred by paragraph 1. of section 51 of the Constitution. With regard to trading operations, not of any particular individuals, but as between one State and another, or between a State and countries outside Australia, we have absolute power ; but the whole power with regard to trading within a State belongs to the State. There we see the harmony of the Commonwealth Constitution; each State is a separate sovereign State, the Government under each State Constitution having full power with regard to all trade within the State. To follow <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> again, the- underlying principle of the Constitution is that matters which can be more efficiently dealt with by the Commonwealth Government are handed over to the Commonwealth Government. What are they? They are matters in which the interest of one State impinges on the interest of another. It may be merchandise marks, or laws relating to trade and commerce - such a law as is now under discussion- - where the interests of two States, or the interests of a State and the interests of .an. outside community, impinge. The Commonwealth then steps in and takes charge. But the genius of the Constitution is that everything in a State shall be within the power of the State Government under the State Constitution. The burden rests on the honorable senators who take an opposite view from myself to show that their interpretation does not lead to anomalies such as would constitute almost an absurdity, and be absolutely contrary to the underlying principle of the Constitution. </para>

It was pointed out then that if a manufacturer found it necessary to employe say, half-a-dozen extra machines, he must get them from the company on the terms I have indicated, no manufacturer being allowed to employ machines of any other make. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> in the course of his remarks, mentioned the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Best,</inline> a well-known boot manufacturer of Melbourne, who, on one occasion, installed a machine, or machines, the product of some other company, and who immediately received notice that the United Shoe Machinery Company proposed to withdraw from his establishment their machines held by him. Subsequently, in an affidavit, which has been laid on the table of the Senate, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Best</inline> denied that the United Shoe Machinery Company had withdrawn their machines for the reasons stated. I have in my possession an accurate copy of an agreement, not such an agreement as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Best</inline> signed, but one which is handed to every manufacturer who desires to use any of the welding or stitching, machines owned by the United Shoe Machinery Company. </para>

                <para class="block">In this agreement it is distinctly laid down that, when a manufacturer purchases one set of machines, he must, if he can, use them to their fullest capacity, and that, if at any time he finds the work more than the machines in his possession will perform, he must not purchase any machine from any other manufacturer, but must obtain what he requires from the United Shoe Machinery Company. According to the actual wording of the agreement, there is nothing to prevent a manufacturer doing the work by hand ; but, in these days of machinery, such a concession need not be seriously considered. The documents which have already been laid upon the table in this connexion indicate perjury on the part of some person somewhere. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lt.-Col.</inline>GOULD (New South Wales) &#91;5.38&#93;. - I think it would be rather novel if an honorable senator were permitted to get up in the middle of a debate and move that a document be printed. I presume that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Croft</inline> read the document with the idea that it would be printed in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and that honorable senators should have an opportunity to read it. But we have something much more important to consider than whether a particular agreement is reasonable or unreasonable. What I wish honorable senators to determine is whether it was ever contemplated that under the Commonwealth Constitution there would be any difference in the treatment of different bodies under, the laws that we saw fit to enact. For my present purpose I assume that the provision we are now considering is within our powers under the Constitution, although later on I shall show that according to my view it is entirely beyond them. I assume, for the sake of argument, that it is within our powers, and I then take up the position that the Constitution was not .granted to us in order that we might differentiate in our laws between corporations and private individuals, or between private individuals and States. I think it will be admitted from a review of the whole scope of the Constitution that it was never intended that we should pass any legislation which would differentiate in its operation in any way whatever. If honorable senators will turn to paragraph ii. of section 51 of the Constitution they will find that it reads - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>Taxation ; but so as not to discriminate between States or parts of States. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">So that in that respect our legislation, whatever it may be, must be uniform in its application. But if the contention of honorable senators is that we can read one paragraph of the section into another, it might be contended that paragraph 11. can be read into paragraph xx. dealing with foreign corporations, and trading or financial coporations formed within the limits of the Commonwealth in such a way as to provide that those corporations might be the subject of taxation in a special way. It is contended that paragraph 1. of section 51 can be read into paragraph xx. so as to enable us to control the operations of corporations trading within a State. If that reasoning be sound it might be contended that we could have one form of taxation applicable to private individuals and another applicable to corporations and trading companies. Honorable senators will agree at once that that would be unjust. </para>

                        <para>-.-Col. GOULD.- We specially tax the publican because we give him special privileges with respect to the sale of liquor, and so on, that are not given to other persons. But would it not be very unjust to say that we shall put a special tax upon corporations which shall not be imposed on individuals or persons in partnership who have not registered themselves as corporations? There might be a partnership of ten, twenty, or thirty individuals who would escape such taxation, whilst if they agreed that it would be better that they should become incorporated, the same people would become liable to the taxation. If honorable senators will look at section 99 of the Constitution they will find that it is there provided that - </para>

It may be contended that that deals only with one particular set of matters in connexion with the States themselves. But if it be the intention of the Constitution to prevent the States from being unfairly dealt with, surely it is equally the intention that individuals and corporations should be placed in the same position? </para>

At present I am assuming that the Commonwealth Parliament has the power to do what is proposed. By-and-by I propose to point out that in my view we have no such power. I need not weary honorable senators by going through the various sections of the Constitution, but we know that originally the object of Federation was to enable the Commonwealth authority to have power to deal with all matters of general concern affecting the States forming the Federation. It was not intended that we should interfere with States rights, except where that power is specifically set forth, and it is set forth only with respect to matters which can be better dealt with by the Commonwealth than by the individual States, which would perhaps adopt diverse legislation to deal with the same subject. </para>

                        <para>.- I am assuming that we have the power proposed, but at the same time I am pointing out that the spirit and intention of the Constitution are that the Commonwealth Parliament shall take in hand only such matters as can be better dealt with by it, as representing the whole of the States, than by the individual States. These are matters of universal concern affecting outside persons, and upon which it is better that our legislation should be uniform. In this case I ask whether it is fair or just to say to the persons forming a corporation, &#34; Because you are a corporation you shall be placed under certain limitations and restrictions which would not apply to you if you were trading as individuals &#34; ? I say at once that it is against the spirit and intention of the Constitution that we should pass any legislation of the kind. I say further that it is a most unwise thing for us to do. If the proposed law is within our power, it is still unwise for us to attempt to pass it, for the simple reason that by so doing we shall be discriminating, and may bring about a conflict between the Commonwealth and the States. While we may possess very great powers, it will be admitted that it is better that they should not be pressed to the breaking point, causing difficulty and friction. In view of the feeling existing between the Commonwealth and the States at the present time, it is well that the rights of each should be respected. I now come to consider whether what is proposed is really within our powers under the Constitution, and, with all due respect to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> and the authorities cited by that honorable and learned senator, I think that we are here being asked to go entirely beyond our powers. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker,</inline> dealing with the question the other day, referred to the history of the paragraphs of section 51 of the Constitution, and, dealing with paragraph xx., explained that the omission of the reference to the &#34; status &#34; of foreign corporations and trading or financial corporations formed within the limits of the Commonwealth was only regarded as a drafting amendment. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> told us that the whole of the debate with respect to paragraph xx. of section 51 had been with regard to the status, position, and creation of corporations, and that when the matter was taken on a step further, and the alteration made, it was accepted as a drafting amendment, and was never meant to cause a departure from the original intention of the framers of the Constitution. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake,</inline> in his contribution to the debate, also quoted largely the history of the matter, going back to the Convention of 1891. We have, therefore, had the intention of the framers of the Constitution in this matter placed clearly before us. I admit at once that where a section of a Statute is absolutely clear and distinct the Court will construe it according to the words used, assuming that the Legislature intended the ordinary construction to be placed on those words. It then becomes necessary to inquire whether there is any doubt or difficulty in regard to the matter, and I ask honorable senators if there is any doubt or difficulty here. If there is, we may depend on it that it will not be taken to drive the law to an extreme; but, on the contrary, an attempt will be. made to bring everything into harmony. If we are dealing with trade we have only limited powers. Whatever subsequent paragraphs of the section may provide with respect to foreign corporations, and trading and financial corporations. I hold that, so far as our power to deal with trade and commerce is concerned, it is covered and controlled by paragraph 1 of section 51 of the Constitution. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> may shake his head.

                        <para>.- Then will the honorable senator tell me that it would be reasonable to deal in this Bill with the question of &#34; Naturalization and aliens,&#34; which I find in paragraph XIX. of section 51 ? Of course, each of these paragraphs is intended to be taken separately. When honorable senators tell me that, by virtue of paragraph xx. we can bring about a different system of dealing with trade and commerce than that specified in paragraph 1., I submit, with all due respect, that if ever the matter is decided by the High Court, those who hold that view will find that they are absolutely wrong. I admit that in this I am adopting the dangerous course of prophesying before the event.

                        <para>.- We have supreme power within the limits of section 51, but perhaps the honorable senator will agree with me that if paragraph xx, of section 51 had been omitted, there would have been no provision under which foreign trading corporations could be dealt with. On the same line of reasoning we derive our power in regard to trade and commerce from paragraph 1. If, apart from paragraph 1. we have any power to deal with trade and commerce, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> would lead us to suppose, then the moment it was exercised it would introduce a limitation, and that limitation could not be extended by any indirect process of reasoning. I feel quite satisfied that under the trade and commerce power we cannot deal with either men or corporations when they are merely trading within the limits of a State, because that jurisdiction is reserved to the State. I hope that honorable senators will treat all persons and bodies alike as far as they possibly can. </para>

                        <para>.- The honorable senator knows as well as I do that if a number of persons form themselves into a partnership they can enter into exactly the same class of trade or business as a corporation. He holds that, because they have not become a corporation, therefore they are not liable to the penalty prescribed for an offence under the Bill ; but a corporation is so liable. Does he not perceive that a corporation is merely a collection of persons who, for business purposes, get themselves incorporated by Act of Parliament or registered under a Joint Stock Companies Act? It is manifestly unjust to enact that, because those persons have formed themselves into a corporation, they shall be liable to certain restrictions in trade to which they would not have been liable if they had remained merely a partnership. It may be argued that there is a difference of opinion on that point, and that, therefore, we should enact the legislation and leave it to the High Court to determine its constitutionality. I entirely object to legislating on that line. We, as representatives of the people, ought to satisfy ourselves first that a proposal is reasonable, and, secondly, that, if reasonable, it comes within the scope of our legislative powers. In my opinion, this proposal is unreasonable, and contrary to the spirit of the Constitution, and, therefore, it should not be enacted. I go further, and contend that it is beyond the powers conferred upon us by the Constitution, and that even if it were not. it would be most dangerous and undesirable, if it were passed, in its present form. </para>

                        <para>- No. Unless we have very good reason for departing from a well-established form of drafting, we ought to retain the words &#34; or omission,&#34; so that the clause may cover all possible kinds of aiding and abetting. I do not know, as I said at the outset, that I could enumerate the instances which the use of the word might cover, and which otherwise the clause would not meet. The illustration I give is an illustration of the commission of the primary offence by omitting to do a certain Act, and not the commission of the offence of aiding and abetting. It is quite conceivable, and I think that honorable senators can very readily realize, that in many instances in which a man might aid and abet the commission of an offence, it would not be by active interference, but by omission to perform a duty which had been cast upon him. </para>

                        <para>- A person by omission may be directly, or indirectly, counselling or procuring the commission of an offence. Would the clause not reach a person who was responsible for the issue of a periodical or newspaper, and who, by an omission, was knowingly concerned in counselling or procuring the commission of an offence ? I make this suggestion as an illustration for the consideration of honorable senators. It seems to me quite possible that in many cases a man may, by omission, be knowingly concerned in counselling or procuring the commission of an offence, and, if so, he ought to come within the provisions of the law. </para>

                <para>I move the insertion of the new clause at the present stage, but I shall be perfectly satisfied, if the Government or the Parliamentary Draftsman, in the event of its being passed, think it desirable, that it should appear in some other part of the Bill. I submit the clause in order to afford an opportunity to -give some practical effect to the desire so frequently expressed to establish a preference for the mother country. The present is a particularly valuable opportunity to give expression to our views in this regard, if we are in earnest about them. There has been a great deal of talk on the subject of preference to Great Britain. </para>

                        <para>- Most emphatically I do, though my method of affording preference may be not that which&#34; the honorable senator would adopt. On many platforms and on many occasions, we have heard much eloquent talk in favour of preference to the manufactures of the mother country. In England, politicians and statesmen, in order to change the fiscal system of the mother country, have made use of what they believe to be the strong and crystallized sentiments in favour of preference. Those statesmen and politicians have spoken of &#34; offers &#34; from Australia in this connexion, though I am not aware that any definite offers of the kind have been made by any responsible public man in Australia to justify the statements which have been circulated in Great Britain and Ireland during the last three or four years. I think that many of those statements have been unjustifiable; but, at any rate, a Bill of this description presents an opportunity of which we may avail ourselves in order to show that when we are legislating in this extremely drastic way to prevent or prohibit importations, into this country from oversea-- </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable senator will allow me to proceed, he will. I think, admit that my view is the correct one. When we are legislating for the purpose of preventing or prohibiting the importation into this country of goods which may enter into successful competition with the goods of traders or manufacturers in this country - because that is what is meant bv injury - Ave have an opportunity to provide that the law shall not apply to the people or manufactures of England, Scot land, and Ireland. When something was said in this connexion the other day, the Minister of Defence interjected to the effect that the Government would oppose a proposal of the sort. I was sorry to hear the Minister give that intimation ; but, at any rate, the amendment I now propose will afford an opportunity to those who have hitherto expressed themselves as being anxious to have preference shown to the mother country, to git&#39;e effect to their present so-called opinions, and deny that preference. The Minister of Defence, the other day, said that preference would mean preference for dumping ; and my only feeling is that the honorable gentleman has become a slave to the expression. We all admit that dumping is merely the bringing in of goods in competition Avith local manufactures here; and, according to the Bill, if imported goods, as they always must, reduce the profits of manufacturers of similar goods in Australia, they are to be regarded as injuring an Australian industry. This is a Bill to prohibit, as far as possible, importations into this country, on the ground that, by reducing the profits of manufacturers in Australia, they will injure Australian industries. It is necessary for those who say that they are in favour of preference Avith the mother country, to show that they are not merely using fine language. They cannot hide their real intentions by a Bill which uses the expression &#34; dumping&#34; - a word of no meaning except that casual meaning which was so effectively derided the other day by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> in his excellent speech. It is of no use &#39;to burke the fact that this Bill is intended to interfere Avith  importations. It is intended to prohibit them, if they reduce the profits of manufacturers in this  country.  I  Avant  to give a preference to importations from the mother country as against those from foreign lands. </para>

He did not orate on the public platform about preference to the mother country, and when it came to legislating, treat the whole thing; as a sham and a delusion. There was no hypocrisy in his professions. He dealt with the matter fairly and honestly. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> quoted the legislation of New Zealand as a precedent. But what do we find?

                        <para>-When that time came I should be perfectly prepared to see legislation passed dealing with the subject. Will not this Bill be treated in Great Britain as a Bill to prohibit importations from that country, just as much as from foreign lands ? It may be wrong to draw inferences of that kind, but they will be drawn. We know what inferences were drawn, and what things were said about Australia, in connexion with the Immigration Restriction Act, for instance. Many of them, in my opinion, were unjust; but similar things will be said of this Bill. What harm will be done by inserting my amendment? It puts in a practical form a sentiment upon which we are all agreed. Will the Minister mention any manufacturers in Great Britain who are now doing mischief in this country ? </para>

This drastic measure ought not to be applied to importations from Great Britain. Unless the Minister of Defence can mention any mischievous importations from the mother country that are destroying or injuring industries in Australia. I may very fairly ask him to reconsider the intimation he gave by way of interjection, and to support my proposal. </para>

                    <para>. - I cannot assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> definitely that there are importations from Great Britain which are injurious to our industries. When introducing the Bill I admitted that I could not definitely put my finger on trusts and combines that were injuring our manufactures. But I said then that, as certainly as light follows darkness, and as the sun rises in the east every morning, the experience that we have gained of trusts and combines in America shows that the great majority of trusts do eventually become injurious to the public interest, and that we may expect the same thing to happen here. It is a great deal better to have legislation to meet such evils than to have to pass Bills to cope with them after they have done a considerable amount of mischief. I cannot say that particular manufacturers are at present injuring Australian industries, or are doing any of the things enumerated in the first sub-clause of clause 19. Certainly I cannot say that in regard to British manufacturers. At present we are more likely to receive dumped goods from America than from England, especially machinery. New Zealand has been mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> as a State whose example we should follow. But it has to be remembered that in New Zealand there was no competition from Great Britain in respect to machinery, and that the particular Act referred to has now been relegated to the limbo of forgotten things. Its operation ceased on the 1st of August. Why should we follow the example of New Zealand ? We have to protect ourselves against dumping from any part of the world, Great Britain included. We have a right to say to the manufacturers of Great Britain that they ought not to import goods into this country with the intent to destroy our industries which pay good wages to employ&#233;s. Why should we allow British manufacturers to injure us, whilst we say that American and foreign manufacturers must not do so? We put them all on exactly the same footing. </para>

                <para>SenatorP LAYFORD. - The object of the amendment is to except British goods from the dumping provisions of the Bill. That is proposed on the ground that we should give a preference to the people of Great Britain. I hold that such a preference can only properly be given by one of two means - by an alteration of the Tariff, increasing the existing Customs duties against all foreign goods, and allowing them to remain at their present rate as against British goods, or lowering the duties against British goods, and allowing them to remain as they are against foreign goods. I contend that this Bill is certainly not the place in which to introduce any such proposal for preference to Great Britain. This part, comprising the provisions relating to dumping, has been proposed for an object, and that object is to prevent the destruction of our own manufactures by unfair competition. If the amendment be introduced, what will be the effect ? We shall practically say, &#34; We are quite willing to allow British manufacturers to dump their goods into Australia to any extent they please to the injury of our own manufacturers and traders, and, although the results may be to throw our own people out of employment, we shall only interfere in this matter where the foreigner is concerned.&#34; I say that that would be a wrong principle to adopt. If we desire to carry out preferential trade with Great Britain, it can only properly be done in one of the two ways I have mentioned. To attempt to provide for it in the way proposed in this amendment may be said to be almost an insult to Great Britain. </para>

                    <para>. - I have been very pleased to hear the leader of the Senate say that he is not prepared to accept the amendment. If there be any virtue in this Bill, I think it will be found to be centred in these provisions against dumping. This is the part of the measure which I feel will become most effective, and of most use to Australian industries in its operation. I have nothing to say against England. Having due regard to our own interests, I am not opposed to our giving whatever advantage we can to that country. At the same time, I am not one of those who are prepared to say, &#34; So long as it is England that is injuring us, never mind the injury. We can afford to grin and bear it so long as we know that the injury is being done to us by the people of the mother country.&#34; If we. are to protect the industries of Australia from the kind of trade contemplated in these clauses, we can do so only by treating England, and every other country, on exactly the same footing. I believe that to discriminate here in the way proposed would lead us in to a. very great deal of trouble. I am accustomed to look upon packages of English merchandise as packages of so much sorrow and oppression. Not that I blame England for that. England is, in the matter, merely subject to the system to which nearly all the countries of the world are subject to-day. She is groaning under a burden of wrong-doing, I repeat that I am afraid that if we discriminated here in the way proposed, we should land ourselves in a very great deal of trouble, and the time would not be long in coming when even the application of these dumping provisions to the foreigner would be found to fee in reality a thing of the past, because foreign-made goods of all countries would be sent to us through smart men in Great Britain. </para>

                        <para>- We know that they would be made up in Great Britain. The whole business would be beautifully fixed up, and if we attempted to enforce any such discrimination as is proposed by the amendment, we should have goods made in all parts of the world shipped from England to Australia by English shippers, and claimed by English manufacturers and merchants, with the result that our attempt to prevent dumping would have become absolutely useless. Now that we have set about dealing with the matters covered by this Bill, I repeat my view that to the provisions with respect to dumping we should direct our most careful attention, because I believe that from them we are likely to receive the greatest benefit. I think that this is the part of the measure to which we must look for an effective weapon to prevent the extermination of some of our Australian industries, and, in the circumstances, I support the leader of the Government in the Senate in his opposition to the amendment. </para>

It lets out the air. The amendment does something to expose the character and quality of the boasted desire to do something for the mother country which we have so often heard expressed. At the same time, I think that the Government are greatly to blame for leading people on the other side of the world to believe that they are permeated with a desire to do something special for them. It is very much to be regretted that they should allow such ideas to get abroad, because now after such declarations as have fallen from the leader of the Government in the Senate, they are made to look rather silly.

                        <para>- I dare say, but what I am directing attention to is the belief that has been engendered in many British circles as the result of utterances by certain Australians as to what they intended to do. I say that the amendment proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has the effect of letting the stuffing out, and exposes in all its bare nakedness the utter selfishness which lies at the bottom of these professions of special regard for the mother country. There is no intention on the part of those who profess to desire preferential trade with, Great Britain to give up a farthing&#39;s worth of anything. That is the real truth, and the sooner every one concerned is made aware of it the better. Honorable . senators know that I am no believer in any good being likely to arise from a policy of preference adopted, we will say, by England. Of course, we have here a bad policy in force, and I am ready to do all I can to reduce its evil effects. Any proposal, no matter where it emanates from, which is calculated to restrict the operation of legislation likely to decrease our trade, will have my support, and therefore I cordially support the amendment.&#39; </para>

As I said, he was only chaffing when he moved the amendment. I am quite sure that, if it were within his power to inflict such an insult upon Great Britain, he would not be prepared to do it. His amendment is sub.mitted for the purpose, if he can, from his point of view, of poking a little fun at the Bill, and I do not propose to discuss it seriously. It is obviously absurd&#39; to say, &#34; We will pass a Bill against wrong-doing, but will permit anybody, evert our nearest relative, to do that wrong.&#34; It would be an insult to them to say so. </para>

                    <para>. - I desire to say a few words, be-&#39; cause I gave notice of a similar amendment. It is most extraordinary that the Government, with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> at its head,, should object to .an amendment of this kind, having regard to the fact that only a few years ago he was writing to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain,</inline> who said that he was encouraged to believe that Australia would not object to British manufactures being imported into Australia. He used that as an argument why his policy of -preferential trade should be adopted in Australia;. But now we have a Government which would prevent British goods from coming in and not because we have been hurt, for there is no evidence to that effect. In the Bill we are really crying out before we are hurt. We ought to take a leaf out of New Zealand&#39;s book, and give British manufactures a preference, ort at least, we ought to take a leaf out of Canada&#39;s book, and, if goods are coming in here to the detriment of our own manufacturers, raise the duty against them. It seems to me that the profession of the Government in regard to preferential trade is now shown to be a farce. I feel very strongly that they are not behaving in the way in which they are expected by England to behave. </para>

                    <para>.- I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> that there is nothing morally wrong in the practice of dumping as it is described in the Bill. Under certain circumstances1, a country maybe quite justified in prohibiting the introduction of goods; but I do not see that the enactment of a law of that kind would make the practice morally wrong. It would be enacted simply as a matter of expediency, in order . to promote the supposed well-being of the country.

                        <para>- Quite so. For certain purposes it is proposed to prohibit the introduction of these goods, as being calculated, perhaps, to do injury to persons who are trading in similar articles here. But it is a pure trade transaction, and it is simply a matter of expediency for us to consider whether it is desirable that they should be excluded. It ought to be remembered that the alternative to prohibition is not unrestricted competition, as some honorable members seem to assume, because the Tariff would still continue in operation. I will not say that the duties are right in all cases. Perhaps they might with advantage be made higher in some cases and lower in others. But the Tariff was solemnly agreed to by the Parliament as being adequate to protect our industries. What the amendment proposes is that in regard to all the world the Tariff shall remain in operation as it stands, but that in the case of foreign producers or manufacturers there should be the Tariff plus this possible prohibition. That is very similar, indeed, to the proposals for preferential trade which were submitted to the country less than three years ago. What the protectionists who were in favour of preferential trade with Great Britain proposed then was that the Tariff should remain with a certain addition in the case of foreign imports. </para>

                        <para>- I can quite understand that amongst a body of protectionists who desire to protect the industries of the country, there must always be some who are in favour of imposing very much higher duties on particular articles, and of allowing the Tariff to remain as it is in regard to other articles. The contention of the Protectionist Party, or, perhaps I should say the Government Party, at the last election was that they desired preferential trade with Great Britain, and that was held to mean the addition to the Tariff of a certain percentage in the case of foreign imports, so as to give a preference to Great Britain. This Bill proposes a protection to industries by another method than the Tariff, and one which goes further. It is somewhat different in character, but the object aimed at is the same. Instead of protection by means of a high Tariff, it is to be protection by means of a Tariff with possibly prohibition in certain cases. </para>

                        <para>- Protection by means of the Tariff is, in my opinion, preferable, because it operates all round, and applies equally to large as well as small industries. My point at present is that this prohibition is to come in and operate when the Tariff fails to give the necessary protection to local industries.. Therefore the case is very nearly on all-fours when we come to consider preferential trade. What the amendment proposes is that against all the world there shall remain the Tariff, which, of course, may be altered from time to time, but against foreign countries there is to be the Tariff and possibly prohibition in certain cases. Surely that is the principle of preferential trade which the Deakin Government, of which I was a member, advocated at the last general election. I feel that it is only reasonable and proper for me to vote for the amendment. </para>

                        <para>- No. As I was not here, that throws a little light on the attitude adopted by the honorable senators then present, showing their feeling of displeasure at the course taken by the Minister of Defence. But my honorable friend says that the Tariff is the proper means to deal with the question of trade, and that there are two ways under the Tariff of giving preference - one by raising the duties against the countries which ought not to have the preference, so as to lea.ve a kind of bastard preference for the country supposed to Wave the benefit; and the other by lowering the Tariff in favour of the preferred country. The latter is the method which. I should support, but the other is the method that honorable senators of different fiscal views from myself would adopt. That, however, has been disposed of altogether by what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> has said. &#39; Without elaborating, I wish to emphasize the remarks of that honorable senator, to the effect that under the present Tariff we may, in certain directions, attack the importation of agricultural machinery, which I repeat is the origin or cause of this Bill. There may or may not be a higher Tariff imposed on such machinery this session, but. whatever the Tariff may be. there will always be this Bill superadded. Bv the Tariff we seek to keep out the goods of other countries, either wholly or in part; and if the Tariff is not enough there will be this Bill, which will give the same kind of protection, but, it may be, to a greater extent, and altogether prohibit importation. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> has made it perfectly plain that this, in a sense, is a Tariff Bill - a Bill to prohibit imports. The only difference between it and a prohibitive Tariff is that there is introduced the element of injury to some particular local industry. But every importation, to a certain extent, injures local industry. The kind of injury is not defined, and it may be the same which it is sought to prevent by the Tariff. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake.</inline> has put it, this is essentially a Bill in which we can give effect to the principle of preference if we sincerely believe in that principle; and that is what I ask the Committee and the Government to do. I am not now advocating preference as against those who think there should be no preference; all I say is that those who believe in preference have no reason to say that this is not an opportune time to give effect to the principle. The Minister of Defence and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> advanced the most extraordinary argument I ever heard. </para>

                        <para>- I know <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> Styles&#39; views on protection, and I respect him for the assiduity with which, in season and out of season, he seeks to give effect to them. I felt sure, however, that he would agree with me as to the extraordinary character of the argument that this amendment, if carried, would insult Great Britain. Why should the &#39; amendment insult Great Britain? It is an insult to pass a. Bill directed against Great Britain as well as against foreign nations, when we are not able to cite one single instance of the importation of English manufactures with the intent to injure or destroy Australian industry. This Bill is a gross insult to England. My amendment is simply a declaration that we in this Parliament believe that nothing of the kind was ever done, or ever will be done, by England. It is all very well for the Minister of Defence to laugh. We at present keep English manufactures out by means of the Tariff, and I ask why we should insult England by saying that the Tariff is not sufficient - that the manufacturers of the mother country will send their goods here with the intent to destroy or injure the manufactures of Australia? English manufacturers send their goods here in order to sell them, and in the process of selling other manufacturers have, of course, to take their chance. The object of protection is to equalize the chances; but this Bill is introduced in order to prevent what is said to be a mischievous kind of importation of agricultural implements and, of course, other goods from America, Canada, or other places. Why, then, should we include England? If instances could be shown in England similar to that of the harvester combine, or the Standard Oil Trust, there would be some justification for the Bill; but the Minister candidly and frankly says that he is unable to give any such instance. </para>

                        <para>- I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> is an encyclopaedia of knowledge of wicked things known to none of us. The fact is that legislation of this kind&#39; gives Australia and Australian legislation a bad flavour in England. I do not agree with those who &#34; run down&#34; Australia, or take advantage of bad legislation to do so. I scorn people who are guilty of that kind of thing ; but I have sense enough! to know what is said, and what will be said, if we continue to pass measures such as the Immigration Restriction Act. Such legislation simply gives a handle to the enemy. From what I observe now, it is quite evident that the Minister of Defence and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> have &#34; made it up.&#34; It is not now <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> who is called to the aid of the Ministry ; and I am quite sure we shall not have a count out to-night. </para>

                        <para>- As the Minister knows, that is not an original remark, because it was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> a few minutes ago. At present I desire to call honorable senators&#39; attention to the fact that the Bill, in its present form, will give a handle to those who are hostile to Australia, and only too willing to be adverse critics of this country and its legislation. The newspaper quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> is, I know, regarded in England as, to a large extent, the exponent of Australian feeling. It will be seen that there was an impression, when this Bill was introduced, that it was an instalment of preference, for the purpose of defeating the accursed foreigner, and keeping his goods out of Australia for the benefit of Australian and British manufacturers. </para>

                        <para>- What the Bill says is that English manufacturers threaten to do what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> has indicated. If we pass the amendment, and English manufacturers resort to nefarious practices, we can have fresh legislation. It is much better in legislation of this kind, which imposes penalties, to say that we do not mean England, against which country we have no complaint. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> says that he is going to cite some instances ; but there is no complaint to be made now, and we do not believe that England would do such an unkind and monstrous thing as to send goods here with the intention to destroy or injure our industries. The reasons which have been offered from that standpoint against the amendment have no strength or substance. </para>

                        <para>- The amendment means the very opposite. It declares that there are no instances of the kind, and that we do not believe English manufacturers would be guilty of such a thing. But I am sure that it is hopeless to attempt to convince <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith.</inline> If an angel came down from heaven, it could not offer any inducement to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> to change his mind, so wedded is he to this particular measure. At the same time, the position appears perfectly plain from the point of view of those who think that this legislation has been introduced in the interests of British and Australian manufacturers as against foreign manufacturers ; but when the Bill is thoroughly understood, we shall have very different articles in the <inline font-style="italic">British-Australasian</inline> and other newspapers, and we shall scarcely be entitled to complain if our legislation meets with still further hostile criticism. </para>

The practical difficulty being indentical in both cases, there is no reason against the passing of my amendment. If honorable senators were against preference under proper circumstances and conditions, the objection would be right enough, but if they are not against preference it is clear that my proposal is quite as much entitled to support as a preferential Tariff would be. </para>

Three years ago, when I was addressing my constituents in Perth. I advocated giving a preference to Great Britain, and am still in favour of that policy. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has pointed out that the clause means prohibition under certain conditions, and there is a fear that it mav be misunderstood in Great Britain. We are well aware that our Immigration Restriction Acts - which, as amended, are really good Acts, and should remain exactly as they stand - were misunderstood through the British people being misinformed as to their intention. A great deal of injury was consequently done to the Commonwealth in respect of attracting desirable immigration. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> also pointed out that we are imposing penalties which mav be applied to British manufacturers, although no instance has been given of their having done wrong to our traders. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator STANIFORTH</inline>SMITH.Surety prohibition is a penalty. But another question has arisen in my mind. Why is this proposed exemption confined to the British Isles, and not proposed to be applied to other portions of the British Empire in which the Anglo-Saxon race exists - such, for instance, as Canada? The answer will at once Le made that if the exemption were extended to Canada it would mean that the line of manufactures that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> says this Bill was specially introduced to prevent the importation of under certain circumstances, would be exempted from the operation of the measure. In another place a Bill has been introduced to impose specific duties on stripper harvesters. It is not proposed to make any differentiation between Great Britain and any other part of the world with regard to their importation. If. when that measure comes before the Senate, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> proposes that a preference shall be granted to Great Britain, I shall be prepared to support him. But the Bill now before us was, we are informed, introduced specially to deal with stripper harvesters. I am inclined to agree with that view to a large extent. If, therefore, we read into this Bill an application to stripper harvesters specifically, instead of to manufactures generally, we shall find that it is now proposed to give a preference to Great Britain in the importation of stripper harvesters, although a Judge of the High Court may find that they are being introduced at a specially low price with the object of destroying an Australian industry. </para>

                        <para>- But she may do so The Canadian and American manufacturers may commence to manufacture in Great Britain if she is exempted from the dumping clauses. It appears to me that this is the wrong Bill in which to propose to grant a preference to Great Britain. We propose in this measure to punish those who are endeavouring to injure us. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon&#39;s</inline> amendment proposes that we shall not punish dumpers who desire to injure us if their goods come from Great Britain. That is very altruistic, and ethically admirable as far as it goes ; but if we apply it to this Bill we practically say that we will not inflict any punishment on our kinsfolk who do us wrong,- whereas if we apply it to the Tariff Bill to which I have referred, and which is now before another place, we shall say that we do desire to give a. preference to British manufacturers over others who honestly compete with us. I should prefer to give a preference to Great Britain under the Tariff proposals, and not in a Bill which is introduced with the special object of punishing those who attempt to injure Australian industries. I shall vote against the amendment. </para>

I will, however, give mv own reasons in favour of it. -I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> that the natural interpretation that would be put upon any exemption of Great Britain from the -provisions of this Bill, would be that we desired to show a preference to British dumping. But what is overlooked is that we are now dealing with a portion of the Bill which proposes to make a crime of a thing which is done every day, and done most legitimately in the ordinary way of trade. </para>

It is quite a common thing for goods to be .purchased in Great Britain as well as in foreign countries at a price greatly below their cost of production, and below the market price in the country where they are purchased. Australian merchants are constant! v importing goods from Great Britain, especially towards the ends of seasons, at a price below the cost of production. These goods are brought out to Australia, and sold cheaply with every advantage to the people of this country. We are going to make that practice an offence if this Bill is strictly interpreted. I wish to ask the legal representative of the Government in the Senate a question. I wish to know whether under this Bill unfair competition is merely part of an offence, or the whole offence? Is a man merely introducing goods which have been- purchased at a price below the cost of production, by so doing, to be held to be guilty of &#34;an intent &#34; to injure an Australian industry? &#34; Unfair competition &#34; is denned in clause 1 8, paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> of sub-clause 2, as applying to cases where the imported goods have been purchased abroad -  at prices greatly below their ordinary cost of production where produced or market price where purchased. </para>

We have only to look back to the time of the Boer war to find that her merchants of undoubted integrity sent shoddy war materials to South Africa, and thus endangered the lives of citizens of Great Britain. We have only to look at what is being done to-day to find that they are capable of little tricks of this description, for we learn that in connexion with the butter industry in which Australia is interested they are prepared to adulterate their goods in every shape and form with the object of deceiving their own people. Surely if they are capable of doing that, it is not too much to suppose that they are capable of doing to the injury of the Australian people what would be regarded as illegal under this Bill ? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> asked for instances in which anything of the kind complained about had been done. There are many things that are required and can be manufactured in Australia that cannot be protected by means of the Tariff, and it may be that in those cases the provision of such a measure as this would be the only protection that could be afforded. It is not so long ago since a South Australian smarted an industry in Club House Lane, North Hindley-street, for the purpose of manufacturing blacking. He went to a large distributing house in Adelaide. I do not know that there &#39;would be anything improper in mentioning the name of the house in question, but it is not necessary that I should do so, since I can give the name to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> or any other honorable senator who may be curious on the point, and they will be able to make inquiries for themselves. </para>

                        <para>- We are dealing;, with foreign countries in this measure. This is not a Bill against New South Wales. The distributing house to which I have referred took up the local manufacturer&#39;s blacking and put it on the market, with the result that the British article with which it came into competition was not required, and immediately a. letter came from the great firm of Day and Martin of England, asking why the demand for their goods had fallen off. A reply was sent back stating that a local manufacturer was turning out an article of equal quality at an equal or a lower price, and they were putting it on the market. The reply to that was that there was a consignment on its way out free of charge, and it might be put on the market at any price. That is the kind of competition this Bill is designed to prevent. </para>

No argument which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has so far advanced has disabused the minds of honorable senators on this side of the existence of that danger. I have given a special instance. I know of other like instances .that have occurred, and I know that they are likely to occur in future.

                    <para>.- I am a firm believer in preferential trade, and I shall take advantage of every opportunity I can to give practical effect to mv views. It is contended that this is not the time, nor is this a fitting measure, in which to introduce such a provision for preference. But I am bound to say that Senators Playford and Trenwith have not convinced me that this is an improper occasion for the introduction of the principle. What is meant by dumping? There may be two or three classes of dumping. The dumping which I believe to be unfair, and which I think should be prevented, is that carried on by the manufacturers of the United States. They have an enormous home market of 80,000,000 people, and are protected by a wall of protective duties. They keep their factories going night and day. with the result that they have very large quantities of surplus products, which they dump in every part of the world at prices very much below cost price, and yet, on the year&#39;s transaction, can show an enormous profit. That cannot be compared in any way with the kind of dumping of which the manufacturers of Great Britain are capable. Great Britain is without any protection whatever, her markets are open to the whole world, her manufactures are, in the main, produced to order, and if there is any surplus of manufactured goods in Great Britain, what are the manufacturers to do with them?. Do our honorable friends opposite desire that they should be prevented from selling them? If this is a proper measure for Australia to pass every other part of the Empire might pass similar legislation, and; in that case, what could the British manufacturers do with their surplus goods? There is all the difference in the world between the dumping of Great Britain and of America. We know that the manufacturers of the United States are keen on getting possession of every market in the world, and are prepared to destroy the industries for the sake of profit. An. isolated case of the kind might be quoted in connexion with the operations of the British manufacturers, but that is not the way in which British trade is generally carried on. I should like to ask our honorable friends opposite what they think will happen if goods sent here from Great Britain in the ordinary way of trade, and as they have been sent here for years past, are not admitted into Australia? Will that be likely to increase or to decrease the unpopularity of Australia in Great Britain which has arisen as the result of our legislation. </para>

                        <para>- At .the Premiers&#39; Conference, in 1897, Canada made a distinct offer to continue the preference already given of 33 per cent, in favour of British goods, and also to give a higher preference with respect to goods to be stipulated. At that Conference the representatives of Australia, Natal, and. I believe, other Colonial Possessions of the Empire, agreed that when they went back to their respective States they would endeavour to pass legislation providing for preference to Great Britain. What has been done since then? We have had nothing but talk, which appears to entirely satisfy our friends of the Deakin Ministry. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> seemed to think that the one argument which clinched and disposed of the amendment was that it was an insult, but for once I think that our clear-headed friend made a. slip. He has spoken of the Bill as one to get rid of wrong-doing. There is a kind of dumping which is not wrong-doing, but ordinary trade. In the same connexion, the honorable senator illustrated his argument by a reference to the case of a Bill to prevent thieving, and said that in this Bill no insult is offered to Great Britain but that to pass the amendment would be an insult to her. It is unfair to assume for a moment, let alone to declare in an Act of Parliament, that Great Britain has been, or might be, guilty of the tyranny, the gross wrong-doing, and the injustice which have been practised by manufacturers in the United States. </para>

If we agreed to the amendment we would show our faith in her superior honesty. We all know that the English merchant is the most honest on the face of the globe. </para>

Is it a fair and right thing for the Parliament of the Commonwealth to legislate in this way ? Are we an Empire or are we not ?

                <para>By passing the provision, we should not be making that an offence, nor should we be making it the sole test for determining whether or not he was committing an offence in the way of an illegal dumping. We should be declaring that that fact in itself should be deemed unfair unless the contrary were proved. Let me state the procedure which would follow in regard to an individual whom it was desired to bring under the operation of the penal provisions of this part of the Act. The Comptroller-General would have to receive a complaint in writing, that an importer was dumping goods with intent to destroy an Australian industry, and thereupon he would issue a certificate. It would contain the particulars stated in sub-clause 2 of clause 19, namely - </para>

                    <item label="(d)">

                </list>
                <para class="block">But before issuing that certificate to the Minister, the Comptroller-General would have to give the importer an opportunity of showing cause against its issue. It might be that the Comptroller-General would put before the importer the fact that he had bought the goods abroad at a, ridiculously low price. And at that stage, as between the Comptroller-General and importer that would be <inline font-style="italic">prim&#226; facie</inline> evidence of unfair competition or intended unfair competition. If the importer could satisfy the Comptroller-General that, notwithstanding that fact, it was not his intention to enter unfairly into competition with an Australian industry, the certificate need not go on. But if he failed to satisfy, or did satisfy, the Comptroller-General, and the latter still forwarded the certificate on to the Minister, then the matter would not be determined, but would, by order in writing, be referred by him to the Justice. What he would refer would not be the mere fact whether the man had bought cheaply abroad, but the investigation and determination of the question whether the imported goods were being imported with the intent to destroy an Australian industry. Of course, the Justice would also take into consideration the fact if it were established before him, that the goods were bought cheaply abroad, and give to the importer the opportunity of disproving that he had the intent alleged against him. </para>

                        <para>- Undoubtedly. The Justice could, perhaps in error, draw an inference from certain circumstances, which my honorable friend would not. But it would all depend first upon the evidence which would be furnished to the Comptroller-General, and secondly upon, the evidence which would be furnished to His Honour, and the effect which it would have upon his mind. We are anticipating the discussion of the provisions to some extent. I think my honorable friend will see that the fact of buying cheaply abroad would not end the matter, so far as the importer was concerned. A procedure of a somewhat lengthy character would then have to be followed, and that would necessitate a considerable amount of investigation, during the course of which the importer would have every opportunity to display his <inline font-style="italic">bona fides.</inline> As one who has spoken in favour of preferential trade with Great Britain, not merely at the last election, but at the first election. I am extremely gratified to find so many adherents to that principle during the course of this discussion. </para>

This part of the Bill deals with what we might call illegitimate competition with Australian industry. If my honorable friends say, &#34; Very good, let this provision stand so far as illegitimate competition comes from abroad, but let us exempt English trade,&#34; does not that postulate the possibility of illegitimate competition coming from England? If, however, no reference were made to any country we should stand in a far better position. Under no circumstances should we welcome illegitimate competition from any quarter. If it is bad it is bad wherever it comes from. </para>

                        <para>- That has no bearing upon my argument at present. I am not discussing what is illegitimate trade in every instance. So far as we do agree with this part of the Bill, we agree that a certain class of trade, which we can only designate in general terms, is illegitimate and unwarrantable competition with our own industries, whether it comes from Great&#39; Britain, or elsewhere, and to which those of us who are opposed to it will object. If we set out in the Bill that if the competition comes from Great Britain it shall Tie exempted from the ordinary treatment meted out to the others, it will be an indication to the people -of that country that we are inclined to believe that we may expect illegitimate competition to come from that quarter. I am sure that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> will only look at the matter in that way he will see that this is not an attempt to establish preferential trade, although it may be the. preferential treatment in respect of a certain class of trade. </para>

                    <para>. - This is supposed to be a Bill for the preservation of Australian industries, and for the repression of destructive monopolies. If it were a Tariff Bill, or a Preferential Trade Bill, I could understand the perfervid speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline> and the arguments of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> ; but it is not a Bill which proposes to accord preferential trade to Great Britain, or any other country. Nor is it a measure which proposes to enact certain duties of Customs. </para>

                        <para>- That is a view which may very properly be taken by such an ardent free-trader as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon;</inline> but as a protectionist I do not desire the benefit of temporary cheapness if it is to be obtained at the expense of permanent injury to Australian industries and workmen. I repeat that it is not Great Britain as a country which is aimed at, but the manufacturers of Great Britain, and therefore, the question as to whether the legislation is an insult to Great Britain ought not to enter into the discussion. The question is whether this legislation is right and proper as applied to manufacturers, trusts, and combines in any part of the world, including Great Britain. This is not a Preferential Trade Bill, nor a Tariff Bill, but a measure which, as shown on the face of it, is intended to preserve Australian industries, and repress destructive monopolies which may do injury to Australian industries, and, incidentally, throw Australian workmen out of employment. It is because I think there is a danger of that kind that I support the Bill as it stands. </para>

                        <para>.- That is probably because I never heard the honorable senator on the hustings. At any rate, protectionist senators have gone from place to place throughout the Commonwealth advocating preferential trade, and condemning free-traders on the ground that the latter are not in favour of the principle. But the Commonwealth has been in existence now for six years, and I ask whether any one of those honorable senators has raised a finger to bring about preferential trade. As a matter of fact, preferential trade has simply been used as a parrot cry in order to cajole the electors. The Prime Minister, like his colleagues and followers, has gone from place to place talking about preferential trade, and about binding the Empire closer together ; and in this way the people at Home have been led to believe that some offer in this connexion has been made by Australia. Has any offer been made, or will any offer be made? Canada has shown a desire to bring about preferential trade; but honorable senators opposite, with their views on protection, will do precious little in favour of preference to Great Britain, while they are prepared to take all they can get from the mother country. Honorable senators who have spoken to-night have given what they believe to be excellent reasons to excuse themselves for refusing to give the slightest preference to Great Britain. </para>

Of course, that is quite right from a protectionist stand-point, and if I were a protectionist, I should throw on one side all this talk about preferential trade. There are precious few protectionists who believe in giving preference to Great Britain. They are quite willing that Great Britain should impose &#39; a duty on wheat as against the foreigner, because then Australians might get command of the market and obtain better prices. But, if we get an advantage of that kind, we must give something in exchange; in any case, I do not believe the mother country would impose duties as against outside people in favour of the </para>

First, I do not consider that this is a proper Bill in which to deal with the question of preferential trade, which, so far as I understand it, is a matter of negotiation between Great Britain&#39; and the Commonwealth. I do not know whether any distinct offer has been made bv the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- At the last general election in Great Britain, the people declared by a large majority for free-trade, as against the principal of preferential trade. That being so, I do not see how we can approach the people of Great Britain on the matter, and I really see no reason why we should. What is the object of the Bill, and what ought to be our object here as members pf the Australian Parliament and citizens of the Australian Commonwealth ? The object of the Bill is the preservation of Australian industries, and our object as members of this Senate, and as citizens of the Commonwealth, ought to be the preservation of such industries as we have, and the creation of new industries. Surely that is an end which every Australian ought to assist to attain. Some honorable senators have said that we get cheap goods, which are dumped down at the end of every season, whereby the people of Australia benefit. There may have been benefits in the past, when we had no manufacturing industries of our own, but now that we are endeavouring to manufacture such goods as we can ourselves, it would be the most foolish policy imaginable&#39; to allow anything in the shape of dumping to take place. In my opinion, it is absolutely impossible to establish new industries unless we take precautions against dumping. It is almost as impossible to establish&#39; an industry, if we permit competition by the great firms in Europe and America, as it would be to fortify Melbourne under the fire of an enemy. If we are to raise fortifications sufficient to protect us against invasion, we must do so before the enemy appears in sight. If we are to protect our industries in such a way that they will grow strong enough to look after themselves, we must do so by establishing some barrier against dumping. I do not know whether the aspect of the question to which I am about to refer has ever struck honorable senators, but it always appeals to&#39; me with very great force. All trade is war - all commerce is war. Hundreds of thousands of lives are sacrificed every year in the war of commerce as remorselessly as in wars between nations. Men are mowed down bv the hundred and the thousand just as surely 1n commerce as they are by the bullets and bayonets of an enemy. Our object here ought to be to do everything in our power to prevent people being destroyed by any such system. Some people will tell us that we cannot afford to dispense with the cheap goods which other countries - from philanthropic motives, I suppose - send to us. Can we not? Why, as a; matter of fact, is there at the present moment such a superfluity of capital in Australia that people are rushing all over the place looking for investments and unable to find them? Large sums of money are being, sent to Great Britain for investment. Wealth that has been wrung out of wool, out of mines, from agricultural sources, and from other veins of industry, has been accumulating to such an extent that it is difficult to find profitable fields for its employment. We. are producing, as our statisticians and politicians are fond of telling us, more wealth per head than any other people in the world. I want to see that wealth distributed somewhat more equally than it is. Let us use1 some portion of it to create industries in our midst that will give employment to our young meet and our young women. That ought to be the desire j of every man who loves this Commonwealth and who wishes to see it prosper. It does not matter to me whether dumped goods come here from America or from Great Britain. I am opposed to them in either case. As regards the unpopularity of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> has spoken, I do not care &#34;two dumps &#34; about it, to use a vulgar phrase. It does nob trouble me what Great Britain thinks of our legislation. We must stand upon our own legs, not lean against Great Britain or any other nation. We have borrowed large sums of money, and we will pay every farthing of it. We have never failed to pay our annual interest promptly, and I do not think we ever shall. I do not see where the obligation comes in. If we want money, and Great Britain will not lend it to us, we can get it from New York, which is rapidly becoming the financial centre of the world. In a few years we shall not need to go outside Australia for money to develop our resources. We shall, I trust, be able with- money of our own*, not only to develop such industries, as we have, but also to establish new ones. The nearer we approach to that time the better I shall .like it. Therefore I shall vote against the amendment. </para>

                    <para>. - It is quite refreshing to observe the enthusiasm which the members of the Opposition have infused into the debate, when we remember that some of the leaders of the free-trade party have been&#39; talking about sinking the&#39; fiscal issue. It shows that, after all their talk, the &#34;dry dog&#34; is going to be allowed to live for a little while longer. The members of the Opposition have been refurbishing the old arguments for free-trade, which we understood was to be thrown overboard. But the laughable part of the debate is that nearly adi the speakers who have supported <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon&#39;s</inline> proposal are members of the legal fraternity. I should like to know how much preference they would give to British lawyers who might come here. Why, these lawyers are so very narrow that, even when a member of their own profession crosses the borders of one of the States, they will not allow him to practice in a State in -which he has not been formally &#34;admitted.&#34; These are the men who get up and lecture us on the principles of preference 1 Why should we give any preference to Great Britain? Is she giving any preference to us? After all, the question is not one of preference in trade, but of preference in dumping. If dumping is an evil, why should it be any less am evil because it is practised by merchants in Great Britain rather than by those of any other country? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> tried to make a great deal out of the contention that the merchants of England are very much more virtuous than are those of other countries - that they do not practise the same kind of commercial morality as marks the conduct of Americans, for example. For the life of me, I cannot see the slightest difference. I believe that there is i quite as high ai standard of commercial morality in the United States as in England. It is all a question of profit. I lived long enough in the old country to know that the same unscrupulousness in trade obtains in the United Kingdom as in other parts of the world. It is true that I came from a part of the British Isles where the commercial morality is perhaps a little higher than it is in England ; but even in the place where I had the honour to be born I found that merchants and shopkeepers were prepared to practise commercial trickery, and to palm off on customers articles from which they could derive the greatest amount of profit. We need not be surprised at that. It is the sort of thing that prevails everywhere. I should like to know why I should go out of my way to force principles upon the people of the old country that they have formally repudiated. It is only a few weeks since there was .a general election in Great Britain. What was the result? The issue turned to a considerable extent on the fiscal question. The matter of preference was placed before the electors ; but they did not agree with that principle. Why should we force it upon them when they are not inclined to accept it ? I hope that the amendment will be negatived. </para>

                <para class="block">Honorable senators cannot but take notice of the strong view that is being expressed in England, and of the keen expectations there entertained of something like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon&#39;s</inline> amendment being adopted by this Parliament. What feeling concerning this debate will be entertained in England? It has thrown a strong, almost a lurid, light on the possibilities of preferential trade. The same ideas as have been expressed to-night will be expressed when any proposals for preference are brought forward. We shall be told that preference cannot be given to Great Britain because goods from foreign countries will be sent through England. All sorts of assertions will be made with a view to show how impossible is any policy of the kind. But one thing is very clear to me - that if Australia were not federated to-day,, we should have Victoria and some of the other States passing on their own account Bills such as this. We should have parties in Victoria fighting for Bills to prevent the dumping of goods from the surrounding States; and we should have the other States following suit. This consideration will give honorable senators some idea of the policy which we are pursuing towards Great Britain. </para>

All that the Bill proposes to do is to prevent certain things being done which would injure Australian industry. It is intended to prevent unfair and illegitimate competition. It does not matter a straw to the people of Australia whether the illegitimate competition comes from Great Britain, the United States, or any other country. Our people ought to be protected against it, no matter whence it comes. My principle is to prohibit any one from doing anything to injure the industries of this young nation of ours. Those honorable senators who are in favour of subjecting the people of Australia to illegitimate competition will next be wanting to give a preference to British burglars.

We desire, if possible, to protect Australian industries and the Australian people from the evils which trusts and combines have been shown to have inflicted on the industries and people of other countries. That is a perfectly legitimate object; but we may differ as to whether this Bill will accomplish it. </para>

                        <para>- To some extent I believe it will. At the same time, while we are making the attempt to pass this legislation, we should do all we possibly can to make it effective, and we certainly should not deliberately try to render it ineffective. An amendment which is designed to permit illegitimate competition, with the object of injuring Australian industries, is one which any Australian who has the welfare of the country at heart should be ashamed to advocate. I am opposed to the amendment as something which is designed to weaken the effect of the Bill. I feel sure that the Committee will not assent to it, and I am therefore prepared to allow it to go to a vote without saying anything further on the matter. </para>

                    <para>.- I wish upon this clause to state the reasons why I think that, as a means of protecting local industries, a Tariff is preferable to the provisions of this Bill. A Tariff deals fairly with all industries affected by it. If we increase the protective duties imposed we give a benefit to that extent to all the industries concerned. In this clause, however, a discriminating power is given to the Comptroller-General or a Justice to say which industries shall receive the protection of this measure. Without contravening the Standing Orders, I think I might refer honorable senators to the last sub-clause of clause 18. which provides - </para>

                <para class="block">I understand that the construction put on that provision by Ministers is that the protection of this measure shall not be extended, generally speaking, to any industry unless its processes, plant, and machinery are up-to-date. That is to say, unless it is a top-notch industry it is not to be entitled to the benefit of the protective provisions of this Bill. What is almost certain to happen is that the Comptroller-General, when called upon to discriminate between industries, will refuse the protection of this measure to those that are young and struggling, and that most require help. It is always advisable, where possible, to quote a concrete case to illustrate an argument. It may not always be the strongest case, or entirely appropriate, but it helps to concentrate attention on the way in which a measure will probably be found to work. On the second reading I referred to the way in which the Bill would probably operate in connexion with one of the small industries of Queensland. What I said was this - </para>

                <para class="block">We have in Australia a number of industries scattered over the enormous territory represented by the various States. We may have the same industry in different stages of development in different States. In one it may be employing a great number of hands, and may be carried on with the most modern plant and machinery and up-to-date processes, whilst in another it may be in a comparatively infant condition, and giving employment to comparatively few hands. I take again the case of the coffee industry in Queensland, and in connexion with that I might again emphasize what I mean. We have imposed a protective duty of 3d. per lb. on coffee for the protection of coffee-growers, whether large or small, and that I think is the better means of protecting the industry. But when we come to use this method of prohibition for the purpose the result may be exactly as I have suggested. A complaint may be brought under the notice of the Comptroller-General that the coffee industry is being swamped bv- importations from abroad, and if that officer takes the same view of the matter as does the Minister he will say, &#34; That is only a paltry little industry carried on away in a remote part of Australia. Let it go; it is not worth preserving. Let us attend to this complaint which comes from the proprietors of a big factory in Melbourne, where they have up-to-date appliances, and let us consider what their complaint is. That is the kind of industry we must protect.&#34; Why should there be this discrimination? </para>

It may be unavoidable, but the small industry may be just as much hampered by the big Australian industry as by importations from abroad, when we take into account the protection which each may be given under, the Tariff. The small industry may go on struggling and be at length squeezed out of existence by the operation of the big Australian factory and the importations from outside. It will be unable to obtain any protection under this Bill, because when those concerned in it make a complaint, the Comptroller-General will say, &#34; This is only a paltry affair, and is not worth preserving.&#34; </para>

Let me take the case of another trade which, I think, will appeal to a good many honorable senators, and that is the manufacture of buggies. Some factories in the country are not what might be called right up-to-date, in that they are not equipped with the latest machinery and appliances.

                <para class="block">That seems to mean that before a manufacturer could ask that the power of prohibition should be put into operation for his benefit, he would have to show that there was no fault whatever in his management, and that his processes, plant, and machinery were up-to-date. The manufacture of buggies is carried on all over the Continent, but in a great many places it must be carried on under circumstances which do not tend to the most efficient means of production. For instance, a small country factory, which turns out a score of different kinds of buggies in the year, is at a very great disadvantage, and it seems to me that, according to clause 18, country factories would not get the benefit of the Act at all. </para>

                        <para>- Distance might help them there, although, in that case, they would not get the benefit of the import duty. They might be struggling along against the competition of large up-to-date factories in the big cities. Suppose that a complaint came from a buggy manufacturer in an out-of-the-way part of the Commonwealth to the Comptroller-General, that he could not stand against the competition of the imported article at the present duty. Apparently, that officer would have a discriminating power to refuse any help to that factory. He could say, &#34; No, this protection is not being asked for elsewhere, and yours is a paltry affair, which is not worth preserving.&#34; That position would continue until a big up-to-date factory cried out, and when it did, then the Comptroller-General, I presume, would say, &#34; This is an important industry, which employs a great number of hands in one of the big States, and it must be protected; consequently, we shall put the provisions of the Act into operation.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- When I look at subclause 3 of clause 18, I think not. When I quoted the Minister&#39;s words with regard to the coffee industry in Queensland, it looked to me as if the Comptroller-General had the same idea as the Minister had, that he would not look after the small factory, but would say, &#34; This is a paltry affair in a remote part of Australia, and is not one of the industries worth preserving.&#34; If he will have to look after the small as well as the big industries, what is the meaning of the clause? Why should we not have a provision discriminating between those industries which are worthy of being preserved, and others? I cannot see any justification for the clause, and therefore I shall vote against it. </para>

If honorable senators will turn to sub-clause 1 of clause 21 they will find that under that provision the Justice will have the power if he sees fit - to inquire as to any goods, things, and matters whatsoever which he considers pertinent, necessary, or material </para>

                <para>Itappears to me that those two provisions are intended to meet just such a case as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> has referred to. Suppose that a shipment of a particular line of goods were being made to Brisbane, the authors of the Bill evidently recognised that it would be idle to stop the shipment if simultaneously other shipments were taking place to other ports. Therefore, the Justice has been empowered to take note of every shipment similar to the one in respect of which a complaint has been lodged, and then as equity required to grant a status to persons interested in the other shipments to which his attention had been directed. </para>

He has stated that if the Bill were put into operation it would only be done in the interest of large, well-equipped and up-to-date factories, and that the little establishments scattered about Australia, which we may assume would have a less efficient plant and less capable management, would not be benefited in any way. The honorable and learned senator must know that under the clause we are required to take into account, not merely the interests of those engaged in a particular industry, but also the interests of consumers. </para>

The term &#34;industry&#34; as used in the Bill does not refer to a particular wheelwright&#39;s establishment in a remote country district, but it embraces all establishments of that kind which would be grouped under one head for statistical and other purposes. In the case of the industry of buggy-making, for instance, it would not be sufficient to say that a particular establishment in a certain State was being injured by the importation of foreign buggies; the onus would be thrown upon the complainant to show that the industry as a whole was being injured by the importation. </para>

                        <para>- I do not see how we could help these little struggling establishments by a protective duty. Even if we had absolute prohibition, the little industry would still have to meet the competition of the big and well-equipped industry. In the buggy trade, for instance, establishments spring up because locality and distance are, in themselves, sufficient protection. It is to a very large extent the local demand which induces wheelwrights to start in country districts; and this Bill will not affect them in any way. If these establishments were brought into competition with the bigger establishments in Sydney and the other cities, they would have to go .down in the struggle. </para>

                    <para>. - I am pleased to say that the honorable senator who preceded me has saved me the trouble of advancing a number of arguments. I agree with almost every word said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> who has, in my opinion, demolished <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> most completely. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> did not keep closely to the clause, but dealt with the Bill in a general way. He started with a false assumption that if a complaint were made against a shipment of goods, as destroying an Australian industry, prohibition would be brought about. It does not necessarily follow that prohibition would result from any such complaint, but, on that false assumption, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> was led on to a false conclusion regarding the little industry of coffee-growing in Queensland. If the honorable senator will look at clause 22, he will see that the determination, when published, will have the effect of a proclamation under the Customs Act 1901, &#34; prohibiting the importation of the goods either absolutely or subject to those conditions or restrictions or limitations as the case may be.&#34; It is not necessary, therefore, to prohibit the importation of goods in every case ; and the small industry of coffee-growing in Queensland will not be affected by the Bill. That industry has a protective duty of something like 3d. per lb., and such prohibition as the honorable senator alluded to would be most stupid, because it would mean that the great majority of people in Australia would not be able to use coffee. </para>

                <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir JOSIAH</inline>SYMON (South Australia) &#91;10.20&#93;.- I am also very glad that the third Minister in the Senate has so lucidly expounded the views of himself and his colleagues on the subject; but I think we have drifted a little from, what was said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake.</inline> The first criticism of that . honorable senator was that the Comptroller-General can only act on a complaint as against a specific importer of specific goods. According to clause  19,  when the Comptroller-General receives a complaint, and has reason to believe that any person, either singly or in combination, is importing goods with intent to destroy or injure an Australian industry, he has to deal with a specific importation bv a specific person, who may be a company. That complaint may be made in Melbourne, while another importer in Adelaide would be importing the same goods, in regard to which no complaint had there been made, and which, therefore, would not be subject to prohibition. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> points out that such a state of things is not intended by the Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> was under the impression that this position could be remedied bv sub-clause 2 of clause 21, and subclause 4 of the same clause ; but I think the honorable senator will see that that is not so. </para>
                <para class="block">The Justice, in inquiring into the matter, and determining the question under subclause 5 of clause 19, may, of course, inquire as to such goods and matters as are material to the question of whether the particular shipment interferes with an industry ; he cannot under that complaint inquire whether other shipments have been admitted without complaint in Adelaide or any other port of the Commonwealth. Therefore, under the clause as now framed, there might be prohibition of a shipment in Melbourne with the risk of confiscation, while whole shipments of the same goods were being admitted in other States, from which they might be poured into Victoria. </para>

                        <para>- If so, I shall be very glad. I merely wish to emphasize what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> said, and to point out that this is a matter which ought to be remedied. But the more one discusses the Bill the more one sees how absurd, complex, and useless it proves to be. If the position be as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> understands it, it is certainly very serious and vicious to place an instrument on the statute-book which might be made the means of crushing a struggling industry for the benefit of a large and established industry. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> drew attention to the fact that a large industry, with up-to-date machinery and management, might be willing to stand by and see the small industry crushed out by importations, before making any complaint of injury. That would be a very unfair position. Then a burden too heavy to be borne is placed on the Comptroller-General when he is asked to say whether an industry is advantageous to the Commonwealth, having regard to the efficiency of management, the processes, plant, and machinery. If that means: anything it means that if the plant is not up-to-date the industry will not be worth preserving. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> that clause 18 does not really bear that meaning, at any rate in regard to the first part, because if it were so it would be necessary to read the word &#34;industries&#34; as &#34;businesses.&#34; It is not &#34;businesses,&#34; but &#34;industries,&#34; as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has pointed out, that are dealt with. Just think what the clause is, considered along with the antecedent clause. According to the interpretation, &#34; industries &#34; does not include industries in which the majority of the workers do not receive adequate remuneration, or are subject to unfair terms or conditions of labour or employment. I make no complaint, but this might have the effect of preventing an industry receiving the benefit of the Bill and protection against dumping, at the behest of the workers engaged in if. I am not complaining of that. It is only another way pf expressing the principle of preference to unionists. But what I complain of is that it is left to the Comptroller-General to put the law in motion. The Comptroller-General has to be satisfied whether there is an adequate remuneration for labour and whether proper conditions are being, observed in the industry. In order to find that out, he has to make an independent investigation, and he may declare that remuneration to be inade&#187;quate which perhaps the Wages Boards and the Conciliation and Arbitration Courts of the States have declared to be adequate. He is not to be bound by their decisions. We are setting up a new and independent tribunal which may declare that the decisions of these Boards and Courts do not provide for an adequate remuneration. </para>

                        <para>- The Government in this Bill has provided that industries are to be protected against dumping, and before the dumping; clauses are put into operation the Comptroller-General has to be of opinion that the remuneration of the workers and their conditions of labour are satisfactory. My point is that these matters are settled in the States by proper tribunals. Why should we enable a Commonwealth officer to say that a particular industry in South Australia shall not be protected against dumping because the wages are not adequate, although a State Arbitration Court may say that they are? Is that a right thing to do? Is that what the Senate, which is supposed to protect the rights of the States, ought to do? I agree that what is meant by the Bill is an industry and not merely a business here and there. It is not merely an industry in a particular State that is referred to. Unless it can be shown that in an industry the majority of the workers all over Australia are receiving adequate remuneration, and that that industry all over Australia is in the opinion of the Comptroller-General advantageous to the Commonwealth, there is no protection against dumping for it. Is not that ridiculous? I know that it is hopeless to try to amend the Bill. But this point is well worthy of the consideration of the Minister and his colleagues. I say that in all seriousness, and I hope that between now and to-morrow they will see whether they cannot change the phraseology so as, at any rate, to make the Bill attain the purposes desired in a really sensible and effective way. </para>

                    <para>. - This question has given rise to an interesting discussion upon side issues. The point taken by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> for instance, that this clause would operate as an all-round prohibition throughout Australia, is one with which I cannot agree. My opinion upon that point is that of the Minister, and I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> holds the same view. I am hot at all confusing businesses with industries. I agree that &#34; industry &#34; means a process of trade or manufacture carried on all over the Commonwealth. But I do not lose sight of the fact that the same industry may be carried on in different States under different conditions as to wages. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">There are Wages Boards in some States, and in others; there are none. In some States, wages may be much higher than in others. There will necessarily be different standards for the remuneration of labour in different States. I do not wish honorable senators to be in doubt as to what my objection to the clause is. I believe that, as a means of protecting industries, a Tariff is better than the system of prohibition provided by this Bill, because whatever the measure of protection may be, a Tariff operates upon the big man and the small man indiscriminately. But what will be the effect of giving the Comptroller-General power of his own motion to say that a certain industry shall be protected by the means provided by this Bill, and that another industry shall not be protected? I am supposing an industry which has first of all passed the first barrier, and is declared to bean industry within the meaning of this Bill. That is to say, it must be an industry in which the majority of the workers receive adequate remuneration, and are not subjected to unfair terms and conditions of employment. That industry in one State may be injured by importations in the manner described in clause 18, which sets forth the different kinds of injury constituting unfair competition. If there be an industry that fulfils those conditions, and which is at the same time being subjected to unfair competition, so that the workers are driven out of employment, it should be entitled to the protection of the Bill. It ought not to be within the power of one individual - the Comptroller-General- to declare that it is not worth preserving, </para>

                <para>In submitting this motion I may be allowed to state that I trust honorable senators will assist the Government to pass the few remaining clauses of this Bill as early as possible to-morrow, because it is necessary that we should consider the Constitution Alteration (Senate Elections) Bill, which will appear second on the paper, and the second reading of which my honorable and learned colleague desires to move. It is necessary that that Bill should be passed two months before the elections. It is being introduced very properly, I think, in the Senate, and must go on to another place. I trust that honorable senators, if they approve of the measure, will be prepared to assist us in passing it as early as possible. </para>
