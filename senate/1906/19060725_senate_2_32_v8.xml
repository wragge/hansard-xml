                        <para>- I desire, sir, to ask a question concerning the distribution of official publications, and I am not quite sure that it ought not to be put to you. About a month ago, the Senate, at my instance, passed a motion in favour of supplying to members of both Houses Government publications, particularly regulations under various Acts. I have not received any of these regulations, but, judging by the advertisements in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette,</inline> I think that a good number have been promulgated. </para>

If papers cannot be supplied to members of Parliament unless they are ordered by the Senate to be printed, of course I shall submit another motion; but as the documents are already in print, that does not seem to me to be needful. </para>

I have been informed that as regards regulations printed by the Government Printer, but not ordered b,y either House to be printed, members of Parliament can get copies of them by making a small payment. </para>

                            <para>- It is my intention to suggest to my colleagues that it shall be an instruction to the Government Printer to send a copy of each regulation, or set of regulations, to every member of Parliament. That I think will meet the case. Honorable senators have the right to call in question the wisdom of any regulations, and to move that a regulation be amended by way of deletion or addition. The least which can be done is, I think, to supply them, without payment of a fee, with copies of regulations as they are issued by the Government Printer. </para>

                    <para>.- When we reported progress on this Bill on Friday, I had submitted, together with a number of my honorable friends, reasons for the desirableness of re-casting clause 6. I am very loth indeed to bring under the attention of the Committee again, at any length, the points then objected to. I presume that the Minister has had an opportunity to reconsider the matter in the meantime. I certainly thought that he would have attempted to supply some answer to the objections w&#39;hich were then made, and I ventured to hope that he would accept the suggestions, and re-cast the clause. I should like, as shortly as possible, to recapitulate the objections to the clause, as it stands. The first objection to it is that it contains a very undesirable principle which is a d&#39;eparture from what we have hitherto done in the framing of clauses of a similar character. It is attempted to enact a law under which a State shall act in regard to matters which are essentially within the jurisdiction of the State itself. In other words, Ave seek to provide by this clause what the Governor of a State may do under certain circumstances, in spite of what may be the law of the State concerned. The clause uses the words: - the Governor of a State acting with the advice of the Executive Council thereof. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">As a preliminary remark, I would mention that that language, in itself, is a little irregular, and somewhat uncomplimentary to the States. It is possible, but extremely improbable, that the Governor of a State, acting with the advice of the Executive Council, will act contrary to the law of the State. I would point out - though not as a verv strong objection - that under the terms o&#39;f the clause it would be quite possible for the Governor of a State, with the advice of the Executive Council, to execute any agreement contemplated by the clause, irrespective of, and, indeed, in spite of the laws of that State; in other words, disregarding the desires and wishes of the Parliament of the State. That I make, as a. preliminary remark, but the essential objection which I flake to the clause - and it is one which has been strongly supported - is that we, as a Commonwealth, are attempting to enact a law under which the Governor of a State is to act. What we have hitherto done under similar circumstances has been to enact that the Governor-General shall have power to enter into an arrangement with the Governor of a State. But here we go further. We turn the provision round, and say that the Governor of a State, acting with the advice of the Executive Council, may do so and so. I say that in principle that is essentially wrong. I ventured on Friday to make certain suggestions by way of amendment, and, in doing so, I sought to meet - and I think I completely met - the objections urged by the Minister in charge of the Bill to alterations of the kind suggested. The objections which the Minister took were these : He argued that it is essential that we should empower the Governor of a State to do certain things. First he urged that the Governor of a State having at present only power to issue a grant in a certain form, that grant might contain certain reservations which might require that the grant should only last for a period of twenty-one years, when the land could be resumed without compensation. In short, the objection was that the Governor of a State might only be able to make a grant subject to certain reservations or encumbrances. That is a very important matter. My answer was, and is, that as the Commonwealth has the undoubted power under the terms of the Constitution to acquire land free of encumbrances, all that it was necessary to do under those circumstances was to enact that upon the notification of the grant in the <inline font-style="italic">Government Gazette</inline> that notification should have the effect of cancelling any dedication or reservation to which the land was subjected. No one, least of all the Minister, can say that such a power is not within the jurisdiction of this Parliament, because the Minister himself has inserted in the Bill certain words in regard to land which the Commonwealth is empowered to resume compulsorily. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. And such a power is essential, though of course it has to be exercised with very great care and caution, and with due regard to the public interest. What I contend is that what I. have submitted is a complete answer to that objection of the Minister. He cannot take exception to it, because as a matter of law he admits that it is competent for the Commonwealth to enact such a provision. A further exception which was taken was, as I understood it, that before any land could be sold by mutual arrangement by the Governor in Council of a State it would be necessary to go through certain forms - either to put the land up to public auction or to resort to some such machinery in order to comply with the law of the State. That also would be a valid objection if it could not be completely met. But my answer is that it is not necessary to act in the manner proposed by this Bill for the purpose of overcoming that objection. It is not necessary to adopt the improper principle of legislating as to what the Government of a State may do in order to achieve our end. All that need be done is to sav that upon the publication of the notification in the <inline font-style="italic">Government Gazette,or</inline> even upon entering into an agreement, the property shall vest free of all encumbrances in the Commonwealth. We as a Commonwealth have power to make that enactment. Consequently I say if it is declared <inline font-style="italic">ipso facto</inline> that upon entering into the agreement or upon the publication in the <inline font-style="italic">Government Gazette</inline> the land shall vest in the Commonwealth free of all encumbrances, or, as it may be. subject to the agreement, that will be sufficient. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. This is one of the specific powers delegated to the Commonwealth. I submit that I have shown, first of all, that it is undesirable to enact a clause in the manner in which clause 6 is framed in this Bill, and that, we are departing from precedent in doing so. On Friday, I instanced what was done in regard to the Meteorology Bill. Our object in passing that measure was the same as it is in this instance - to acquire land by mutual agreement. I pointed out that in that case what we did was to enable the Governor-General - that is to say, our own agent - to enter into arn arrangement with the Governor of a State; and we did not attempt to say how the Governor of the State should attempt to carry out his functions&#39; and duties. I therefore urge that the objections which I and some of my honorable friends have taken to the clause are sound, and that the reasons which have been given by the Minister for inserting it in this form are insufficient. I think that I have furnished a complete answer, and by the proposed amendment I have suggested a better way. My honorable friend may say in reply, &#34; Yes, but a similar provision was inserted in the Property for Public Services Acquisition Act, which was passed by this Parliament in the year 1902.&#34; I am not prepared to say that that provision goes anything like so far. Section 5, which provides that in the case of Crown lands purchased under the Act, the Governor-General may grant the land in the name of <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> King to the Commonwealth, has to be read in conjunction with section 3, which enables the Governor-General to agree with the owners of the land, and with the State in the case of Crown land, for the absolute purchase. These two sections are to toe read together ; and section 5, I submit, provides for what is strictly a Ministerial act. But apart from that, in my opinion, after debate and consideration of the principles to which I have referred, I submit that section 5 as we enacted it is wrong; that is, I think the Senate acted unwisely in enacting the provision in that particular form. And now that we ha&#39;Ve an opportunity of achieving the same end in a less objectionable way it is our duty to do so. Therefore, my suggestion is that,, first of all, we should re-enact section 3 of the Property for Public Purposes Acquisition Act, adding to it an amendment to the effect that upon such agreement and notification thereof in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette, the</inline> land shall be vested in the Commonwealth free from all encumbrances. </para>

                        <para>- We already have the power referred to by the honorable senator ; and I am now suggesting that it should be exercised in a much less offensive way by the amendment I &#39; have foreshadowed. This Senate is supposed to conserve the rights of the States; and I trust we shall always do so as far as possible. It may be suggested that the &#39;provision is not at all offensive to the States in its present form. That &#34;may or may not be so; still, the provision creates a precedent and a wrong principle, and we have no right to infringe on the rights and duties of a State in the manner proposed by the Bill. It might be held that it is undesirable, following Acts of a similar&#39; character since 1845, to simply declare that the land shall&#39; vest in either the State or the Commonwealth, as the case may be, without <inline font-style="italic">&#39;st</inline> parchment title. Such, however, is the-- case according to the present law; at any rate, I can speak of the law of Victoria. But if a parchment title is required by having recourse to the Bill and similar legislation, the simple answer is that a certificate can be given by the Attorney-General that the land has been compulsorily resumed. When that certificate has been issued, a parchment title will be granted by the Commissioner of Titles, or a corresponding officer. What I suggest is completely in conformity with what would take place were land compulsorily resumed. But I desire to make the same principles apply to an agreement in order to avoid what has hitherto been a difficulty, namely, that under certain circumstances land has been compulsorily resumed where it would have been more desirable to have resumed it by mutual agreement. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly ; that is according to the present law of the States, and also of the Commonwealth. The Imperial Parliament, in granting responsible government to Australia, and placing the lands of the country in charge of the various Governments, gave us absolute dominion, and power to legislate in regard to those lands. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> need not be at all apprehensive that we are entering upon any &#39;violent innovation ; because we are simply carrying out the laws of the States, and of the Commonwealth. It is suggested that certain minor alterations shall, by this Bill, be made in the law of the Commonwealth. One of the alterations is in an offensive form; and the desire of certain honorable senators and myself is simply to place the provision in a less offensive form, and not to create what I regard as a wrong principle. </para>

                    <para>. - Since this matter was discussed in Committee on Friday, consideration has been given to the suggestion made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> and other honorable senators who supported him. So far, I have been informed and advised by those who are intimately acquainted with the working of this and similar legislation, that to give effect to the suggestion would be somewhat dangerous, so far as the Commonwealth is concerned. I use the word &#34; dangerous &#34; in the sense only that the suggestions would not take us any further than where we stand to-day. We have, of course, under the existing law, power to acquire land, either by mutual agreement or compulsorily. We propose to still exercise that power, whether the owner be a private individual, or the Crown in any particular State. What we do desire - and I think it is a very laudable desire - is that we shall never exercise our compulsory powers, either as against the private individual or the Crown, except in the last resort. Under the provisions of the present law, the Crown law officers in some of the States are of opinion that the Governor of a State, in dealing with the Commonwealth in the disposition of the lands of the State, is absolutely tied and limited by the State laws. I gave, on Friday last, some instances, and showed that in the case of Western Australia, a deed came to hand for execution on the part of the Commonwealth, containing in it a reservation of the right of the State to resume the land at the end of twenty-one years in case certain improvements were not effected. The Commonwealth rightly showed a disinclination to accept a grant, subject to such a reservation ; and the Western Australian Government then, in effect, said - &#34; As a matter of fact, we do not wish to impose such a reservation, but our, law requires that in all such instances we shall do so; and we cannot treat the Commonwealth Government differently from any other person or persons.&#34; I think honorable senators accept my assurance that this provision is not intended to mean anything in the nature of aggression, or an assertion of high-handed authority on the part of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- On Friday last I also instanced the State of New South Wales, where the Government are to some extent tied, in granting land, by conditions which impose the necessity of having the land put up for selection, or subjected to public auction. Those conditions, of course, could not apply to the Commonwealth; but to this the New South Wales Government reply that the Commonwealth&#39; Act for the acquisition by agreement of property for public purposes is not strong enough - that the local Government are compelled to comply with all the conditions of the local Statutes, and that the Commonwealth ought to exercise their compulsory powers. I have here a letter, which is only a specimen letter, setting out that attitude on the part of the New South Wales Government, as far back as 1904. </para>

                <para class="block">As a matter of fact, the State of New South Wales and the Commonwealth were in agreement as to the sum to be paid, but the former suggested that, under the circumstances, our compulsory powers should be exercised. As I said before, it is desirable that we should exhaust all chances of peaceful negotiation before we resort to our compulsory powers, in the case of either a private individual or the Crown. The amendment suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> is to re-state section 3 of the present Act, and add a paragraph corresponding to the second paragraph of clause 17. </para>

                        <para>- The question arises as to how far a reservation on the part of a State authority applies as against a Commonwealth authority in the absence of an agreement. The Commonwealth might desire in some instance only what might be called the surface rights ; but still we wish to have the freehold title, subject to such reservations as any State may agree with the Commonwealth to make, and in those instances it would be undesirable to have a hard and fast rule. </para>

                        <para>- As I said before-, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> has submitted no amendment in form, and I am only criticising his suggestion from memory, as I heard it indicated by him on Friday, and re-stated this afternoon. So far as this clause is concerned. I point out to the Committee that its object is simply to empower the Government of a State - not to direct them, and not to oblige them - whenever they in their wisdom think fit to do so, to dispose of lands of the State to the Commonwealth for public purposes. And that notwithstanding the fact that so far as those lands are concerned, generally, and in the case of alienation to any private individual, they would be subject to some condition which ought not attach to lands acquired for the public purposes of the Commonwealth. We are not obliging the States authorities or commanding them to do certain things in certain circumstances, but are leaving them the most unbounded discretion. </para>

Having the superior authority in this common domain of legislation, we simply propose to empower them, when they do decide to do anything of the kind, to proceed to do it, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the laws of their State. I assure honorable senators that since Friday last I have been in consultation with the public officers most intimately acquainted with the working of the existing Act, and who know a great deal about the working of corresponding laws in the different States, and they are disposed to think that an amendment in the direction indicated, or other amendments drafted for the purpose of trying to meet the views of honorable senators opposite, might and probably would, be read and construed in the States as bringing the States authorities no further forward in this matter. </para>

                    <para>. - If the Minister had been able to supply the Committee with a simple but clear proof that most of the States desire us to do something which practically they feel themselves unable to do, and desire that we should do it in the way proposed, we could accept the clause. Seeing the clause for the first time as it stands, and without any explanation, we should be justified in assuming that it arrogates to the Commonwealth powers which might be enforced against the States without their consent, and in such a1 way as to injure their feelings. In the absence of any explanation, we should say at once that this is an assertion of Commonwealth power which is very likely to create friction. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has said that the authorities of one State intimated some years ago that, while perfectly willing that their land should be compulsorily acquired, there were certain obstacles in the way created by State legislation which they desired that the Commonwealth Parliament should overcome. IP 1,t I think the honorable senator quoted only one instance of that kind. </para>

                        <para>- That was a different case, and, so far as we know, the Western Australian authorities in that case did not call upon the Commonwealth to enact legislation which would overcome the difficulties arising under their State legislation. What they said was that their State legislation was such that the difficulty could not be overcome except by the compulsory acquisition of the land by the Common wealth. The case cited by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> showed that in 1904 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline> W. O&#39;sullivan, as Minister of Lands for New South Wales, intimated that while the State had no power to alienate certain land to the Commonwealth, he would raise no objection to the Commonwealth taking immediate action to complete the purchase by acquiring the land by means of the Property for Public Purposes Acquisition Act 1901. Whilst I throw no doubt upon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating&#39;s</inline> statement, I think it would be a pity to pass the clause in its present form, because it would enable the authorities in the various States to permit their lands to be compulsorily acquired, although that course might not be agreeable to the people of the State. If the States authorities desire that these acquisitions of land by the Commonwealth should take place unhampered by conditions of local legislation, why do they not alter their local legislation fo make that possible?

                    <para>. - Two objects are proposed to be served by the clause, and both should be kept in mind. First of all, we have to consider that we are taking the right to acquire lond for public purposes on behalf of the Commonwealth. I think we might assume circumstances in which it would be necessary for us to acquire land in the interest of the Commonwealth against the will of a State. In such circumstances, the interests of the whole must override those of a section, and we must, therefore, have the power to acquire compulsorily any of the lands of a State required in the public interest. We know that in all the States there are certain dedications or reservations in- connexion with public lands which, unless very strong reason to the contrary is shown, should be observed. The States &#34;Parliaments taking necessarily a narrower view as compared with the Commonwealth Parliament have embedded the principle of reservation in particular enactments.1 In the event of circumstances arising in which, for some reason, it would be obviously in the public interest that land should be acquired by the Commonwealth for public purposes, and a certain dedication or reservation revoked, the case might be so strong that even the authorities of the State responsible for enacting the dedication or reservation would admit the justice of the claim. </para>

                        <para>- It seems to me that the clause is designed to facilitate business! iri an event which may easily arise. Both parties may agree that the best&#39; thing to be done is that which is proposed, but a law may stand in the way. In order to obviate the necessity of a special Act in every instance in which a contingency of that sort arises, we by this Bill intrust the right to take land from a State to our responsible administrators, over whose action Parliament continually keeps control. I think that there is no danger involved in the provision. </para>

                        <para>- It seems to me that the clause empowers the act to be done by the administrators of a State, in conjunction with the administrators of the Commonwealth, notwithstanding, anything in the law of the State to the contrary. It seems to me to give two sets of administrators, on some general principle, the power to come to an agreement. I feel disposed to support the clause. I do not think that it contains anything which is offensive to the States. In all questions of aggregate public interest, we must take to the Commonwealth the right to supersede any section of the community in that connexion. </para>

                    <para>- - I fee&#39; quite sure that honorable senators are viewing this question from the Commonwealth point of view. No party issue is involved, and I believe that every honorable senator is endeavouring to pass a measure which will work smoothly. When the present Act was under consideration here, very few senators other than those&#39; who belonged to the legal profession, took any active interest in its provisions. Speaking from memory, it was left entirely to the superior intelligence of the lawyers to frame a measure which would carry out the intentions of the Parliament, and which would not in any way be oppressive to the States. It has been found, however, that notwithstanding all the diligence of the learned senators, it is not a perfect measure. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has pointed out the direction in which it has not fulfilled the object of Parliament, and that is in coming to an agreement without resort to compulsion. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has been persistent in his declaration that the Commonwealth could not take lands which hare been dedicated to the purposes of the public in the &#39;different States. But that is all nonsense. Ac- 4 cording to the present Act - and also according to this Bill - if the Commonwealth choose to resort to compulsion it can take any land, whether it is dedicated to the purpose of a park land, or a cemetery, or a church. In some instances, the Government have not been able to come to an agreement with a State other than by resorting to compulsion, and they wish to obviate that. They wish to empower the representative authorities of the Commonwealth and a State to meet together, and to say, &#34;We are both agreeable that this shall be done.&#34; That is the object of the clause, and it is the object which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> has in view when he wishes to embody section 3 of tha present Act in his suggested amendment. I believe that clause 6 is far more likely to be acceptable to the States than is his amendment, and I am very glad to find that my view is shared by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith.</inline> What does the clause provide in its present form ? It provides that if, in an emergency, or under any  circumstances, it be desirable to resume any land, it shall be within the power of the representatives of the Commonwealth and the State to come together, and, notwithstanding any State legislation to the contrary, or any reservation attached to any land, to come to an agreement that the land shall be transferred to the Commonwealth. An interjection was made by an honorable senator about the land being handed back to the States, bin! that is a different matter. The Commonwealth already has full power to take any land for temporary use, and then it can revert to the State under the agreement, but that has nothing to do with the clause. If honorable senators will read the clause carefully they will see that it really is not necessary to retain the words - notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the law of any State. </para>

                        <para>- If there were any reservations which the Government of a State wanted to maintain, they would not recommend the proposal, and the Commonwealth would have to exercise its compulsory powers. The honorable senator does not, seem to recognise that whether the Government of a State agrees or not the Commonwealth has power, under existing legislation, to take land compulsorily. and that the Bill keeps that power in .existence. The clause, as it stands, will enable the Government of the Commonwealth to act as fairly as possible towards a State. Etu&#39; what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> wishes to do is to embody in this clause section 3 of the Act, which empowers the Governor-General to make an agreement with a State, and provides that, upon its publication in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette,</inline> the matter shall be finished, in spite of any legislation of the State to the contrary, or of any reservation attached to the land. In the clause, however, we say that the Governor of a State, with the consent of his Executive Council, may come to an agreement with the Commonwealth. I hope that honorable senators will be able to see the matter in that light. </para>

We ought to do everything that lies in our power to protect from inroads estates owned and enjoyed by&#39; the public. I have a clear recollection of an endeavour made some time ago by the Gtv Corporation to take a portion of the park lands surrounding Adelaide for the purpose of erecting abattoirs, rubbish destructors, and other buildings of an objectionable character. The Defence Department has also made considerable inroads upon the public domain, though it is true that it has not prevented the public from crossing the land. </para>

Yet the municipality of Adelaide attempted to take away certain portions of the park lands of that city. The State Government, however, refused its permission. Now the Federal Government is taking power to say that it shall, if it likes, vest those lands in the Commonwealth. What do the Commonwealth representatives from Queensland and Tasmania care about the park lands of Adelaide? They do not care twopence. </para>

                    <para>. - I should like the Minister to explain how this clause compares with the corresponding section in the original Act. I observe that there has been a great re-arrangement of provisions, some clauses being identical with corresponding sections, while others are curtailed and varied in all sorts of* ways. It would certainly save time, and serve the convenience of the Committee, if the Minister would explain the reasons for the variations. </para>

                        <para>- There is none. It is simply a matter of drafting, in order to make the provision read better. While the Bill was being drafted two minor alterations suggested themselves as bringing the clause more into conformity with the drafting of provisions usual in the Commonwealth Statutes. On the second reading I purposely took the precaution to introduce to the notice of honorable senators every material or substantial alteration that would be effected by the Bill. If I did not particularly refer to a clause it was because there was no alteration in it of any consequence or material significance. </para>

                        <para>.- It is all very well to legislate in this way, but such provisions deal rather ruthlessly with all sorts of trusts, whether for public purposes or in private interests. Where lands have been settled upon trust for the payment of the rents to a widow and afterwards to her children, the sale might not be in the best interest of the family generally. It would be much better in such cases for the trustee or person holding the land to get the approval of the Court, or, failing that, to leave it to the Government to resume the land, so that, while the law was complied with, the trustees themselves might be protected. We do not desire to put a trustee in such a. position that he will be liable for a breach of trust, and neither do we desire to ride rough-shod over the Courts of the State in a matter of the kind. It would be as well to call a halt in regard to some of these provisions, in order to insure that persons like those to whom I have referred may be placed in a safer position. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. Trustees are, under this clause, empowered to convey lands to which they are legally entitled to the Commonwealth for the purposes of this Bill. It is desirable that the Commonwealth should not be hampered in any way in the acquisition of lands, so long as they are required for a public purpose. If the Commonwealth is to be compelled to enter into nice questions as to whether or not any trustee would be well advised in disposing of the land which he holds, upon certain trusts indicated in some deed or document of title, we should never know when we could negotiate with such persons. If that were so, any person would be entitled&#39; to draw up deeds and documents of trust which would place considerable obstacles in the way of the Commonwealth acquiring land for public purposes. We, therefore, propose to empower all such persons holding a partial or limited interest in land, and having an immediate legal title to it, to dispose of it to the Commonwealth for public purposes under this Bill. We are not giving such persons the right to dispose of such lands in a general fashion <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> anybody, but only in certain specified circumstances, namely, to the Commonwealth, for public purposes, and under the provisions of this Bill. Once they do dispose of it, so far as the compensation which may be paid to them is concerned, subsequent provision is made in clause 11 for its application. In that clause we provide that- </para>

                        <para>- Possibly, but I am pointing out now the way in which we propose that the purchase money shall be dealt with, and that we give to the parties interested the right to apply to the High Court or the Supreme Court for a direction as to the application of the money. Under the existing law the parties might apply to the High Court for a direction as to the apportionment of the money, and we propose a modification of the existing law to the extent of enabling those persons to apply not merely to the High Court, but alternatively to the Supreme Court of a State for such a direction. We introduce no other new provisions in clause II, to which I have referred honorable senators, because of its relation to clause 8, with which we are at present dealing. Going back to clause 8, I point out that we only extend the existing law in this clause by making trustees or feoffees in trust for other than charitable purposes competent to convey to the Commonwealth. </para>

Of course we have executors and administrators, who, in a great many instances, occupy the position of trustees, and, speaking generally, that is the only extension we propose of the provisions of the existing law, if I exclude for a moment from consideration the words within parentheses. These, as I have already pointed out, are provisions which exist in the English legislation from which our present Act was adopted, as honorable senators will see by a reference to the marginal note of the corresponding section in the existing Act.

                    <para>.- I admit freely that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> is quite right in saying that these provisions are well founded. They are founded on English legislation, to some extent re-enacted in our own law, but it is just as well that the Committee should understand the full extent of their operation. Personally, I think that they go too far. Under this clause, for instance, this might happen : A.B. might be a life tenant of a most valuable property in Collins-street, CD. the reversionary owner, subject to the life tenancy of A.B., may be living in a remote part of Australia or abroad. It would be quite possible, under this clause, for the Commonwealth Government to resume the property by arrangement or otherwise. It will toe observed that the estate of the life tenant would be practically only a small portion carved out of the estate in question. The Bill would enable the life tenant to deal with that valuable property just as though he were the owner of the fee-simple, and the Government could go so far as to say that he was entitled to receive the whole of the purchase money. The real owner of the reversion, who, as I have said, might be resident abroad, might never hear anything about the transaction. Hitherto the life tenant has not been able to deal with any interest in an estate, saving his own life tenancy, but, under this clause, when once he received the purchase money, he would put it into his pocket, and the owner of the reversion would be absolutely and completely robbed of his interest in the estate. That is what this Parliament is asked to enact. According to my view that has always seemed to be a harsh law. I think that the proper -way in which to deal with such matters is that, where various interests exist in an estate, such, for instance, as the interest of a remainder man, the owner of the reversion, it should be necessary that the transaction should be submitted to a Judge of the Supreme Court, or, ai least, to m..orncer of that Court, whose duty it should be to assess the value of the several interests in the estate, and to pay om! to the life tenant, for example, his interest, whilst the Government should deposit in the Treasury, or in the Savings Bank, or with the Court, as might be thought advisable, the balance of the money, to be lifted whenever the remainder man came to be entitled to it. I have given a most simple illustration, because I desire to impress upon honorable senators the seriousness of the principle. I wish&#39; them to understand that they are here being asked to re-enact what, in my view, is an alarming principle, and I have suggested what I think should be the course adopted. </para>

When the money is paid over to the life tenant to whom I have referred, clause 11 goes on to provide how the purchase money shall be applied by that person. It will then be quite competent for any person interested to apply to the High Court, or the Supreme Court of a State, for a direction as to the way in which the purchase money shall be applied. That is all right. </para>

Where trusts are disclosed, the obligation should be thrown upon the Government to pay the money into Court, in order that an assessment of the various interests might be made, and. the money paid out.

In the meantime, it is desirable, however we may provide for the application of the purchase money, that the persons who hold the legal estate shall be empowered to convey to the Commonwealth, so that there shall be the least possible delay, and there shall not be an opportunity afforded to private individuals who desire to hoodwink the Commonwealth, to enter into deeds of trust which would in some way or other hamper its action in relation to the property. This clause, I think, should stand, and the Question of apportioning the compensation could be better determined on clauses 10 and 11. </para>

                    <para>. - It is not inappropriate to mention a matter which I brought up on the definition clause, because the same principle is involved. Judging from the last words of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best,</inline> his object in directing attention to a weakness in this and subsequent clauses is to point out that there is no machinery by which compensation money can be distributed in equitable proportion among the holders of various interests in land acquired. That is exactly the position I raised in regard to conditional purchasers, conditional lessees, and the holders of other tenures in New South Wales. I have not yet been, able to discover in the Bill any proper provision by which the interests of the States of New South Wales and the interests of those to whom it has conditionally sold land! can be determined. Nor can I discover that there is any machinery by which compensation money can be distributed between them. It is possible that there are other clauses in which I can submit an amendment, but, still, I suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> whether, if there is any force in the remarks concerning this clause, clause 8 will not also require consideration if it be deemed desirable to alter the definition clause later on. </para>

                            (New South Wales) &#91;4.36&#93;. - I am very glad that I referred to this clause, because the remarks of
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline>
                            have thrown a good deal of light upon what we are enacting. The Government say, &#34; Do not throw any obstacle in the way of getting a transfer completed.&#34; But there is such a thing as placing too much power in the hands of a Government at the expense of persons who are primarily interested in property. While we should be willing to give every facility we can to the Government where it is necessary to acquire land, we should also take care that . no opportunity is afforded by our legislation to persons to defraud others of what they are entitled to. It has been pointed out that the empowering of tenants in tail or for life to dispose of property, is a very serious matter, especially when coupled with the right to receive the purchase money. I do not object to making the machinery of the law reasonably smooth and easy, so long as the interests of owners of land are fully provided&#39; for. But that, I think, has not been done here. The Minister has stated that the clause has been taken from the Imperial&#39; Act. Paragraph
                            <inline font-style="italic">i</inline>
                            of the Bill empowers a trustee or feoffee in trust to sell or convey. But according to section 4 of the present Act, it is only those persons who hold &#34; in trust for charitable or other purposes&#34; who can exercise this right. I wish to know why it is necessary to extend the power so as to meet cases where persons are holding land on private trusts. Why should we give power to these persons to join in and sell instead of leaving it to the Government to adopt some other course?

Under this provision he would have the power of entering into negotiation, and fixing the purchase money for the fee-simple of the land. By a subsequent clause he could receive the money, and the owner would have to get it out of him as best he could. Surely the Minister must see that a lessee for life, or for life and years, or for any less interest should not have the power to convey the fee-simple ! He might be allowed to deal with his life interest, whatever it was, leaving it to the owner of the land to join in with regard to the remainder. </para>

                    <para>.- If the Minister desires to make substantial, and, as I conceive, most necessary reforms in the law relating to the acquisition of land and compensation therefor, there is ample room for doing so. The danger I have referred to applies most seriously, I think, to paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">b,h,</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">i,</inline> because a lessee for years cannot be said to have the legal estate. </para>

                <para>It is most undesirable that the Government should negotiate with those persons alone. My suggestion to the Minister is that where a person is not the owner in fee-simple, and where there are subordinate interests - for instance, where property is held in trust - then-, in order to relieve the Government from any embarrassment or difficulty, they should simply deposit the amount, and allow the persons to take out the money for themselves. That would assure to these persons, at all events, that they would be placed in no worse position than they previously occupied, because they would get an assessment of the value of their interest. I do not deem it necessary that in the interest of the Government there should be any person who would convey to them a legal estate, because in these Acts, right from the very commencement, there has always been provision made for the vesting of the estate by the execution of a deed-poll by a purchaser, whilst in some cases the mere fact of the deposit of the money has vested the estate in the Government. What I am urging is that the Minister should adopt some of the principles embodied in this measure itself, and say that, on taking possession of land, and on notification in the <inline font-style="italic">Government Gazette,</inline> instead of paying over the money to the tenant for life - who may disappropriate it - or to the other persons mentioned, he should simply deposit the money. Then the interests of the other persons would be protected. In the interests of the Government it is not necessary that the purchase money should be paid to the&#39; person from whom the land is acquired. There is no value in a clause of this kind, which picks out a person having a comparatively small interest in a property, and says that that person shall convey to the Government. </para>

If it is desired that there shall be any restriction placed on persons who only hold a partial or limited interest in property disposing of the whole of the estates to the Commonwealth, the proper course, it seems to me, would be to extend the exemptions which are included in parentheses in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> of clause 9. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> objects to the tenant In tail or the tenant for life having power to dispose of the whole interest in a property to the Commonwealth, the proper place to include such an amendment would be in the same paragraph. The tenant&#39; for life could be included amongst the other disabled persons. But clause 8 -deals with the power of persons to dispose of land to the Commonwealth where the compulsory powers of the measure, are -not being employed. </para>

                    <para>.- My honorable and learned friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has not dealt with my, objection. I draw attention to the ambiguous wording of this clause. The power to sell land may be exercised by &#34; any person.&#34; . It does not go on to say &#34; any person who is interested,&#34; no matter how small his interest is. We will assume that he has some interest - it may be the most remote. For instance, it may be an interest coming into existence after the death of a dozen persons. But that person under this clause is authorized - provided he is not one of the persons excepted - not only on behalf of himself, his heirs, and successors, but also on behalf of every person entitled in reversion, remainder, or expectancy after him, and in defeasance of the estate of every person so entitled to convey the land to the Commonwealth. That is the principle which I say is wrong. </para>

                    GOULD (New South Wales) &#91;4.58&#93;. - There is nothing very serious in making such an amendment as has been suggested. It is not necessary that the Minister should think it over. The clause provides that a lessee for life shall not be entitled to convey the whole of his estate away. What we need to do is to insert in addition the words &#34; tenant for life.&#34; A tenant for life virtually, has the same estate as a lessee for life. But still he is not a lessee for life. It is1 just as easy to ascertain who is entitled to the reversion of an estate held by a tenant for life as who is entitled in the case of a lesseeship for life. There is a distinction between the two. A man lets property to A.B. for life, with the remainder to CD. In another case he leases property to A.B. for the remainder pf his life, which is a different thing from making him a tenant for life. I think the Minister ran readily agree to the insertion of wards such as have been suggested.

                        <para>- I am contending that there should be no doubt about it. I understand that the Government want to be in a position to secure the conveyance of property with a minimum of trouble. There is no more trouble about getting a conveyance from the owner of the land where it is in the occupation of a tenant for life than in the case of the occupancy by a lessee for life. I do not think there is much need to be apprehensive as. to persons other than those enumerated. </para>

The Government could always protect themselves by resuming the land, and obtaining possession in that way. With the amendment suggested,&#34; and provision made as to how the purchase money or compensation shall be paid, the clause will, I think, amply protect every interest.

This clause enables the Commonwealth to pay the money to the person who is empowered to sell and convey the land, and clause II deals with the application of purchase money, when it is paid to a person having a partial interest. I have <inline font-style="italic">-no</inline> objection to both clauses being postponed.

                        <para>- In the case of Melbourne, those who first surveyed the city showed very wise foresight in dedicating large reserves for public purposes. I suppose there are few cities in the world the inhabitants of which have such reason to be thankful in this respect, and in all the cities of the Commonwealth there are reserves of one kind and another. In Hobart and in Launceston, the chief city of the north of Tasmania, there are reserves on the maintenance and beautifying of which public money is spent year after year, and which are regarded by the people with as much, if not more, jealous care than is their own private property. </para>

                        <para>- That is so; and they have ho objection to the Commonwealth Government acquiring all the land that is necessary for Federal purposes. It may be considered only wise, however, to have some little restriction in regard to lands which are now dedicated to public purposes. There is a disposition, on the part of military officers,, at any rate, to disregard the rights of the people - to proceed in time of peace much as they would in time of war. My desire is to put a brake on the ardour of those gentlemen, and to give them to understand that there are public rights which even the Commonwealth ought to respect. It is all very well for the Minister of Defence to say that the Department would never endeavour to obtain a piece of a recreation reserve unless the land was absolutely necessary. </para>

I have proposed the term of seven years, but, it it be deemed advisable, I shall have no objection to an alteration in that regard.

                    GOULD (New South Wales) &#91;5.14&#93;. - It is assumed by a good many honorable senators that, because the Commonwealth Parliament has control of the Defence and other great Departments, there should be the fullest possible means of acquiring lands which may be deemed necessary. We may concede all that; but I should like to quote the case of Sydney as an illustration affording some light on the other side. In. Sydney there is the Centennial Park, which for many years has been dedicated to public recreation, and is used and highly appreciated by thousands of people. The Defence Department might consider that a portion of the Centennial Park would be very convenient as a drill ground, or as a site for drill sheds.

                        <para>.- Considerable sums have been spent in making many portions of the Park level ; and it is not quite an impossible contingency that the Commonwealth Government may desire to acquire a portion of it for defence purposes. If the State Parliament were opposed to any alienation, the Commonwealth Government could, under the provisions of this Bill, declare their intention to take the land, and to run the risk of any trouble that might subsequently arise in the Commonwealth Parliament. In the Commonwealth Parliament there are members who represent States far removed from New South Wales, and who are not seized, as members from that particular State are, with the importance of this Park ito the public. &#39; Under such circumstances, the Government might, under the protection of Parliament, do an act which would really be ruthless to an individual State, and by that means a conflict might be brought about between the State and the Federal authorities. Let us take another joint of view, and ask ourselves whether there is any more reason to believe that a State would object to give up land which was necessary for defence purposes, than that the State would object if the defence were still under its own jurisdiction? </para>

                        <para>- No; each State has a separate Parliament, and if, in the opinion of the majority of members, anything wrong was done, the Government could be brought to book. The Commonwealth Government would not be amenable to the same tribunal as the State Government. The State Government would always be anxious to do everything possible for defence purposes, but they would have very intimate knowledge which might enable them to prevent the acquisition of land by the Commonwealth,, the parting with which might inflict an injury upon the State, which would not be compensated for by the advantage which its acquisition would be to the Commonwealth. For instance, if it were proposed to resume land near Sydney, Melbourne, Hobart, or Adelaide, for defence purposes, it would have to be remembered that it would be necessary not only for the defence of the Commonwealth, but for the defence of the particular city or port, and the acquisition of such land would be a matter of very great moment to the residents of the city concerned, who would probably be in the best position to decide on the wisest course to be adopted. They would be in closer touch with the matter, and under the amendment a means would be afforded to ascertain whether the State Government were willing to permit the acquisition of the land by the Commonwealth without allowing the Commonwealth Government to ride over them roughshod. We have here to deal with States Governments having rights over the Crown lands of the States and a Commonwealth Parliament having power to resume certain of those lands for public purposes. We do not desire to bring about any conflict between the two different authorities. These matters should be dealt with, if possible, in an amicable way. But </para>

                        <para>.- I admit that the Commonwealth authorities might not desire to be so, but their action might be so regarded by the authorities of a State. We should not run that risk. I think that the amendment proposed is, therefore, reasonable, and should be accepted by the Committee. We must assume that a State Executive will be composed of reasonable men, just as we assume that the Commonwealth Executive will be composed of such men. Although the authorities of a State might, in the first instance, be disinclined to permit the resumption of certain lands, if they are shown that the resumption is absolutely necessary, and that there is no other piece of land equally suitable, they will naturally give way; </para>

                        <para>- I am contending that the Executive of a State should receive just as much credit for being reasonable as should the Executive of the Commonwealth, and just as much credit for being interested &#39;in seeing that all that is necessary for public purposes is given effect to. If the Executive of a State is unreasonable, the Commonwealth will continue to hold the supreme power of compulsory acquisition, but I say that we have no right to assume that the authorities of a State will not act reasonably. </para>

                    <para>. - In connexion with this question of the jealousy of the rights of citizens, I think it can safely be said that the Federal Parliament, as at present constituted, is very much more likely to regard the rights of the public than is any of the State Parliaments I have in mind just now. But the amendment really bids for differences between the Federal and States Governments over matters in connexion with which the Federal authority must be supreme. If we accept the amendment we shall be adopting; a principle which I do not think has been adopted in any civilized country - the principle that a section of the people shall have the right to block the interests of the majority. </para>

                        <para>- The Government of a section of the Commonwealth. We must remember that Australia is a Commonwealth composed of independent States. The sovereignty in connexion with certain matters has, by common consent; been handed over to the Commonwealth. This is one of such matters. But so careful were the framers of the Constitution, knowing that there would necessarily, from time to time, arise questions in connexion with which there might be honest and intense differences of opinion, that this Chamber was created, entirely out of accord with the general spirit of representation throughout the States. It was felt that the creation of this Chamber would be a sufficient security, and I think it might reasonably be said that it should be. If the Federal Government, in a fit of thoughtlessness or recklessness, determine to take land, such, for instance, as the Centennial Park land, which, from the point of view of an observer, I have no hesitation in saying should never be taken from the people of Sydney without the very strongest possible justification, I should regard their action as improper. I say that as a representative of another State, and I should be prepared to say it in this Chamber if I were present when the Government proposed to take it, if it did not appear to be justified by the strongest possible reasons. </para>

                        <para>- Or the Botanical Gardens at Brisbane or at Melbourne, or in any other city in the Commonwealth. It is true that the matter would be dealt with ultimately by persons, the majority of whom had not that special interest which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> conceives might exist in connexion with certain proposals. But they .would all have interests of a similar character, and they would know that if they established a precedent by taking land of that kind recklessly, and without sufficient reason, it might be brought home to themselves immediately. They would feel the necessity of creating security against evil doing in this connexion, and&#39; that would make members of this Parliament as careful to see that a correct principle was followed in connexion with the acquisition of lands from another State, as they would be in connexion with the acquisition of lands from their own State. Even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> admits that in the ultimate the supreme power in this connexion must rest with the Commonwealth. But the honorable and learned senator suggested the adoption of the highly inconvenient method of passing a special Act of the Federal Parliament after a dispute between the Commonwealth and a State has arisen. It. would be very difficult to carry such an Act in the face of strong excitement. </para>

                        <para>- They did it, but whether it was justified or not is another matter. It requires no very great effort to imagine conditions under which an extremely important and urgent measure of public interest might have to run the gauntlet of vigorous stone-walling in both Houses of this Parliament. I am pointing out that these are risks which we ought not to take. The risk of injury being done to a State is very remote indeed, though it may be sand that what is possible will sometimes happen. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> has said that, it is highly improbable that a State would resist the adoption of a reasonable course by the Commonwealth. But it is much more probable that the Parliament of a State, feeling that their direct, immediate, and1 cherished interests were being threatened, might determine to be unreasonable, than that the Commonwealth Parliament, without long prejudice to influence them in. connexion with the matter, would do what was unreasonable in the acquisition df land in the public interest. </para>

                        <para>- No. T0 start with, I think that the Commonwealth could not acquire a property about which there was such a strong feeling without some delay, and without a protest from those who conceived themselves to be injured. This Parliament, constituted as it is, will afford them an ample opportunity of presenting their case with the fullest knowledge. My experience of Parliaments is that if they err at all they are more likely to err on the side of consideration for sentiment, for love of fair play, &#39; although it is possible sometimes, in the desire not to do anything harsh or unfair, to prejudice an important interest. But in the main, Parliament is more likely to err in that direction than in the direction of undue or hasty action. </para>

                        <para>- We have no right to assume that Parliament will ever get worse than it is, because the experience of the world is that it is getting more humane and more kindly as it gets older and better educated, which, perhaps, is the greatest factor of all in inducing reasonableness. The important consideration is that all civilized countries lay down the principle, as I think properly, and necessarily, that there may come a stage when the most cherished interest of the individual must give way to the interest of the whole community. Here we have a community of States, and while it is our duty, and I believe it will be our pleasure at all times, to give the greatest possible consideration to any unit, there mav come a. time when it will be necessary, in the interest of the community, to disregard the sentiment, and possibly, in a degree, the interest of a unit for the sake of the whole people. We must keep that power. To carry the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> would be to give it away temporarily. </para>

                        <para>- It would be quite impossible for the Government to move. There is no authority in a British-speaking community, not even in the Crown itself, to act in opposition to a distinct law. There are prerogatives, both of them being nominal rather than real, but there is no power to act in opposition to a definite Statute. If we were to accept the amendment, we should have to wait, perhaps in the direst emergency, for an Act of Parliament to be passed. I do not think that there is any person more intensely Federal than I am. I believe that the accomplishment of Federation was a great event. I feel that in our every act and utterance, we should always endeavour to keep in view that Federal sentiment. If it were possible to take all the powers that are necessary, without in the slightest degree expressing in our legislation a sentiment which was un-Federal, I should be glad to do so. But if there are any who consider it un-Federal for the &#34;Parliament to take the strongest possible measures for national purposes, for the aggrandisement, or the protection, or the development of the whole Commonwealth, then I am afrai&#39;d that in the interest of good government and perfect security, we must outrage their Federal spirit. I venture to suggest, however, that they start with an extremely un-Federal sentiment. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith,</inline>
                    in a general Bill of this character, this Parliament has the right to take powers which might be used to the great detriment of an individual State. If we get to a position when we want to use powers to the detriment of an individual State, it ought to be done, after receiving the fullest possible consideration, and under the authority of special legislation.

                        <para>.- That is a position which a Government is entitled to take up. It is not reasonable, however, that the Government, upon the recommendation of the Military Department, should be able to take land for their purposes, against the interests of a State, unless it were shown to be absolutely necessary to do so for the protection of the whole community. We are told that this Parliament would act fairly and reasonably. I believe that it would as far as it possibly could, but there might be a large number of honorable senators who would not have that intimate knowledge of the circumstances which would enable them to exercise so sound a judgment as could a man representing the State concerned. I can very well imagine a case where a Minister might say, &#34;We have received this recommendation from our military advisers - I am going to carry it out whether you like it or&#39; not.&#34; And when the matter cam-e before the Senate, a great many honorable senators might say, &#34; We have confidence in the Government ; we believe that this act was done honestly, and in. the best interest of the community. Perhaps it was rather a serious step to take, but, nevertheless, we intend to validate their act.&#34; The case of Sydney has been cited, but let me put the case of Hobart. What special knowledge would the representatives of Western Australia, or Queensland have in regard to the value of a place of recreation for Hobart? </para>

The people of Hobart can acquire some other land for the purposes of a recreation ground.&#34; The ground might have been in their possession for a long while. It  misfit  have been endeared to their memories, and eminently, suitable for purposes of recreation : and not far away there might be other land which would have been just as suitable for military purposes.

                        <para>.- The State Parliament had power to deal with the Ministers, and if it did not exercise its power, the assumption is that a majority of its members thought that the resumption of the land was reasonable. Suppose that the Government of the Commonwealth thought fit to take a large area of this land for military purposes exclusively, when there. was in the neighbourhood abundance of land which would suit just as well. Would that be a fair proceeding? Would it not be entirely to the injury and detriment of the people of Adelaide? </para>

                        <para>-If you can show to a State, from the reports of military officers, that a particular piece of land ought to be resumed for military purposes, it will undoubtedly be granted. If the State itself had the control of the Military Forces within its own borders, it would adopt the same course. The position is that here we have one Parliament endowed with certain wide powers, and other Parliaments enjoying, what are termed sovereign rights. We therefore have to be very careful that we do not trench upon the powers of the States, just as we are careful that the States do not trench on our powers. I do not think that any case can be quoted where the relative powers of two authorities are such as those possessed by the Commonwealth and States Governments in Australia. We have to be careful in laying down lines for our legislation to avoid a conflict between the Commonwealth and the States. </para>

The amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> will tend to prevent friction, because it recognises the great rights and interests of the States, and will compel the Commonwealth Government to do everything possible to come to an agreement. Of course, if it is found that a State is unreasonable, and that the Commonwealth must have a piece of land for public purposes, the Federal Parliament can step in and take it. </para>

                        <para>- We must have a reserve power for compulsory acquisition in respect of all land, whether belonging to an individual or to a State, or whether controlled by a Government, a municipality, or any other body. One reason which I think will appeal to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> is that, if we have what may be termed a divided authority, it will be considerably to the disadvantage of the Commonwealth. We will assume the case of a park which has been dedicated to the public for recreation purposes. Suppose that the Commonwealth desires to acquire a portion of that land. Under existing circumstances, the Government would go to the persons who hold the title to the land, and negotiate with them for its acquisition. If the negotiation failed, we could exercise our compulsory powers. But if this amendment were carried the Commonwealth would have to go, in the first instance, to the State Government. The State Government would naturally consult the local governing, body, or other1 authority, in which the land was vested. That authority would not unnaturally be inclined to say, &#34; We have no power to part with this land ; if you like, as a State Government, you can do it &#34; ; or the controlling authority might say that it was absolutely disinclined to dispose of any portion of the property. Then the State Government would be left in a most unenviable position. On the one hand, it would have the Commonwealth Government saying that it must have this land for public purposes, and on the other hand, it would have a local authority in conformity with a not uninfluential body of public opinion influencing it in an entirely different direction. Any State Government would rather that the local municipal council, or other body in whom the land was vested, should take the responsibility.

                        <para>- If we set up a divided authority we shall find that the Commonwealth will be unable in very many instances to come to a satisfactory arrangement with regard to the acquisition of land. Naturally a State Government will not like to run counter to the express wish of a local governing authority controlling land which has been dedicated for public recreation purposes. I do not for a moment wish it to be supposed that it would be the desire of the Commonwealth Government to resume dedicated land for public purposes whenever it was at all possible to obtain other land that was equally suitable. There exists in all the States of Australia a very strong respect for the rights of the citizens in the enjoyment of public lands. Naturally a Government would not desire to run counter to that feeling. On the contrary, the desire of Governments has always been, so far as I am aware, to try to avoid taking land of this character for public purposes. It will be remembered, for instance, that some years ago it was suggested in Sydney that a portion of Hyde Park should be appropriated for a railway station. Honorable senators probably recollect that the very suggestion evoked a storm of opposition. I doubt very much if such a course was ever seriously contemplated bv any Government, or if it were, would be persevered with. The general spirit in every State of Australia is directly in favour of preserving such lands for the people. That is the feeling that I believe will always exist in this community, and every Government, Common wealth or State, will be bound to pay the utmost respect to it. </para>

If an amendment of this description were carried, it would be the duty of the Government to drop the Bill, especially if there was any danger of its adoption in another place, seeing that all the authority that is required is provided in existing legislation. It has already been explained many times that the object of the Bill is to obviate the necessity of resor ting in every instance to compulsory measures ; and the Government always have the opportunity to negotiate with the States. Only when a State and the Commonwealth could not come to terms, would it be necessary, under the Bill, to put the compulsory provisions into operation. </para>

                        <para>- Of course, the matter would not be referred to the State Parliament if the State agreed to the transfer ; but such a reference might have to be made. In negotiations between a State and the Commonwealth in regard to land, on which there are certain reservations, an arrangement might be arrived . at by which the citizens could retain all the rights they possess at the present time; but if the Commonwealth were forced into compulsory acquisition no rights of the kind could be retained. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> doubtless thinks he is protecting the rights of the people; and he is, I feel, acting ir. good faith. The honorable senator, however, appears to have a fear in his mind that something may happen; but I am sure that under the Bill- nothing could occur which would prove objectionable to the people of Australia. Indeed, the people would not tolerate any transfers of an objectionable character: and, therefore, nothing could happen that would be detrimental to the interests of the community. Many honorable senators have contended that State interests ought to &#39;be paramount ; and so they are, in reference to the State Parliament and the State Government; nevertheless, the interests of one State might not be the interests of the whole Commonwealth. We know the bitterness that arose between the States and the central authority in the &#34;United States at the time of the Civil War : and I ask whether (here is an\&#39; guarantee that similar bitterness mav not arise in Australia? Under such circumstances a provision such as that proposed bv <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> would have no effect. The Bill presents every opportunity for negotiations; and we ought to reserve to the Commonwealth the ultimate power to compulsorily acquire land. </para>

Any sensible man will agree that the public lands should be devoted to the most important purposes; and it- must not be forgotten that, in any case, the land is not taken away from the people, though it may be turned to a different use. There ought to be some predominant authority, and the Constitution provides that wherever the States laws and the Commonwealth laws come into conflict the latter shall prevail. All this is provided for in the Bill, and the amendment is altogether wrong, seeing that it provides that the law of a State shall prevail. </para>

                    <para>. - I cannot follow the argument of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie. If I were a member of a State Parliament, and this question arose, I should oppose, just as strongly as I do now, any proposal to resume reserves which have been dedicated to the public for the purposes of recreation and amusement. We in Australia have left very little land for the benefit of the public generally, and there is a strong feeling against using for speculative purposes any land that has been dedicated to the use of the community. </para>

It was proposed a few years ago to enlarge the cricketing oval, and a special Bill was introduced into the State Parliament for the purpose. The House of Assembly voted against a proposal to add a few acres to the oval, as did also the Legislative Council, but then a Governor&#39;s message was sent down - a course which is almost unprecedented, even in the House of Commons - and in the last days of the session an amendment recommended in the Governor&#39;s message was rushed through Parliament for the purpose of adding four acres to the area of the oval. </para>

                        <para>- This amendment necessarily implies that. It means that the Commonwealth Government cannot be trusted with the power of resuming land dedicated for purposes of recreation without the consent of a State Government. Under the &#39;Constitution we have the power absolutely to resume any land if the public rights and interests demand that we should do so. The only justification for our resumption of land&#39; in which public rights already exist would be that the greater public rights and interests of the Commonwealth demanded such resumption. </para>

I contend that we are just as capable judges of the public rights and interests as are the authorities of the States, and we should only exercise our powers in this connexion where the greater public rights and interests of the Commonwealth demand its exercise. The amendment would not achieve all that the honorable senator who has moved it desires. It reads - </para>

                <para class="block">I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> that surrounding Melbourne there are many beautiful reserves dedicated to the public for recreation purposes, but in many cases they are not Crown lands. Some are vested in municipalities, others in municipalities in conjunction with the Board of Land and Works, and others again in trustees. As the amendment stands, it would affect but a limited number of the areas reserved in Victoria for recreation - purposes, and if it is to achieve what the honorable senator has in his mind, it must be substantially altered. I would seriously urge honorable senators not to limit the powers of the Commonwealth in the way proposed. Our present law provides for unqualified1 resumption, and the principles embodied in our present law, and proposed to be embodied in this Bill, Have been in force throughout the British Dominions for something like 100 years. In the circumstances, it is very late now to bring about a limitation of the power of the Crown to resume lands in the public interest. </para>

                            is aware that in most cases that remedy would le found1 to be impracticable, and certainly by the time a measure would be passed the urgency of the action proposed might have passed away. The arguments which have been used by
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline>
                            are destructive of the position he took up, because he showed that a State Parliament, which he desires should be arbiter in these matters, had abused its powers in a most unwarrantable manner. The Federal Parliament has possessed&#34; this power for some years&#39;, and the honorable senator brought forward no case in which there has been any abuse. Yet he proposes to transfer the power from this Parliament to the States Parliaments, which he says have repeatedly abused it. I remind honorable senators that the Commonwealth has only three Departments which are likely to require land for public purposes, whilst in the States there are many Government Departments requiring land. The States Governments are therefore verv much more likely to trench upon the; rights of private citizens than is the Commonwealth Government. The obligation to defend the Commonwealth is thrown upon the Federal Parliament, and in carrying out that obligation it may become necessary that we should take land which, in the opinion of people in the particular locality, might be usefully devoted to other purposes. The people of Australia have imposed upon us the obligation of carrying out the defence of the Commonwealth, and in doing so our power should not come in conflict with that of a local authority in connexion Avith the acquisition of a piece of land. The amendment proposes that we should hand over the right to deal with that piece of land to a State Parliament, which has no obligation or responsibility in connexion with the defence of the Commonwealth. It is clear that the position taken up by
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline>
                            is untenable, and I am surprised that any honorable senators should in this matter propose to put the States Parliament in a position superior to that of the Federal Parliament.

Local influences might have considerable weight with a State Government, and whilst they might recognise the necessity for the acquisition bv the Commonwealth of a certain piece of land, they might be loth to give their consent lest by doing so they should come into conflict with local interests. In some instances the States Governments delegate their powers, as in the management of railways, to Commissioners. I am not sure, but I believe that in such cases the Commissioners are given control over the lands on which the railways are constructed. </para>

                        <para>- I know of another case of the kind at Fremantle. The Railways Commissioner was in possession of certain tend eminently suitable for a Customs House, and though the land might not actually be put to any use, if the State Government in such a case were applied to. they would refer the Federal Government to the Railways Commissioner. He would look at the Question from the point of view of the manager of the railways, and though, the land might be required for purposes of defence, he would consider the possibility qf its being required for railway purposes, probably at some far-distant time. Honorable senators must see that ultimately in these instances the States Governments would not have the settlement of the question at all. All these objections can be urged to the amendment, and surely in this matter the Federal Parliament can be trusted to see that no injustice, which can be avoided, is done to local interests. </para>

                <para class="block">Throughout the .debate, which has been very interesting to me, there seems to have been in the minds of some honorable senators a disproportion as to what the full effect of my proposal is. Under the Constitution, the Commonwealth Parliament has absolute power to acquire all the land which it may deem necessary for the purpose of carrying on the various Departments which have been handed over from the States. </para>

                        <para>- We are now providing the machinery for the exercise of that power. Surely it is within our right not to stop the Commonwealth from acquiring certain lands, because that could not be done, but to restrain its action to some extent, and make it difficult to acquire lands which are used for public purposes, and which we are all agreed it is desirable should not be interfered with without strong reason. The reason why I spoke of a disproportion in the minds of some honorable senators is that the Commonwealth is taking power to acquire any portion of a .huge territory of, I understand, about 3,000,000 square miles. What are we seeking to reserve from the operation of the Bill ? Comparatively speaking, a few acres. We are only trying to reserve lands which are used particularly for the purposes of recreation and public health. Unfortunately, in a great many Australian cities, when land was plentiful enough, there was an absence of foresight, and public reserves were rather too limited in area. That in itself is, I think, sufficient justification for trying to safeguard such areas as have been reserved. It is utterly wrong to suggest that we are in any way showing a want of confidence in the present or any future Government. There is no such idea in our mind. In the immense territory of the Commonwealth, it will be necessary, from time to time, to deal with locations of which, possibly, even the representatives of the State concerned may know nothing. </para>

                        <para>- From time to time the Commonwealth Government will have to deal with the acquisition of certain areas in distant places, of which they will have no personal knowledge. In view of our immense territory, it is quite possible that even the representatives of the States concerned may have no knowledge of these locations, and in all good faith the Minister will accept the report of one of his officers, as being the best possible authority whom he can get to advise him. It is in regard to the acquisition of land for defence purposes that I particularly fear that, from time to time, some trespass may be made upon the public domain which is not really necessary. Very frequently there is a disposition on the part of Defence officers to try to suit their own convenience, and in doing that they may commit a very grievous public wrong. It must be borne in mind that all the time we shall have the power to acquire any land which may be needed. The only objection is that if the amendment were accepted, it might delay the acquisition of a certain piece of land. It might be that the Commonwealth would not be able to arrange by agreement for the acquisition of the land, and in every such case the Commonwealth Parliament would have the right to assert its power. </para>

                        <para>- I know that there is a tendency on the part of not only trustees, but everybody else, not to part with their land too readily, and to make the best bargain they can. In this case the application of the restriction would be comparatively limited. It would merely postpone for a time the acquisition of a piece of land. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> has reminded the Committee that if land is required for any emergent purpose of defence, it can be obtained by him immediately. But we are now dealing with a measure for the permanent acquisition of land. I believe that the amendment, if adopted, would do no harm, and that in many cases it would prevent the Departments from taking land which ought not to be taken. </para>

                    <para>- Certainly, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> has limited the scope of his amendment, but I do not think that he has improved it. Under the previous amendment, State land could not betaken otherwise than by agreement with the State, but the amendment as altered says that it cannot be taken otherwise than by agreement. With whom the agreement is to be made is not stated. </para>

                        <para>- If the agreement is not to be made with the State Government, then the honorable senator is seeking to bring, in irresponsible bodies, and the Commonwealth would have to make an agreement with perhaps a racing club or a cricket club. Questions of national moment would have to be determined by an agreement between a cricket or football club and the Commonwealth Government. That would reduce our obligation to an absurdity, and it is the only construction which can be put on the amendment. I wish to see the agreement made with the State, but the honorable senator has omitted the words &#34;with a State,&#34; and used the vague term &#34; by agreement.&#34; In the circumstances, one can imagine what would happen if the amendment were carried. 1 am sure that it will not be accepted in its present form. </para>

                        <para>- Of course I did. I voted against the proposition because I am a believer in the doctrine of responsible government. It is not a correct representation of the case for the honorable senator to say that if the amendment Were carried, it would necessarily deprive the Parliament of any power which it now enjoys under the Constitution. It would still have that power to exercise whenever it liked. It could authorize the resumption of land, whether the amendment were carried or not. So far as final power was concerned, it would be in exactly the same position as if the Bill were passed in its entirety. The objection which I take to the the proposal is this. It will be within the memory of honorable senators that when, the second reading debate was in progress it was urged with considerable force, and at some length, by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> that it would have been very much better to make this a Bill simply providing machinery for the resumption of land for public purposes, but not giving the power to resume. He urged that the resumption power should be exercised in each particular case by means of a special Bill. I should have been very pleased if the Minister had seen fit to adopt that suggestion, and to recast the measure, bringing down a proposal containing machinery -clauses only. When an act of resumption became necessary in any particular case a special Bill could have been introduced. But that suggestion has not been accepted. I understand that the Government does not &#34;intend to adopt it. Apparently the Senate -does not desire it, because it was not supported, except by a few honorable senators -on this side of the chamber. Therefore, having in one Bill both machinery for the resumption of land and power for resuming it, and the Senate having adopted the &#62;two principles by clauses which have been passed, it seems to me that it would not &#34;be wise to make a special exception in one particular case. And that is what we are mow asked to do. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> asks us to provide that when it is desired to resume a portion of a public reserve a special Act of Parliament shall be passed. That is my objection to his amendment. I &#34;believe that we are making a mistake in having the machinery and the powers provided for in one measure. But the Committee having accepted the proposal of the Government in this respect, it seems to me that we should be inconsistent in adopting an amendment which would differentiate between lands held by trustees - it mav be the trustees of a cricket club or a national park - and lands held by any one else, or for any other purpose. If there is to be any difference at all in our treatment of -owners of land, that difference ought to be with respect to Crown land and the land of individuals. But we do not propose to -differentiate between the States and private owners. If we are going to treat a State </para>

                <para class="block">Government as we treat a private owner, there is no reason why we should make a difference with respect to trustees. If the amendment were on solid ground at all, it would provide that all States land should be dealt with by a separate measure. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> proposes to allow the Commonwealth to take any portion of the lands of a State. He accepts the principle that there should be no exception in that respect. But now he seeks to make an exception in the case of lands controlled by trustees for public purposes. It seems to me to be somewhat like straining at a gnat and swallowing a camel to give power to the Commonwealth to resume States land, and at the same time refuse power to the Commonwealth to take a cricket pitch. </para>

                        <para>- If the Commonwealth Government has power to take all the Crown land which it requires from New South Wales, why say that it shall not have the power to take an acre of the National Park? It seems to me that, having accepted the principle that machinery and power to resume should be included in the one measure, and having further agreed to give the Commonwealth Government full power to resume States lands, there is no logic in saying that the Commonwealth Government shall not have a similar power to take lands controlled by local bodies. For that reason I shall vote against the amendment. </para>

                    GOULD (New South Wales) &#91;8.6J. - It seems to me that
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline>
                    has failed to realize the difference between &#34;the lands -which are ordinarily denominated Crown lands and lands which are dedicated for a specific and special purpose in the interests of the people of a State. There is an immense difference, to my mind. While it is perfectly true that in this Bill we contemplate allowing the Commonwealth Government to resume, by compulsory appropriation, any Crown land that it sees fit, yet we know that the bulk of the Crown lands in every State are what are known as waste lands. That is to say, they are lands that are not being used for any specific purpose. This amendment is only intended to meet a case in which a State has set apart specific lands for the purpose of recreation or health for the benefit of the people of a State. I cannot, for the life of me, see why the views expressed by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline>
                    in the early portion of his speech, should have caused so much disturbance in &#34;the mind of
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline>
                    considering that he now tells us that he proposes to vote against the amendment. I contend that the case in favour of
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy&#39;s</inline>
                    amendment is a very strong one. I admit at once that some difficulty may arise in connexion with the wording of the amendment. It is certainly open to exception as to the party with whom the Commonwealth is to make an agreement. Has the agreement to be made, say, with the trustees of a cricket pitch? Has the Commonwealth Government to say to the trustees, &#34; We should like this land, and we know that we cannot obtain it without your consent?&#34;

It can say to the private owner, &#34; We covet this vineyard of yours ; cannot we make some arrangement about it ?&#34; The owner may say, &#34; I am not going to part with it.&#34; Then the Commonwealth Government can say, &#34; It does not matter whether you like to part with&#39; it or not, we are going to take it, and if we cannot get it by arrangement, we will take it compulsorily.&#34; I do not want the Government to be put in that position in negotiating for the acquisition of land which has been dedicated for public purposes. I think that it would be a fair thing to say in the amendment that nothing in the Bill shall authorize the acquisition by the Commonwealth otherwise than with the consent of the State, of any land which has been dedicated or reserved. </para>

                        <para>.- Yes; in certain extreme cases. Take a case in point. I believe that . the Defence Department is very anxious to obtain a range for artillery practice. It will require, probably, six or eight miles . of country to make the range safe. If a stretch of eight miles, together with a. proportionate width, were taken out of the National. Park, Sydney, it would deprive the public of an enormous slice of that territory. But we know that there is a great quantity of Crown land - it may be a little further away - which it might be more convenient for the people of New South Wales that the Commonwealth Government should acquire. I do not assume that the Commonwealth Government wishes to do anything that is unreasonable, but, at the same time, I do not propose to rut it in the power of the Government to take land which it is undesirable it should take, having, in view the interests of a State. I consider it to be wise to safeguard those interests as far as we can, having due regard to the welfare of the. Commonwealth as a whole. I trust that the Committee will see that there is some merit in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy&#39;s</inline> amendment, and will vote for it. If objection is taken to the drafting, it will be a very simple matter to recommit the clause afterwards, in order to put it into proper form. Personally, I think that the terms of the amendment are open to objection. But the principle is sound, and if a little consideration were given to it bv the Parliamentary draftsman, he would be able to put it into proper shane. I ask honorable senators not to be led away by objections to the wording of the amendment, but to&#62; regard it as a matter of principle bv means of which we can safeguard States interests- and prevent any possibility of friction and collision occurring between the States and the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- I have no hesitation in saying that Parliament would not submit to the cherished sentiments of any of the States being needlessly outraged. There is no danger whatever of public reserves being taken away by the Commonwealth, unless, under some peculiar circumstances, they are proved to be an absolute necessity in the public interest. Whenever those peculiar circumstances do arise, the interests of the particular locality must take second place. If we carry this amendment we shall certainly entail on Parliament the necessity of carrying, not one, but innumerable Acts of Parliament for the acquisition of public property. </para>

As a matter of fact, in every session of every Parliament of which we have any knowledge, many measures, admitted to be of importance, have to be deferred owing to want of time ; and yet this amendment proposes to burden Parliament with the consideration of innumerable Bills for the acquisition of land. </para>

                        <para>- I spoke of Parliament, which has the control of the Executive. Although the Senate has not the control of the Executive, in the sense that we can displace the latter, we have considerable control, which gives the States, as States, greater power than their numerical strength would warrant. Our duty is to see that no Act of Parliament prejudices the interests of the States. This Chamber was created as the bulwark of States interests and rights, and therefore we ought not to pass this amendment, which, if it were carried, would outrage the Constitution. Subject to the conditions being just, the Constitution provides that the Commonwealth may acquire land for public purposes; and this amendment proposes that, by our own act, we shall restrict our powers. The amendment is extremely unwise in itself, and it is injudicious from the point of view that it creates more legislation! for Parliament, which already has little enough time for its own work. </para>

                    <para>. - I desire to say only a few words, because I spoke on the original amendment, the principle of which is practically the same as that of the proposal now before us. The amendment which the honorable senator has now submitted really carries him no further, except in a limited number of cases. No doubt this is the more comprehensive amendment; and the intention of the honorable senator now is that there shall be a direct dealing with trustees or other owners of parks or reserves dedicated to public purposes, and an agreement entered into with them. Taking Victoria as an illustration, I may say that the Crown grants of the various reserves are dedicated, in some cases, to the municipalities, and in others to municipalities and the Board of Land and Works, while lands have also been acquired by purchase or gift. The powers of the trustees are contained for the most part within the four corners of the grant, though, in other cases, they are assisted to some extent by Act of Parliament. But I do not suppose there is a grant in existence in Victoria of public lands for recreation purposes which permits the trustees to enter into any such agreement as is proposed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson.</inline> - With the consent of the State. </para>

But surely the Bill would give the Commonwealth power to take the land; and, to that extent, would empower the trustees to make an agreement? </para>

                        <para>- That clause does not affect the amendment, but simply provides that the Governor of a State may enter into agreement with the Governor-General with regard to the grant of Crown land. As I say, it is proposed to put a distinct limit on our powers. If the amendment be carried, there will be no power for the compulsory resumption of recreation reserves. We have now to see what power there would be to make an agreement for handing over a recreation reserve to the Commonwealth Government. As a matter of fact, any power would be within the four corners of the Crown grant, or, at most, there might be some assisting power in the Land Act of the particular State. But there would be no power which would permit what is proposed; and, consequently, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> will see that by carrying his amendment, he would not be one small step forward1 towards the object he has in view. Of course, it is unfair to apply destructive criticism to a rapidly-conceived amendment. All we can do in fairness to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> is to suggest that if we desire to vote on the principle we might do so in reference to some preliminary words, and not on the actual amendment itself. The result of the vote could then be taken as an instruction to the Ministry to see that the intention of the majority of honorable senators was expressed in proper verbiage, and the necessary machinery provided for carrying it into effect. </para>

                    <para>.- I think I liked best the amendment first submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> ; but, as has been suggested, if we agree as to the principle, there should be no difficulty in putting the amendment into the right shape. We should never &#39;forget that it is impossible for this Parliament to divest itself of any power conferred on it by the Constitution ; and I look on this proposal as in the nature of a self-denying ordinance. Presuming the amendment to be carried, the Commonwealth Executive will have no power to acquire lands that have been dedicated to the public for health or recreation except by agreement. This is not a matter, as some honorable senators seem to think, of a conflict between the Commonwealth powers and the States powers; it is npt a case in which the Commonwealth seeks to take certain powers in order to diminish the powers of the States, or <inline font-style="italic">vice versa.</inline> The power of a State is derived from its Constitution, and will not be altered by any action we may take. Under the State </para>

                <para class="block">Constitution, a State Government has power to resume any land dedicated to the use of the public. In the case of ordinary reserves, it has the power to do that by Executive action. In other cases, and even in the case of private property, it exercises that power under an Act of Parliament. In one way or another a State Government has always the power to resume lands in the State dedicated for public purposes. Our Constitution gives us the same right, and the proposal now made is that, until this measure is repealed by this Parliament, we shall not authorize, the Commonwealth Executive to resume such, land. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. The power always remains in this Parliament to act up to the limit defined by the Constitution, but what is proposed is that we shall say that until this measure is repealed we will not authorize the Executive of the Commonwealth to resume land dedicated to the public for purposes of health and recreation. The reason why I am inclined to favour that is that in the State of Queensland - and I suppose the same thing holds good in other States - there has been a continual tendency to appropriate these reserves. We have one reserve - Victoria Park, close to Brisbane - which has been pecked at all round. </para>

                        <para>- It is not a question of giving to or withholding from the States any power whatever. No matter what we do, we shall leave the States, in this connexion, exactly im the same position, and they will be able under their Constitutions to resume the whole or any portion of these parks for their own purposes. I am desirous that we shall not give the Commonwealth Government the power to do the same thing. If we do it will lead to the quicker resumption of these lands, because, if the Commonwealth Government takes a portion of a public reserve for public purposes, the State Government will be encouraged to do the same thing. They will say, &#34; If the Commonwealth Government can take five acres of our park for one purpose, why should we not take ten acres for some other purpose ?&#34; - By agreeing to the amendment we shall be protecting lands dedicated to the public by putting two bars instead of one in the way of their resumption. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> proposes that, if the &#39;Commonwealth requires a piece of land that has been dedicated, they must ask the State Government to resume it for them. They must make terms with the State for it. If the State Government is not agreeable, and the resumption of the land is absolutely necessary, the Commonwealth Government is then thrown back upon the powers vested in it under the Constitution. </para>

                        <para>- The last amendment speaks of an agreement being made with trustees. It is suggested that, if the land is held by trustees, it mav be necessary that an agreement should be made with them. That, I think, would be almost impossible. I feel somewhat strongly on this question of the preservation of public reserves, because I have known them to be encroached upon to such an extent that I should be prepared to support almost any provision which would throw additional difficulties in the way. I think it was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> who referred to the advantage which it might be to the Commonwealth to be able to resume these lands for defence purposes. Surely section 69 of the Defence Act is sufficient in the circumstances. It provides that - </para>

                        <para>- I do not see what other question there is. A State Government undoubtedly has power under the State Constitution to resume any land, even though it should be in private hands. I should be inclined to think that the only purpose we might seriously consider to-night is the acquisition of land for rifle ranges. I think that the interest of the public to whom these spaces have been dedicated should be the first consideration. I am strongly of the opinion that in these matters the State Government should be assumed to know more than does the Commonwealth Government about the requirements of the public and the desirability of resuming public land in any particular place. The Minister of Defence is aware that a little time ago in Queensland some question arose with regard to the resumption of land for a rifle range, and there were conflicting interests connected with the proposal. - </para>

                        <para>- I am supporting the amendment, because my experience justifies me in saving that it would. My experience in Queensland has been that whenever a piece of land has been required for any purpose, public or private, it has almost invariably been sought for in a public reserve. I believe that the same course is likely to be followed by the Commonwealth Government unless this Parliament speaks out clearly on the subject. I believe that these reserves should foe held sacred because they have been established for the purpose of conserving the health of the people. As our population increases out cities) will grow, and the necessity for these reserves will every year become greater. If the Commonwealth requires a piece of land for any specific purpose, in nine cases out of ten it will be easier for us to find suitable land that is not a reserve than it will be for the local community to find another reserve, or to part with a portion of any of their existing! reserves. The only Commonwealth Department which I think might be compel led to encroach seriously on these reserves is the Defence Department. I do not think there will be the slightest difficulty in finding suitable areas of land for the Customs and Post and Telegraph Departments without touching any of these reserves. If the Commonwealth Government can make out a clear case for the resumption of any reserve, or portion of a reserve, for defence purposes, I am sure that no State will stand in the way. I look upon the amendment .as a sort of hurdle, over which the Commonwealth Executive must jump before it can take any of these reserves. I trust that the Committee will approve of the principle embodied in the amendment. </para>

                        <para>- In the case which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> put, he reiterated the fact that the Queensland Government are pillaging as fast as they can the whole of the public lands. He says that that is ample reason why we should go beyond the power granted to us bv the Constitution, and prevent this Parliament, by what he calls an ordinance of sacrifice, from ever taking possession of any of those lands. Be the reason ever so strong, and be the importance of the case ever so great, the Commonwealth, he says, must not lay hands upon such land at any cost. He would allow the State Government to go on taking the land at their own sweet will, and at the same time prevent the Federal Government from using a certain area for a very necessary purpose. I sympathize with every one who wishes to preserve the public lands, and am quite prepared to do everything possible to help in that direction. </para>

                    <para>.- In common with other honorable senators, I should like to see reserves preserved to the people. Those who are in favour of the amendment seem to distrust the Federal authority, while those who are supporting the Bill do not. It has been argued that the State authority would not object if it saw that it was absolutely necessary that a certain area should be acquired bv the Commonwealth. Might we not just as reasonably assume that the Commonwealth authority has sufficient sound judgment not to ask for land unless it be absolutely indispensable ! That is how the matter presents itself to mv mind. Honorable senators are contrasting the Federal and States authorities in point of capacity and honesty. There is no necessity to do anything of that kind. Surely we may trust those whom we have placed in power. According to the amendment, the two parties are to come together, and if the State Government should object to hand over a certain area which the Federal Government desired to acquire, then the matter is to be at an end. Surely we have sufficient confidence in the Federal Government for the time being to trust them not to ask for any portion of a recreation reserve, unless they are fully satisfied upon expert advice that it is absolutely necessary to the welfare of the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>. - I have listened with a good deal of interest and attention to the different speakers. There is one thing to which it seems to me no supporter of the amendment has directed his attention. At the present time we have the power of resuming compulsorily. if necessary any properties such as those which are referred to in the amendment. That power has been in existence ever since the Property for Public Purposes Acquisition Act was passed in 1901. I do not know that a single case has been giver, or even hinted at, where it has been exercised unjustly or abused. Then., again, each State has the absolute right to resume property for public purposes, whether it be dedicated to such uses as those indicated in this amendment or not. The amendment seeks to; differentiate the Commonwealth, as a sovereign power from exercising corresponding rights to those of the States. In other words, although each State can within its own sphere resume property compulsorily for public purposes, whether it be dedicated for the health or recreation of its citizens in any part or not, it is now sought to impose an express statutory limit upon the Commonwealth. I ask honorable senators who support the amendment, why they draw this glaring distinction between the States and the Commonwealth. Not a single reason has been advanced to support the proposal. </para>

                        <para>- My honorable friend knows that the Commonwealth possesses the power to resume these lands compulsorily, and that if we were to exercise the power, all the dedications and reservations applicable to any areas would cease to have any effect. Has that power been abused so far? If a single instance of that kind had been cited, I admit that there might be some_ weight of argument behind the amendment. Or, if there had been advanced a single reason why. we should take up a totally different position from that taken up bv any of the States, there might be some weight behind the argument. But everything points, not to the possibility, but to the probability, remote even in the minds of those who suggest it, that the power might be wantonly used to the prejudice of persons in different parts of the Commonwealth who are at present enjoying the benefit of recreation and health reserves. </para>

Why should there be this change of front on his part? Why should a limitation be sought to be placed upon the Commonwealth when the present Government are in power?

                <para class="block">The object of the amendment is this: In many instances it happens that small interests have to be acquired by a Commonwealth Department. They are of such small consequences that it is like using a steam hammer to crack a nut to bring the powers of this Bill into operation. The question then arises as to the exact line of limitation between a case that should be dealt with directly by the Minister and cases which should be reserved for the Governor-General in Council. Honorable senators will notice that a corresponding provision is proposed to be inserted in a subsequent clause, which will deal with cases where the Minister is letting property of the Commonwealth for a period not exceeding three years, and at a rental of not more than&#163;50. I may, perhaps, best illustrate this class of case by giving an illustration to which the last mentioned provision will apply. There are some instances in which a Commonwealth Department is in occupation of property which it is not actually using. Some person or body in the locality asks whether he or they may be allowed to rent that property. </para>
                <para class="block">A valuation being agreed upon, which sometimes amounts to 5s. or 6s. a week, the applicant is allowed to rent the property for, say, fifteen months or two years. It is obvious that cases like that should not be the subject of action by the Governor-General in Council, but that the Minister should be empowered in all these minor instances to act directly. We, therefore, shall ask for that power for the Minister in cases where he is going to Tease property belonging to the Commonwealth that is not being used for departmental purposes. We now ask that he shall haw a corresponding power in connexion with acquiring lands. It is provided that in such cases the term is not to be longer than three years and the annual rental not more than <inline font-style="italic">&#163;,$o.</inline> If the term is over three years or the annual rent over ^50 the matter has to go through the ordinary procedure. </para>

                    <para>.- Before the amendment is put I should like to draw attention to the fact that the question whether we should have a separate Bill, or a clear division in this Bill, dealing with the acquisition of land from a State, may very properly be considered to arise here. This is the first clause in which I have noticed that the word &#34; owner &#34; is used. The use of that word at once brings before us the question whether we ought not to have a separate Bill dealing with the acquisition of the land of a State. It is my intention to move in that direction ; but as the word &#34; owner &#39; &#39; is here used, and as that word expressedly includes a State, I think it would be appropriate for the Minister to say what he intends to do. While I do not wish to embarrass him in dealing with this measure, I think that even now an attempt should be made to divide it into two parts, even if it is determined to deal with the whole matter in one Bill. We should have one part dealing separately and distinctly with the case of land to be acquired from a State. I cannot help repeating that, in common courtesy, the very least we can do to a State from which we take land is to make it perfectly clear what the provisions of our law are, and that we do not treat a State as an ordinary private individual. I should like the Minister to express his view as to whether he thinks it advisable to divide the Bill into two parts. I should prefer to have two Bills, and T think we ought to have them. But if that cannot be done, we should, at any rate, devote one part of the Bill entirely and exclusively to the acquisition of land from the States. </para>

                    <para>. - Since last Friday the matter mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> has been considered, and it is thought to be inadvisable to depart from the form in which the Bill has been submitted to Parliament. As a matter of fact, the present arrangement of the Bill offers many advantages to the Commonwealth, and imposes no disadvantages upon any State. It is not intended to convey, nor do I think that the Bill would be taken by any State as conveying, any discourtesy. We provide in the definition clause that the word &#34;owner&#34; shall include a State where the State in question happens to be the owner of Crown land. We are, of course, legislating for the right to resume land for public purposes - that as to say, for the purposes of the people of the Commonwealth. In Great Britain, to which reference was made last Thursday, the position is very different. </para>

                        <para>- It was said that the legislation of Great Britain upon this subject was incorporated in more than one measure - that one Act gave authority to resume and another provided1 machines- for resumption. In the case of the people of the Commonwealth, we are indicating power to resume, and, at the same time, we are prescribing the method which shall be adopted in resumption. In Great Britain, on the other hand, the system is mostly applicable to the acquisition of land for the benefit of private persons. Consideration has been given to the suggestion, and it is thought that, in the interests of all concerned, the present form of the Bill is better. </para>

                    <para>. - The Minister&#39;s argument will not suggest itself to those honorable senators who have had parliamentary experience as being very convincing. I never heard of any Bill as to which we did not have the assurance of the Minister in charge that the whole of the drafting talents of the State had been engrossed in its construction, that it was as perfect as it could possibly be, and that nothing could1 be done to improve it. But, as a rule, it is not very long after such declarations are made before we find the Minister himself coming down with amendments, thereby showing that although so much attention has been devoted to the measure nevertheless something else is desirable. We are told that a&#39;fter conferring with some unnamed authorities, the Minister has come to the conclusion that the perfection of form has been reached in this Bill, and that nothing more need be. done except to pass it. But we have already had the Minister proposing an amendment. We have only dealt with fifteen clauses, and we have been engaged upon the measure for less than a week. Yet the Minister, dealing with a Bill red-hot from the hands of the draftsman, comes down with amendments, which really suggest that the mere fact that he and his draftsman have drawn this measure in its present form, and have paid a great deal of attention to it, are not sufficient reasons why we should pass it in this form. I have heard1 no argument against adopting the course suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons,</inline> except that the Minister and his draftsman have come to the decision that this is the best form. There is no man who has had parliamentary experience who has not heard the same argument in. connexion with every Bill upon which he has been engaged. But the Committee is entitled to something more tangible than the assurance that, in the opinion of the Minister, and in the opinion of the draftsman, this is the best possible Bill that human ingenuity can construct. I db not accept that argument. It is part of the stock-in-trade of every Minister in charge of a Bill. The Committee is entitled to a serious reply to the argument of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons.</inline></para>

I myself pointed out that I did not think there was any necessity for the insertion of such words - that in the case of the Federal Capital we should own the territory, whereas, so far an land taken under this Bill was concerned, we should be acquiring an estate or interest in it, as described bv the measure. I suggested for the consideration of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> the difference between an estate or interest which we should acquire in land obtained for ordinary purposes under this Bill, and the territory which we shall hold by virtue of the provisions of the Constitution for the Seat of Government. I think that my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford,</inline> indicated bv way of whisper or suggestion - perhaps bv a verv audible whisper - that the whole difficulty could be overcome by inserting words to that effect. But I do not know that he gave the Senate an assurance that the Government would be agreeable to insert such words. </para>

                        <para>- That is what I understood. The. words were audible to all, though they were intended for me, and should not be taken as an assurance on the part of my colleague, who has had many more years&#39; experience than I have, and would have intimated that the assurance should have come from me or would have made it with my concurrence. As I have already said a similar assurance was given a few years ago by the representatives of a former Government at this table, and with that assurance the Senate was satisfied. Why should honorable senators not accept a similar assurance now? This clause can apply only to land acquired under the provisions of this Bill, and such land would not, properly speaking, become Federal territory as prescribed by the Constitution. </para>

                    <para>. - I have a distinct recollection that in the earlier part of this discussion, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator any</inline> in answer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> gave utterance to words which meant that this Bill would not affect the territory within which the Seat of Government would be situated. I have here a memorandum to that effect. I am under the impression that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> said he would see that it was made clear that the Bill did not affect the Federal territory. </para>

                    (Tasmania) &#91;9.18&#93;. - I am not much concerned with what
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline>
                    said, but I should like to point out the position at which we have arrived. We have heard from the Ministers that the Government have no intention to apply this measure to the acquirement of lands for a Federal Capital. But the life of the present Ministry and the life of the Act will not be co-terminous ; the Act may be repealed, and the Ministry remain in existence; or the Ministry may disappear, leaving the Act still operative. If it is not desirable that the measure should be applied&#39; for the purpose of acquiring the Capital Site, why not say so in clear terms? The other day
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline>
                    practically said what I am saying now, namely, that if the Bill is not going to apply, what harm is there in saying so; and
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating&#39;s</inline>
                    answer is by no means conclusive. I repeat, in order to emphasize, the statement that the present Government have no desire or intention to apply the measure to that purpose; but such an assurance ought not to satisfy us in every instance. We shall be placed in a perfectly ridiculous position if, every time Ministers declare that while they are in office a Bill under discussion shall not be applied in a certain direction, we leave out words which are thought desirable as making the intention quite clear. I believe the majority of the Committee, desire that the Bill shall not apply to the acquisition of land for the Federal Capital Site, and surely we should say so. For the sake of lucidity, and in order to test the question, I move -

                    GOULD (New South Wales) &#91;9.25&#93;. - I do not think that this Bill ought to deal in any way with the acquisition of land for the Federal Capital site. If it were considered desirable by the Parliament to establish the Seat of Government on private lands, the Government would be enabled by means of the Bill to fix
                    <inline font-style="italic">on</inline>
                    the site for the Federal territory. The land thus selected might be the very best; but a matter of such paramount importance should be determined by a separate Bill, and not left to Executive action, even though the latter had to be subsequently confirmed by Parliament. A Bill of this character is intended to provide for the resumption of land for the purpose of post-offices, custom-houses, light-houses, defence buildings, and so forth, and not to acquire or deal in any way with land appertaining to the Federal Capital site. If Parliament determined to fix the Capital on. land already alienated, surely it would never be said that it was proper to come to the determination by virtue of the Bill before us. If the territory selected consisted partly of Crown lands, and partly of private lands, the Commonwealth would be placed in the position that, while under the Bill they could resume the whole of the private lands, they could not, by virtue of the same measure, resume the Crown lands, and there would have to be a separate Act of Parliament in regard to the latter. If Parliament declined to take up the Crown lands, then we should be in the absurd position of having acquired a large area of private land, and not being in possession of the Crown land. I am sure that
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline>
                    himself, when he introduced the Bill, never dreamt that it would be made applicable in any respect to the Federal Capital. Under the Bill, an attempt might be made to do in an indirect way what ought to be done in a direct and straightforward way. If the clause be postponed, I suggest&#39; that it be submitted with amendments which will show clearly that the Bill is not intended to deal in any way with the important question of the Capital site. I offer this suggestion in perfect good faith, and I am sure that Ministers will see sound reason why the suggestion I have made should be acted upon.

It was always intended that the Federal Capital should be created by a Bill passed through both Houses, and I hope the Ministers will give attention to the suggestion that has been made. </para>

                    <para>- Comparing clause 20 with the existing Act, it seems to me that there is an omission from this clause which is not provided for elsewhere in the Bill. It is provided here that where the Government, by notification in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette,</inline> has resumed a portion of land, and Parliament subse- . quently refuses to ratify the resumption, the notification becomes void and of no effect, and the land reverts to the owner from whom it has been temporarily taken. Under the existing law, the owner, in such a case, is entitled to compensation for the temporary dispossession of his land, but, in this clause, there is no provision for such compensation. By an Executive act, the Commonwealth Government might resume a piece of farming land. The owner, seeing the notification of the _ resumption, might cease his farming operations, and by the time Parliament had disallowed the resumption, it might be&#39; too late for the farmer to make provision for the season&#39;s crop. Under the existing law he would be compensated in such circumstances, but there is no such provision in clause 20 of this Bill. I ask the Minister whether there is any other portion of the Bill which I may have overlooked, in which the omission is remedied, or whether it is intended1 that in circumstances, such as I have indicated the owner of the land shall be deprived of the compensation to which I think he is legitimately entitled? </para>

                        has made the suggestion with regard to recreation reserves that the sanction of Parliament should be obtained for their acquisition. I suggest to the honorable senator that an amendment to give effect to what he desires might be appropriately introduced in this clause.

The point 1 am making is that, where a recreation reserve, or portion of such a reserve, is resumed, it should be competent for Parliament to pass a resolution as provided in clause 20, and something should appear in the notification to direct the attention of Parliament to the fact that a recreation reserve, or part of such a reserve, is being resumed. </para>

I suggest to the Minister, with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> &#39;s permission, that some provision might be inserted in clause 20, enabling Parliament to pass a resolution negativing a resumption of a reserve or part of a reserve and requiring that the notification should show in such a case that it is a recreation reserve, or part of such a reserve, that is resumed. I agree that it is not an amendment which can be framed at the table, but I have no doubt, from what has been said by honorable senators, that the Minister will undertake to frame an amendment on the lines I have suggested. </para>

                        <para>- I see no objection, so long as we can secure a correct form of words in which to express the amendment. I think that that would reserve to both Houses the opportunity of discussing the policy and the wisdom of the Executive act, which would result in the acquisition of any dedicated land. There is nothing at all undesirable in having such a provision. It would still preserve intact the complete power of the Commonwealth as expressed in the Bill, and it would give to each House the right, on motion, to criticise any action which might take place in the exercise of power, so far as- dedicated land was concerned. </para>

                    GOULD (New South Wales) &#91;9.47&#93;. - I wish to draw the attention of the Minister to the wording of the clause, and the effect which it would apparently have. I believe it is contemplated that where land is resumed by the Government they shall take the minerals, the metals, and everything else, in order to prevent any source of conflict arising between the States and1 the Commonwealth. It will be noticed that in: the majority of cases a conveyance has to be obtained. The object of the registration is set forth in the latter portion of the clause, to which I ask honorable senators to refer. It might happen that the laws in force in the State reserved the whole of the minerals to the Crown.

                        <para>- This clause would not have any application to that, but would apply purely to registration.
