                        <para>- No doubt honorable senators would have been glad to have come to a division last night at an early hour if it had been possible. It is well that we should have the fullest opportunity to express our views as to the advisability of making the amendment. I think that the general -opinion outside is that if the contract be carried out in its entirety, the Government may very fairly be congratulated. It has been surrounded with a certain amount of mystery, and doubts have been expressed as to whether the contract will be carried out, and also as to whether it is not merely a speculative agreement. The Government have to accept the responsibility of having, after complete inquiry, satisfied themselves that the contractors are prepared and able to carry out the agreement. And if the Senate is in&#39; a position to show that a mistake is being made by the Government, it is quite justified in doing so. We do not possess, however, the same opportunities of entering into the details as do the Government. If the con- tractors were not able to give effect to the contract, that fact would not become known to us until late in the coming year, and at a. time when it would be utterly impossible for us to make other than hasty arrangements, possibly to the injury of the Commonwealth, for a mail service. The responsibility for such a failure would rest upon the Government primarily. </para>

                            <para>-Col. GOULD. - I observe that the Postmaster-General has the right to increase the guarantee, and also to cancel the contract. It must be borne in mind, however, that where a specific penalty is provided for, with the power of cancelling&#34; the contract, <inline font-style="italic">no</inline> further action can be taken thereafter, no matter what damage may be caused to the Commonwealth. I regret, that, from first to fast, there has not been a fuller amount of confidence placed in the Senate. First of all, we heard that a gentleman in Melbourne was entering into negotiations with the Government. Whether he holds a power of attorney from <inline font-weight="bold">Sir James</inline> Laing and Sons, or whether, under the articles of association, that company has the right to enter into a mail contract or not, we do not know. No doubt the idea is that after securing a contract two or three ship-building firms will come together for the purpose of building ships and forming a company. </para>

                            <para> - I suppose that they will have to trust to the leniency of the Government in that regard. However, assuming everything to be in order, the subsidy which the Government are contracting to pay is unquestionably moderate. Of course, it has been fixed in consideration of the terms specified in the agreement, that is to say, for the carriage of mails between Brindisi and Adelaide, within certain periods, and on certain occasions. We may take it for granted that if the terms of the contract were varied, as proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> the contractors would very naturally expect to be paid a consideration for extending the service, and accepting additional burdens. If the contract be a good one, as it stands, it will be utterly foolish of honorable senators to attempt to superadd conditions that would involve a cancellation of it, and necessitate the Government setting to work with a view to prepare a fresh contract. If, on the other hand, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> says, the vessels will come to Melbourne and Sydney, and therefore ought to go to Queensland, the reply is that they will not come to Melbourne and Sydney unless they consider that trade demands that they should do so. If trade demands it, unquestionably the vessels will be brought on; and just in the same way. if trade demands that they should go to Brisbane they will go. But if the honorable senator says that to get the ships past Sydney it is necessary to give them an additional subsidy, he gives his case away, because he admits that they will not obtain sufficient trade at Brisbane, and will require an additional sum of money to recompense them for going there. With such a prospect in front of us, it would be utterly suicidal to superadd conditions that would throw the whole question into the crucible again. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has been very strong upon the necessity of making provision for the purpose of taking our butter and other produce to the old world. No doubt it is very desirable that every possible effort should be. made in that direction. But the States have declined to guarantee a certain amount of freight, and therefore the Commonwealth Government has not felt itself bound to take further action. I think that&#39; the Government has been wise in that respect, because it has not the same intimate knowledge of the work as the States Governments must have; and if the States Governments find themselves unable to enter into any condition of the character how much more difficult would it be for the Commonwealth Government to do anything of the kind. Let us look at the matter all round. These vessels are to be of 11,000 tons, and we are told that they will provide a large amount of refrigerating space. Why will they do that? For the simple reason that it is recognised that the line cannot be expected to pay unless every possible provision is made for conducting a profitable trade. </para>

                            <para>- The&#39; Government says, &#34;We want our mails carried in a certain time, and we want a good class of ship; we know perfectly well that if we are to have swift ships, with a long sea journey before them, they must be large, in order that they may carry a large quantity of coal. They must also provide a large amount of accommodation! for passengers and freight, if they are to pay. <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> cannot conceive that any ship-owning firm would be prepared to take up a mail contract for &#163;1 25,000 between Adelaide and Brindisi unless great inducements were held out to them. The great inducements in this case are freight and passenger money. The  contractors  have to build first-class ships, and provide accommodation to compete with well-equipped lines. I believe that the vessels will be thoroughly up-to-date. I do not believe that the men who are at the back of this firm are such fools as to enter into a contract of this kind unless they see a reasonable prospect of making the enterprise a success. The sum which we are going to pay them is a mere bagatelle, compared with the expenditure involved. I do not believe that there is a single steamship which, goes from Australia to Great Britain by  way  of the Suez Canal unless it receives a subsidy. Honorable senators know why that is. </para>

                            <para>.- I know that the dues are very high, and that upon the class of ships now trading to Australia they come to something like ,&#163;78,000 or &#163;80.000 per annum. I think that a vessel of the <inline font-style="italic">Ophir</inline> class pays about &#163;3, 000 for the trip home and back again. Twenty-six ships of that kind would pay &#163;78,000. The vessels to be provided for by the contractors will be larger than the present mail-ships. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> tells us that the Suez Canal dues will amount to as much as the subsidy.

The vessels of the White Star, Aberdeen, and Lund lines take the Cape route, and so avoid the Suez Canal dues. But the great charm to the butter men is that they are able to sen3 their produce by the shortest and quickest route possible; and that necessitates vessels going by the Suer Canal. </para>

                            <para>.- No doubt it is, but the vessels which take that route have no inducement to go &#34;by the canal. The Messageries, Norddeutscher, the Peninsular and Oriental, and Orient lines are the only lines that use the Suez Canal. If we want this contract to be carried out we ought not to put any difficulties in the way. The vessels will naturally call at those ports where they can pick up the greatest amount of trade, and will take precious good care to land their produce from any &#39; port in Australia at the port of destination in Great Britain within as brief a time as possible. It is to their own advantage to do so. A great deal of &#39;debate has taken place over the question of registered tonnage. I do not think that any honorable senator who has taken the trouble to Took &#39; into the matter can quarrel with what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has said in regard &#39;tothat matter. He has pointed out trie requirements of the Merchant Shipping Act, and has shown how registered tonnage is to be ascertained. I think his observations! are fairly conclusive as to the way registered tonnage is determined. &#39; I have- here a work on shipping, entitled <inline font-style="italic">Know Your Own Ship,</inline> by Walton, in which he points out how registered tonnage is arrived at. He says that it is obtained after certain allowed deductions have been made from the gross tonnage. He points out that deductions are made for crew space, master&#39;s accommodation, engineers and officers&#39; accommodation, sail room, boatswain&#39;s store, wheel room, donkey boiler, deck shelter, and propelling space. A case has been cited in regard to one of the Peninsular and Oriental Company&#39;s vessels where 9,500 tons is the gross register, whilst the permitted deductions bring the registered tonnage down to 4,800. That is the registered tonnage of such vessels as the <inline font-style="italic">Marmora</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Mongolia.</inline></para>

                            <para>- No, it is not. An example is given in this book of the case of a screw collier. All her measurements are quoted. Her gross tonnage is 964 tons. Then various deductions are made such as propelling space 367.5, chart room 5, bridge accommodation for officers 54, crew space 23, boatswains&#39; store 10, making the total deductions 459.5. These deductions from the gross tonnage leave the registered tonnage 504.5. The vessels under the contract now being considered will, it is stated, be of a registered tonnage of 11,000. If that were to be taken literally, it would mean that the ships would be of 16,000 tons gross tonnage. But I am quite satisfied that they are not intended to be of more than 11,000 gross tonnage. The possibility is that their registered tonnage will be something like 5,000 or 6,000. </para>

But why should we say that we will compel them to go there, knowing perfectly well that if we do they will expect to receive some consideration for the additional restrictions placed upon their movements.

                            <para>. - The whole tone of this debate indicates that honorable senators regard this agreement as too good to be true, in view of the fact that in the past we have not been able to obtain such favorable conditions as are now offered. If those who tender are offering something more than we require, or ask for, at the price we are prepared to pay, I do not see that we have any ground for complaint. Any honorable senator would admit that if when he goes to purchase an article, he is asked to pay less than he expected, he will usually come to the conclusion that he has made a fairly&#39; good bargain; the vendor may have &#34;fallen in,&#34; but if both parties are satisfied, what complaint can be made? I may say at once that I intend to support, not the <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> of this year, but the <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> of last year. </para>

                                <para>- I do not know that that is the case; but last year <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> represented clearly the opinion of the people of Queensland, and I am now taking the same stand that he then took, because I realize that the agreement before us gives us exactly what we were asking for. I am not prepared to support a claim for something else, when we are. apparently, getting what we originally desired. The contract under discussion last year definitely stated that the vessels should call at Melbourne and Sydney, on both the outward and inward trips, but no provision was made for their calling at Brisbane. </para>

                                <para>- But that is not an understanding entered into with the Prime Minister ; and. therefore, we could not compel the vessels to go from Adelaide to Melbourne, or from Melbourne to Sydney. If the Prime Minister has entered into an understanding of the sort, I contend that neither he nor those who are aiding and abetting him, are fit to be in public life, much less to guide the destinies of Australia. Since last year, there has been a change in the State Ministry of Queensland. I then saw the State Premier, and two or three members of his Cabinet, and the position they took up was that if the Commonwealth entered into a contract for mail purposes only, they had no ground for complaint. That is the attitude which &#34;is taken by the present Premier of Queensland, as shown bv the report of a newspaper interview with him, read by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> last night. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> says that he has been able to convert the Premier of Queensland to his way of thinking; but I do not think that is the case. It is not long since the Queensland Premier and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> were like the Siamese twins ; where one was the other could always be found, and their opinions coincided. Apparently, however, those two gentlemen are at variance on this question of the mail contract. </para>

You, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> will remember that in the Queensland Parliament, at one time, there was an honorable member who spoke on one side of a question and voted on the other, and that, when he was taxed with the fact, he said he regarded it as a very convenient arrangement. That gentleman pointed out that in his district some centres of population were in favour of the proposal in question, whilst other centres were against it, and the convenience lay in the fact that, when before the electors who were in favour, he could point to the division-list, and, when in the other centres, he could quote his strong opposition speeches. I regard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> as occupying exactly similar ground in connexion with this mail contract. </para>

                                <para>-&#39;The honorable senator knows as well as I do that the calling of the vessels at Brisbane would not benefit Rockhampton in connexion with the carriage of produce. The country is being opened up for dairying purposes at the back of Mackay and Cairns, and the same may be said of the Atherton scrub; and it is believed that, eventually, shipping facilities will be required for those districts. What the people interested in this development are advocating to-day is a contract with some shipping line, which shall start at Brisbane or Sydney, and collect all the produce along the coast, for export to the old country. So far as I can judge from the press, negotiations have been entered into with the Peninsular and Oriental Steam; Navigation Company for accommodation in this connexion. Because the Government realize that it is not in the interests of their State to pay additional subsidies for boats that will take the produce of the States only from one corner. What is required is that the boats of such a service shall pick up produce from one end of Queensland to the other, and take it in a direct line to the old country. I am satisfied that this contract provides for nothing but the carriage of mails, and that these boats need not go a foot beyond Adelaide unless the company please. Last year <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> said that if we did not make special provision for it in the mail contract then under consideration, the mail boats would go to ports beyond Adelaide for the sake pf the trade, but last night the honorable senator said that this contract is not confined to the carriage of mails, and that there is an understanding between the Prime Minister and the company that the boats are to call at Melbourne and Sydney. The honorable senator has changed his ground, and has appealed to the representatives of Victoria and New South Wales in the Senate to support his amendment on the ground that if the New Zealand Government hold out sufficient inducements, these boats may go direct from Adelaide to New Zealand, pick up cargo there, and, missing Sydney and Melbourne, go back to Adelaide for the mails, without calling at other Australian ports. If that can be done under this contract, where is the honorable senator&#39;s evidence that it is anything more than a mail contract to Adelaide? From the way in which the honorable member has advocated consideration for the interests of the producers of Queensland, one might be pardoned for imagining that he would be up for election this time. At one time the honorable senator contended that it is the duty of the States Governments to do all that is necessary to provide means of transport for the benefit of the producers. I believe that it is the duty of all Governments to do whatever they can to provide facilities for the export of produce. Some fifteen or sixteen days ago a deputation of representatives of Queensland, of whom I was one, waited on the Prime Minister in connexion with this matter. The honorable and learned gentleman told us - and it appeared in the press later on, and has been confirmed by the statement made bv the Premier of Queensland - that the Commonwealth Government realized that it was their duty to enter into a contract for a postal service only, and that they had nothing to do with the export of produce. But he added that he had communicated with the Governments of the States, asking whether they could not arrange amongst themselves to secure that the boats engaged&#39; in the service should be provided with certain cold storage accommodation. and should call at Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane. He explained that the Premiers &#34; of the States did not see &#34;their way to adopt his suggestion. The report of an interview with the Premier of Queensland, to which reference has already been made bears out the statement of the Prime Minister to the very letter. I think that the best arrangement that can be made has been made. It is not necessary for us to consider anything but a mail contract. Of course we desire, that the boats should run to Melbourne, Sydney, and, if possible, to Brisbane, but if the Governments of the States concerned will not enter into negotiations to make proper provision for the transport by these boats of the produce of Australia, we cannot be blamed for that. I am aware that in connexion with the export of butter, and other perishable produce, regularity of shipment is an important consideration to the producer. At the same time I think with the <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> of last year, that it is the duty of the States Governments to make arrangements for the export of produce, and it is the duty of the Commonwealth Government to make the necessary arrangements for the carriage of the mails. One reason which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> gave in support of his contention that this is more than a mail contract, was that the boats are compelled by its terms to proceed from the Mediterranean port to some port in the United Kingdom. If the honorable senator is prepared to move an amendment, binding the company down to a service between Adelaide and Brindisi only, I shall be prepared to vote for it. </para>

If Senators Stewart and Guthrie believe that the omission of the provision requiring the boats to go from Brindisi to a port in the United Kingdom will make this a purely mail contract, they have only to move to that effect, and I shall be prepared to support them. They ask why we should interfere with business that is not ours, and they contend that the carriage of the mails being a function of the Federal Government, we should make provision for that, and nothing more. </para>

The State Government- of Queensland agreed to pay the Orient Steam Navigation Company a subsidy of &#163;26,000 a year to continue the voyages of their steamers to Brisbane, and when, on the representations of Queensland representatives/, a proposal was made bv the Government that Queensland should be credited with a mileage rate of 3s. 7d., amounting in all to something like &#163;4,700 a year, and the boats be free of pilotage and light dues, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> strongly opposed the concession. </para>

                                <para>- The Queensland Government desired that the Orient boats should call at Brisbane, because it had previously been necessary for produce exported from Queensland and requiring cold storage to be sent in the coastal boats to Sydney, and transhipped there. It was because they desired to avoid the necessity for the transhipment of this produce in Sydney that they offered&#39; these concessions to the company. This contract provides exactly what we were asking for-last year. It provides for a mail service to Adelaide. As a matter of fact, the boats engaged under this contract, need not go any further. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> pointed out last night, the New Zealand Government might offer the company a subsidy of &#163;30,000 or &#39;&#163;40,000 -a year, and they might send their boats direct from Adelaide to New Zealand, and then back 10 Adelaide to pick up the mails on their return voyage to Brindisi. So long as they are free <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> go where they like when they have finished our work, I am prepared to vote for the contract almost as it stands. </para>

                            <para>. - I am a supporter of the amendment, and I should like to indicate the reasons which influence my vote. I am also disposed to support the amendment, which I understand is to be moved bv <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie.</inline> I am altogether opposed to the idea of making this entirely a mail contract. That is contrary to practice and common sense, and certainly the Government are not adopting the best means at their disposal for safeguarding the producing interests. It has been stated by honorable senators, including, I think, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> that every day is of great importance, and&#39; that if we are not careful, we shall upset the contract. If we did upset the contract, what harm could it do? I believe that it would be wise to arrange at once with the Orient. Steam Navigation Company to renew its contract for a year, and to call for three alternative tenders. In my opinion, the Government made a very great mistake when they failed to grasp the opportunity they had of helping the producers. I quite approve of the action of the Prime Minister in communicating with the States and asking for their views as to the provision of cool storage. But because the States naturally shrank from undertaking to guarantee a certain amount of freight, that was no reason why the Government of the Commonwealth should say, &#34; Thank God.! we can now go in for only a mail contract and leave the other matter to the States.&#34; I believe that every State would welcome a contract which bound eight or nine magnificent shins with cool storage to call regularly and punctually at the chief ports in the Commonwealth. But that is quite a different thing from asking the States to undertake a liability in regard to freight. We all know that the producers can get their produce taken to the old country by outside boats. It does not follow, of course, that they would always be able to make such arrangements. </para>

                                <para>- Yes. They would then have derived from the contract a benefit, whereas now it gives them nothing. Is it not business and commonsense for the producers to wish to have two strings to their Low? In my opinion, the Government should have called for tenders first for a mail contract pure and simple, second for a mail contract with cool storage accommodation, and an obligation to call at all ports including Brisbane, and to charge a certain freight for meat, butter, fruit, &#38;c, and third a contract with the rate of freight a little below that fixed in the mail contract, but higher than that charged on outside ocean liners. Suppose that the freight on the mail steamers was 3s. 3d. a case for fruit, and that producers could get outside boats to take fruit at 2s. 6d. a case, had I been Postmaster-General, I should have called for tenders Tor the carriage of fruit at a freight of 2s.9d. or 3s. a case. By that means the Government would have secured a tender which would have saved&#163;30,000, or , &#163;40,000, or &#163;50,000 a year to the producers. Was there any commonsense in asking for one kind of service when they might have asked for three separate kinds of service? Is there any commonsense in calling for only a mail service when they might have felt the tone of the market as regards a freight service? I regret that the Government missed that opportunity. As regards the mail contract itself, they have made a most excellent bargain. But I desire to get something more than a mail contract if it be possible. I quite agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> that the contract as it stand&#39;s does not show much evidence of being a combined contract. Judging from statements which have been made elsewhere as well as here, it is quite certain that Ministers do look forward to the contractors supplying, to a great extent, boats with cool storage. It is provided in the contract that the plans of the ships shall be submitted for the approval of the Government. We are assured that the ships will contain ample cool storage space, and will be bound, in their own interest, to go to the various ports. Why should not all those things be provided for in the contract? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> has said that the boats would not be bound to go beyond Adelaide. But he knows that they would go on to other ports. He would let the boats stop at the port in the Mediterranean, and would vote that they should not be bound to go on to England. In my opinion, if he were to vote in that way, he would make a great mistake. No one can foretell what is likely to happen during the next ten years. Suppose that these eight or nine magnificent ships could stop at Adelaide? What might happen? A war might break out in another part of the world, and the result of the war might depend upon the ability to get boats for carrying soldiers and stores. By cablegram some boats of the contracting company might be offered an enormous sum to undertake a freight voyage, and persons who were looking, for the vessels to go to Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane might be disappointed. Why? Because we had not taken the precaution of providing in the contract that the boats should do as our mail boats have always done. </para>

Would <inline font-style="italic">not</inline> that be a great mistake, too? Have not the travel- ling public for years had the option of being carried to the London docks in the mail boats, if they so wished?

                                <para>- No doubt thousands of passengers would be greatly disappointed if they could not proceed in the boats to the London docks. Is that the kind of contract which would redound to the credit and business tact of the Government and Parliament of the Commonwealth? Certainly not. Why should we accept a contract under which such advantages would not be guaranteed? I quite admit that in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred those advantages would be offered, but at times the contractors might not run their boats to the various ports. It would be <inline font-style="italic">st</inline> mistake not to guard against a contingency of that kind. </para>

                                <para>- We have evidence that the Government have been considering certain provisions in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart, Senator Guthrie,</inline> and .myself are interested, but they have not embodied them in the contract. In my opinion, they have committed an error of judgment. I should hold up both hands to-morrow with delight if they would renew the contract with the Orient Steam Navigation Company for another year, and call for fresh tenders. Coming to the provisional contract itself, it appears to me to be a kind of promoters&#39; &#34; spec.&#34; It reminds me of a concession for a railway of which we have had considerable experience in Tasmania. This is nothing more than a kind of commercial concession which certain gentlemen in England will carry out if they can float their undertaking with a capital of &#163;4,000,000, but which, if they do not succeed in die attempt, they will drop like a hot potato, and forfeit the amount of their bond. That possibility stands out plainly on the face of the contract. With regard to the question of registered tonnage, I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> must be right in his contention, although, at first, I agreed with the view of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, because the Merchant Shipping Act absolutely defines the term. In my opinion, the contractors have not seen one line of this contract. It has &#39;been negotiated by their agent and solicitor, and only the salient points have been communicated to the contractors by cable. The omission of the word &#34; gross &#34; is enough to damn the contract. If the contractors were held to their agreement, they would have to build vessels of about 20,000 tons register, and they would have all their work cut out to provide a net tonnage of 11,000 tons. </para>

                                <para>- I know that the contractors could issue debentures, and borrow money on the ships, but at the same time they would have to find at least &#163;2,000,000. It is estimated by some persons that at first the service would be run at a loss of &#163;100,000 a year, or more. We have, as a guide, the experience of the Orient Steam Navigation Company. I take it that that company would not withdraw all their ships from the Australian trade, and that, after having traded here for twenty of thirty years, some of their friends would be loyal to them. If they cannot make the service pay regularly, but can only declare a dividend now and then, is the new company, with magnificent ships, and with more dues to pay, likely to succeed, in view of the fact that a few of the Orient Steam Navigation Company&#39;s boats would remain in the Australian trade and compete with them? It appears to me that the contractors are bound to lose money. We have no reasonable assurance that a company will be floated, and, of course, if it were not, the contract would not be carried out. I do not think that the ships ought to be compelled to go to Hobart or Brisbane, or to go anywhere outside the mail route, unless they had a guarantee that their expenses to and from would be covered by the freight. It would be of no use for the boats to call at Brisbane simply to satisfy our friends from that State if the producers did not offer sufficient freight to pay the expenses of the voyage. I do not advocate that the boats should call at&#39; Hobart all the year round. I only desire them to call at that port during the fruit season, when I am certain that they would on each trip get freightage of &#163;2,000, &#163;2,500, or &#163;3,000. As the cost of going from Sydney to Hobart instead of to Melbourne would be about &#163;300, the contractors would make an enormous gain on each voyage. </para>

                                <para>- The Premier of Tasmania, I understand, declined to give a guarantee in regard to cool storage. Fruit-growers have told me that they prefer to make their own arrangements for space. But I have to look ahead, and to think of things which, perhaps, they have overlooked. If, by agreeing to pay a subsidy of &#163;125,000 a year, I could get the vessels to go to Hobart, why should I not work in that direction? </para>

                                <para>- I believe that if we were to ask the contractors to send the boats to Hobart during the fruit season, they would not charge one shilling more for carrying our mails. Why? Because they would make a positive gain in going to that port. In any case, the chances are as ninety-nine to one that the boats will go there. But why not make them do what the mail companies have always done? With regard to Brisbane it must be apparent, I think, that if the vessels go there, they will pay expenses and soon earn a profit. The Government will not hear the last of it until they do go to Brisbane. That is my prophecy. I do not know that we are calle&#39;d upon to alter the contract against ourselves, but I certainly think that we ought to put the word &#34; gross &#34; before the word &#34; tonnage.&#39;&#39; </para>

                            <para>. - I was very pleased yesterday to learn that the contractors had agreed to an alteration providing that an extension of the term of the contract should not take place without the approval of Parliament. There was, from my point of view, a weak point in the contract previously. There is very little doubt of the existence of general distrust in connexion with this contract. I attribute that largely to the Government. When tenders were called for, the Government permitted the names of the tenderers to be kept secret, even after a tender had been accepted. </para>

                                <para>- It may be a wrong impression, but certainly it does prevail. When I was a boy, in Scotland, we used to be told that certain confections were too sweet to be wholesome. This seems to be so good a contract that it makes people a wee bit suspicious. If it is genuine, it is very good. Will the Minister kindly give us information as to the amount of the unsuccessful tenders, including the one which came in too late? I cannot support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart&#39;s</inline> amendment. I cannot see that what he requires has anything to do with a mail contract. Nor can I understand why he should find fault with the size of the vessels. As a matter of fact, when the Government calls for tenders for an inland postal contract, it expects that the coaches will provide room for so many passengers. . It is also to be expected that these mail steamers will provide accommodation for passengers. People who can afford it prefer to travel to Europe by mail steamer. It seems to me that the size of the steamers is to be explained by a provision in the contract which most honorable senators appear to have overlooked, and which I will therefore take the liberty of reading - </para>

                                <para>- From their point of view, honorable senators are no doubt right. Even from my own point of view, if I am making a bargain, I like it to be a good one. Another reason why it probably suits the contractors to accept what is apparently a small subsidy, is that they are shipbuilders, and may see their way to make profits on the ships, even if they lose something on the contract. When they are building ships costing about &#163;4,000,000, they may consider that they can afford to lose something on the contract for a few years. But that is our advantage, and I see no objection to the Commonwealth getting the benefit of a good bargain. With regard to the vessels calling at Sydney and Melbourne, I am quite satisfied that private enterprise can supply sufficient accommodation for our produce. If these vessels do not see fit to call at our principal ports, we will not be dependent solely upon them, though we should welcome them if they came. We shall still have the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, and the White Star ships, and I hope we shall continue to have the Orient Steam Navigation Company&#39;s vessels. We are well assured that adequate facilities will be available for the carriage of our produce to England. I quite agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> that the Suez Canal dues alone will amount to as much as the price we are to pay for the carriage of our mails. I went to Europe in the <inline font-style="italic">Bremen,</inline> 11,500 tons, five years ago. </para>

                                <para>- Certainly. I am a free-trader, and I go by the vessel that will supply me with the best accommodation for my money. One of the officers assured me that the Suez Canal dues on the round trip came to &#163;7,000 approximately. If the new vessels are going to be anything like the size we expect them to be, I shall not be surprised if the dues for each round trip come to at least &#163;6,000. Multiply that sum by twenty-six, and you find that the dues paid each year will amount to more than the subsidy stipulated for in the contract. I am very glad that the term is not to be longer than ten years. I hope that Parliament will not agree to any extension beyond that time. It may be that those of us who live will see railways constructed to Fremantle and Port Darwin by the end of ten years. Then we shall be able to get our European mails carried in three days shorter time. We may even have balloons to carry our mails. I have lately seen in the Queensland newspapers - I get them regularly, and am not sure that I have not a small interest in one of them - that the State Government recognise that their wisest plan will be to encourage, ships to go by the Torres Strait route rather than bring their produce round the south of the Continent. I am glad to notice that movement. I cannot see my way to support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart&#39;s</inline> proposal. This is no more than a mail contract pure and simple. Its terms are advantageous, and we should not risk losing it, by placing unnecessary difficulties in the way. </para>

                            <para>. - After listening to honorable senators this morning, and last night, I find myself confronted with two entirely different sets of arguments. On the one side we have <inline font-weight="bold">Senator .</inline> Dobson and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> finding fault in no measured terms with the contract, because it does not provide for cool storage and other facilities. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> feels so strongly upon the matter that he would absolutely tear up this contract, and1 initiate other proceedings on a different basis. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> in expressing himself in the same fashion, but with equal, if not superior, emphasis, showed that he regarded the absence of these provisions as a vital blot on the contract that we are asked to ratify. But against that we have the view of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> that the vital defect in the contract is that it does provide those very facilities that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> say are entirely absent. I am rather inclined to think that by some strange chapter of accidents the Government has stumbled upon a fairly accurate middle course. The features which present themselves to my mind are these: The Government invited applications from the whole world for the conveyance of mails. It invited tenderers who responded to these applications to state what size. vessels they would supply. I put it to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> who has mentioned the size of these ships a.s one of the chief objections to the tender, seeing that it is a mail contract only - whether if two tenders had been submitted for an equal subsidy, one company offering to supply vessels of 11,000 tons, and the other vessels of 3,000 or 4,000 tons, which tender would he have accepted ? </para>

                                <para>- We have this evidence - that invitations were published throughout the world for tenders to be supplied for the conveyance of our mails, and tenderers were invited to state what size vessels they would supply. The tender which has been accepted contained an offer to supply 11,000 tons boats. The size of the vessels has been made one of the points of attack. I say that that attack altogether, fails, in view of the admission that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> now makes, that other things being equal, he would prefer the larger to the smaller ships. </para>

                                <para>- I do not want to deal with the question of tonnage as to which one of two opinions is open to us. Either the contractors have used the term &#34; registered tonnage &#39; &#39; in. ignorance, or they have done so pursuing the game of bluff, which is tried by all shipping companies in advertising gross instead of registered tonnage. I give the Government the benefit of the doubt - it is a pleasure to me. though I do not often do so - in supposing that they did not really know what &#34; registered tonnage &#34; meant. But the other contracting parties knew perfectly well what they were doing, and were, apparently, resorting, as I say, to that species of advertising puff or bluff which is favoured by most shipping firms. </para>

                                <para>- Just before I pass from the objection raised to the contract on the ground that the vessels are large, I invite attention to clauses 8 and 9 of the general conditions of tender. I make this reference, because last night it was pointed out that the plans have to be submitted to the Government, and it will be seen that these articles provide that this submission is to be only for the purpose of showing that the vessels are suitable and fit for the purposes of the contract. If I read those clauses aright, they mean that the power of supervision is- to be absolutely limited to the maillcarrying capacity of the vessels, and that there need not be any other provision on the vessels beyond that for carrying mail matter. That there will be other provision I have no doubt, but, so far as the supervising power of the contract is concerned, the plans have only to show that the vessels have ample accommodation for the conveyance of the mails. </para>

                                <para>- The representative of the Government would have no legal right to do so, as I read the clauses. Clause 8 of the general conditions of tender, amongst other matters, provides that every mail ship shall be &#34; in all respects suited to the performance of the services herein agreed to be performed,&#39;&#39; while clause 9 stipulates that every vessel shall be &#34; always properly and sufficiently equipped in all respects, so as to render her constantly efficient for the said services, and safe for the conveyance of mails.&#34; The supervision which the Government claim, and rightly claim, to exercise over the plans and construction of the vessels, is limited to the purpose for which, so far as we are concerned, they are to be constructed. The clauses I have quoted seem to me to support the contention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> that this is a mail contract pure and simple ; but in proportion as those clauses tend to support those two honorable senators, they correspondingly demolish the position taken up by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart. Senator Guthrie</inline> seems to think that because the contract does not provide for cargo facilities, some injury will be done to the producers and the trade of Australia. I cannot accept that view. That some additional advantage might have been conferred if there had been added to the mail contract a trade contract, is a matter for consideration and argument; but I cannot conceive that any injury will be done to the producers of Australia if a contract, which we enter into for mail purposes, has the effect of bringing a large and capacious fleet into Australian waters. Although there is no stipulation that the vessels shall be bound to enter any ports but those of Fremantle and Adelaide, it is obvious that the presence of such vessels in Australian waters, increasing as they will the carrying capacity for Australian produce, must have a beneficial effect on those who desire to send produce to the markets of the world. Even if the vessels never pass Adelaide, the effect of their competition will still be felt, because they will take so large a proportion of the South Australian export produce as to leave the vessels now trading here more and more dependent on the ports of the other States. </para>

                                <para>- If that danger ex:ists, as it probably does in these days of big commercial enterprises, there will be a much smaller risk of combination with a multiplicity of companies than with a limited number. For that reason I altogether dissent from the view that, because we have no direct undertaking on the part of the contractors to visit other ports, no advantage will accrue to those who have produce to ship. The presence in Australian waters of such a body of shipping as is projected in this agreement will have an immense benefit, not merely in adding to the number of the shipping companies catering for the trade, but also in the anticipation, which I confidently entertain, that modern, well-equipped vessels of the kind will tend to stimulate the lines already trading on our coasts, .and still further induce, or even force, them to make concessions in order to secure their share of trade in export produce. </para>

The position of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> is rather anomalous, seeing that he admits that, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, the vessels would, call at the ports voluntarily. Under the circumstances. I see no reason to make a rigid stipulation, and thus run the risk of destroying the contract, which, as I said on a previous occasion, appears to me to be verv favorable to the Commonwealth. </para>

                                <para>- That is so; but, to make the callings coompulsory, by means of a stipulation in the contract, would, to my mind, be vicious. It would be left open to Western Australia, or any other State, to contend that all vessel&#39;s under mail contract should call at all the ports of the Commonwealth. It might be claimed; for instance, that the vessels of the Vancouver service should proceed to Western Australia, or that the vessels of the New Guinea service should call at Tasmanian ports. There is no doubt that the ports would to a certain extent benefit if those subsidized steamers were required to call, but I regard such a principle as wrong. One reason why it seems to me that the Government are very wise in making this only a mail contract is to be found in the disappointment of the anticipation which they evidently entertained in the case of a former contract, that they would get generous support from the producers if a large space were guaranteed for refrigerated produce. We know what the result was. When they endeavoured to get a guarantee, they were informed, to their surprise, that the principal producers desired to be left alone. I was present at a large meeting in Hobart when the producers distinctly refused to give any guarantee; and the experience in Sydney was similar. While honorable senators talk about forwarding the interests of producers, we ought to remember that the latter desire only to be left alone, they having in the past managed their own affairs with profit. For the reasons I have given I cannot support the amendment. </para>

                            <para>. - In the case of a Chamber representative of the States, it is excusable that honorable senators should address themselves to the question from the stand- point of their own States; and I also propose to take that course. There is no doubt that under this agreement Queensland will be at a disadvantage, as compared with some of the other States. But I do not attribute that position to any malice on the part of the present or any past Government ; it arises more from the geographical position of Queensland in reference to any mail service from the West. This question has been in the mind of successive Governments for a very long time past. It was considered when tenders were invited for a mail contract during the Barton Administration. I was then Postmaster-General ; and the tenders invited were of every possible character, including one from any port in Australia to any port in the United Kingdom, affording every opportunity for tenderers of all kinds to offer. I was in hopes at the time that we might have an offer for a mail service by Torres Straits. In fact, in my opinion, the ideal mail service for Australia would approach from the West, with a Home route by the Torres Straits, perhaps alternately reversing the trip. Such a service would not only serve the ports hitherto recognised as ports of call in this connexion, but would afford shipping facilities to various centres in Queensland. In all the States except Queensland, there is, we may say, one port for the whole of the territory. </para>

                                <para>- Of course, there are the ports of Launceston and Hobart in that State; but on the mainland, the difference between Queensland and the other States, is that in the northern State there are ports which serve distinctly separate districts that would be left out entirely by any mail service involving a call only at Brisbane. That fact has been recognised for a long time past by the Queensland Government. As far back, I think, as 1880 the Queensland Government entered into a contract with the British-India Steam Navigation Company for a mail service <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> Torres Straits. The subsidy at the start was &#163;55,000 a year for a four-weekly service. In addition, port dues were remitted, so that, on the whole, the subsidy reached a very substantial amount. </para>

                                <para>- There were intermediate steamers, I think; but, at any rate, cargo was picked up at all of those ports. _ It soon became apparent, however, that this, as a mail service, was a failure, because it was too slow; and it was therefore found more advantageous to use the vessels sailing from Sydney. Consequently letters were almost immediately sent by the old route; but the service of the British-India Steam Navigation Company was retained for cargo purposes with, I think, beneficial results to the whole of Queensland. </para>

                                <para>- Quite so. The result of calling for tenders for the mail service from Australia to England in the first place was that after an interval of eighteen months, there was practically only one tender sent in. and1 that was from the Orient Steam Navigation Company, on very much the same conditions as the company had previously performed the service. I should like here to emphasize the fact that the Postmaster-General at that time, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sydney</inline> Smith, endeavoured to induce the company to make am offer to take their boats on to Brisbane. It was one of the conditions of tender that they should state what sum they would require to go on to Brisbane. But the company would not name any sum at all, although they were pressed to do so. At that time, it should be remembered that nearly all the butter freight from Brisbane was going under an arrangement to the Aberdeen line, so that there was no particular inducement for the company to make the offer. But with, regard to Sydney and Melbourne, the position was that they did not care whether the contract made provision for calling at those ports or not If they had been omitted from the contract, the company would not have taken one sixpence less for the service. The insertion in the conditions that the steamers should go on to Melbourne and Sydney from Adelaide was a matter of grace, and cost the Commonwealth nothing whatever. We should not have secured the service for any less if that condition had not been inserted. But its insertion gave umbrage to a number of people in Queensland who contended that if it was a condition of the contract that the boats should go to Sydney and Melbourne, it should also be a condition that they should go on to Brisbane. Last session, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> expressed the views of a great number of people in Queensland, when he said that the contract should be &#39; purely for a mail service, and that all arrangements with respect to the carriage of cargo should be left to the States Governments. That is exactly what has been done in this contract. It is possible that the contractors might have been willing that a provision should be inserted compelling the boats to go to Sydney and&#39; Melbourne without making any extra charge. But the course adopted by the Government is the course which Queensland . asked for last year. That is to say, that the contract should be&#34; purely for a mail service, covering the carriage of the mails from Adelaide to </para>

                        <para class="block">Brindisi, and of the heavier mail matter to London. That this is purely a mail service is clear, if we consider what the contractors have undertaken to do for the subsidy of &#163;125,000. They have undertaken to carry our mails and nothing else. Everything else has been left to arrangement with the States Governments. </para>

                                <para>- That is so. In this contract, the Government have asked the company to carry our mails, but it is ridiculous to suppose that any shipping company in the world would build, charter, or use steamers merely for the purpose of carrying mail matter. They would never offer to carry our mails for &#163;125,000 a year if they had not in mind the making of money by the carriage of goods. They have elected&#39; to make a contract simply for the carriage of mails, and leave themselves perfectly free to go where they like to secure freight. The Commonwealth Government communicated with the Governments of the States with a view to placing themselves in a position to inform the contractors what freight they would get at different ports if they went there. The negotiations fell through, because none of the States&#39; Governments were prepared to make any definite offer. I am not sure that the Government of Queensland were not wise in the attitude they took up, because, if any such arrangement were made, it would involve a corresponding compensation. And if they had offered the contractors so much freight on condition that their boats went to Queensland ports they would have tied their hands for perhaps the number of years contemplated in the contract. They would have had to agree to give the company a certain amount of freight, and, in doing so, they might, perhaps, have been hampering themselves, if subsequently they desired to negotiate for the carriage of Queensland produce, <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> Torres Straits. I feel sure that the producers of Queensland, and those representing them, will never be satisfied with any cargo service which will not give equal facilities to all the ports on the Queensland coast, and which will not connect them with the principal ports in the East. I think that, eventually, there must be a service for the carriage of cargo <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> Torres Straits. Whether the Queensland Government, in declining to negotiate with the new company, were actuated by these views or&#39; not, I do not know, but I believe they were wise in not tying themselves to any southern mail service. </para>

                                <para>- I have not the slightest doubt that, in view of the enormous expansion which has taken place lately, and is taking place now, in connexion with the production of butter in Queensland, and the enormous and increasing output of frozen meat from the State, the exports of the State will be sufficient shortly to warrant a line of steamers being put on to transport them, and such a service will almost certainly be <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> Torres Straits&#39;. Queensland, of course, desires an efficient and speedy mail service; and, looking upon this contract as one purely for a mail service, I should not consider myself justified in doing anything that would prevent it being carried out. It provides for probably as good a mail service as we could possibly expect to get for the money, and Southern Queensland, at all events, could hardly be better served. The contractors will be under no obligation in regard to the carriage of cargo; but, as I have already said, I think the requirements of Queensland in that respect can be more efficiently met by a line of steamers plying <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> Torres Straits. In the circumstances, I must vote against the amendment, which has been moved bv <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart.</inline></para>

I apprehend that the transparent blunder which some one has committed in the wording of this option agreement will have to be put right some day. Some one will have to own up and admit that he did not know what he was doing. I suppose it will be <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Croker.</inline> I do not blame the Postmaster-General, because I suppose he knew all about it, and was quite prepared to accept the gigantic steamers which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Croker</inline> was complacent enough to offer.

We can accept the proposal with more certainty than we could accept the terms of an agreement which the persons alleged to be pledged have not seen, or a warranty to a bond which apparently nobody has seen. I feel that I could not have made the remarks I made the other day without trifling unless I was prepared to give evidence of my belief in their validity bv supporting the amendment which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has moved. </para>

                            <para>. - The proviso has also to be considered in connexion with article 5, which provides that where the period of the voyage is reduced from 636 to 612 hours, the contractors shall be reimbursed the cost of extra coal and other incidental expenses in providing the accelerated service. I cannot see where any occasion for other incidental expenses could arise. To a very large extent, this provision would operate in favour of the contractors. Suppose, for instance, that with a large ship they managed to save thirty-six hours in running, they would make a considerable saving. And yet, in addition to that, it is proposed to give them an additional subsidy up to a sum of &#163;23,000. </para>

                                <para>- The proviso would empower the Postmaster-General to require an alteration in the rate of speed of the vessels. Consequently if the period of the voyage were altered from 636 to 612 hours the question of expense would arise. How it comes to be put in article 3 and not in article 5 I cannot understand. The latter prescribes how the Postmaster-General shall deal with the contractors when he asks for increased speed. The only consideration with me now is whether, if article 3 were approved, we could amend article 5. </para>

Surely extra labour would be incidental to the consumption of extra coal. The Navigation Commission, of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> was a member, has reported, and he ought to know that that Commission recognised the principle that manning ought to be regulated by coal consumption. </para>

                                <para>- Manning has a necessary relation to coal consumption. The present agreement involves the consumption of a certain amount of coal. Increased speed will mean extra consumption, and incidental to that will be extra cost for labour. Therefore, I think it is necessary that the article should be worded as it is. </para>

If they consumed extra coal in increasing the speed, they might say, &#34; We ought to have two or three more men,&#34; and charge that as an incidental expense. They would not be compelled to go to arbitration on that point any more than with regard to the extra allowance of &#163;25,000. </para>

                            <para>. - The Minister&#39;s explanation means that the Postmaster-General would, if he gave notice requiring an expedited service and&#39; found the cost too great, have the option of leaving the contract as it originally stood. But once he has given the notice the matter will not rest with him. The contractors can go on in accordance with his notice, and call upon the Postmaster-General either to pay its claim or submit the matter to arbitration. </para>

                                <para>- The Minister has offered an explanation which he must admit is not literally accurate. Once the notice has been given there will be no opportunity to draw back from it. It will be for the contr&#39;actor to determine whether he will agree to the expedited service or not. The adjustment of the additional price will be a matter for arrangement or arbitration, and the only question that can come before Parliament is that of the extension of the contract. I am not saying that this is a vital blot in the agreement, but I am pointing it out because the Minister seemed to hold a different view. I do not see that a matter of this kind&#39; can come before Parliament. It is one of adjusting little details for which the Government must take the responsibility. It does not follow, however, that we may not obtain an expedited service without paying an extra penny. I am not saying that we are likely to get it. But the word &#34; reimbursement &#34; is used. We call for a. superior service. If the contractors say that that entails additional expenditure, they will have to be paid for it. But they may put in superior machinery which will be more economically worked. It may be more profitable to them to give us an accelerated service without extra payment. It is only in case of additional outlay being caused to the company that the Commonwealth can be approached for additional payment. </para>

                            <para>. - I should like to reply briefly to the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline> The honorable senator has every right to be anxious as to what may be done by any future Postmaster-General and the contractors in the matter of increased speed ; and he pointed out that if a quicker service were desired, the fact would be intimated to the contractors, and the whole question would then be submitted to arbitration. In my opinion, there is nothing in the contract to prevent the present or any future Postmaster-General, before proceeding to the length indicated, from endeavouring to find out from the contractors the probable cost of the accelerated service; and the Government would certainly be guided by any suggestions or statements the contractors might make in this connexion. Of course, the contractors might refuse to give any hint as to the probable cost, and thereupon the Postmaster-General -would have to fall back on his powers under the contract. I have no doubt, however, that, in any such negotiations, the contractors would be very willing to assist in arriving at an agreement without resorting to arbitration ; but if the latter course were decided upon, then both parties would be on the same footing. I have no fear as to anything that may occur in this connexion under the conditions. </para>

                            <para>. - The south-west monsoon blows from Aden, in the Red Sea, towards Ceylon from the beginning of May to the end of September, or some time in October. If we allow an extended period! of thirty-six hours between Ceylon - which is the only place in question - and Aden, it will operate for about six months in the year, and will, therefore, be a considerable addition to the time mentioned in the contract. The contract between the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company and the Imperial Government contains a similar stipulation. </para>

                            <para>. - The best course the Government could take, in the interests of the people of the Commonwealth, would be to strike out this article. The Imperial contract referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane</inline> is an Indian contract, the circumstances of which are different from those under consideration. In order to steam against a southwest monsoon, simply a little additional power is required by the vessel, and I do not know why the Government have accepted this article. At the present time the southwest monsoon is blowing, and yet the boats of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company cover the voyage in exactly the same time as they did six months ago. </para>

It is probably very business-like on the part of the contractors to induce us to enter into an agreement which, to a considerable extent, is in their favour, and I have expressed the opinion that, under the conditions laid down, there is very little chance of a company being floated to undertake this service. </para>

                                <para>- We are now revising previous conditions, and, unless for good reasons shown, this article ought not to be inserted. It cannot be challenged, I think, that, with a head wind, the majority of up-to-date steamers are able to make better speed than they can attain with a fair wind, because the fires burn brighter and &#39;better steam is obtained. Every one knows that on their course to Brindisi these boats will has&#39;e to contend against no absolutely bad weather. If they had to go round the Horn it would be another question. I object to the proposed concession for what is an indefinite period. I may feel more strongly on the subject than do some other honorable senators, because I remember that the various States have adopted a load-line, and that whilst the Imperial Act provides that on the coast of Great Britain, during certain months of the year, a winter load-line shall be used, and some of our States have adopted a winter load-line for corresponding months in Australian seas, others of the States have claimed that we have no winter in Australia, and have refused to introduce that safeguard. The result is that, in the natter of loading ships, the men sailing round Australia are in a worse position than seamen in any other part of the British Dominions. </para>

                                <para>- The pressure of steam will force the ship through at her ordinary rate of speed with a head wind in anything like moderate weather. I challenge any member of the Committee to say that there is anything like bad weather on the track between Fremantle and1 Brindisi, unless a ship should happen to meet a typhoon, and such an experience might not occur once in ten years. I should add that typhoons are more likely to occur during the north-east monsoons than d&#39;uring the south-west monsoons. </para>

                                <para>- I remind the honorable senator that by this contract we are making provision in the interests of the company for all extraordinary circumstances. In the event of delay through &#34; the act of God, the King&#39;s enemies, or pirates,&#34; an extension of time is allowed under this contract. I contend that there is no necessity for the concession proposed, and I do not believe that we should jeopardize the contract by omitting the provision. I believe that if it be omitted, the contractors will be prepared to admit that there is no reason why they should be given an extra thirty-six hours in which to complete a voyage during the south-west monsoons. These winds blow when the sun is north of the line, and why should the company be given the additional time during six months of the year? </para>

                                <para>- It is, of course, an advantage to a shipping company to secure the longest extension of time they can. Between May and October the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company are allowed an extension of thirty-six hours on the voyage from Colombo to Brindisi. That is an indication that there is heavy weather to be met with between Colombo and Aden during that time of the year. As a matter of fact, it is found that the steamers must go a considerable distance south of their ordinary track to avoid the heavy monsoons. The south-west monsoons do not always blow with the same strength, but at times they bring on very heavy weather, and the steamers go south of their usual course, to avoid being deluged with water. That is the reason why the concession is asked for. </para>

                            <para>. - According to this article, the plans of new mail ships will be submitted to the sole approval of the representative of the Commonwealth Government in London. I admit that there may be very great difficulty in getting some person who will closely, and possibly more adequately represent the view of the Government, to approve of plans. It is very likely that the Ministry find it utterly impossible, at any rate, very difficult, to provide any other means. But that sort of approval of plans will not satisfy me. </para>

                                <para>- I am glad to get that information from the Minister. I think it may fairly be assumed that at the present time the Commonwealth Government has a representative in London. It would be rather dangerous to leave the approval of these plans solely in the hands of that officer, or possibly his successor. But if the Minister chooses to say that it is the intention of the Government to appoint a special and properly qualified man for the purpose I shall be glad to get the assurance. </para>

                                <para>- The use of the term&#34;representative&#34; in this article is misleading, and it was fair to assume that the approving officer would be the person whom we call the representative of the Government. But with the assurance that a properly qualified man will be chosen for the purpose, I shall say no more on that point. </para>

The plans of new ships might very well be submitted, in the first instance, to the representative of the Government in London, whomsoever he might be, but he should either be directed to forward them for the approval of the Government or receive instructions as to the nature of plans of which he might approve. </para>

                            <para>. - Most likely the Government will have a representative in London, and he will not be competent to criticise plans of steam-ships. Suppose that the Commonwealth were represented by a High Commissioner or by Captain Collins, undoubtedly he would appoint some person who had the necessary technical knowledge to advise him, and in the light of that advice he would approve of plans. It has been suggested that subsequently the plans should be sent out, and approved of by the Government. But the contractors would desire to begin the building of the ships immediately. The Government will have to oppose any alterations other than those to which we have agreed. </para>

                                <para>- The Minister has got into the same state of confusion as the agreement is in. Noone suggests that the Commonwealth Government shall consider the plans. Its approval is to be given through its expert. The article is extremely badly framed. No one desires to delay the approval of the contract for a moment. We wish to hasten it. Nor is it intended that an amendment shall be made which would embarrass the Government in any way. But it is right that it should be put on record that this point has been criticised, and that the explanation: of the Government should be forthcoming and recorded. What <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> points out is that owing to the unhappy phraseology used, this article may be understood to mean that the approval is to be that of the ordinary representative of the Government in London. That view is emphasized by the use of the word &#34; the&#34; That representative may be either Captain Collins, the High Commissioner, or some one else. </para>

                                <para>- I believe that that is the intention. It should be some one competent to give an intelligent approval of the plans. All that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> has done is to suggest an amendment. Whether it is pressed or not is another matter. I do not know that it need be. But he indicates that to carry out the intention it would be better to make the article read : &#34; A representative of the Government in London appointed for thepurpose.&#34; The High Commissioner would not be competent. He must have some one to advise him. It would be better if the article had been framed differently. But the Government has said - and its assurance in that respect may be accepted - that it is intended that a competent representative shall be appointed for the purpose. If the article is understood in that sense by the contractors there will be no trouble. </para>

I believe that the men who are going to plank down their money in this enterprise will take good care to build good up-to-date ships. They would be born idiots if they did not. But I do object to any whippersnapper having power to knock the contractors plans about for no good end. It would be far better for the Government to appoint an expert to do this work. If they do that I shall he perfectly satisfied. I recommend them to do it as soon as this contract is closed. </para>

                            <para>. - There is a difficulty that we are sure to incur, and be confronted with later on in relation to the tonnage of these ships. The matter has been so thoroughly thrashed out that we are all by this time agreed that the phrase &#34; 11,000 tons registered tonnage,&#34; as it stands, means if it is correctly interpreted, ships of a tonnage running, we will say, up to anything from 1 6,000 to 20,000 tons gross. If that is what it means, it may be said that the Commonwealth cannot lose by allowing the article to go as it stands. It has been urged by many honorable senators that if the boats represent 11,000 tons gross tonnage, we should be quite satisfied. If they represent a tonnage of very much more they will be equally satisfied. I am going, to assume that the phrase, &#34; 11,000 tons registered tonnage &#34; means what it should mean, and what we believe it means - boats of much larger gross tonnage. I believe personally that the phrase has got into the contract through a blunder. Some one put it in who did not understand what it meant, and it has been passed over by some one else who did not understand it. We may be confronted with the position that if we accept this contract the principals, when they are asked to ratify it, and discover that boats of 11,000 tons registered tonnage are provided for, may say, &#34; We decline to go on ; there has been an absurd blunder. &#34; I do not believe that we have power to bind them. Suppose the principals&#39; say, &#34; This contract binds us to build ships of something like 16,000 or 20,000 gross tonnage, and we decline to do so.&#34; What will be the position of the Government? Where will the Commonwealth be? We shall certainly, in my opinion, have the Government coming back to Parliament because the principals will decline to go on. If that be so - and I think I have shown good grounds for the opinion - is it wise for us to let this, article pass as it stands, with the sure and certain consequence, in my view, that the principals in England will formally repudiate it, and ask the Government to request Parliament to amend it? I am quite sincere in mv desire to get the contract through. I will not even move an amendment. But I must point out the difficulty that I believe the Government will be confronted with, and I hope they realize it. If the contractors say they will not build such boats as are provided, the Government will have to come to it again to alter the contract. Does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> propose to run that risk, in order to get the contract through without amendment? </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator KEATING</inline>(Tasmania- Honorary Minister &#91;2.59&#93;. - I recognise the difficulties that present themselves to my honorable friend&#39;s mind, and probably to the minds of other honorable senators. But I am not authorized to ask for any amendment in connexion with this article. I go further, and say that I am not authorized on behalf of the Government to consent to any amendment in it. Even assuming that events did turn out as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> suggests that they will, I do not think that the contractors would be able to repudiate the bargain made for them by their accredited agent. If it were necessary - I do not say for a moment that it will be - to come down to Parliament again with a proposal for the amendment of the contract as ratified, well, then, it would be. for Parliament to decide the matter upon its merits. </para>

The law is very clear, and the position is serious : but I am prepared to leave the responsibility with the Government. I feel sure that the law will enable any person who feels aggrieved to bring an action against the contractors if they do not carryout what the law requires in reference to the registered tonnage. If the Government are prepared to take responsibility, I shall say no more, because I have no desire to upset the contract. </para>

If the Government have, in the interval, approached <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Croker,</inline> and pointed out to him the difficulties which have arisen in regard to the interpretation of the article, they may be in possession of information that will make it unnecessary to prolong this debate. It is possible that the Government have taken such a step, but, if so, we have not heard of it ; and, therefore, I should assume that they have done nothing. but have left <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Croker</inline> to suffer because of his own blunder. </para>

                                <para>- No doubt. It -would not have taken the Government long to cable to the principals asking whether they intend to construct vessels of 11,000 tons registered tonnage, or vessels of 11,000 tons gross tonnage. If we had that information we should know clearly what the contract is that we are asked to approve. My chief objection to this article, as I said yesterday, is that it contains a phrase about which there is a good deal of uncertainty. To put the matter another way, we are asked to affirm a contract containing a condition which renders it very uncertain whether it will be carried out when it comes to be considered by the principals. Even now, without delaying matters, there is time to cable to England. I have no desire to lecture the Government, but it would have been far better policy to settle the matter in the way I have suggested. </para>

                                <para>- I have already given honorable senators my authority for the opinion I hold, and the only contradiction I have heard is that supplied by the British Merchant Shipping Act. I hold, however, that we are not making this agreement under that Act, but are making it in terms well understood by shipbuilders and shippers generally. Considering the heckling the Government got in another place, and the debates in this Chamber, they would have been well advised to obtain some fresh information for honorable senators. Apparently the Government are themselves not sure of their ground; and, if that be so, they have had sufficient time to make themselves conversant with the facts. If we make any amendment that would have the effect of lessening the tonnage specified, we may be contracting for smaller vessels than are now contemplated, and if,&#34; registered &#34; means &#34; gross,&#34; there is no difficulty in the way. </para>

I should like to say, however, that all through the discussion I have felt that there are a few honorable senators who seem to be desirous to limit the contractors to supplying very small vessels in the Australian service. </para>

                                <para>- Those honorable senators seem anxious for a provision to enable the contractors to run any kind of little fishing smacks, so long as they can carry a few bags of mails between England and Australia. That, however, is not my view of the matter. I probably speak feelinglv. because I am not a good sailor, and, when making a voyage, prefer as large a vessel as possible. If the contractors desire to give us vessels of a registered tonnage of 11,000 tons, why should we complain? If the vessels supplied are of 20,000 tons gross, so much the better for the travelling public. However, we do not seem to know what is meant by the phrase. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie are both nautical experts. They were members of the Royal Commission on Navigation, and, although they might not have known a ship from a soapbox previously, they are now absolute experts on all questions of navigation. And at what conclusions have they arrived ?, Judging from the record of their speeches, they have made the position as clear as mud can make it. As to a vessel of 11,000 tons, there is a difference of 5,000 tons between the interpretations placed by those honorable senators on the phrase &#34; registered tonnage.&#34; It would be absolutely unreasonable to ask honorable senators to take any notice whatever of such &#34; experts.&#34; I am half inclined to follow every step of the road taken by the uninitiated Ministry - men who know so little about shipping that possibly <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Croker</inline> has &#34; taken them &#39;down.&#34; It may be, however, that the Government have &#34; taken down&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Croker;</inline> but what has really occurred I am not yet prepared to say. </para>

                        <para class="block">We have been told to-day that it does not matter whether this is gross or registered tonnage. Authorities have been quoted to prove that the register of a ship at Lloyds may be interpreted as registered tonnage under this contract. I say the thing is absolutely preposterous, and the man who uses an argument of that sort only shows his entire ignorance of everything connected with shipping. What is the object of registration? It is that the ships registered shall come under British law. An unregistered ship is exactly in the same position as a person who is not a naturalized subject. I first discovered that the object of registration was to bring a ship under the application of British laws, as the result of a bitter experience, when a vessel was sunk in one of the South Australian Gulfs. Three men lost their lives in the disaster, but no action could be brought against the ship because she was not registered. If these ships were registered at Lloyds, would that registration permit them to fly the Commonwealth flag, of which we are all so proud? It would not. There is a clause in this contract providing that these ships shall . fly the Australian flag. I am very glad to see that clause, and will support it. </para>

It has been suggested during the debate that as these ships are to be registered in Australia, the registration may take place under some other law than the Merchant Shipping Act. But that could not be done, because the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act respecting the registration of ships apply to the whole of the King&#39;s Dominions, and to every part of the known world to which His Majesty&#39;s jurisdiction extends. There is no escape from the fact that&#39; the ships must be registered under the Merchant Shipping Act. The provision dealing with the subject will be found in Part 1 of the Merchant Shipping Act, section 2, which reads - </para>

                                <para>- I should like to reply to the interjection that these contractors are Scotchmen. I do not know that Croker is a Scotchman, and, so far as I know, the firm of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir James</inline> Laing and Sons Limited is a North of England firm, and not a Scotch firm. I do not attribute all the virtues to the Scotch, but they are not to be led into a contract without knowing what it is. The view I take is that I am being asked personally to sign this contract on behalf of the people of South Australia, and I wish to know what I am signing. The contract says that we are to have ships of not less than 11,000 tons register. I have no doubt that the contract was considered by the Cabinet.. There are two members of the Cabinet present, and I wish to know from them what was the opinion of the Cabinet as to the size of these ships. </para>

A ship which is not registered according to British law is in exactly the same position as an alien who has refused to become a naturalized British subject.

                            <para>. - I am quite willing to tell the honorable senator, if he wishes to know, exactly what the Government considered that they would get under the contract which they were signing. I have heard many arguments on this point while I have been sitting very quietly in my chair. The first question I heard was &#34; Why did you stipulate for boats of 11,000 tons?&#34; It was said that if this was only a mail contract we need have vessels of not more than a few hundred tons. Then we were told that &#34; 11,000 tons registered tonnage &#34; meant quite a different thing - that it meant something like 15,000 or 22,000 tons gross. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> however, informed us that such ships could not go through the Suez Canal, or enter our ports. Now he has told us that ships of 11,000 tons gross register would not have sufficient space for carrying refrigerated produce. First he said that we want small ships for carrying our mails, and, secondly, that we want large ships to enable produce to be conveyed. The Government has considered this matter of registration. They think that what is&#39; meant is gross tonnage. We should be satisfied if the company built vessels larger than 11,000 tons gross, but we consider that for our purposes vessels of that size would be ample. We leave it to the contractors to say whether in the management of their business they consider that larger ships are necessary ; and if so, we shall be very pleased to have them provided. </para>

                            <para>. - I hold in my hand a publication, a perusal of which shows me that we have had a great deal of talk about a very simple matter. The document is the report of a Royal Commission which sat in England some years ago to inquire into the mercantile marine. It shows that Senator de Largie&#39;s contention in respect of tonnage is absolutely correct - that registered tonnage means not only gross but also net tonnage. There is not only registered gross tonnage, but also registered net tonnage ; but in all cases the registered gross tonnage comes first. For instance, the list of ships contains the name of one which is well known to all Australians, the <inline font-style="italic">Suevic</inline> of the White Star line. The particulars concerning her are taken from the register. In one column is entered her gross registered tonnage, and in another sub-division her net registered tonnage. The gross registered tonnage is 12,499,and the net registered tonnage 8,180. Both are registered tonnages. That is the contention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie. In the case of this Contract I have no doubt that 11, 000 tons means gross tonnage. At any rate, the words carry that implication, as net tonnage is put in a secondary position in the document before me. Lloyds&#39; Register differs only from the register under the Merchant Shipping Act in this respect: that it includes not only registrations under that Act, but also foreign registrations. That is to say, Lloyds is the register under the Merchant Shipping Act, plus a register of foreign vessels. </para>

There are many British ships on the British register that are not registered at Lloyds at all. Many are registered with the French <inline font-style="italic">Vois Veritas.</inline> Some register with a German Association. Lloyds&#39; Register is merely a classification for insurance purposes. Lloyds is an insurance institution. It has nothing to do with the law. There is no statutory provision that gives any recognition to Lloyds. </para>

                                <para>- This is too big a matter for us to consider the trifling inconvenience of a Minister who wants to catch his train. It will affect every living soul in this Commonwealth for the next ten years. That is a far more important consideration than whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> shall go to Adelaide to-night. Up till just now we had been unable to obtain from the Government any declaration of what was meant by registered tonnage. Now the Minister tells, us that the Government understands it to mean gross tonnage. . Why was not the other branch of the &#39; Legislature informed of that ? In my opinion, this is too important a matter&#39; to be rushed through at the end of the week. The public ought to have an opportunity of considering it. </para>

                                <para>- It is a long story, and I know that some honorable senators are anxious to catch the train. If, however, the Government will agree to an adjournment, I shall promise to lay the whole facts before honorable senators next week. This was not a matter of combining the various shipping companies, but of keeping in existence the great industry of shipbuilding in Great Britain. The whole scheme was engineered by one of the largest shipbuilders at Home; and&#34; it was pointed out in an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> that it did not matter where the registered office of the combination was, or under which flag the vessel sailed, because the hub of the combine would be at Belfast where the ships were built. All I propose by the new article is that if we take over these ships, the only value recognised shall be that of the vessels themselves, and not the values shown in the books. This is a clear cut proposition which, I think, will appeal to every honorable senator. In such a transaction, no goodwill should be considered ; and here I may say that in Adelaide, in connexion with the Tramway Company, the Government have had to pay according to the value of the shares. In six years&#39; time if we have to take over these vessels, we shall have to beware of the booming of shares on the Exchange, or we shall find&#39; ourselves in a big hole. The. sole object of the proposition is to make it clear that the ships shall be taken over at their real, and not their book, value. </para>

The matter is one of very great importance to South Australia. I have said that the State Government are making provision at very great cost to give facilities for these ships, and yet under this clause, as soon as the Outer Harbor works are completed, these vessels need not go to the port at all, because there will be no Adelaide under this clause when those works are completed. </para>

There are very strong reasons why those provisions should be made. For instance, in their report, the Butter Commission say - </para>

                            <para>After much deliberation upon the evidence regarding ocean freights, we are of opinion that this is one of the most pressing questions concerning the butter industry. It is also a question of vital importance to the Commonwealth, inasmuch as the majority of our rural producers are interested in the export of butter. This trade, therefore, may now be recognised as one of the most important to the people of Australia. , </para>
                            <para>Since the inception of the export trade in butter, the carriage of this product has been practically in the hands of the mail companies. Whilst readily acknowledging the fact that the facilities offered by the mail companies assisted the butter industry at its inception, the present action of these companies in endeavouring to secure a contract for a number of years at a trivial reduction on the existing high rates. must be looked upon in the light of the evidence, as in attempt to monopolize the trade. </para>

                                <para>- It is supported by evidence which was adduced by the very gentleman who signed this contract on behalf of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir James</inline> Laing and Sons. It has been explained by the Honorary Minister that the Government took the view that the contract ought not to deal with the question of cold storage, because the State Governments would not guarantee to fill a certain amount of space in each ship. But I take up the position that it is not our place to be guided by a recommendation from the StatesPemiers. Probably each senator represents more persons in his State than does its Premier. In South Australia, for instance, it is quite possible for its Premier to be a member of the Legislative Council, and, having been elected on a property qualification, to represent only a third of the population of the State. The present Premier is, I&#39; admit, the representative of the State, but he is returned for a suburban constituency. A senator, however, is elected on an adult suffrage, and it is our duty to look after the interests of our producers when we are asked to ratify a contract of this kind. I can only imagine that the grant of this subsidy of &#163;125,000 is based on two considerations - one being to secure the carriage of a few tons of mails and the other to insure regularity in delivery. But for the necessity to secure regular delivery, we could get our mail matter carried for &#163;5,000 a year under the poundage system. When we are making a present of &#163;100,000 to the contractors, we have a right, I submit, to require that they shall provide sufficient cool storage on each ship for carrying a portion of our produce. I may mention that, as the result of the inquiries by the Butter Commission, the rate of freight for butter has fallen from11/8d. to3/8d. per lb. The position in Australia is a serious one. Butter is carried to London from Riga, in Russia, at 24s. per ton, and from Australia at &#163;7 per ton. If we desire to hold1 the European market, ought we not to fake advantage of this opportunity to out our producers on equal terms with their competitors in that market? &#163;125,000 a year is too large a price to pay for the carriage of mail matter, unless the contract secures to the Commonwealth other advantages.
