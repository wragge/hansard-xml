                            <para>- Arising out of the answer, I wish to ask the Minister whether it is possible that the tenders that will be submitted to the Government can' under any circumstances, induce them to alter the port of arrival for the mail boats from Launceston to any other . port? I hope that I have made my question intelligible. I want to know if it is within the consideration of the Government to prevent mail boats from going to Launceston. </para>

            <para class="block">It is customary - almost invariably - when application is made to introduce a Bill for it to be allowed to go as formal. But I suppose it is necessary for me to say a few words of explanation on this occasion. I cannot produce a copy of my Bill, because I have not obtained leave to introduce it. The object that I desire to achieve is to follow the course of procedure now being taken in the Imperial Parliament, to allow appeals against conviction on matters of fact as well as on matters of law. Of course, there is a right of appeal on matters of law, but on matters of fact - no matter how transparently wrong a verdict may. prove to be on the production of further evidence - at present, there is nothing to be done but to seek the Royal pardon for an offence that has not been committed. While it is possible 'to litigate over a matter of or <inline font-style="italic">£10,</inline> having appeal after appeal - while in respect of a bank note or a trifling matter of property, it is possible for a litigant to pursue his case through Court after Court - there is no right of appeal except on a bare question of law where a man's life or liberty is at stake. This Commonwealth has, in the course of five years, created an abnormal number of new offences. We have created them by the score in one Act after another. I simply ask leave for permission to bring in a Bill which will more adequately specify all that I desire to achieve, than I can possibly explain it at the present time. I hope that leave will be given. The Bill will then .be introduced, and honorable senators will understand precisely what I desire to do. That will be more satisfactory than debating the Bill in advance. </para>

        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir JOSIAH</inline>SYMON (South Australia) [2.50]. - There ought not to be a moment's hesitation in granting to my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild1,</inline> the leave that he desires. As he has pointed out, it is the invariable parliamentary custom for motions of this kind to be treated as formal. The honorable senator would be at a considerable disadvantage in attempting to explain the provisions of such a Bill as he has indicated1 before copies of it were in the hands of honorable senators. But I should like to say that my honorable friend is undertaking - I knew that his sense of responsibility is very keen - a large matter. In the first place his real object seems to be to establish a Court of Criminal Appeal in relation, I take it, to Commonwealth offences. </para>

                    <para>- My honorable friend quite appreciates the fact that in regard to' the administration of the general criminal law we have no jurisdiction or control. Nor has the High Court; nor would it be desirable that the Commonwealth should interfere with the general administration of the criminal law of this country. I should like my honorable friend to consider, in preparing his Bill,, how far there should be an appeal from the verdict of a jury on a question of fact to Judges sitting on the bench. Of course, 'the underlying principle of the criminal law of England, which applies throughout the British Empire, is that a jury is the final arbiter on all questions of fact; and it will require grave consideration - which I am sure my honorable friend will give to it - to frame a measure that will not be at variance with that great principle, that can be carried out with due regard to the effective administration of criminal justice, and that at the same time will preserve the distinction between questions of law and questions of fact. At the present moment, certainly in my own State, there is no appeal whatever from the verdict of a jury in any case where there has been a criminal trial, except that the learned Judge may reserve some point of law for the consideration of! the Full Court. That is the only possibility of appeal in connexion with criminal procedure. Therefore, my honorable friend's proposal is one out of which some important questions may arise. I am sure that he appreciates the issues, and that he will provide us with a Bill that will give us matter for grave consideration in connexion with the subject with which he has undertaken to deal. </para>

                    <para class="block">I shall be as brief as possible in submitting this motion, and shall not quote any more figures than are absolutely necessary for the purpose of proving my case. I admit at once that it may be charged against me that this motion, if carried, would act inequitably to some States. But while I reply that there is only one State that has any serious cause for objection to the motion, and while I admit that my proposal does appear to be inequitable to that State, the view which I take is that it is only by means of the bookkeeping system that perfect equity in the distribution of surplus revenue can be maintained. But does the present bookkeeping system achieve for us any real and true Federation? I say that it assuredly does not;. seeing that we have not any bookkeeping system for dealing with the expenditure. The' Treasurer, in delivering his Budget in another place 011 Tuesday, mentioned a number of. items of expenditure. Amongst them is a proposal to .spend £37,000 in the construction of a telephone system between Melbourne and Sydney. No one, I am sure, will contend for a moment that the State which I represent will derive any benefit from that expenditure. I merely use this item as an illustration - I think a forcible one - to show that our present system of distributing surplus revenue under the bookkeeping system, and distributing new expenditure according to the population of the different States, is inconsistent, and utterly opposed to the true spirit of Federation. While those two systems are running; side by side, it is impossible that there can be a true Federal spirit created amongst the people of Australia, and especially in those States which seem to suffer most. We know that the consuming . power per head depends largely on the proportion of adult males in each State. The enormous discrepancy between the amount contributed per head to the Customs and Excise revenue in Western Australia, and the amount contributed per head in the other States, has been almost entirely due to the cause 1 have mentioned. We must remember, however, that there are large areas of unexplored country in South Australia, Queensland, and the far back portions of New South Wales, which may at any time attract a rush of population for the purpose of developing mining or other newly-discovered resources. It seems possible, and, in fact, probable, that for many years we shall be subject to changing conditions, with the accompanying, result of an excess of males over females and children in particular States. To-day the excess is in Western Australia,, but next year it may be in some other State, possibly Queensland, South Australia, or New South Wales, or even, to some extent, in the more thickly populated State of Victoria, or the smaller State of Tasmania. These conditions could not, of course, operate to so large an extent in the latter places, but we may find them present in the larger States as time goes on. The present dissatisfaction, which exists in Tasmania - I leave honorable senators to speak for other States - was foreseen bv the keenest financial minds at the Federal Convention ; and in support of my contention I shall read some brief extracts from the report pf the Convention "debates. In my remarks under this head, I am subject to correction, because there are in this chamber several senators who were members of the Convention. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon, Senator Dobson, Senator Fraser, Senator Walker,</inline> and also the President, were members of the Convention, and they will recollect what took place. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner fought strenuously from beginning to end for the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> system of distributing the surplus revenue, and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Holder, who was also regarded' as a financial expert, favoured that system, only accepting the bookkeeping proposal for five years as a. compromise. Then I think I am right in saying that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> favoured the system. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Isaacs</inline>moved accordingly. I quote these extracts to show that the members of the Convention foresaw the great disarrangement of the finances which must ensue in some of the States, owing to the operation of Inter-State free-trade. That disarrangement has been greater in two of the States - especially in Tasmania - than in the other States ; and it is that fact which prompts me to submit this motion. I invite honorable senators, who are likely to oppose the proposal I now make, to note the amounts collected in Tasmania from Excise and 'Customs in the three years preceding Federation. In 1898 the amount collected from this source in Tasmania was ?429,700; in 1899 it was ?440,660; and in 1900 it was , ?492,459. Now observe the difference since Federation - the great loss to the Tasmanian Treasurer. I speak of this as a loss to the Tasmanian Treasurer as distinct from a loss to the people. In 1901-2 the amount collected from Customs and Excise in Tasmania was ?315,540, though I think the Federal Tariff did not apply to the whole of that financial year; in 1902-3 the amount was ?301,978; in 1903-4 it was ?263,191; in 1904-5 it was ?259,099 ; and in 1905-6 the estimated amount was . ?247,162, but I believe, though I am not sure, that there was a little increase on the estimate. </para>

                            <para>- I shall do so later. That there is ample justification for a motion of this kind by a Tasmanian senator is shown in the fact that the revenue which has flowed into the Tasmanian Treasury for the needs of that State since Federation, has gradually dwindled from an average of ?450,000, prior to Federation, to the" amounts I have just mentioned. It must be patent to any one that such a. serious disarrangement of the finances, particularly in a small State, the total revenue of which was, before Federation, only about ?1,000,000, all told, must cause great trouble to the Government in finding the money necessary to carry on the work of the State. In this connexion it is interesting to look at a table submittedby <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, when making his Budget speech on Tuesday last, showing the gain or. loss to each State in Customs) and Excise revenue from 1 st July, 1901, to the 30th June, 1907, on the basis of the revenue received in 1900 in each State. I may say that I do not regard that as a fair basis, because, in consequence of merchants loading up in view of the Federal Tariff, the revenue received in the former year was rather greater than it otherwise would have been. New South Wales, under the Federal Tariff, has made a total gain of £7,475,188. </para>

                            <para>- I am not . saying that this has been a gain to the Western Australian taxpayers. I have already said that I am putting the matter from the point of view of the States- Treasurers: If it will satisfy <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> I am prepared to admit that one of the reasons for which I advocated Federation in Tasmania was that I thought that in that State too much money was being raised from Customs taxation prior to Federation, and I thought that the amount raised in that way would be less after Federation. I am dealing with this subject from the point of view of the Tasmanian Treasurer, whose financial arrangements have been so completely upset. The Western Australian Treasurer, if I must put it in thai way, has been a gainer under the system adopted to the extent of £468,122 under the operation of the ordinary Tariff. Victoria has gained £19,431. Queensland has lost £2.608,208, and Tasmania' has lost £908,112. </para>

                            <para>- I was not aware that I had done so. South Australia has gained to the extent of £59,337. I wish to make it clear that these figures include the Treasurer's estimate of revenue for the current financial year ending 30th. June, 1907. These are the facts under the existing system, and it will be interesting to honorable senators to know what the position would have been under the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> system of distribution of revenue. I shall give the figures for Tasmania for 1901-2, although, as that was the year in which there was so complete a disorganization of business, it can hardly be accepted as a fair basis. If the surplus: revenue had been distributed on the <inline font-style="italic">percapita</inline> basis, Tasmania would have gained' in. that year £11,040. In 1902-3, she would have received an additional sum of £62,161; in 1903-4, <inline font-style="italic">£65,332;</inline> in 1904-5,£57,450; and for 1905-6, according to the estimate of the Treasurer, the amount which she would have received' in addition would have been £52,786. Though Tasmania has suffered greatly in loss of revenue since Federation, Queensland has suffered in a much greater degree,, and the Treasurer of that State must have been inconvenienced in his financial arrangements, even to a greater extent than the Treasurer of Tasmania. </para>

                            <para>- I ask the honorable senator not to put such totally irrelevant questions. I do not object to interjections, but a question of that sort is irrelevant. It is quite probable thai Tasmania has not gained anything like . as much from the totalizator as has Western Australia. It is notorious that the totalizator in Western Australia brings in more revenue than in any other State of the Federation. I have stated the amount by which Tasmania would have gained in revenue under the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> system of distribution. </para>

                            <para>- I have been asked by honorable senators to quote the figures for the other States, and I think it will be sufficient to quote those for Queensland. Under the actual distribution which has taken place, Queensland received in 1901-2 £904,775. If the surplus revenue had been distributed on the basis of population, she would have received , £947,284, or an increase of £42,509. In 1902-3 Queensland would have gained by the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> system of distribution to the extent of ; £142,974; in1903-4,£132,439; in 1904-5, £163,828; and, according to the Treasurer's estimate for the current year, she would gain to the extent of £139,000. Honorable senators representing Queensland might, in the circumstances, be anxious to see some system adopted for the distribution of the revenue other than that which is at present in force. </para>

                            <para>- Although, on the figures, Queensland as compared with Tasmania might appear to be in very much the worse position, there can be no doubt that that State has received a great deal of consideration in the matter of the bounties on sugar grown by white labour, which I ardently supported, and I am inclined to think that if there be a Cinderella in the Federation, it is Tasmania. In order that the position may be thoroughly understood, it is absolutely necessary, in dealing with this matter, to place side by side with the revenue figures the figures showing the actual expenditure and the expenditure debited to each of the States. From these figures it will be seen that the finances of Tasmania are affected in both ways. There has been, as I have shown, a very serious disarrangement of the finances of that State as the result of decreased revenue every year since Federation. But Tasmania has also been debited with expenditure very largely in excess of the amount which has been actually expended in the State. </para>

                            <para>- I direct the attention of honorable senators to the figures connected with the expenditure. Tasmania in 1901-2 was debited with a total expenditure amounting to £158,982, whilst there was actually expended in that year in the State, only £149,654, or some £10,000, in round figures, less' than the expenditure with which the State was debited. In 1902-3 Tasmania was debited with £154,521, whilst the amount actually expended was .£140,604. In 1903-4, the figures debited were £^182,654, actually expended, £168,098 <inline font-style="italic">;</inline> in 1904-5, debited, £[185,712, actually expended, ^165,154; and for 1905-6, the actual figures are not yet available. Honorable senators will see that for every year during the past five years, Tasmania has been debited with sums varying from ,£10,000 to £20,000 in excess of the money actually expended in the State. I am therefore justified in saying that in a financial sense, the State which I represent has had to suffer in both ways. As I said at the outset, a number of new items of expenditure are included in the Treasurer's Budget speech, and I am satisfied that under the present system of allocating new expenditure according to population, Tasmania is likely to be a greater sufferer in the ensuing, year than she was in the past. I may refer to one item of £37,000, which it is proposed shall be spent on the telephone line connecting Melbourne and Sydney. If this is a necessary service, it would be unfederal of me to object to it. But I can surely claim some sympathy for Tasmania in this respect. So long as these heavy items of new expenditure are to be distributed on the population basis, it seems distinctly unfederal that the present bookkeeping method' should be continued, so far as revenue is concerned. </para>

                            <para>- In 1901-2 the amount debited to Western Australia was £339,589, and the amount expended was £328,324. In 1902-3 the amount debited to the State was £365,000 and the amount expended was £348,000. In 1903-4 the amount debited to the State was ^429,661, and the amount expended was .£405, 000. In 1904-5 the amount debited to the State was -£400.464, and the amount expended was £397,728. I am not Quite sure, but I think that the figures are exclusive of the expenditure on defence. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, because side by side with that system of distributing the expenditure is the book-keeping system of distributing the revenue. Cannot the honorable senator see the point? I am quite willing that " new " expenditure should be distributed on  a population basis in Tasmania if he would agree that the Federal revenue, should be distributed on that basis. Probably I have used sufficient figures to weary honorable senators, and I shall not weary them any longer in that way. I admit that Western Australia would seem to be treated unfairly if, after October next, we were to adopt straight away the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> system of distributing the revenue. Even although the discrepancy between the consuming power of the population of Western Australia and that of other States is very great, it is gradually and rapidly diminishing. The last Budget shows that in that State the contribution per head to the Customs and Excise revenue has decreased from £5 16s. 4d. in 1901-2 to ,£3 12s. 5d. - that is estimated - in the current year, being a decrease of £2 3s. nd. To show how nearly .that' approximates to the consuming power of the population of other States. I may mention that in the current year the Treasurer estimates that the contribution per head to the Customs and Excise revenue will be -£2 4s. <inline font-style="italic">yd.</inline> in New South Wales, <inline font-style="italic">-C2</inline> is. 8d. in Victoria. .£2 3s. in Queensland. £t 16s. in South Australia. £3 12s. t;d in Western Australia, and £1 1.6s. id. in Tasmania. While I admit that as regards Western Australia the discrepancy in the contribution per head is very large, and that necessarily the adoption ' of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> system of distributing the revenue would work a seeming injustice to that State, I submit that after October next there should be a financial re-adjustment in the interests of other States, particularly Tasmania. Now, how are we going to effect that re-adjustment without doing a seeming injustice to Western Australia? A suggestion has occurred to me. Certainly it originated with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker,</inline> because in poring over the debates on the financial clause of the Constitution in the Convention, I found that, after all- the keenest financial minds had discussed the question from every possible point of view, and had agreed to the present system, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> was still of his original opinion. Here, perhaps, I ought tq do justice to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> bysaying that one cf the most statesmanlike speeches on this subject made in the Convention was made by him. Although I do not often agree with him in politics, still, I think that I ought to pay him that tribute. </para>

At any rate, I believe that Tasmania might have got a fairer deal, and that special arrangements might have been made in the interests of her finances just as was done in the case of Western Australia. Now, how are we going, without doing an injustice to Western Australia, to readjust this financial system, which admittedly is causing so much dissatisfaction in the States, and which is a constant bar to the growth of the Federal spirit, which we all wish to see growing. </para>

                            <para>- I am not jealous that Victoria has benefited in that way. It reflects credit upon her statesmen that before the consummation of the Union they had adopted a policy which afterwards enabled their manufacturers to swamp other States, and probably to knock out a few small manufacturers in Tasmania. Can we readjust the financial system without doing an injustice to Western Australia, and without, at the same time, putting her Government to a great deal of inconvenience such as other States have been put to? One way out of the difficulty has occurred to me, and I hope that it will be discussed by honorable senators from their particular point of view. Perhaps better suggestions may be offered for the solution of the difficulty. When the time arrives to take a vote I can say whether I shall submit my proposal or not. If we take the difference between the amount which Western Australia would1 have received under the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> system during the last financial year, and the amount which she did receive under the present system, of" course excluding her receipts under her special Tariff, we shall find that it amounts to £400,000. Would it not be fair to take that amount as a basis, and to say that the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> system of distribution should come into force in October next, and that there should be made to that State a special vote for a period of five years, but decreasing bv twenty per cent, in each year. In the first year, she would get one-fifth less than £400,000, that is £320,000, and in each following, year she would get £80,000 less than in the previous year until the vote disappeared. </para>

                            <para>- I am not asking for a special donation for Tasmania. If the representatives of Western Australia will only remember how the discrepancy in consuming power has been disappearing, they may come to the conclusion that it will continue to disappear at the rate of about twenty per cent, in each year during the next five years. Possibly, if it has disappeared by the end of that term, Western Australia will have nothing to complain about. What we do. contend is that we should end the present unfortunate system of dividing the revenue in one manner and the expenditure in another. If any method can be devised or any suggestion thrown out during the debate which would be acceptable to the majority of honorable senators from other States, and would not work injustice to Western Australia, the discussion will not have been in vain. I ask honorable senators to remember that the State which I represent has been struck at both ends. Her Treasurer and her Governments have, for the last five years, been considerably inconvenienced - perhaps more inconvenienced than the Government of any other State except Queensland. We shall never have a real and true Federation until a true system of dealing with finance is adopted. I am a Federalist, and always have been. I am as sincere a Federalist to-day as ever I was. But I recognise that, until the present system is altered, it will be impossible to create a better Federal feeling in the minds of the Tasmanian electors that is there to-day. Wherever a Federal member goes on to the platform, in any portion of Tasmania - even in the remotest parts of the State, where one might think that the people would not take much interest in politics, and especially in financial questions - he invariably meets with an expression of the feeling that Tasmania is not receiving fair treatment. I always reply to such criticism : " It is simply constitutional ; it cannot be altered, and you cannot, strictly speaking, call it unfair treatment." Then the argument used is, " The system should be altered in fairness to this State." It is impossible to make any elector in Tasmania see the fairness of a financial system which adopts two methods of distribution for revenue and expenditure. I hope that those honorable senators who address themselves to the motion will do so in the same spirit as I have endeavoured to maintain. I trust that those who think their States would be disadvantaged or unfairly treated if my motion were carried, even with the suggestion which I have thrown out, will try to look at the subject from the point of view of the people of a State where the disarrangement of the finances has caused so much trouble and complaint, and has prevented the growth of that Federal spirit which I am sure we all wish to see nourished. </para>

                    <para class="block">O'Keefe with a great deal of interest. He has placed the matter very fairly before us. I point out to him, however, that if he will turn to the Treasurer's Budget speech, delivered on Tuesday last, he will find that- the Government has fully dealt with this matter. We realize the difficulties under which some of the States are laboring under the present manner of distribution. But any system except that which we have adopted would have been unfair to some States. The system recommended by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe</inline> would have been grossly unfair to Western Australia. In some of the States the revenue derived from Customs and Excise amounts to <inline font-style="italic">£4</inline> and over per head of the population ; in other States it does not amount to half so much. If we were to distribute that revenue on a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> basis, some States would therefore be robbed at the expense of others. Tasmania may think that she is injured by the existing system. Personally, I fail to see that she has been injured to any great extent. At the present time she is getting the whole of her share of the revenue collected from Customs and Excise after the Commonwealth has taken a proportion to cover necessary expenditure. </para>

                            <para>- I prefer to rely upon an actuality, not an estimate. I find that the figures for 1905-6 show that the Customs and Excise receipts for Tasmania per head of population in successive years from J900 to 1905-6 were £2 16s. 6|d., <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> 15s. 2fd., £z 2s. rod., £2 os. 8£d., <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> 18s. r|d., <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> 16s. 8Jd., and <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> 16s. ojd. In Western Australia, however, the receipts in the first year were £5 6s. 2d. per head of the population. They rose to £5 16s. 4¾d. in 1901-2. In the next year they dropped to £5 8s., then to <inline font-style="italic">£4.</inline> 13s. <inline font-style="italic">£4</inline> 4s. 11¾d., and <inline font-style="italic">£3</inline> 14s. <inline font-style="italic">9%d.</inline> So that apparently the consumption of Western, Australia is gradually coming down to something like the level reached in the other States of the Commonwealth. It may come down further within the next five years. </para>

                            <para>- These figures show the reasons why Tasmania is receiving so small an amount per head of population, and they also show why. if the distribution were made all over the Commonwealth per head of population, Tasmania would gain largely at the expense of her neighbours. Even supposing that an injustice is inflicted upon her now, which I do not conceive to be the case, if effect were given to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe's</inline> motion a considerably greater injustice would be inflicted upon other States. </para>

The " other " expenditure is divided amongst the' State on a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> basis. Western Australia is a go-ahead State, requiring a large number of new works. Since <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner provided that all new public works should be paid' for out of "other" expenditure, Western Australia, so far as concerns money spent on public works, has apparently had more than her fair share. But it must be recollected that, although that may be the case, the State that is gaining least from this system is Victoria. Victoria has not had anything like the amount of " other " . expenditure within her territory that little Tasmania has had in proportion to population. At the present time we are building a fort at Hobart. The payment is debited to "other" expenditure. </para>

                            <para>- So far as concerns the distribution of revenue on a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> basis a paper distributed by the Treasurer shows what the effect would have been, if the distribution had been made on the basis of population. First the table shows the actual amount distributed, and then the amount that would have been distributed if on the basis of population. In the first year of the existence of the Commonwealth we find that New South, Wales would have gained £192,534; Victoria £344,271 ; Queensland ,£42,509, and South Australia '£67,902. Western Australia, however, would have lost, if the amounts paid to the State Treasurers had been distributed on the basis of population, £658,256 in that one year. Tasmania would have gained the very small amount of £11,040. In the following year the tables would have been turned against New South Wales, which, instead of a gain., would have experienced a loss of £171,696; Victoria would have come out with a gain- of £373,089 ; Queensland with a gain of £142,974; South Australia with a gain of £173,306; Western Australia with a loss of £579,834 ; and Tasmania with a gain of £62,161. In the year 1903-4, New South Wales would have lost £71,659; Victoria would have gained £209,116; Queensland would have gained £132,439; South Australia would have gained £117,908; Western Australia would have lost £453,035 ; and Tasmania would have gained '£65, 231. ' If the matter be put in another way, and the gain or loss to the States shown if the actual distribution had been varied by charging new works and buildings on a population basis - what we are doing now - as compared with the result if the whole surplus had been distributed on a population basis, New South Wales would have lost £[78,533 ; Victoria would have gained £[233,866 ; Queensland would have gained £[144,996 ; South Australia would have gained £[114,240; Western Australia would have lost £478,575, or still more than under the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> system ; and Tasmania would have gained £64,006. In the year 1904-5, there would have been a turn, I do not know for what particular reason, in favour of New South Wales, which State, under the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> system in that year, would have gained £30,788, although previously she had* suffered a loss, except in the first year of Federation. Victoria, in 1905-6, would have come down to a gain of £[100,402 ; and Queensland would have come down to a gain of £95,215. South Australia, in that year, would have come out pretty well, with a gain of ,£122,636, and, therefore, the system would have suited' my own State. Western Australia, however, would have come out with, a heavy loss of .£335,868. It is estimated that in the year 1906-7, New South Wales, under a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> system, would . come out with a loss of £1.73,089 ; Victoria with a gain of £.104,643; Queensland with a gain of £[r55',668; South Australia with a gain of £141,139; Western Australia with less loss than she Has ever experienced before, namely, £[309,279. Bui) Tasmania, it is esti-mated, would make a most marvellous jump to a gain of £80,000. I have now shown honorable senators what the position would be if we were to pass this motion - that New South Wales would lose heavily, and Western Australia would lose most disastrously. How would the result in the case of Western Australia be brought about? The Western Australian people, through the Customs, are paying per h-id into the Commonwealth Treasury, an amount considerably in excess of that paid by any other State; and under the system now proposed, money thus paid would be simply placed to the credit of the other States. I suppose that some people would call that robbery; at all events, it is much like robbery. </para>

                    <para class="block">The discussion has special reference to Tasmania; and all I know is that that State is treated in precisely the same way as is every other State, so that there can scarcely be any complaint on that score. Tasmania is credited with the amount of Customs and Excise revenue she pays, less any sum which the Commonwealth Parliament may deem necessary for the purposes of Commonwealth administration; and she is debited with all transferred expenditure on a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> basis, as are all the other States. For instance, the expenditure on Thursday Island is called " other " expenditure; and why? Because, originally, Thursday Island was fortified at the joint expense of most of the States; and it was contended that all the States should contribute to the maintenance of the fortifications, just as in the case of Albany. Then, again, we have taken over the administration of Papua, which costs £20,000 or £[30,000 a year ; and towards this expenditure Tasmania simply pays in proportion to population ; in short, Tasmania is treated in exactly the same way as is every other State. If we adopt this motion, and alter the system, the result will be that Tasmania will dip her hands into the pockets of New South Wales and Western Australia; and I do not think that that is the desire of the people of Tasmania. Surely Tasmania does not want to use for her own special benefit money contributed by the people of New South Wales and Western Australia ? </para>

They foresaw the difficulties, and knew that, unless they adopted the system of each State being credited with the amount contributed through Excise and Customs, and of each State paying its expenditure on a fair basis, the grossest injustice would be inflicted on certain of the States. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know how the honorable senator can call Western Australia the only stumbling-block, when we recollect that New South Wales would, under the system proposed, lose £173,089, in 1906-7, which, with the £309,000 already alluded to, would make a total loss of very nearly ,£500,000. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe</inline> practically suggests that Western Australia should be left out of consideration, and that we should then see how the figures would come out. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, following the example of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner, has afforded the Commonwealth information of the most valuable character relating to these matters. Amongst the tables laid before another place, when the Budget speech was delivered, was a statement comparing the amounts paid to the States Treasurers with the amounts which would have been paid if distributed on the basis of population, excluding Western Australia. This table shows that under such circumstances New South Wales, in 1902, would have lost £43,685, Victoria would have gained1 £106,609, Queensland would have lost £46,123, South Australia would have gained .£6,153, and Tasmania would have lost <inline font-style="italic">£22,954.</inline> It will be seen, therefore, that Tasmania would have started with a loss on this particular basis. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe</inline> has suggested that we should practically exclude Western Australia. That, however, could not be done under the Constitution, which, provides that in these matters there shall be uniformity. But, supposing it had been possible to exclude Western Australia, Tasmania, it will be seen, would have started with a loss of £22,954. </para>

We should here be met with another difficulty. The honorable senator would eliminate Western Australia, but other States would be very badly off under the system he proposes. Honorable senators must remember that I am quoting actual figures, and not merely estimates. </para>

                            <para>- Under the honorable senator's proposal New South Wales would have lost in 1903-4 £263,151; .Victoria would have gained £77&gt;5o6, Queensland £78,320, . South Australia £66,537, and Tasmania £40,788. A wonderful change would have taken place in the next year, because, whilst Victoria in the previous years would have gained considerable sums, under this peculiar system of distributing the revenue, she would in 1904-5 have lost £39,999, New South Wales would have lost £.148, Z4r, Queensland would have shown a gain of £99,741, South Australia a gain of £53,190, and the gain by Tasmania would have dropped to £35,309. So the figures would run on, until the current year, for which an estimate only is given. Honorable senators will notice that in this table New South Wales is placed in exactly the same position as Western Australia occupies in the last table, because she would be the State to lose all the money under the system which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe</inline> thinks would be so fair. Taking the estimated figures for the year 1906-7, under this system New South Wales would lose £295,548, Victoria would gain £5,964, Queensland £112,742, South Australia £110,433, and Tasmania £66,409. I do not know that I need" labour the matter any more. I have shown 4he exact position, and honorable senators are aware that the reason why Western Australia loses a larger sum than other States is that her population consumes per head dutiable goods to a much greater extent than do the people of the other States, <inline font-style="italic">And</inline> especially the people of Tasmania. I have shown, also, that if the system advocated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe</inline> were adopted its effect would be to inflict very grievous injustice ora Western Australia. The real point ia that the honorable senator cannot show that under the existing system any injustice is inflicted upon Tasmania. Tasmania receives the whole of the revenue from Customs and Excise collected in the State, less that which the Commonwealth spends, in just the same way as every other State does. So far as expenditure is concerned, it is not germane to the subject, and I need not deal with it. </para>

I can see none, and in the circumstances I think I may fairly ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe</inline> to withdraw his motion. The question is not one which the Government should shirk, and they do not propose to shirk it. When the five years is up, we shall be in a position to alter the mode of distribution. Honorable senators who have followed what has been taking place within the last few years are aware that meetings have been held between the States Treasurers and the Federal Treasurer, with the object of arriving at some mutual arrangement in connexion! with the operation of the Braddon section of the Constitution, and the larger question of the taking over of the States debts by the Commonwealth. At one time the Braddon section was looked upon as a fearful blot on the Constitution, but the </para>

                            <para>- I was not aware that they had gone that far. I am afraid that Judgment Day would intervene to prevent that. However, we are now told that the " Braddon blot " is no longer a blot, and should be continued in operation for ever. It is the duty of the Government to deal with these questions, and they have not failed to do so. If honorable senators will read the Treasurer's Budget speech, they will find in it a statement of the views of the Government on these questions. As far as the money to be returned to the different States is concerned, the Treasurer's proposal, which is acquiesced in by the other members of the Government, is that it shall be a fixed amount, instead of, as at present, an uncertain amount, dependent upon what is spent by the Commonwealth. The existing state of things in this respect is very unsatisfactory. If I were the Treasurer of a State, I know that I should be very much better pleased to be able to say that mv revenue from Customs and Excise would be a certain sum. If I were uncertain as to what it would be, I should have difficulty in balancing revenue and expenditure for the State. What the Government propose in this respect is that, instead of continuing the present uncertain system, under which the amount "handed to each State depends on the amount collected from Customs and Excise in each State, less the amount of Commonwealth expenditure, we should' take the last five years' receipts in each State from Customs and Excise, deduct what might be considered a fair amount for Commonwealth expenditure, and strike an average. We should then be in a position to say to the Treasurers of the States that for the next five years they will get so much. An account would be kept of the amount received by each State, and, at the end of the next five years, we could continue the process. </para>

                            <para>- The increase might be for a special purpose, towards defence, for building a fleet to carry Our mails, or for any other undertaking that Parliament might approve. That would be a very much more satisfactory way of dealing with the matter. I do not propose to discuss the question of the taking over of the debts of the States, but that has also been dealt with in the Treasurer's Budget speech. The right honorable gentleman has submitted an exceedingly valuable memorandum on the subject,, to which Ministers have given a great deal of consideration, and I think that it proposes a satisfactory system, under which we might work for years to come. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. It is proposed that that shall go on for five years, and thé sum to be paid to each State will be based on actual contributions for the previous five years, less Commonwealth expenditure, divided by five. That will give the starting-point. Instead of paying, as at present, an uncertain amount to each State, we propose the adoption of the system in operation in Canada of paying, a fixed sum to each State. I believe that that will be found to be a much more satisfactory way of dealing with the matter. I am sure that honorable senators will read the memorandum on the subject submitted' by the Treasurer with a considerable amount of interest, and I think they will see that Ave have proposed 'a fair solution of the difficulties relating to the transfer of property, the taking over of the debts of the States, and the amount to 'be returned to the States as their share of the revenue derived from Customs and Excise. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe,</inline> -possibly after the discussion has taken place on the subject, to withdraw his motion. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Col. NEILD</inline>(New South Wales) [4.29]. - In resuming the debate on the second reading of this Bill, I should like, first of all, to direct the attention of honorable senators to the great difference in the attitude of the supporters and of the opponents of the measure. I do not do so in any unkindly spirit, but I think that I am justified and required to draw attention to something that was said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford,</inline> in moving. the second reading of this Bill, last week - </para>

                        <para>- I am not making a complaint, but only pointing out that in his statement the honorable senator showed an absolute lack of knowledge on the subject upon which he undertook to legislate. The whole movement in favour of the measure rests upon the somewhat hysterical statements made in another place by gentlemen who do not profess to have any personal knowledge of its subject-matter. The opposition, on the other hand has come from those who have carefully investigated the question, and shown by the recital of facts here how, in the interests of sobriety and good order, they strongly support the maintenance of the canteen system. </para>

                        <para>- Mv honorable friend will have an opportunity to quote them. [ shall quote a few American as well as British opinions, the opinions of almost every regiment.nl commander of the State from which I come, and of a great number of experienced officers. I shall also, by quotation, show the feeling amongst the non-commissioned officers of our Defence Force in connexion with this proposal. Practically all that we have had adduced here in support of the measure in the way of authority has been the recital of the opinions of some American officers, and some American legislation. I am going to show how enormously the canteen system, when it was introduced, advantaged the conditions in the American Army, and by parity of reason, we may suppose that the introduction and maintenance of the canteen system is for the advantage of the soldiers and other persons in our own Military Forces. But I beg honorable senators not to overlook this strong point: that the canteens of which we have, knowledge, whether American or English, are practically those connected with the regular Army, and that only. la Australia, we have scattered about the States a regular Army of about 1300 men, including drill sergeants, one of whom is attached, to a regiment or to a company here and there. We have no large number of- regular troops, even approaching hundreds, in any part of the Commonwealth, I think, except in New South Wales. The greater number is, perhaps, to be found there. But, on the other hand, we have to do with a citizen soldiery, and the canteen business only applies to them during the period of the ' Easter training. Therefore, we cannot assume that the authorities that have held good, either <inline font-style="italic">pro</inline> or <inline font-style="italic">con,</inline> in America, or England, necessarily apply with any kind of aptitude to Australian conditions, though, to some extent, they do, no doubt. I would also point out the extreme difference that exists between the method of enlisting soldiers here and in England. In England, as long as a man has all the necessary height and chest measurements, and is healthy, he is taken on when they are recruiting. What great trouble is taken about the character of men who are enlisted in our little permanent force in Australia ! To obtain admission to the Royal Australian Artillery, for instance, a man has to be fortified with a sufficiency of references to fit* him for the position, of churchwarden in a cathedral. They will not take a man on merely because he is so many inches high, and so many round the chest, but they want a man of first-class character. That sort of selection does not obtain in recruiting for the British Army, nor, so far as I can ascertain, does it obtain in regard to the little American Army. It should be recollected that our main force is a militia force. The Government of the United States have nothing to do with the militia force. That is under the control of the States, and, therefore, there is no similarity between Australian and American conditions. There is a point which, from something he said in conversation with me the other day, I am sure the Minister appreciates very fully, but I have not heard it mentioned either in another place or here. I am not so sure about America, but certainly there is a marvellous difference between English and Australian conditions in respect of the licensing laws. The soldiers of England . are under the same Government as controls the licensing of hotels, public-houses, and drinking booths. But in Australia, everything is altered. The Commonwealth may select a position for a camp for Easter training. There may not be a public-house in the neighbourhood, but the State, through its bench of magistrates, chooses to grant as many drinking licences, perhaps, as are applied for. </para>

                        <para>- My honorable friend is, perhaps, jumping to a conclusion without having given the matter sufficient consideration. I think he will see that no applicant to a bench of magistrates for a booth licence, or for the extension of a licence to sell in a tent at a. given place, would say, " I am making this application in order to supply liquor to the troops which are coming here." He would never make any such representation as that. </para>

                        <para>- My honorable friend may be right in respect of some measure which has not yet been drawn, but his remarks are not in "the slightest degree apposite to this Bill, which is brought in merely to stop the sale of spirituous liquors in military canteens and on military premises. I am talking about the premises across the road, and the two things are not by any means analogous. I am speaking with some experience. I am not now, but for nine years I was a regimental commander. I commanded my regiment in regimental camps, where I was chief authority, and in general camps- under superior authority. As a brigadier I have commanded several regiments in camps during the entire period of annual military training. During the whole of that time the head-quarters of my regiment were in the Victoria Barracks, and, therefore, all that went on there in connexion with canteens, officers' mess, sergeants' mess, and so on, was more immediately under my notice than under that of the very large majority of regimental commanders in New South Wales, whose head-quarters were elsewhere. During the whole of that time I had but once to deal with a case of drinking. I .never had to deal with a case of drinking in camp, or with a case of drinking connected with a canteen of any sort. After the conclusion of a Saturday afternoon parade, a member of my regiment did not change his uniform upon reaching home, as men usually do. In the evening he went out in uniform, and at some public-house or public-houses he obtained more drink than was good for him, and brought discredit upon the uniform by being in the street drunk, or, at any rate, the worse for liquor. I dealt with him, and that was the only instance of a volunteer soldier overstepping the bounds, either in my own regiment or in the several regiments which I had the honour of commanding in a brigade that I had to deal with in a period of nine years. I am going to quote the opinions of other officers to the same effect. I think that, if inquiry be made, it will be found that the professional soldiers, the militia, and the volunteers of Australia are so singularly honorable in their sobriety that one can well understand that they feel very keenly this proposal to place them', as I believe they have indicated in some instances to the Minister, in the position of " lunatics, criminals, and aboriginals." </para>

In passing I may state - I think I am right in- saying it - that the canteen in the military barracks, Sydney, is only open from 12 till 1 o'clock in the afternoon, and from 5 till 9.30 at night. The men are not to be allowed to have a glass of beer in barracks under restriction and discipline, but they can cross the road and drink as much as they like. </para>

I am sure that neither the present Minister of Defence nor <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake,</inline> a previous Minister of Defence, would advocate the closing of what canteen arrangements exist in Thursday Island, and compel the men when they wanted a glass of beer to go to one of the so-called hotels to be found there. Opposite to one of the walls of the barracks, in Sydney - I speak only of one wall, not of four - there are no less than five hotels, and at least one wine shop - I am not sure that there is not a second ; and within a short gun shot there are many other hotels to which the men will be driven if they cannot procure what they desire at the canteen. </para>

Nothing has been quoted in support of this Bill, except some American opinions of a general character, and certain statements that the Commonwealth ought not to promote the consumption of liquor. I do not think that the Commonwealth does. Certainly the Commonwealth does no more to encourage the consumption of liquor in military canteens than this Parliament does in the little place upstairs. </para>

                        <para>- I intend to give some quotations from a work, which I am sure some honorable senator will cry out against because it dates back to the early nineties of the last century. But the very size of the work will show that it is not by any means ephemeral. It was published by one of the medical officers in the American Army, an M.D., and an A.M. I wish to quote from it at some little length with reference to canteens. I think it particularly my duty to read a few paragraphs with reference to disease and crime. Of course, when 1 speak of crime, I mean military crime, not crime at common law. This writer says - </para>

                    <para>The purpose of the canteen, as officially announced, is to supply troops with goods at a low rate of profit and to afford rational recreation and amusement to all enlisted men. The sale of ardent spirits is strictly prohibited therein, but commanding officers are authorized to permit light beer and wine to be sold by the drink, on week days, in a room set apart for the purpose, when in their opinion such action is promotive of temperance. Gambling of any character is forbidden. Each canteen is managed by an officer selected by the post commander for his fitness for the position, he being allowed one or more enlisted men as assistants; under recent orders civilians only being allowed to serve as bar keepers. As showing the favour with which the canteen system was received by troops, it is only necessary to say that in 1894, five years after ils inauguration, there were seventy-five canteens in successful operation in our service, and that during that year the total receipts were $1,417,079.62 ; of which sum no less than $304,649.91 were returned to the men as dividend profits, or about one dollar per month per man. During the year ending 30th June, 1898, the aggregate receipts of the exchanges in operation in the army amounted to $1,621,398.67, and there was received as money on deposit $189,258.81 ; making the total amount of money received $1,810,657.48. There was expended for merchandise purchased, rent, fixtures and repairs, and expenses of operation, $1,297,737.16- which, less deposits, gave a profit of $323,661.51- From this amount donations to the funds of the several regimental bands aggregated the sum of $9,154.51 ; to the maintenance of post gardens, $1,559.17; to post libraries, $640.06; the gymnasia, $2,913.75; as prizes for the encouragement of athletic sports, $3,336.41 ; and, after selling aside the sum of $60,877.58 as a reserve fund to meet the anticipated expenses foi at least one month, the sum of $254,890.93 was returned to the members in the form of dividends. The effect of the introduction of the canteen system upon sick rates with respect to alcoholism, as shown by the reports of the surgeon-general, was prompt and marked. For the decade 1878-87, the average number of admissions for alcoholism and its direct results amounted to 64.28 per thousand of white troops. This rate diminished during the next ten years, in proportion, as canteens were gradually established at various posts, omitting fractions, in the following ratio : - 44, 46, 44, 44, 4', 37, 34. 32, 31, 3°- </para>

                <para>Those figures show a reduction of considerably more than one-half in cases of alcoholism. Surely that fact is of value. Surely it indicates that canteens do not make "for insobriety. I will quote another passage - </para>

                    <para>On observing the admissions for alcoholism for the seven years, 1885-91, which immediately preceded the general establishment of the canteen system upon a satisfactory basis throughout the army, it is found that a yearly average ot 1,214.8 men found it necessary to apply for treatment from this cause; while for the six years, 1892-97, after canteens had been generally established throughout the army, an average of only 928.4 men required medical care as the result of alcoholism - a reduction amounting to 23.6 per cent. </para>

                    <para>In 1890, there were 17 posts, at which the admission r.ite for alcoholism exceeded 10 per cent, of the strength. In 1891, the number of such posts had decreased to 11, and in the six subsequent years diminished at the following rate - 10, 7i 4, 5. 2&gt; 2- 'J-'u's favorable showing for the army at large was duplicated in the case of each individual post; the introduction of the canteen, at a military station, in no instance failing to be promptly followed by a diminution of alcoholism. For certain stations this improvement was extraordinary. In 1889, Willet's Point had an admission rate for alcoholism of 222.97 Per thousand. For 1890, the year during which the canteen was established at that post, it fell to i57-5°i and in the next year was reduced to only 70.46. At Fort Spokane, the amount of sickness resulting from intoxicants was reported by the surgeon as having diminished 50 per cent, during the six months following the institution of the canteen. At Fort Douglas, in 1888 and 1889, the total number of admissions attributed to alcoholism amounted to about 85 per thousand strength; while during the period 1892-94, this rate fell to 52.95 per thousand strength - and such instances might be largely multiplied. </para>

As to insanity in relation to drink, the author  states  - lt is recognised that alcoholism and insanity are closely related, through the direct influence exerted by intoxicants in the production of mental aberration. 'Hence it is not surprising to find that the average number of cases of insanity, annually coming under treatment, was 35.1 for the seven year period,  iSSij-91,  prior to the complete establishment of the canteen system, and only 24 as an annual average for the six subsequent years, 1892-97.

                    <para>The canteen, for the maintenance of good order, in which a commissioned officer is held responsible, is as aid to discipline as well as to the health and morals of troops. It provides a resort which, while under thorough military control, offers inducements to the men to remain at home, and spend their idle time within the limits of the post; this condition obviously being far preferable to the one formerly existing, when the nearest and generally patronized places of amusement and refreshment were the grog shops, usually the gambling room and brothel annexes, which marked the limits of each military reservation. Except with the most dissolute class of men, the soldier is well satisfied to patronize the canteen to the exclusion of outside saloons; knowing, as he does, that he receives good value for his money in articles of excellent quality, and fully appreciating that the profits of the institution ultimately accrue entirely to his benefit, and are not, as with the case of outside establishments, diverted to the advantage of others. </para>

                        <para>- That is a point not involved in the question under discussion, but, as it has been raised, I shall not pass it by. Personally, I think that the practice to which the honorable senator has referred was most discreditable, indecent, and improper, for' which those responsible were deserving of much rougher treatment than they received. In this book there is a table with which I shall not trouble honorable senators, but which is followed by these words: - </para>

                    <para>From the above table, it is observed that during the first year after the canteen system was officially established, the rate of desertions fell 30 per cent., while in the next year the rate was further reduced to 48 per cent. For the five years previous to the establishment of the first officially recognised canteen, the number of men annually deserting from the service, per thousand strength, amounted to 101 ; while for the eight years immediately subsequent to the institution of this system, the annual number of desertions was reduced to 50 per thousand strength. </para>

                    <para>Drunkenness is certainly prevented by the constant military supervision to which the canteen is. subjected. The men themselves are usually careful not to indulge in alcoholics to the point of" inebriety ; while such few individuals as are inclined to be forgetful of the dangers of excess, will usually be restrained by companions, or by those connected with the establishment - who have no personal interest in promoting the sale of liquor, as does the saloon keeper of civil life - from passing the bounds of actual intoxication. </para>

                <para class="block">There is one other table to which I propose to refer, as showing the total number of trials and convictions in the Army for all causes, and the number of trails and convictions for drunkenness, and conditions arising therefrom. The table shows that for the six years before the canteen&gt; period the total number of trials and conviction of all kinds was 1,838, as compared with 1,605, or a reduction of 233, after the establishment of canteens. The total number of trials and convictions for drunkenness for the same periods were- 372.5 and 160.6 respectively, a reduction of materially more than one-half. This table is of importance, as showing that the reduction was greater in reference to cases of drunkenness than in reference to general crime; and the fact is signally pertinent to this Bill. There was quite a moderate reduction in general crime, but an enormous reduction in drunkenness. I desire to occupy as little time as possible,, but. I hope that honorable senators recognise that I am speaking on a subject of which I have some knowledge, and in which I take some interest, and that I am no longer sufficiently actively connected? with the Military Forces to have any personal interest in the outcome of this Bill. I do not think there are many, either inside or outside the Chamber, who would* regard me as an advocate of either loose living or loose drinking, and. therefore, if" I take a strong view, it is not because I believe in reckless consumption of liquor, but in the belief that what is proposed* will be injurious rather than beneficial. Had I the least idea that the Bill' would have the good effects that some honorable senators claim for it,. I should give it mv strongest support. But I am convinced that it will not do good, and that, on. the contrary, it Wil do harm. It is for this reason I am adopting an attitude, which, no doubt, will get one into hot water with a considerable <inline font-style="italic">number</inline> of very worthy people, who, knowing nothing whatever about the subject, will very much resent my action. I propose now to quote from a work from the pen -of "Robert Caldwell, F.R.S., D.P.H., Lieutenant-Colonel, Royal Army Medical Corps. Formerly Medical Officer in Charge, District Laboratory,  Meerut;  Member of Committee On Field Sanitation in connexion with Surgeon-General's Report on South African Campaign; Medi&gt;cal Officer in Charge, District Laboratory and Isolation Hospital, First Army Corps." It cannot be claimed that this work is not of a recent date, since it bears the date 1905, and it was sent out to Australia, as is shown by a piece of paper pasted in it, in order that it might be  reviewed  by the distinguished gentleman who has lent me the volume so that I may make use of it here.

                    <para>Whether universal teetotalism is or is not desirable is too vast a subject to be entered on "here. Whatever individual views may be entertained, there is no getting over the fact that the average man, whether soldier or citizen, will partake of alcohol as a beverage, and, this being the case, it is better to make the habit as little deleterious as possible, instead of violently reprobating a custom which, even if undesirable, is, nevertheless, indulged in by an enormous number of self-respecting people of both sexes, whose lives and conduct are absolutely above reproach. If the soldier has an uncomfortable canteen in barracks he will drink in the town, where the chances are he will consume bad liquor in company of corresponding quality, and where', being free from military control, he can indulge in libations and in a style of behaviour which would be impossible, or, at any rate, promptly followed by unpleasant consequences, within the precincts of an institution under official management. </para>

                    <para>Possibly this is due to the lack of the canteen system with us. The British have a well-established post exchange where light beer is sold, and in connexion a club-room, which tends to keep the soldier in barracks and preserve sobriety. The French give a ration of wine ; likewise the Italians and Austrians. The Japanese sell beer and sake in their compound, but never have a case of drunkenness. The Germans have a home like <inline font-style="italic">Rathskeller</inline> where beer and German foods are sold, and their drunkenness is nil. The Russians have no post exchange as the soldier only gets about 20 cents per month, and therefore has little to spend in liquor; but often the soldiers convive with other nationalities, and there is likely to be drunkenness if the liquor is obtainable. </para>

                    <para>The American soldier, however, is forced to the low groggeries and dives, dozens of which exist on the outskirts of the legation quarter, and the result is he either imbibes an extra quantity of alcohol to last until he reaches the barracks or buys cheap whisky in bottles and secretes it for use in the garrison. The American soldier is the most sought after, as he has far more pay to spend than the other nationalities, and the result is the extra tendency to fall into the hands of these brothel and saloon keepers who especially cater to encourage this trade. I believe this accounts for the extra large venereal rate among our soldiers. </para>

                    <para>From the reports of the Surgeon-General of the United States Army, for the past twenty years it is found that alcoholism is not nearly so great an evil in the Army as it was prior to the establishment of the post exchange allowing the sale of beer and light wines to the soldier. From 18S3 to 1888 the annual admission rate from alcoholism varied from 69 to 40 per 1,000. When the last figure was reached, the Surgeon-General reported in 1889 - " There is here manifested a gratifying temperance movement which it is hoped the canteen system may render more actively progressive." </para>

It has been asked why, in view of the strong opinions expressed by army authorities, the canteen has not been re-instated in America. There is a very simple answer to that question. Any one who has any knowledge of American politics - and I am quite sure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> has that knowledge, only, perhaps, he has not applied it - must be aware of the enormous influence of the drinking saloons in those politics. The head of the electoral committee in each electoral division in the United States is very commonly a boss saloon-keeper, and the influence of the American saloon is so great in American politics that one has no difficulty whatever in readily recognising that the saloon played its part in securing the abolition of canteens: in America, and is playing its part in preventing them from being reestablished. </para>

I do not for a moment suppose that any teetotal authority believes that in his advocacy of the Bill he is helping the licensed victualler; but I shall show very conclusively that that view is entertained, and that there is good ground for it, in view of what has happened this year in connexion;, at any, rate, with the military camps in New South Wales. It is simply a case of " Great is Diana of the Ephesians." It is a question of getting rid of competition. I do not blame the saloon-keeper from his stand-point. If I were a saloon-keeper - and God forbid that I ever should be one - I suppose I should recognise the advantage of getting rid of the canteen. I know that all sorts of objections are raised against institutions standing on the same basis. It is objected that prisoners should be put to useful work in gaol, as that might result in taking good work out of other men's hands. 1 have been approached with objections to the military printing office at Victoria Barracks. Svdney. The printing of military orders is there carried out by an artilleryman who can set type, and I have been approached by printers, who have objected to that, on the ground that they should have the work, and that it interferes with their opportunity to obtain work. I can quite understand that licensed victuallers consider it a serious objection that a canteen should interfere with their trade across the road. It is only common sense. I have promised that I would give some local opinions. They will be found to more than support anything I have said. It will be convenient, perhaps, if, first of all, I quote some telegrams, all of which are very brief. I have a dozen or more here, along with some letters from regimental commanders and ex-regimental commanders, in New South Wales.

                <para>No doubt it will be convenient if I read a fairly long letter from a lieutenant-colonel, who, as he1 says, has had over twenty years' experience in the Permanent Military Forces. He is on the retired list under the age regulation. I know that he has been intimately .connected with the military service, and has had a very extensive knowledge of the working of ' the canteen business. I allude to Lieutenant-Colonel Murray, late of the Royal Australian Artillery, who writes as follows : - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>Military canteens - referring especially to the Liquor Department - are established for the purpose of enabling the rank and file (sergeants having, of course, the accommodation of their mess), to obtain the best possible quality at the lowest possible charge, in comfortable quarters, and in the congenial society of their own class. </para>
                    <para>Intoxication is guarded against bv limiting the hours of sale by the strict injunction upon the canteen steward not to serve any man beyond a certain margin ; and by the circumstances that a non-commissioned officer, called the "canteen orderly," is detailed daily to attend the canteen to see that there is no irregularity or drinking to excess. No inducement is held out to the soldier beyond those stated ; he is in no way tempted or solicited to patronize the canteen. </para>
                    <para>The liquor canteen is only open from 12 to 1 p.m., and 4 to 9.30 p.m. </para>
                    <para>The profits, which are cut down to the lowest possible margin, after payment of working expenses, are devoted to the benefit of the soldier either in the purchase of sport materials, such as cricket and football gear, &amp;c, indoor games, newspapers and periodicals for the recreation room, or otherwise as may be suitable. Occasionally prizes are awarded for athletic contests, military sports, &amp;c. </para>
                    <para>Writing after 26 years in the regular military service, during which I have been actively concerned in the administration of canteens, I am perfectly satisfied that such institutions are for the benefit of the men - that no young soldier was ever led into intemperance in a military canteen, for the reasons already stated, viz.', strict supervision, no solicitation to drink, prevention of excessive drinking, limited hours. </para>
                    <para>If the canteen is closed the effect will be that the soldier, instead of obtaining wholesome liquor at tha minimum price in a private establishment, conducted upon reputable lines, will go to a public house, where he will be served with inferior liquor at a higher charge, and where there will be every incentive upon him to drink to intoxication. </para>
                    <para>The inducement to remain in barracks will be removed, and he will have a direct temptation to loaf about the town. Drinking will be increased, not diminished, and the soldier will become liable to the evil effects which flow from such excess. </para>
                    <para>With regard to camp canteens, depriving men of the accommodation which the canteen affords, amounts to treating respectable citizen soldiers upon the assumption that they are unable to exercise any restraint over themselves, and that if they are provided with a canteen they will necessarily drink to excess. </para>
                    <para>To abolish camp canteens would be a step which I am quite sure will be resented in the highest degree by all except fanatic prohibition lsts - </para>

Lieutenant-Colonel Murray goes on to say - and the inevitable result will be that every man will bring with bini 'into camp his own supply of liquor. This he will find means to keep renewed all the time he is in camp, and the probability is that the free passing of the bottle within the tents, entailing the lavish offering and returning of this species of hospitality, will lead to a great deal more drinking than would take place if the men were able, as heretofore, to go to these canteens, drink what they require, and go away. </para>

                <para>For all these reasons I am quite satisfied that the Canteen Bill is distinctly a step in the wrong direction, inasmuch as it is entirely uncalled for; it will not in the least degree promote the cause of temperance; it will play into the hands of the publicans; and in camps will promote sotting in the tents, and absence from the lines. </para>

I have been supplied with extracts from the minutes of a meeting of members of the Royal Australian Artillery sergeants' mess, held at the Victoria Barracks, Sydney, on&gt; the 23rd July.

I do not know whether my honorable friend has received them yet, but I think that by this time they ought to be here. The resolutions read as follow: - </para>

What the sergeants mean, although it is not clearly expressed, is their own canteen, w'hich is a separate affair from the men's canteen. Sergeants' are not allowed to drink with men, any more than officers are allowed to drink with sergeants. The object of that rule is to maintain discipline. </para>

                    <para>As I said in my telegram, stopping canteens would be a greater hardship on the men than the officers, for the officers are better able to provide for themselves. There is no need for such a law, and instead of preventing crime it would create it. At our last camp near Liverpool we had a canteen run by the brigade, and in the whole 2,000 men there was no drunkenness or crime, but if the men had to go outside of camp and get bad grog at the hotels without the restraint of camp discipline, then there would be crime. Men will not come into camp for several days training if they are to be treated in the way proposed. When cold and wet a glass of grog is a necessity to many men. I hope yon will put the case strongly and prevent this proposed gross injustice being carried out. At the meeting of commanding officers referred to (all being present), even the teetotaller was against the Bill. I fear if the Bill is carried there W 11 be no camp next year. I believe the force in all the States are .unanimous in their opposition to the Bill. </para>

                <para class="block">Dear Colonel Neild, </para>
                <para>I duly received your telegram dated 27th inst. asking whether I approved of the Canteen Bill now before the House of Representatives. </para>
                <para>You will possibly have learnt 'that at a large meeting of nearly all the military officers in Sydney last week, this Canteen Bill was mentioned, and the whole were unanimous in condemning it. They looked on it 'as a strong and unnecessary interference with rights which they have always possessed, and there is not the slightest occasion, to my mind, for bringing in such a Bill. </para>
                <para>I understood General Gordon was telegraphing privately to the Minister of Defence, stating that if such a Bill were passed it would do in calculable injury to the Commonwealth military. I can only indorse this view, and think that the whole of the officers in New South Wales are unanimous in thinking similarly. </para>
                <para>Here is another letter from an officer, who has likewise authorized me to use his. name - 2Sth July, 1906. </para>
                <para>Dear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline></para>
                <para>You will have earned the gratitude of all who wish well to the soldier, who is in arms to defend the Commonwealth. </para>
                <para>You are perhaps aware that I am an abstainer, and therefore have no personal need for canteens, but, having had over twenty years' ex- 1perience of soldiering as a citizen, I unhesitatingly say that the removal of canteens from camps of training would have a most pernicious effect on discipline. </para>
                <para>The work of the soldier is much more trying physically than those who have not experienced' it can believe, and men used to stimulants will have them. They will either march to public houses in the nearest town or have it brought to them and stored in their tents. The senators, knowing what human nature is, cm easily picture the effect on discipline. The canteen is always under observation. A steady reliable noncommissioned officer is always on duty there with <inline font-style="italic">it</inline> small picket, and acts as a restraint on overindulgence. </para>
                <para>In three camps I can only remember one case of drunkenness in the regiment under my command. On investigation, I found that it resulted from the man hearing bad news from home, and his comrades showed their sympathy by invitations 10 liquid refreshment. </para>
                <para class="block">There is nothing unreasonable in that. If a man is in trouble and meets a friend, it is generally a case of " Come and have a. drink, old fellow." We all know it. It is; of no use, because we are sitting in a stately chamber,- to put from our thoughts the common attributes of humanity, with its weaknesses and its sympathies. It is one of the commonest ' features of social1 life for a man who meets a friend who is; in trouble to invite him to have a drink. E am not saying whether it is right or wrong, desirable or undesirable. We are not discussing that point of view. We are discussing the probabilities of doing away with military canteens. </para>
                <para>Its effect on the non-commissioned officers of the regiments would be no better than on the men, and not unlikely lead to it being more difficult to get a desirable stamp of man for the post. </para>

                <para>At a meeting of brigadiers and commanding officers, held on the 26th inst., it was unanimously resolved to ask the General to wire to Minister saying that we were of opinion the passage of the Bill would prove detrimental to the best interests of the forces, was a reflection on the men in the ranks, and instead of doing good would lead to an increase of crime and drunkenness both in camp and barracks. </para>
                <para>I understand the General wired this, same evening. </para>
                <para>The non-commissioned officers and men all through the force are expressing their objection in no unmeasured terms, and threaten to resign rather than submit to the indignity. </para>
                <para class="block">The next letter before me is one from which I shall quote only a portion, because the writer does not authorize me to mention his name. I may say, however, that he is a gentleman of very great experience, who has served in South Africa more than once I think. He is a member of a military order by reason of his services. He says - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>Encampments, as a matter of convenience, are, as a rule, held fairly close to populated centres, alongside a railway line. If the men after, say, a long day's march or exercise, cannot get the refreshment they require in the camp, where, too, the consumption of liquor is under strict supervision by the Military authorities, and no man is allowed to be served with more than is good for him, they will go off to the public houses in the town, where they can drink without supervision, the result being that an increase of liquor consumption generally, and probably, drunkenness will ensue, to the detriment of the discipline of the camp and the good name of the forces. </para>
                    <para>Take, for instance, the camp at Liverpool this year. Speaking of my own regiment, I took 514 men into camp, and during the whole period of the training, not one single case of crime or misdemeanor of any sort was brought under my notice. Yet there was a canteen, controlled directly by the brigade, in the camp. </para>
                    <para>As a result of the canteen this year being in our own hands, the right not being leased to an outside person as formerly, we were enabled to pay over to each officer commanding infantry regiments no less a sum than about£19 profits, which was utilized, in the case of my regiment, for the purpose of gymnastic appliances and extra rations, and in other ways it contributed to the comfort of the troops in camp and afterwards. If military canteens are abolished, there will be more drinking - considerably more drinking, instead of less, and the profits will go into the pockets of the publicans, instead of being devoted to the benefit of the men themselves. </para>
                    <para>It would appear that this movement for the abolition of military canteens has emanated from the teetotal party," but I am inclined to think that this is not so, but is the work of the licensed victuallers, who, I know, this year are grieved that the canteens have been kept in our own hands and run by a' committee of our own officers, which experiment has proved, in every sense of the word, successful. </para>

                <para class="block">I hope that my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles,</inline> will not think that what occurred at a certain place a few miles from Melbourne is common at military canteens. As far as my knowledge goes, that is by no means the case. I was never more shocked than I was by the production of two price lists, one for officers and' one for men. It was the most disgraceful thing I ever heard of in connexion with the Commonwealth Military Forces - a shameful thing. I shall next quote a letter from a colonel of artillery, of at least thiry years' service. He says - 28th July, 1906. </para>
                <para class="block">Dear Col. Neild, </para>
                <para>In reply to your wire of yesterday <inline font-style="italic">re</inline> the Canteen Bill, I am of opinion that this Bill should not become law, the freedom and manhood of the soldier would almost be reduced to that of serfdom. Why should the soldier be' denied the privilege of having a glass of beer with a comrade in his own home, " the barracks," where he is under the eyes and control of his officers? </para>
                <para>I consider it necessary, in the interest of the militia and volunteer troops, to establish a canteen at the Easter encampments. </para>
                <para>During my thirty-eight years experience in the Militia Force in this State, a very limited number of cases of drunkenness have come under my notice, none of which being caused by the men getting the drink in camp, but probably by obtaining drink of a worse quality outside of the camp lines, and not under the supervision of their officers. I am strongly of opinion that the militia troops, " as free men," will resent this encroachment on their right to have a glass of beer on returning to camp after a long march or after a heavy day's work; should this be denied them it may probably be the means of preventing a large number of men from attending camp who may consider that their liberty and freedom has been unduly curtailed. </para>
                <para>That letter is from Colonel Kircaldie of Newcastle. I have very little else to read, and I shall be glad to complete my speech, the length of which I regret for some, though not for other, reasons.

          <inline font-style="italic">Re</inline>Canteen Bill. I am an abstainer, but am strongly opposed to the ill-advised interference of the powers with the rights of the citizen soldiers. They cannot make us all abstainers, nor yet moderate drinkers, and if grog cannot be purchased in camps or barracks, it will be got elsewhere of inferior quality, dearer and under no supervision. Large annual meeting of Commanding Officers on Thursday last gave unanimous -vote against the abolition of canteens. </para>
                <para class="block">I shall conclude these quotations with a letter from a very well known and distinguished officer, who has had English training, Indian training, and long service in Australia, and who has been at least twice on service in South Africa - </para>
                <para>It appears that the proposition is to take away the officers' and sergeants' messes, and the canteen. These institutions are part and parcel of the Army of every country in the world, and have stood the test of lime. They ,are practically the <inline font-style="italic">home</inline> of the officer and noncommissioned officer after his work is done. All he gets there is the best and most wholesome of its kind, and supplied at moderate cost. There he gets a <inline font-style="italic">substitute</inline> for the comforts of the domestic hearth he <inline font-style="italic">forfeits</inline> to join the service. The canteen gives him his groceries and necessaries at a price far below what he would pay outside, better quality, and the place is under rigid supervision. </para>
                <para>The profits supply the soldier with his sole perquisites and luxuries. The Government give him none. Without these he will have no gymnasium, cricket, football, recreation room, and the hundred and one other small things he enjoys, and for which he himself contributes. </para>
                <para>Take these away, and you drive him outside to. get them of worse quality, and more expensive, and his home is robbed of the only semblance of domestic comfort the soldier has the means of supplying. </para>
                <para>I also believe sobriety and temperance are more possible when the soldier is under his superior officers' supervision. In barracks he cannot spread himself. I have seen soldiers in and out of barracks, and in various parts of the world. I am altogether opposed to the limitations it is proposed to place upon his privileges, seeing that they work for his improvement rather than for his deterioration. </para>
                <para>I, as a Commanding Officer, have always encouraged my men, and assisted them to a mess, modest, perhaps, but the far reaching effects of keeping your men together, cannot be apparent to an outsider. , </para>

                        <para>- Lieut.-Col. Antill, C.B. When conducting a case in a law court, it is infinitely better to seek to prove it by one's own witnesses rather than by the assertions of counsel. It cannot be said that, long as I have occupied the attention of the Chamber, I have made very many assertions of my own. My duty has been to communicate to my fellow senators the evidence of witnesses, every one of whom is a man of - well, I was going to say, greater experience than myself, and I have had nine or ten years of command. At any rate, if all of those witnesses have not seen the same length of service, the majority have had much greater experience than myself. I think the evidence I have produced shows that there is a very serious side to the proposal before us; - that it is not a matter which can be ended by a stroke of the pen, or by the passing of a one clause measure. If we were going to insist on a non-drinking military force, I could appreciate a proposal that none but teetotallers should be allowed to serve. That is a logical proposition which could be argued, inasmuch as it could be contended that teetotal soldiers would not be so often sick or so often absent from duty. But it is not proposed to do anything of the kind1. The; Bill proposes to deal with ordinary men - ordinary young men, married men, and, in some cases, old men - to be found in our military or citizen forces, under conditions that do not apply to any other class in the community, except those referred to so frequently to-night, namely, persons under legal restraint in gaols or lunatic asylums, or aboriginals. It may appear humorous to find one officer after another using the same phrase; but that phrase is true - "and pity 'tis, 'tis true." Men of the world know perfectly well that we cannot alter the dispositions and habits of men by passing an Act of Parliament. We cannot stop the consumption of liquor bv simply enacting that it shall not be obtainable on a certain side of the street - by enacting that soldiers shall not drink in the Victoria Barracks, Sydney, while leaving them at liberty to drink at, perhaps, a dozen hotels on the other side of the street, twenty paces away. Is there an v sense in- such a proposal? Can any good result from insisting that soldiers shall not drink in barracks under restraint and supervision, while allowing them to go across the road, and do what they like? I recognise heartily and sincerely the good intentions of those who are promoting this Bill ; and I hope they will not be angry when I venture the opinion that they are acting with a very sad lack of knowledge, and even, I might add, lack of thought. I should like the honorable senators who support this Bill to make themselves acquainted with some of the canteens, which they would find something quite different from boozing houses, where men may be found the worse for liquor. If by any chance the motion for the second- reading is carried, I shall move that the Bill be referred to a Select Committee. In the New South Wales Parliament, of which I -was a member for about twenty years, Bills could be referred to a Select Committee before the necessity for them was affirmed bv adopting the second reading. Our Standing Orders, however, require us to approve a Bill before we inquire into it ; and. somehow, I do not care for the innovation. I say. further, that if those who are supporting the Bill will assent to a full inquiry I shall, for the sake of obtaining full information, vote for the second reading. </para>

                        <para>- My only desire is to show my willingness for full inquiry. I do not think that any of the communications I have read to-night can Le deemed improper on the part of taxpayers and citizens, when directed to me as one of their representatives. The abundance of information as to the views held on this question in New South Wales will, T think satisfy many honorable senators that similar views probably obtain in other States. But I have not quoted the opinion of any member of the Defence Forces in any of the other States, for the simple reason that I could not do so as a direct parliamentary representative, and because communications sent to me, under the circumstances, might be regarded as improper. I have, therefore, simply quoted: communications sent to me bv electors of the State of which I am one of the representatives; and it must not be thought that there is any provincialism or egotism in placing before honorable senators the opinions of officers and sergeants of my own State only. As I have already said, I shall be glad to vote for the second reading on the understanding that the Bill is made the subject of proper inquiry. Along with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> and others, I should be happy to act on a Select Committee, and make a week-end investigation into the opinions entertained on the Bill in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide. and Brisbane. The evidence could very easily be collected. </para>

I am prepared to go anywhere or do any service that I legitimately can as a public man to secure the very fullest information that can be obtained, in order that the Senate, in dealing with this measure, which, however small it may seem, will have far-reaching effects if passed, may deal with it after the most careful inquiry, and with the most sincere desire that the best results, and only the best results, shall follow from the action taken.

It has nothing whatever to do with the Bill. I feel sure that it would be ruled that the Bill could not be altered so as to deal with these matters. I remind honorable senators again that this is a Bill to abolish canteens. </para>

                        <para>- I suppose that honorable senators desire that I should fill up the few moments that remain before the dinner-hour. I was very much surprised to hear that an ex-Minister of Defence, and a citizen soldier at that, had declared that he had tried to regulate the canteens by regulations, and had failed. That is not to be wondered at, because, whether the gentleman in question, or somebody else, is responsible for them, the regulations referred to are, to my mind, exceedingly unsatisfactory and feeble. </para>

                        <para>- I am sure that if the Minister of Defence has not all the necessary knowledge at his fingers' ends at the. present time, he can very easily, to use a sporting phrase, get a few tips which would enable him to revise those regulations in such a way as to do everything which all but the most stringent teetotaller would approve, and that without giving the offence to our citizen soldiers which this measure certainly does give. As the Minister has already set the example, on more than one occasion, of appointing joint committees of soldiers and outsiders, and as I am one of both classes, I should be very glad indeed to form one of a committee of a few to look over these regulations with a view to offering suggestions. I should be very willing indeed to give any service of that kind which might be in my power, believing that such, service would be to the advantage of all concerned, and that the results of the Minister's action, were he to take such a course, would be infinitely preferable to any result which can possibly follow from the passing of this Bill. </para>

                        <para>.- The Minister of Defence admitted that this Bill was not very fully considered :n another place. When some honorable senators .asked for. certain information, he said that he would get it. The honorable senator asked me what information I desired, and I wrote out two or three long questions, that he might be able to secure answers to them. The Minister now states that he is getting information from all the States, but will not give honorable senators the benefit of it until he speaks himself. The honorable senator may be perfectly right in that ; but, in view of the fact that the information, will be of no use after the matter has been dealt with, I should like to ask if the honorable senator will continue the. debate when it is resumed ? </para>

I gathered from your statement that it is not your present intention to put the clauses one by one, as you would do in the cape of a Bill.

                        <para>. - I desire to have a clear understanding, because, in my opinion, we are proposing to adopt an extraordinary procedure. I gave notice of my intention to move some amendments, more as an addendum to the contract than anything else. I intended to move that no contract will be acceptable to the Senate which does not contain special provisions for cool storage, and lay down the maximum freight to be charged on produce, especially in the cool chambers. We cannot interfere with the conditions of the tender, because They were distributed to the world, and ship-owners based their tenders thereon. There is a question of principle involved. The Minister, I think, dealt fully with the whole matter yesterday in submitting his motion. </para>

The effect of adopting my suggestion would be that the agreement, as printed, would be definitely placed before the Committee. </para>

But I think it will meet the general wish if I do not attempt, at any rate at this stage, to repeat any of the' arguments I advanced yesterday when submitting the motion in the Senate. I would say now that after having listened to the expression of opinion from various honorable senators, certain action has been taken by the Government. Honorable senators are, of course, very well aware that this contract, embodying as it does articles of agreement and general conditions of tender, has been signed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Croker</inline> as the representative of the contractors. Since the discussion yesterday, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Croker</inline> has been communicated with by the Government, and he himself has communicated with his principals. I am in a position to state to the Committee now that so far as article 6 is concerned'., we shall be in a position to amend it by striking out the last two lines of the article with the exception of the word " shall." That is to say, we shall delete the words - </para>

                            <para>- So much the worse for the producers of the Commonwealth if the agreement is ratified without such an amendment. When, two years ago, the Commonwealth Government called for tenders for the carriage of mails between Australia and Europe, we inserted a condition that the vessels should supply a certain amount of space for cool storage. On this occasion tenderers, no doubt, had it in their minds that absolutely the same conditions would be required of them. </para>

                            <para>- Why should it not have been in their minds ? There are other conditions which the Minister himself said in his speech that it was not necessary to insert, because they were in previous contracts. Some time ago a Royal Commission was appointed by the State of Victoria to inquire into the butter industry. It was found that the producers of Australia were being bled, not only by the ship-owners, but by agents. The revelations were so strong that, on application being made to the Commonwealth Government, it said, We will make this a Royal Commission!." </para>

                            <para>- The Royal Commission has since reported. What was the effect of its reports? Its first report was signed on the 2nd November, 1904. A further report was issued on the 24th January, 1905. In those reports the Commissioners absolutely state that it is essential that any mail contracts that are made shall contain provisions for the carriage of produce from Australia to London. If the States neglect their duty to the producers in this respect, that is no reason why the Commonwealth Government should fail in its duty. </para>

                            <para>- I hesitate to interrupt the honorable senator, but it appears to me that his amendment is, at this stage, contrary to the understanding at which we have arrived - that we should take the motion of the Minister, and make in the articles under consideration, in their proper order, any amendment that it was desired to introduce. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> wishes to provide that accommodation shall be furnished for cool storage, he can at a convenient stage move to that effect. But if I allow the honorable senator to move the amendment to which he has been addressing himself as an amendment to the motion of the Minister, I shall also have to permit a number of other amendments. That would lead to a departure from the plan which has been suggested and adopted by the Committee. I urge the honorable senator to accept mv suggestion that we should deal with article 1. If no honorable senator has any amendment to submit we shall pass the article, and proceed with others, until we come to that stage when </para>

                    <para class="block">The reason I submit this amendment is that ostensibly this is a. mail contract, whereas, in reality, it is both a. mail and* a cargo contract. When speaking on the subject last year. I declared myself opposed to the Commonwealth Government having anything to do with the carriage of goods. I expressed the opinion that the Government should confine itself wholly te the carriage of mails, and that if the States wished to subsidize vessels foi' the conveyance of produce, they ought to provide the subsidy themselves. I still hold lo that opinion; and if the Government had made this a purely mail contract, I should never have submitted this amendment. But I have come to the conclusion, faking the contract itself, and judging by the evidence contained in it, that it is more than a mail contract. </para>

                            <para>- In any case, I am satisfied that this is not purely a mail contract. I have come to the conclusion that the Government, fearing it would raise opposition if they provided that the vessels should call at Melbourne and Sydney, and not at Brisbane and Hobart, have intentionally omitted this condition from the contract, while substantially subsidizing the contractors to allow the vessels to call at Melbourne and Sydney. I may be wrong in that conclusion ; but that is the inference I draw from "the way in which the contract is made out. If I am wrong, and there is no idea of subsidizing the company for the carriage of cargo, why is there the stipulation that' the steamers shall be of such a tonnage? One honorable senator told me to-day that the steamers will be of such magnitude that they will not be able to enter a single port in the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- I am not stating from any knowledge I possess that the ships will not be able to enter our harbors; I am merely repeating what I have heard. In any case, I submit the amendment, because I believe this to be a compound contract - a mail contract and a harbor cargo, contract. So far as I can make out, there is a deliberate attempt to deprive Queensland of the undoubted rights she possesses under the Constitution. By a subterfuge the boats are to go to Melbourne and Sydney, without the fact being mentioned in the contract, and, under such circumstances, Brisbane, of course, will have no claim. </para>

                            <para>- That is the fact in substance. It is not so stated in the conditions; but, if this is a mail contract. why stipulate for these huge floating hulks of 11,000 tons? Vessels half the size would, I suppose, be more than sufficient to carry the mails. Again, if this is merely a mail contract, why insist on the vessels continuing their voyage to the United Kingdom, after they have delivered the mails at Naples or some other port? </para>

                            <para>- I prefer to do things in my own way. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> desires to make this a purely mail contract, he ought to move in the direction he indicates. I have come to the conclusion that it is not possible, in view of the opposition that would be found in the Chamber, to make this a purely mail contract; therefore, I shall not attempt what I know I should not be able to accomplish. I am trying to get the Senate to agree to a proposal which I consider, in the circumstances, fair and reasonable - to state in the contract what is implied in reference to Melbourne and Sydney, namely, that the vessels shall not only call at these two ports, but proceed also to Brisbane and Hobart. I do not know that I am doing this in the right way, but I have taken the step which appears to me most likely to bring about the result I desire. I have given the reasons why I came to the conclusion that this is something more than a mail contract; and if those reasons appeal to honorable senators they will support me. On the other hand, if honorable senators regard this as a purely mail contract, they will not support the amendment. But from the internal evidence of this document, I have come to the conclusion that it means something very much more than a mail contract ; and, that being the case, all the principal ports of the Commonwealth should be placed on an equality, so far as calling at each of them is concerned. </para>

                        <para>. - I hope honorable senators will not support the amendment, which, as those who were present yesterday when we discussed the matter will see, is of far-reaching importance. In introducing this agreement, I pointed out that the Government had followed the course of calling for tenders for a purely mail contract. An expression of opinion to that effect was made in this branch of the Legislature, if not in another place, when we discussed the Orient contract last year. Honorable senators who have perused the general conditions of tender, and the articles of agreement, must recognise that, on the face of it, and in substance, it is purely a mail contract. If those persons who are going to provide the means of transit choose, as is only natural, to, at the same time, use the ships for other purposes, it is purely their own affair. </para>

                        <para>There is one objection, however, to this contract, which I think may be very fairly urged from the Commonwealth point of view. To my mind, it unnecessarily mixes up the conveyance of produce with the carriage of mails. We have nothing to do with the export trade of the various States. All we ought to interest ourselves in is the carriage of mails from Naples to Adelaide. No doubt it is extremely desirable that vessels coming here should take away produce <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> the most favorable terms, but that is not our business ; it is the duty of the States to arrange that matter. Would the Commonwealth make an arrangement between different post-offices within its jurisdiction for the carriage of goods as well as for the carriage of mails? </para>

                        <para>Of course, if any matter could properly be brought within the category of mail matter, it would be the business of the Post Office t» arrange for its transmission. But surely it would not enter into competition with the railways in the carriage of wheat, or turnips, or potatoes ! Under existing circumstances that class of business would be considered to be outside its sphere. The carriage of produce between Australia and Europe is in exactly the same category. No doubt it is desirable that we should have cold storage and low freights by steamers visiting the different ports at regular intervals. But it is the business of the States to arrange for the steamers to call. When we have arrived at a state of unification, it will then be the duty of the Commonwealth to make the arrangements in these matters. Until that event occurs, however, we ought not to interfere with the functions of the States. In the contract it has been expressly stipulated that whilst the mails are tq be landed at Adelaide, the steamers must proceed to Melbourne and Sydney. </para>

                    <para class="block">We provide in this contract that the steamers shall call at Brindisi, and, so far as Australia is concerned, at Adelaide. There is1 no provision made obliging the boats to call at any other port. </para>

                            <para>- Of course they would not. The idea of the contract is that Adelaide is to be the terminal port for the eastern States, so far as the carriage of mails is concerned. If the boats did not call at Fremantle, it would be necessary for the Western Australian mails to&gt; be brought over to Adelaide. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has spoken as if the people of Queensland would necessarily have a grievance if the provisions of this contract were allowed to stand. As opposed to the honorable senator's suggestion, I venture to&gt; submit to the Committee some views that have been recently expressed in Brisbane. In speaking yesterday I said that on the last occasion on which we dealt with an English mail contract the Government and* people of Queensland expressed an opinion that that contract was so framed, and its terms were such, that Queensland was unfavorably discriminated against. I have here an extract from a report of an interview with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kidston,</inline> the Premier of Queensland, which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane Courier</inline> of the 20th of last month.. This report says - </para>

                        <para>Referring to the mail contract yesterday afternoon, the Premier made an important statement : " <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin's</inline> action in the matter, so far as. I can see, has been quite correct," he said. " He tried to get the several States to arrange to pay the subsidy for what might be called a commercial service, in addition to the mail service, and the Southern States naturally refused' to agree with it. They knew quite well that they would get the steamers without it. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> was then left to provide for a postal service, terminating at Adelaide. I am giving the matter according to mv understanding of it. Adelaide is the end of our railway system in Australia, and Queensland has no more right to complain than Victoria or New South Wales would have. But, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> knew - and every one else knew - these steamers were likely to come on to Melbourne and Sydney- for commercial reasons ; and the fact that the agents of" the company wrote a letter saying that they would do so does not alter the fact in any way, and did not constitute an engagement to do it in such a way, but it became a part of the mail' contract. As I understand it, the mail contract was a separate thing, and the mail service was; to terminate at Adelaide. </para>

                        <para>The only thing that would have justified us in complaining of the action of the Federal Government would have arisen if they had provided in the contract for other States to get an advantage from the service, in which Queensland was not sharing. So faT as I understand at present, that has not been done. The Federal Government have simply completed what seemed to them a desirable postal contract; and although the arrangement may not suit us so well as if we had been included in the service, I cannot see that any intentional injustice has been done. </para>

The desire of human nature for business and profit is no weaker amongst persons forming shipping companies than amongst other human beings, and I therefore submit that we may take it for granted that if the attractions of Queensland in the way of trade are sufficiently great, these vessels will go to Brisbane, as well as to Melbourne and Sydney, in which case the object which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has in view will be sufficiently served bv allowing these ordinary human motives to come into play.

                            <para>- That is so, but I understood the Minister to say that there was a serious objection to the cost of carrying the heavier mail matter from the terminal port in Southern Europe across that Continent. I imagine that the same drawback would operate in the transport of the heavier mail matter from Adelaide to Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane. At all events. I ask the Minister what arrangement is to be made for the conveyance of the heavier portion of the mails eastward from Adelaide? </para>

                        <para>. - I intend to support the amendment. That this is more than a mail contract alone is shown by the fact that the Government insist that the company shall provide. 11, 000-ton boats. To carry our mails from Brindisi to Adelaide there is no necessity to have boats of that tonnage. Clearly. the boats are intended to carry something more than mails. The Commonwealth Government converted the Butter Commission, which had been created by the Government of Victoria, into a Federal Royal ' Commission, and it made two reports to the Governor-General. Regarding ocean freights, it said - </para>

                        <para>After much deliberation upon the evidence regarding ocean freights, we are of opinion that this is one of the most pressing questions concerning the butter industry. It is also a question of vital importance to the Commonwealth, inasmuch as the majority of our rural producers are interested in the export of butter. This trade, therefore, may now be recognised as one of the most important to the people of Australia. </para>

                        <para>Since the inception of the export trade in butter, the carriage of this product has been practically in the hands of the mail companies. Whilst readily acknowledging the fact that the facilities offered by the mail companies assisted the butter industry at its inception, the present action of these companies in endeavouring to secure a contract for a number of years at a trivial reduction on the existing high rates, must be looked upon in the light of the evidence, as an attempt to monopolize the trade. </para>

In the contract under consideration to-night, there is no such provision made. Unless it be made, it would be far better for the Commonwealth to get its mails carried on the poundage system, Because the cost would be a good deal less than ^125,000 a year. </para>

My opinion is that the proposal of the Government is really to hand over to a few speculators a concession to be traded off in the London market. The duty of Parliament is not to play into the hands of a few speculators, but to consider the interests of the people of Australia. On these grounds, I intend to vote for the amendment. </para>

                        <para>.- There are very many desirable alterations which I admit we should like to make in the articles of agreement. I suppose that a number of us sympathize with the desire of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> to bind the ships to call at certain ports, and with the contention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> that cargo accommodation should be provided for. We should have been all the more satisfied if this had been not only a mail contract, but also a produce-carrying contract. </para>

                        <para>. - I trust that not much more time will be spent in debating this point. The proposal to add these ports of call is really tantamount to a proposal to put the contract into the waste-paper basket. When I look at the articles of agreement, I am quite surprised at the unbusiness-like character of certain of the proposals from the point of view of the contractors. I do not think that we should risk what is now offered. I say that with very keen regret, on account of the probability - almost the certainty - that we shall shortly lose the services of the Orient Steam Navigation Company for the carriage of our mails. I do not like to see an old servant - a company that has faithfully for many years, during hard times, and with little remuneration, performed its duties - terminate its connexion with the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- It may not be correct in the case of vessels that travel along the coast, or go over to Tasmania, but it is necessary in the case of vessels that are built to travel over practically half the world. We find that on the Atlantic the vessels that travel between twenty and thirty miles an hour are of immense tonnage. The larger the tonnage the higher the speed is the general rule for mail . vessels, and that is the reason why we are to have large vessels on this service. I do not trouble very much a"bout the term " 11,000 tons registered tonnage." The .provision is drawn loosely and improperly, but I have no doubt that it means gross tonnage. But that is one of the articles that I point out as being loosely drawn from the contractors' point of view. I believe that, on a strictly legal interpretation, the term 11,000 tons might be construed to mean net tonnage, which would require vessels of SUCH large tonnage that they could not come through the Suez: Canal. </para>

                        <para>. - When speaking yesterday I certainly felt a little alarm about some of the articles of the contract. I am glad that the Minister has cleared away one of my difficulties. I feel very much relieved in that regard. I should have preferred to see an article in the contract as to the vessels being compelled to call at Melbourne and Sydney. I should also be glad if there had been an article providing for cool storage. The Orient Steam Navigation Company at the present time is complying with the conditions that I have mentioned. The company is under contract to supply cool storage, and to call at Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane. I believe that the contract under consideration would not be affected to the extent of a one-pound note if the company were asked to do the same as the Orient Steam Navigation Company are doing now. But I see the difficulty that the Government has had. The Premiers of the States were communicated with, and asked if they would do anything in regard to the carriage of produce. I am very sorry that they did not do something, even if it was only to contribute a sum between them. But, that not having been done, the Commonwealth Government was relieved of responsibility to a great extent. </para>

                            <para>- Does the honorable senator mean to say that they will draw too much water to enable them to enter the port of Melbourne? I do not believe that the contract means anything but gross tonnage, and, for my own part, I consider that11,000 tons is quite sufficient. I do not want to see 20,000-ton vessels coming here just now. Vessels of 11,000 tons registered tonnage could not turn round in Brindisi, and would have to pay£78,000 per annum in dues through the Suez Canal. There is no doubt, in my opinion, that 11,000 tons gross is meant in this contract; and that the term "11,000 tons registered " is a mistake. </para>

                            <para>- Made by the contracting parties. The very fact that the vessels are to be so large implies that they will carry cargo. They must, in order to make them pay. The amount paid to them by the Government would be a mere nothing if they did not earn a lot of money in carrying cargo. There is just a bare possibility that the New Zealand Government may subsidize the vessels. In my own opinion that is a remote contingency ; but if I thought that there was any danger in that direction, I should vote for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart's</inline> amendment. Believing that there is no danger, I must support the contract as it stands. </para>

                        <para>. - I think it is very ungrateful of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> after not only suggesting, but urging - in fact, entreating and pleading - on a previous occasion that the Commonwealth Government should contract for nothing but the carriage of mails, and that the vessels should stop at Adelaide, that he should express dissatisfaction with the proposed contract. Every honorable senator remembers how pathetic <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> was on that subject. His eloquent words burnt into the very soul of nearly every one who heard him. The Government, when an opportunity occurred, took up almost every one of his suggestions, and is now endeavouring to put them into a contract. According to what the Honorary Minister has read, the very Premier of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart's</inline> State has been influenced by his pleadings and suggestions of several months ago. Yet the honorable senator is not satisfied. He ought to be the happiest man in Australia; unless, as on another occasion, he has met some man from North Queensland who has influenced him in quite another direction. I am sure that every honorable senator is anxious that a favorable bargain should be made with respect to cool storage with any company that contracts to carry our mails. But I differ from some honorable senators with respect to a contract of this description. The paper placed before us contains the conditions under which tenders were furnished. When the Commonwealth Government called for tenders, the offer was open to all the syndicates and private firms in the world. Certain conditions were laid down. Tenders were sent in under those conditions. Now the agreement comes be- fore us, and some honorable senators object to it. These objections should have been raised when the conditions were being formulated. If any one could show that the terms of the contract are not in accordance with the conditions of tender, there would be some excuse for radical amendments. But honorable senators know very well, and I believe that the Government know very well, that if this agreement is not accepted, practically as it is, or if any material alteration is made in it, the contract will be set aside altogether. We shall then be in the same difficulty that we experienced some years ago, seeing that on 31st January, 1908, the present contract will come to an end. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie's</inline> objections are of a varied character. </para>

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has expressed the opinion that the vessels will not be able to enter the port of Melbourne. Well, I do not suppose that the vessels will come up to Prince's-bridge, if only because the Queen's-bridge is in the way ; I do not suppose, indeed, that it is intended to bring the vessels into the Yarra at all. But if there is not depth enough at Port Melbourne or Williamstown, surely, with the dredge that was obtained from England some time ago, the Harbor Trust or the Government could make the port capable of accommodating vessels of the kind. In the place from which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> comes, it was possible, some years ago, to wade across the river, whereas now vessels of the size which has been mentioned can be built and launched there. </para>

I do not care whether the tonnage mentioned be net or gross ; if the vessels were 20,000 tons it would be the duty of the different Governments in Australia to make provision for them, in the interests of the producers. Such arguments as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has used do not weigh with me for one moment. According to the amendment, the vessels would be bound to call at Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, and Hobart. </para>

                            <para>- I am not going to decry the shipping facilities of the Commonwealth. If those facilities are not equal to any in the world, they can be made so. Our natural advantages in this respect are greater than can be Found anywhere else. If the ports at present are not able to accommodate vessels of the size proposed, they can easily be made to do so, because our ports, in their natural conditions, are superior to any to be found in the old world. I have not the slightest doubt that the vessels under this contract will always call at Melbourne and Sydney for the purposes of obtaining a full cargo. If this amendment were carried, the vessels would be compelled every trip to call also at Brisbane and Hobart; but honorable senators know very well that there are certain times of the year when no cargo can be procured at those ports. Under those circumstances, why should the vessels be compelled to call, when, it might be, they could only do so at great loss ? We may rest assured that the vessels will call at every port where they can find cargo that will pay, and there is no need for any compulsion in the matter. The greater the number of shipping companies trading to Australia the better it will be for the producers of this country, because competition must result in reasonable freights. </para>

I never knew a shipping company send vessels to a country for butter where they could get nothing but wheat, or send them for wheat where they could get nothing but rice. Each shipping "company sends vessels to places where they can get the cargo that is wanted, and so it will be with the company under the contract. This is a serious matter, and I am endeavouring to show that we ought to adopt this contract. What those who support the amendment desire will be gained if it will pay the shipping company to call at the ports mentioned. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has described this as a mere option agreement which is going to be hawked about Great Britain in order to form a company with the object of robbing the people of Australia.

Then if the public were dissatisfied with the poundage system we should be in a position to say that the Government had done all they possibly could, and that private enterprise having failed, it was an opportune time to charter a line of steamers of our own. The position would afford justification for such a proposal. We must remember that the contract is for the carriage of our mails from Adelaide to Brindisi, and that, sofar as the producers are concerned, there will always be the competition of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company. </para>

If the company were not doing what was in the best interests of Australia, the Government would have power under the contract to say, " You are not doing what is right, and we shall therefore put into operation one of the provisions of this agreement. We shall take over your boats, and run them ourselves in the interests of the Commonwealth." Is not that a safeguard in the interests of the producers of the Commonwealth ? </para>

                            <para>- I shall satisfy <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> before I have finished. Suppose that the existing shipping companies agreed to carry produce at such low rates that in three or four years the contractors for this mail service would have to cave in ? The same power would still lie with the Commonwealth Government to take over the vessels, and continue to run them. Then the cut-throat competition would be against the Commonwealth vessels, and if the producers of Australia saved £t, 000,000 or £1,500,000 in reduced freights, could they not afford to pay a little in taxation to support vessels owned by the Commonwealth when it was by the competition of those vessels that they were enabled to secure the low rates of freight? I hope that honorable senators will see that, so far as the cut-throat competition is concerned, it can do the Commonwealth no harm. I hope that the amendment, if not withdrawn, will not be carried, and that we shall do the best we can to have this contract agreed to. If it is agreed to the Commonwealth will be placed, so far as a mail service is concerned, in a better position than any of the States Iba ve ever occupied under a mail contract. Honorable senators will see that I support the ratification of this contract, not from any great anxiety to support the Government, or to defeat the opposition to the contract, but because I believe that, so far as the carriage of our mails is concerned, this agreement will be in the best interests of the Commonwealth, and that ultimately it is bound to be also in the best interests of the producers of Australia. </para>

                    <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator DE</inline>LARGIE (Western Australia) [9.35J. - I am quite in accord with the sympathetic remarks which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> made concerning the loss of this service by the Orient Steam Navigation Company. We have to remember that the Orient Steam Navigation Company is a White-labour company, and on that ground most honorable senators must have considerable sympathy with it in the circumstances. It is possible that they would prefer to have seen the Orient Steam Navigation Company in the position of the contractors for the new service, but there can be no doubt* that if the size of the boats to be provided is any indication, the new company will give us a better service than the Orient Steam Navigation Company has supplied. Whilst the Orient Steam Navigation Company has failed to obtain the contract for the new service, they will have the comfort which every free-trader is every ready to give to the man who is cut out of a job, that they can turn their attention to something else for the time being. I do not know whether they will succeed in getting something, else, but the opportunity to try for it will be open to them. I can agree with many of the remarks which have fallen from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie.</inline> I should like to have seen this contract made more of a cargo contract than it is, but apparently all the efforts of the Commonwealth Government to secure the co-operation of the) States Governments to that end 'were in vain. They could not induce the States Governments to meet them, and were consequently obliged to make terms for a mail contract pure and simple, and, with the exception of the reference to the size of the vessels to be provided, to leave all questions affecting the carriage of cargo out of consideration in the preparation of this contract. With respect to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart's</inline> amendment, I believe that if it were inserted we might as well tear up this contract at once, as it would become necessary to start the whole of the negotiations over again. I am satisfied that if the amendment is accepted, it will be impossible for any one, to deny another claim which will be brought forward, and that is the claim that the Vancouver service shall be continued to Fremantle for the benefit of Western Australia. If the one claim is granted, the other cannot be denied, and so the whole thing would be made ridiculous. Our business at the present time is to secure as good a contract as we can get for the carriage of our mails to and from the most convenient port in Australia, for their distribution and collection. In order if possible to a'waken the consciences of some honorable senators, and particularly of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> I should like to say that rather than that the Committee should accept the amendment, I should prefer that the word " Adelaide " should be left out, with a view to insert the word "Fremantle." Fremantle is the first Australian port at which these boats will touch on the voyage from Europe, and why should they go beyond that port? </para>

                            <para>- It is due, not to the combine alone, but to the operations of all the shipping companies. It is notorious that freights to Adelaide are higher than to Melbourne, and I believe that in the same way freights from Europe are also higher to Melbourne than to Sydney. The proposal to fix freights would probably meet the views of commercial people in all of the Australian ports, but we know very well that, at the present time, such a proposal is impracticable, and it is useless to waste time in discussing it. If all these conditions are to be dragged into this contract it will be torn up, and we must begin negotiations for a new contract. I regret that, after further light has been thrown on the subject, reference should again be made to-night to the tonnage of these boats. We have had no fresh proof from those who hold that the registered tonnage of a ship is her net tonnage. Undoubtedly it is the gross tonnage. </para>

                    <para>Tonnage under deck means the total measurement under the weather deck. To arrive at the net tonnage you must deduct (1) the measurement of the houses on deck and the superstructure ; and (2) the space taken up below deck by machinery, accommodation for the crew, and the bunkers. </para>
                    <para>Let us take an example. The <inline font-style="italic">Moldavia</inline> is one of the new 10,000-tonners' of the P. and O. Company's fleet. Lloyd's Register gives her gross registered tonnage as 9,500 tons, her ion.nage under deck at 7,202 tons, and her net tonnage as 4,92s tons. So you see, her net tonnage is only about half of the gross tonnage. Without doubt <inline font-weight="bold">Sir James</inline> Laing and Sons referred to the gross registered tonnage when they contracted to supply steamers of 11,000 tons registered tonnage. The tonnage is measured by a formula. When shipping people speak of registered tonnage they always mean the gross registered tonnage. </para>

Surely he must remember quite well that I put crucial questions to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Paxton</inline> to discover exactly what he did know. I questioned him about the net line, the load line, heaving the lead, the marks and deeps on the lead, and the tonnage question. All the authorities which have Been quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie count for nothing as against the decisions of the Court on this point. </para>

                            <para>- But the Merchant Shipping Act itself provides that it shall apply to the " whole of Her Majesty's Dominion, and to all places where Her Majesty has jurisdiction. " The Royal Commission on Navigation, of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie was a member, did not touch that part of the Act, thereby acknowledging that the Commonwealth has no power to affect a single letter of it. Section 79 of the Act provides how the registered' tonnage shall be arrived at. In the case of sailing ships allowance is to be made for space for the crew, space for storage of sails, and stowage. In the case of a steam-ship, allowance is to be made for the space occupied by the propelling power, the space necessary for the crew and for stores. When these factors are deducted from the gross tonnage you arrive at the registered tonnage of the ship. Yet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie has stated that what I have asserted is absolutely wrong. He puts himself up as an authority above <inline font-style="italic">Chitty.</inline> . If the honorable senator will go down to the wharf to-morrow, and board any British ship, he will find indelibly cut into the main hatch her registered tonnage. When any proof is wanted regarding the tonnage of a ship, it is not necessary to go to Lloyd's, or to look at the ship's papers. Her registered tonnage is cut with a chisel into the main hatch ; and she is charged her dues in every port in the British Dominions on that tonnage. I intend to try to make it absolutely clear that 11,000 tons' registered tonnage in this agreement means 11,000 tons registered tonnage within the meaning of the Merchant Shipping Act. I feel certain that if we could bring the Postmaster-General to the bar of the Senate, and examine him, the honorable gentleman would have to acknowledge that when he signed the contract he thought it meant 11,000 tons "registered," within the meaning of the Merchant Shipping Act, and1 not 11,000 gross. There is a considerable amount of mystery about this matter. If we were entering into a contract with an existing shipping company we should know whom we were dealing with. But what is our position now ? We do not know who the contractors are. I asked the Minister yesterday to give us a copy of the cablegram authorizing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Croker</inline> to enter into this agreement. It was not forthcoming to-day. I asked the question again, but Ve have no notification that we are to get the information. We are, completely in the dark, entering into a contract with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> H. Croker to supply us with a fortnightly service with vessels of 11,000 tons registered tonnage. </para>

                            <para>- I have seen paragraphs in the newspapers - I suppose they were inspired - stating that this is a contract entered into by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir James</inline> Laing and Sons Limited. They are described as shipbuilders, not ship-owners. I do not know whether their articles of association allow them to enter into a contract of this description. The Minister, in reply to a question, informed me that they did not know, but that they assumed the formalities were all right. What right have we, as custodians of the people's interests, to assume that the articles of association of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir James</inline> Laing and Sons allow them to enter into such a contract? I asked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> if he would make such an assumption in the case of a private client of his own. </para>

If there is a guarantee that this is a <inline font-style="italic">bona fide</inline> tender, and that the contractors are in a position to carry out the agreement, probably a good deal of my opposition .would fall to the ground. At the present time, however, the contract appears to me to be an absolute shadow. There is as yet no company in existence, and we have no guarantee that the articles of association of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir James</inline> Laing and Sons permit them to run vessels of the kind. My own opinion is that a company has vet to be floated, and that the contract will have to be assigned to that company per <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> H. Croker. Under the agreement, the Postmaster-General has an absolute right to make that assignment; and I hope that when the time comes, we shall provide that it shall not be made without the sanction of Parliament. </para>

                        <para>. - I should like to reply to the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> on the observations which I made on this subject twelve months ago. I adhere to every word I uttered on that occasion. I believe that the Government should undertake a mail contract only ; but since they have seen fit to make it also a produce-carrying contract, I am not going to permit dust to be thrown in my eyes. </para>

                            <para>- That is exactly where the cunning of the document comes in. The understanding is so cleverly concealed as to be invisible to people who do not want to see it, but to others it is so plain that he who runs may read. Why is there this stipulation as to the tonnage of the vessels? It is ridiculous to assume that it is for the purpose of carrying mails. The Government stipulate not for one vessel, but for a whole fleet. The Government say to the prospective - and prospecting - company not only that they must build vessels of 11,000 tons, but must submit the plans and specifications to the Government representative. If there is no understanding that they are to be cargo vessels, why all these stipulations? The Prime Minister said that an arrangement, or understanding, had been arrived at <inline font-style="italic">sub rosa</inline> - though he did not use those words - that the boats were to proceed to Melbourne and Sydney ; and he might have added that that condition was not included in the contract, lest the Queensland people should desire them to also call at Brisbane. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable senator had listened he would have understood that my objection to the contract is that it is more than a mail contract, and if I am right in that, the vessels ought to be bound to go on to Brisbane and Hobart. If this is a mail contract only, the company's connexion with the Commonwealth should end at Adelaide and Brindisi. I have pointed out that the internal evidence of the contract itself convincingly proves to any man open to reason that a. cargo contract is contemplated, as well as a mail contract. It is as plainly there in the terms of the contract as the nose upon a man's face. I have pointed out that it does not affect the representatives of Western Australia, South Australia, Victoria, or New South Wales, because the vessels will call at Fremantle, at Adelaide, and probably also at Melbourne and Sydney. </para>

                            <para>- They are not bound by this contract to call at Melbourne or Sydney, and. our Victorian and New South Wales friends may find themselves in a difficulty some early morning. We have had some experience of the operations of shipping rings- in Australia already. I remember that the Aberdeen Company was in the habit of Bringing goods from Europe consigned to Queensland, and of actually taking them out of their vessels at Sydney to be sent on to Brisbane by other vessels, whilst the vessels in which' they were brought to Sydney continued their voyage to Brisbane. That foolish and vicious action was compelled by the shipping ring. What security have we that this company which is now being organized will not be a member of the same shipping ring, and that as a consequence the fierce competition amongst the shipping companies, on which some of our friends seem to rely so strongly, will not vanish into thin air? It is quite within the bounds of possibility that the New Zealand Government will offer this company a subsidy, and that, as a consequence, instead of sending their boats on to Melbourne and Sydney from Adelaide, as some of our friends fondly expect they will, they will prefer <inline font-style="italic">fo</inline> send them on te New Zealand,' and thus place the producers of the eastern States in a most difficult position. </para>

                            <para>- What I have said does not prove anything of the kind. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> does not see anything in this contract but what he desires to see. I repeat that these vessels are not bound to go to Sydney and Melbourne, and that is just where the company are getting the better of our friends from New South Wales and Victoria. Honorable senators representing those States believe that in this contract they are getting the better of Queensland, and that is why they propose to agree to the bargain. But the company, while aiding and abetting them to outwit Queensland, are at the same time outwitting themselves. That is the position. A threat on the part of the company not to call at Melbourne and Sydney would compel the producers in the eastern States to come to any terms which the combine might exact. Any one can see that, and even if honorable senators from New South Wales and Victoria do not care very much about the interests of Queensland, they should try to conserve the interests of their own State. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> was kind enough to tell the Committee what the Premier of Queensland thinks about the subject. I may inform the honorable senator that I had a conversation with the Premier of Queensland not very long ago, in which I believe I persuaded that honorable gentleman, much against his will, to my own way of thinking with regard to these contracts, and that is that they ought to be mail contracts pure and simple. </para>

                            <para>- No, recently. The Premier of Queensland evidently has not realized that this contract is something more than a mail contract, and that is why he has spoken in the terms quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating.</inline> The honorable and learned senator gave the Committee the benefit of the opinion of one organ of public opinion in Queensland, and I will read the opinion of another. Not that I care very much for either, because I very seldom agree with them, or they with me. Just in order to show that there is some difference of opinion in Queensland on this subject, I take the liberty of reading what the <inline font-style="italic">Courier</inline> has to say about it. I ask the special attention of honorable senators to the following article, which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane Courier</inline> of Friday, 27th June: - </para>

                    </continue>
                    <para>The statement made that either the letter or the spirit of the new mail contract provides for Adelaide being the terminal port of call for the mail steamers received a flat contradiction from the Prime Minister's own explanation, as given in the House of Representatives. One need not question that it may, as he says, be the best mail contract - for the southern States - that has yet been entered into; but, so far as Queensland is concerned, no advantage whatever has been gained. The vessels, remarked <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> were to" be constructed according to plans submitted to the Government, with a provision for more than three times the cold storage of the present liners. Here, then, is the assumption that the purpose of the contract is, not only the speedy and regular delivery of mail matter, but also the regular and speedy carriage of refrigerated produce from Australian ports to the markets of the United Kingdom. If the only question to be considered was the saving of time between Brindisi and Adelaide, the two terminal ports for the receipt of the mail bags, why should it have been deemed necessary to submit plans of the steamers to the Federal Government, and why should there have been any reference to the fact that the new steamers will have more than three times the frozen space of the present steamers? From first to last, within and outside the terms of the mail contract, there is a clear understanding that it has as much to do with the carriage of produce as with the regular delivery of letters; and the boast made about increase of space has no meaning unless. there isa definite assurance that the mail steamers wilt call at other ports as well as Adelaide. The same conclusion is reached by other lines of argument. </para>
                    <para class="block">I ask honorable senators to pay particular attention to this part of the article. </para>
                    <para>Suppose, for example, that there has been&gt; any uncertainty as to whether the mail steamers would call at Melbourne or Sydney there would1 have been no meaning in the Prime Minister'sreference to greater facilities for the carriage of Australian produce, as South Australia has not developed at such a rate as to require three times the frozen space for her products, and it is certain that the shippers of Melbourne and' Sydney would not send the produce of their own States by subsidiary steamers for transshipment at Adelaide. It is only a quibble to say that the two southern ports were not specifically mentioned' in the mail contract, when its general terms imply the inclusion of these ports in any contract that might be accepted, and when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakinhas</inline> been given the private assurance of the agents of the new company that for commercial reasons the steamers would continue their voyage to Melbourne and Sydney. Another consideration must be duly weighed in connexion with the comparatively high subsidy to be paid. The only justification for such a subsidy is found in increased1 speed and better accommodation for frozen produce. There never yet has been a mail contract in which the two things have not been associated ;. and supreme folly would be shown' in their dissociation. Where a subsidy has to be paid for the carriage of the mails it is surely cheaper and more efficient to arrange that the steamers which carry the mails shall also be thoroughly equipped for the carriage of frozen produce, as the same canal and port dues have to be paid, and there is practically the same cost of working the steamers. </para>

And the result of all this boastful talking and argument is that Brisbane has been treated as utterly unworthy of consideration, and that Queensland producers shall pay taxes in order to give the producers of other St ates advantages which they themselves do not enjoy. The splendid mail steamers of 11,000 tons, fitted to carry three times the former amount of produce, will call at Fremantle and Adelaide - by- compulsion ; at Sydney and Melbourne - according to a definite understanding ; but Brisbane, -which commands a wider scope df country and greater natural resources than are tapped by any other Australian port, is asked to accept an arrangement in which there is neither compulsion nor understanding that Queenslanders would be given the same benefits conferred on other Australians. The people of southern Queensland must contribute in cash for a subsidy that will give the other States a fortnightly service of splendid cargo steamers; but if they want the same service they must arrange for a special subsidy. And yet, according to the Constitution of the Commonwealth, no differentiation is supposed to be made between State and State. Tn a matter of this kind, one might expect that Queensland's representatives will' show a united and resolute front against the Federal Government. Their failure to do so should make electors pause and consider when the next appeal is -.-made to the country. </para>

It has given some honorable senators an opportunity to go over the terms of the contract, although, nominally, a particular article only is before the Chair. I sincerely hope that at the next sitting they will, as far as possible, endeavour to confine their arguments to the amendment before the Committee.

                    <para class="block">The consideration of this contract was begun at the earliest opportunity this week, and, of course, to-morrow will be our last day of sitting in this week. Tor some time the terms of the contract have been under the consideration of the members of each House, if not legislatively, at any rate privately. The contractors are at some distance from the scene of our deliberations, and they can only receive information by cablegram. From communications which have been received from the contractors, I have every reason to assume that they are informed to the effect that their capacity .to fulfil the terms of this contract has been, very seriously canvassed both inside and outside the Parliament of Australia. With regard to the amendments which it was indicated would be made in the Senate, arid the amendments which have been made elsewhere, the Government have taken the precaution in each instance of securing in advance the signature of the representative of the contractors thereto, so that under no circumstances could it be said afterwards that the adoption of the amendments was a ground for them to abandon the contract. </para>

                            <para>- I do not say that. So far the policy of the Government has been to get an indorsement of any amendment before it has been approved, because it is quite possible that, upon the adoption of certain amendments, it might be open to the contractors to retire from the position they have taken up. </para>
