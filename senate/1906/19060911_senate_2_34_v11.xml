                        <para>- That is a matter for the Government to consider. I dare say it would please certain honorable senators if we dropped a large proportion of our measures. At the present time the notice-paper of the Senate contains eight Government orders of the day, while the notice-paper of the other House contains eleven Government orders of the day, including two Bills which have passed the Senate, thus leaving nine orders of the day which will have to be passed and sent to us, or. otherwise disposed of. I think I am fairly entitled to ask the Senate to give me the extra time for which I ask, so that honorable senators may have a fair opportunity to discuss, not only the measures on the notice-paper for to-day, but the measures which will come up from another place, including the Appropriation Bill, which of course will have to be passed. My attention has been called to the fact that, by my motion, I am proposing to take away the whole of the time allotted to private business. The private business on the notice-paper comprises notices of motion and orders of the day. A motion, if passed, could produce no special result unless the Government took action or the honorable senator interested brought in -a Bill to deal with its subject-matter, but that would be practically impossible this session. Two honorable senators have, however, embodied their views in Bills. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has brought forward a Bill to amend the Papua Act in regard to the election of Legislative Councillors, whilst <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has brought forward a Bill for the purpose of taking a referendum of the people on a question upon which he feels very strongly, J think it is only fair to those two honorable .senators that they, should have an opportunity of testing the feeling of the Senate, and therefore I ask leave, to add to my motion the following words: - and except that private members' Bills already on the notice-paper take precedence of all other business on Thursdays after the tea adjournment. </para>

                    <para>. - With one statement which fell from the lips of the Minister of Defence, I do not suppose that there will be any dissent, and that is the expression of his desire that the work of the session should end on the 30th September. He will recognise that he used the argument as a lever to induce the Senate to agree to the motion.' I admit at once that if it is properly so used, it may have a material effect upon the way' in which I intend to vote. But I would draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that wittingly or unwittingly the Minister did not commit himself to anything more than a pious hope that we should suspend our work on the 30th September. </para>

                        <para>- If the Minister of Defence can give the Senate an assurance that it is the intention of the Government to terminate the session on the 30th September, I believe that it will go a long way to induce every honorable senator, no matter where he sits, to vote with him. If, on the other hand, he is merely saying, in so many words, " I hope that by adopting this course we shall be able to finish the business on the 30th September," his argument is not so convincing to those honorable senators who still have on the notice-paper business which they would like to submit to the Senate. Perhaps, before I go any further, the Minister will intimate whether he can give a definite undertaking on that point? </para>

I hope, however, that the Senate will not have to indulge in any -of those all-night sittings which we have had on previous occasions in order to get our work done. Certainly I shall be no party to anything of the kind. But two exceptions have been made in regard to -private business. I have no objection - in fact I rather welcome the statement - to the two Bills fathered respectively by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> being proceeded with this session. I hope they will be. But even though an opportunity be given to the Senate to discuss those measures there is no certainty that the debates will not be fruitless, inasmuch as divisions may not take place upon them. If we could have such an assurance from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford,</inline> I should say at once that we might very fairly meet the convenience of the honorable senators concerned. </para>

                        <para>- Seeing that neither <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> nor any one else can give such an assurance, it does not seem reasonable that valuable time, which is required for the consideration of important public business, should be occupied upon those measures. But there is upon the notice-paper another item of private business which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> has put in a different category. I allude to a motion moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe.</inline> I admit at once that it differs from the private business instanced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford,</inline> inasmuch as it is not in the form of a Bill. But I myself have been most anxious, not merely to speak - I would even forego the right of speech - but to secure a division upon that motion. As a matter of fact, I waited on four successive Thursdays in the hope of furthering it. Now it is important to me - and I venture to suggest that it is equally important to my honorable friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe</inline> - that we should if possible secure a division upon that motion before the end of the session. I hope, therefore, that he will join with me in objecting to the removal of it from the notice-paper unless we have some assurance that the two Bills referred" to will proceed at any rate to a division on their second reading. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe</inline> may justly feel himself aggrieved by being deprived of the opportunity of hearing an expression of views from other speakers with regard to it, while an exception is made in favour of two other items of private business. The question with which his motion is concerned is one of vital importance not only to the Commonwealth as a whole, but to every State, and it should not be shelved without further discussion, and without an opportunity being given to secure an expression of the view of the Senate- </para>

                    <para>. - I had intended to ask the Minister of Defence if he could see his way to amend his motion further by excepting the order of the day set down under private business, and headed " Commonwealth Revenue and Expenditure : Sharing of on basis of population." It may be said that other honorable senators who have motions on the business paper have an equal right to be considered. In a general way I grant that contention; but I think that, if honorable senators look at the question fairly and squarely, they will come to the conclusion that, however important several other motions may be, the motion introduced tow me, and which 'has been debated on a couple of Thursday afternoons, transcends in importance any other matter of private business which has been before the Senate. I say that because the question with which it deals goes to the root of our present financial system, which operates greatly to the inconvenience of two of the States. Without touching on the merits of the motion, I hope that the Minister of Defence will see his way clear to include it also in the exceptions mentioned in his amended motion. There is some validity in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford's</inline> 'contention that the. two matters of private business which he has agreed shall be dealt with again are Bills which, if carried to a division; and passed through all stages in the Senate, might also be carried through the other branch of the Legislature; whereas a notice of motion, even if supported by a majority on a division, would have no practical effect. But I was: hoping that, if my motion were agreed to&gt; by a majority, the Government might afford am opportunity for it to be introduced in the other House. Even if that were not done, it would be an important step to have obtained the opinion of this branch of the Legislature upon the question. If: Parliament had met a couple of months; earlier, it would not have been necessary for the Government to cut off private members' time before matters of importances have been dealt with. I also call attention to the fact that, if there had been sufficient time for the discussion of my motion,, and it had been passed, there would have been an opportunity to bring in a Bill to&gt; give effect to it. We might as well amend1 the Standing Orders, and abolish the time for private business altogether, if an opportunity is not to be afforded to push important matters to a. conclusion. As to the two Bills introduced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> I concur in what has; been said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> - that there seems to be no possible chance of their being pushed to a conclusion in both branches of the Legislature this session. The lack of time is entirely due to the fact that Parliament met- so late in the year, and that we have to adjourn within) three or four weeks, owing to the coming elections. I submit, however, that my motion* stands in a different category from other motions on the paper, because it is of vastly more importance to all the States. I really do not know how honorable senators propose to vote; but I should like to have an expression of opinion given upon the present system of distributing revenue and expenditure. I am aware that the question may be discussed upon the Appropriation Bill, but we shall then not be able to obtain a vote, and our time will also be very limited. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> will agree to deal with my motion as he proposes to deal with the two Bills in question, I feel certain that other honorable senators who have private business on the paper will not object to that course. Several have already, intimated to me that they are willing to forego their opportunity to have their business discussed in order that my motion may be dealt with. So far, my motion has been spoken to by four members of the Senate, including the Minister, but several other honorable senators desire to speak to it. Whatever the fate of the motion might be, I should like to have an expression of the opinion of the Senate upon it. I hope that the Minister will see his way to accept my suggestion, otherwise I shall be inclined to move that my motion be added to the private members' business, to which time will yet be given. </para>

                    <para>-- On the general aspect of the motion before the Senate, I think the Minister has made a very great mistake. The honorable senator is naturally anxious to placate his followers, and, in order to do so, he has attempted to make a distinction between a Bill and a motion submitted in the name of a private member. I repeat the question which I asked by interjection, and to which I received no answer : Are the Government in favour of the Bills introduced by Senators Pearce and Stewart? </para>

                        <para>- The motion is moved to set aside private members' business, but the Minister has amended it in order to make an exception in favour of two Bills which the Government. do not approve of. The Bill introduced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> is equivalent to a vote of want of confidence in the Government, who embodied their own ideas as to the government of Papua in a Bill passed last session, while <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart's</inline> idea is something very different. I do not believe that the Government propose to change their views on the subject because a member of the Labour Party has introduced a Bill. I think that Ministers are insincere in this proposal to allow the Bills referred to to be proceeded with. The motion which I have on the paper with regard to compulsory insurance opens up a very big question, and I am prepared to let it stand over. In one way, I think that to do so will suit me best, because I understand that next session an attempt will be made to legislate on the question of old-age pensions, and I shall then be able to move my motion with greater advantage. I remind! <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> that I have another motion on the paper, which has been partly discussed. I was prevented from obtaining" a division on a similar motion last year, and I ask the honorable senator to give me an opportunity to secure a division on the motion .this year. Some honorable senators desire to speak to it. and I should like to be given ten or fifteen minutes in which to reply, when a division could be taken. It is, I think, important that the opinion' of the Senate should be expressed on the system suggested for the military training of boys and youths, and if he had that expression of opinion the Minister of Defence would be in a better position to frame a national policy of defence. As I was unable to secure a division on a similar motion last session, I hope the leader of the Senate will be prepared to meet me in the way I have indicated. </para>

                        <para>- If the Government have made arrangements of that sort, they mav be able to cope with the difficulty ; but it is one which should be considered. It looks a very simple matter to propose to shorten the session by asking both Houses to sit from 10.30 a&gt;.m. ; but I have often found that, while that leads to a great deal more talk, it does not assist Parliament to get 'through its work any sooner. If the business is brought forward in the regular manner, and the speaking is to the point, a great deal can be done during the hours of sitting at present adopted. I am very doubtful of the wisdom of asking the Senate to sit from 10.30 a.m. on two days in the week, in addition to Friday. </para>

Since I have been a member of the Senate it has been the practice, at this stage of the session, for the Government to take as much of the time for their business as possible. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe</inline> considers that the motion which is om the paper in his name is of very much greater importance than are motions on the paper in the names of other honorable senators. I hold a different opinion. No doubt, from the stand-point of an honorable senator from Tasmania, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'</inline> Keefe' s motion is of very great importance ; but, in my opinion!, the motion in the name of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> which goes to the root of the question of taxation, is of much greater importance. Again, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson's</inline> motion with respect to old-age pensions is of very great importance. </para>

                    <para>. - I have some little difficulty in determining how I shall cast my vote, should a division on the motion be called for. I have always held that private members' business is largely a waste of time, and the sooner we abolish the present practice with regard to it the better. I have expressed that view in the Senate before, but I have still some difficulty in agreeing to the present proposal to reduce the time devoted to the consideration of private members' business, because there is one matter in the name of a private member of the Senate on which I have expressed myself somewhat strongly. If I were to vote now in such a way as to terminate the debate on that question, it might not unreasonably be said that I was helping to close the opportunity for a reply to the debate which has taken place. To that extent I am doubtful as to how I should vote on this motion. </para>

                        <para>- I should be willing to sacrifice myself in that respect. I am not in favour of unduly limiting speech, and in this matter what appeals to me is that I think opportunity should be given to those who might wish to reply to a debate which has already taken place on the business which they have submitted. We are now confronted with an entirely different position, because the Minister comes forward with a motion which does not propose either to continue or to abolish the opportunity afforded for the discussion of private members' business. The honorable senator makes a distinction which I think is entirely invidious. He proposes that we should throw overboard motions in the names of private members on the ground that they will lead to nothing. If that is to be the basis of our judgment in this matter, I should like to ask what debate will lead us to in connexion with all these matters in the names of private members? We cannot hope to get a division on the second reading of the Bills mentioned. </para>

                        <para>- If I did not say another word, there are honorable senators who, I feel convinced, would desire to deal with the important principle involved in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce's</inline> Bill. The latter measure stands as an order of the day for the 20th of this month, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> expresses the hope that he will be able to close the session at the end of the month. That, under ordinary circumstances, means the 29th, and that leaves only two other Thursdays on which to deal with private members' business. And assuming that full advantage be taken of both opportunities, J venture to say that it is beyond the bounds of possibility that any final decision can be arrived at. At any rate, the idea that the discussion can lead to anything practical must be discarded as an idle effort of the imagination. ' If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> bases his motion on the grounds of practical expediency, and he believes that the Bills can. lead to something and the motions to nothing, he ought to show what chance there is of the Bills being successfully proceeded with. </para>

                        <para>- : The honorable senator is stating the odds too mildly, because not even a miracle could give practical effect to that Bill. With regard to the other matter, I can quite understand the difficulty of the Government. No doubt it was felt that the Bill of one private member could not be selected without also including the Bill of the other private member; and that accounts for the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> is bracketted with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline></para>

                        <para>- Certainly not the honorable senator who asks the question. I am not now discussing the merits of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart's</inline> Bill ; but does any one suppose that there is the slightest chance of it passing into law ? It appears to me that the contention of the Minister that he is making this distinction on the ground that certain measures are practical and possible, while others are impracticable ana impossible, altogether falls to the ground. I think I have made it clear that all that can occur in regard to the Bills is further debate; and the same may be said in regard to the motions. As to the merits of the various proposals, we may reasonably say that the motion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe</inline> is equally important with the Bill of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> The motion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe</inline> opens up the whole financial question, which is of urgent importance to every State of the Commonwealth, as well as to the Commonwealth itself. We are shortly to be asked to deal with a Bill to amend the Constitution in its financial provisions ; and, therefore, nothing could be more important than a close examination of the financial position of the Commonwealth. Such a motion may end in debate, but so may the proposed Bill of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce;</inline> and, therefore, I see no such difference as to justify the discrimination suggested by the Government. All debate presumably has an object; and the object of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce's</inline> remarks was to direct attention to an important matter, and, as far as possible, expedite Government action. The motion in reference to defence matters is important, and all the more practical in view of the fact that the Minister has not yet unfolded his long-promised defence scheme. Am I to be told that we are wasting time in discussing the question of defence in the absence of a Ministerial scheme, any more than that we are wasting time in discussing the nationalization! of industries, in the absence of any Government pronouncement? The whole thing must stand together; there can be no practical legislation this session, but all. discussion tends to widen knowledge, and, probably, hasten our steps towards some clearly defined objective, or to enable us to determine what the objective should be. For that reason, I am unable to discriminate, as suggested by the Government ; and, therefore, I shall vote against the motion. At the same time, had the Government submitted the motion as originally framed, I should have felt inclined to support it, in order that we might not close the mouths of those who desire to reply to the speech I delivered. </para>

                        <para>- It is a great pity that Parliaments and the leaders of Parliament never seem to learn anything by experience. At the 'end of every session there is a regular rush of business. We find private members' business thrown overboard, and Government business introduced at the rate of half-a-dozen Bills at a time. No opportunity for legitimate or exhaustive discussion is given; and I take this occasion to impress on the Government, on the Opposition, and on the Labour Party the suggestion that, if this Senate is to do any useful work, our methods must be different in the future. In the first place, the Government are the responsible power, . and yet they permit the business of the Senate, during' the first month of the session, to move along in the most dawdling, fashion. When Bills are submitted, honorable senators on the Opposition side reiterate each other's arguments by the hour on the second reading, and regularly at half-past ten o'clock at night, the representative of the Government consents to an adjournment. All this is really playing into the hands of the Opposition, the members of which do not wish to see any business whatever to the credit of the Government. If the Senate is to do any useful work, we must sit earlier in the year, and sit longer. </para>

                        <para>- That is a jibe which is very often thrown at me because I do not happen to attend earlier in the session, being usually very much more profitably employed, both to myself and the country. Very shortly after the beginning of the present session the Senate adjourned for three weeks. The present arrangements are very easy for honorable senators who are able to leave for their homes every week-end ; but the case is different with senators, like myself, who reside in outlying portions of the Commonwealth, and have to remain in Melbourne until the end of the session. We cannot, like other honorable senators, rush to Sydney on the one hand, or Adelaide on the other, every week, and thus compel other honorable senators to suit our convenience. Now, at the end of the session, when it is found that there is more business that can be carried through, the Government propose to jettison a number of private members' motions, some of which I believe to be much more important than any measure introduced by the Government this session. I realize that it is impossible to discuss beneficially all those motions at this late period of the session. With regard to the Bills about which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> is so much concerned- </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator ought to know perfectly well that there is not plenty of time. There will be a general election some time in November, and if the honorable senator is not going on an electioneering campaign, other honorable senators are, and they desire to present themselves to their constituencies as early as possible. With the desire of those honor- ' able senators I sympathise ; because there are probably many things to be explained away, and honorable senators ought to have every opportunity to place themselves in a favourable light before the people. </para>

Apparently, however, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has no confidence in his own case, because, rather than submit the matter to the public, he would block the Bill. I now invite <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> to transfer the discussion of the question from Parliament to the hustings, when he will find what is the real opinion of the people of Australia. In regard to the Papua Bill, which I have been guilty of introducing, it could be decided in five minutes. In my opinion, every honorable senator knows how he is going to vote; and I have no other desire than to get a decision. I should be very glad to see the measure carried, but - - . </para>

Even, if my motion had been thrown overboard, recognising the position as it exists, I think it is very probable that I would have voted for the motion of the Minister. But I do hope that in the future the Government will call Parliament together earlier in the year, that the Senate will sit oftener and longer, and that private senators will have that opportunity to bring forward business which they ought to have. The business of the Senate ought not to be entirely a monopoly of the Committee, which we call the Government, but. every private senator ought to have as ample an opportunity as is possible to bring forward any measure which he may desire to submit. </para>

Notwithstanding that, 1 recognise that there are one or two motions which are entitled to a little consideration, and while I am not prepared to move an amendment-, I would ask the Minister to allow an opportunity for the discussion of them, especially the motion which deals with the distribution of revenue, and which I know holds a somewhat high place as a matter of importance in the minds of a number of honorable senators. </para>

                <para class="block">In view of the fact that a proposal which was intended to effect a similar object was rather fully discussed here on Friday, I do not purpose to again relate all the circumstances which have led up to the moving of this motion. Honorable senators, I believe, all realize that it is desirable that the session should close at the end of this month. And, in view of the fact that the Standing Orders necessitate a call of the Senate for the third reading of a Bill to alter the Constitution, they also recognise that it would seriously imperil the prospect of the session ending as soon as is desired if we had to comply most strictly with standing order 271, which fixes the notice for a call at not less than twenty-one days. If it would not imperil the prospect of an early termination of the session it might, on the other hand, imperil the prospect of an early appeal to the country. I am sure honorable senators will acquit me of any intention to scamp discussion when I say that I feel satisfied that the circumstances, as detailed by me on Friday last, are so fresh in their minds that they will see that their is no necessity to expend unnecessary time in discussing this matter." </para>

                        <para>- If the motion be carried, I propose to have a call of the Senate on Tuesday or Wednesday next. I think that by this time not only those who are here, but all who could possibly attend during the session, are well aware of the fact that this Bill to alter the Constitution has been dealt with in its early stages, and that its third reading must fake place before the Parliament is prorogued. I do not propose to discuss the merits of the proposed alteration, because they were dealt with very fully in connexion with the Bill. But I would point out that the object of suspending the standing order is to enable the Bill to be presented for indorsement or rejection by the electors at the forthcoming general election. </para>

                    <para>. - I shall endeavour to imitate for once the excellent example of the Minister by being as brief as I can. I have frequently voiced here a strong objection to tampering with the Standing Orders. It is necessary to consider 'for what purpose they have been adopted. They have not been adopted merely to suit any passing expediency or for any party purpose. They are, I fake it, the result of many years experience of parliamentary government. They have been adopted, not merely to secure the proper expedition of public business, but also to safeguard the rights of minorities and the interests of the electors we represent. In proportion as we suspend the Standing Orders, or, as I say, tamper with them, we undo some of those safeguards. In this particular case these general objections are intensified by the fact that the object of standing order 271 is to secure that due deliberation shall be given to measures affecting the Constitution. If there is any reason for a standing order to prevent the slipping through of an ordinary Bill, surely there must be greater reason for a standing order to prevent the rapid passage of a Bill to amend the Constitution. The difficulty with which the Government are trying to grapple is due to their own neglect. There was no reason why they should have allowed this question to stand over until this stage of the session. For reasons best known to themselves, they have done so. The question as to when the elections should take place has been in the minds of the public and the Government for months. I could, if I wished to detain the Senate, quote from speeches in which Ministers have given countenance to the suggestion when originally made. </para>

                        <para>- The business of Ministers in the Senate is to conform to the Standing Orders under which we work. Instead of that, however, they blunder along, get into difficulty, and then come forward and ask for the suspension of the Standing Orders in order to help them out of it. I protest against this practice. It is becoming rather too frequent. There is hardly a Supply' Bill that comes before the Senate as to which Ministers do not move to suspend the Standing Orders. If a particular standing order appears to stand in the way of the business they have in hand, they move for its suspension. Surely it would be simpler if they moved for the suspension of the whole of our Standing Orders, and adopted the principle that any honorable senator could come along at any time with any motion that he liked to submit. We should then know that our only safeguard was to be here at all times; there would be no rules for our guidance, and we should drift into that happy position indicated by an honorable senator as a " goasyouplease." But while that method of procedure may have its merits in the domain of sport, I have yet to learn that a system of the kind has any advantages over the system which has been adopted under the form of government that we are trying to work out, namely, parliamentary government. It may be urged that no grave danger can arise from what is proposed, because every member of the Senate will get notice of what it is proposed to do. But that is not a sufficient answer. In the first place, the Minister cannot guarantee that every senator will receive notice; 'but even if he could, what will happen with regard to the other Bills which it is proposed to introduce for the purpose of amending the Constitution? While the Government may give honorable senators notice in this instance, if we suspend with very fully in connexion with the Bill. But I would point out that the object of suspending the standing order is to enable the Bill to be presented for indorsement or rejection by the electors at the forthcoming general election. </para>

                        <para>. - I shall endeavour to imitate for once the excellent example of the Minister by being as brief as I can. I have frequently voiced here a strong objection to tampering with the Standing Orders. It is necessary to consider 'for what purpose they have been adopted. They have not been adopted merely to suit any passing expediency or for any party purpose. They are, I take it, the result of many years experience of parliamentary government. They have been adopted, not merely to secure the proper expedition of public business, but also to safeguard the rights of minorities and the interests of the electors we represent. In proportion as we suspend the Standing Orders, or, as I say, tamper with them, we undo some of those safeguards. In this particular case these general objections are intensified by the fact that the object of standing order 271 is to secure that due deliberation shall be given to measures affecting the Constitution. If there is any reason for a standing order to prevent the slipping through of an ordinary Bill, surely there must be greater reason for a standing order to prevent the rapid passage of a Bill to amend the Constitution. The difficulty with which the Government are trying to grapple is due to their own neglect. There was no reason why they should have allowed this question to stand over until this stage of the session. For reasons best known to themselves, they have done so. The question as to when the elections should take place has been in the minds of the public and the Government for months. I could, if I wished to detain the Senate, quote from speeches in which Ministers have given countenance to the suggestion when originally made. </para>

                        <para>- The business of Ministers in the Senate is to conform to the Standing Orders under which we, work. Instead of that, however, they blunder along, get into difficulty, and then come forward and ask for the suspension of the Standing Orders in order to help them out of it. I protest against this practice. It is 'becoming rather too frequent. There is hardly a Supply' Bill that comes before the Senate as to which Ministers do not move to suspend the Standing Orders. If a particular standing order appears to stand in the way of the business they have in hand, they move for its suspension. Surely it would be simpler if they moved for the suspension of the whole of our Standing Orders, and adopted 'the principle that any honorable senator could come along at any time with any motion that he liked to submit. We should then know that our only safeguard was to be here at all times; there would be no rules for our guidance, and we should drift into that happy position indicated by an honorable senator as a " goasyouplease." But while that method of procedure may have its merits in the domain of sport, I have yet to learn that a system of the kind has any advantages over the system which has been adopted under the form of government that we are trying to work out, namely, parliamentary government. Tt may be urged that no grave danger can arise from what is proposed, because every member of the Senate will get notice of what it is proposed to do. But that is not a. sufficient answer. In the first place, the Minister cannot guarantee that every senator will receive notice; but even if he could, what will happen with regard to the other Bills which it is proposed to introduce for the purpose of amending the Constitution ? While the Government may give honorable senators notice in this instance, if we suspending on this proposal. The fact that it is necessary to have the general election some time in November or early in December, and that it may be convenient to take a referendum at the same time, does not appear to me to be a sufficient ground for dispensing with the safeguards. Instead of looking at an amendment of the Constitution as being so important that it should not be attempted without the utmost deliberation, we are apparently adopting the principle that, in this early stage of the Commonwealth, when an election is coming on, we should, so to speak, send round a bellman to ask if there is any one who would like an amendment of the Constitution made. If one section says, " We should like this amendment," and another section says "We should like that," opportunities are to be given to them to test their little fads. These proposals are to be rushed through in a hurry at the close of the session, in order that the proposed amendments of the Constitution shall be voted upon by the electors at a general election. Such a method of amending the Constitution was never intended bv the framers of. it. It was never contemplated that every time an election took place, an endeavour should be made to find out the views of those who would like to see the Constitution altered, and that proposals to that effect should be rushed through in the closing days of a Parliament, when its members were tired, and both Houses were more or less demoralized. Again, it is not desirable to amend the Constitution in the way proposed, because I do not think that we shall obtain the well considered judgment of tha people when a whole group of proposed amendments are thrust upon them during a general election. There should be a period given to Parliament, and to the people, to become thoroughly seized of the probable effects of the amendments. It certainly is not desirable to thrust forward a number of proposed amendments at a time when the people are engaged in selecting members to represent them. At the last Federal elections in New South Wales, the people of the State were asked to answer a simple question with regard to the State Parliament. They were asked to decide whether the number of members should be reduced, and, if so, to what extent. I can assure honorable senators that there was a great deal of confusion in the minds of the electors. The subjects of State politics and of Federal politics were " boxed up " together in their minds, and the issues were never fairly presented to them. It is not fair to the electors to expect them to answer a number of questions at the ballot-box. I do not think that a general election is an appropriate time at which to submit to the people important questions involving amendments of the Constitution. At the forthcoming elections, if the proposals of the Government are carried out, the electors will be asked to vote upon as many as four proposed amendments of the Constitution at the same time. This is likely to lead to a great deal of confusion, and certainly will not secure the very best judgment of the people upon what is proposed. Our Standing Orders were passed expressly to provide that proper consideration should be given to proposed amendments of the Constitution. When they were passed, they were regarded always from a non-party stand-point. But, whenever a proposal to suspend standing - orders is made, it is regarded more or less from the standpoint of one party which happens to have a majority. Thereby a majority deliberately - for party purposes sometimes - suspends standing orders which were agreed to at a time when no party considerations whatever were involved in framing them. The particular standing order with which we are now concerned was solemnly adopted for the reason that when it was proposed to submit to the electors a question involving an amendment of the Constitution, ample time should be given for reflection and consideration before the Senate agreed that the proposed amendment should be submitted to the electors, and that there should also be ample time for the electors to consider the proposal. Now it is proposed to sweep aside that safeguard. There never was a time, however, when it was more necessary than on the present occasion. We are proposing to amend the Constitution for the first time. Probably in the future, whenever amendments of the Constitution are proposed, they will be amendments on far more difficult matters than the one now under consideration, and matters that have been considered for years, because we know that public opinion with regard to important questions gains strength from reflection, and afterwards comes to a focus. That has been. so in the United States, and we may assume that hereafter no amendment of the Constitution will be proposed there except as the outcome of consideration and discussion extending over years. Now we are proposing to amend our Constitution merely in deference to a cry that has been raised by a. very few persons, and in connexion with a question that is. not known and understood outside. It will be almost impossible for candidates at the coming elections, no matter what efforts they may put forth, to acquaint the electors with the exact meaning of the amendment. I, for one, do not believe that the cry for this amendment has emanated from the section of the people to whom it is attributed I do not say so disrespectfully, but I think" that it has originated with politicians who have been hard driven to account for certain results at elections. They have indicated this, that, and the other as the cause of those results. Some have said that it was because the farmers growing wheat in one particular State found it inconvenient to record their votes at a particular time of the year, and they, therefore, desired that the date for holding the elections should be altered. This request has enlisted sympathy, the proposal to alter the 'date of the elections has been taken up by the Government, and they now propose solemnly to amend the Constitution in order that the elections may be held at a different time of the year, in order to accommodate the wheat-growers in one State. If the proposed amendment is carried, and if the Constitution is altered as proposed, we shall probably find that another class in the community, quite as numerous as the wheat-growers, will find the altered date inconvenient, and politicians who may consider that they have lost some votes in consequence of the elections being held at that time, may come forward at the end of another three years with another proposal to amend the Constitution in order that the elections may take place at some other time. I say that it is all very paltry and very small. It is most unfortunate that proposals for the amendment of the Constitution should be brought forward so hastily that it should be necessary to ask the Senate to suspend the Standing Orders in order that the safeguards solemnly and" carefully provided should be removed. I shall vote against the motion. </para>

                    <para>-35!- - I should be very sorry if the motion were put without having expressed my view upon it. Much that I should like to have said has already been said by Senators Millen and Drake, but I feel constrained to urge other considerations upon the Senate. We have made provision under our Standing Orders for a call of the Senate in only one set of circumstances, and that is when a Bill is before us to amend the Constitution. It must therefore be obvious that a very important additional reason against the suspension of our Standing Orders is supplied when we are asked to suspend them 011 an occasion of this sort. It will be a poor thing if it must subsequently be admitted that when the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia first sought to amend the Constitution it began by breaking its own Standing Orders. I have very rarely agreed to the suspension of the Standing Orders in any circumstances whatever, and, as a general rule, it is a course which should be religiously avoided. In this case, we have been frankly told by Senator Keating that we are being asked to suspend this standing order because he has overlooked it. I welcome the frank admission, but I submit that the offence is not minimized because of it. It is just as bad for us to break the Standing Orders in these circumstances as it would have been to break them wittingly and knowingly. The argument really is that the standing orders relating to a call of the Senate are all right so long as no ordinary or extraordinary impediment arises against their use. That is to say, that so long as the business of the Senate can be conducted smoothly and without very much difficulty in due conformity with the Standing Orders, they have been properly drawn and should be observed, but when an occasion arises, no matter what the circumstances, when it becomes desirable or convenient that the Standing Orders should be set aside, there is no reason at all why that course should not be taken. I cannot agree with that reasoning. My view is that the Standing Orders have been carefully and properly drawn with a definite intention of providing against what is at present proposed, in order that the Senate should not be carried away by a desire to do something in an unusual way, or at any unusual time. The Standing Orders are a safeguard' of the interests of the minority. I do not wish to discuss whether the Government have a majority prepared to suspend this standing order in this instance, but it has been framed, amongst other reasons, in order to protect the interests of the minority, and I should find it extremely difficult to justify the action or any Government that would propose to suspend a standing order merely because they had a majority prepared to support them in doing so. The onus of justification for the suspension of a standing, order on this, as on every other occasion, must rest with the majority. I do not wish to deal with the intrinsic merits of the Bill, to facilitate the passing of which it is proposed to suspend standing order 271, but I direct the attention of honorable senators to what is likely to happen. First of all, I think that the motion should be condemned as it stands, but after <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford's</inline> explanation, we must recognise that this is likely to be only the first of a series of such motions. I refer to the fact that the honorable senator has given contingent notice of similar' motions for the suspension of this standing order, to enable other measures of this class to be passed during the present session. That does not make the offence in this instance any less, but if we agree to this motion now in order to allow the particular Bill to which it refers to go through, it will be idle and perhaps unjustifiable for us to oppose the suspension of. the standing order, in order to allow some other Bills, which have yet to be submitted to us, to go through. I shall oppose the motion in every succeeding instance, as I do now. The proposal, in my opinion, is absolutely wrong on its merits, quite irrespective - of the Bill proposed to be dealt with. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> very properly directed the attention of the Minister to the fact that it is questionable whether we should have a referendum at the same time as a general election. Assuming that the other Bills at which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> has hinted will also be passed, it will be necessary for the Government to prepare for the consideration of the electors a long series of necessarily complicated questions. At the coming election the electors will be asked to vote in one way for members of the House of Representatives and in another way for members of the Senate. They will be asked to express an opinion with respect to the alteration of the Constitution proposed in the Bill with which we are now dealing, and I imagine that it will be impossible to frame the question dealing with the matter in a very simple form. They will also be asked to give answers to questions affecting perhaps three or four more Bills. </para>

                        <para>- That is quite true. They will have to answer all these questions, and probably the only time they will have for consideration as to what their answer should be will be the interval between the time they enter the polling booth to vote and the time they come out of it. If the Government believe that at the coming election, in addition to their other duties, the duty should be superimposed upon candidates of explaining to the electors how they should vote on the various proposals submitted to them for the amendment of the Constitution, they will be imposing upon candidates far too great a task. If it is assumed that candidates for election will have to instruct the electors in their duties with respect to these different matters, my attitude will be that which I think will be adopted by many others - I shall decline to take the responsibility of telling the electors whether they should vote for this or that proposed amendment of the Constitution. I shall have quite as much as I can manage to induce the electors to agree with my views' on general questions. If it is unfair, as I think it is, to ask the electors to answer these questions, we should stop at this stage, and should go no further. If we are to suggest an alteration of the Constitution, and in order to bring it about we must suspend one of our standing orders, we should have some practicable end in view. In my opinion the proposed referendum will be a failure. I believe that whatever the result of the voting may be, only the votes of a ridiculously small minority of the electors will be recorded on these questions. I should at once justify the attitude of any elector who would say, " I decline at present to give an answer to these important questions. The matters they involve have been before the Commonwealth for so short a time that I have had no opportunity to investigate them, or to receive advice and instruction upon them." It is too much to ask them to come to a decision on so important a matter as an alteration of the Constitution without giving them time to ascertain the merits of the proposal, or to be instructed upon it. We are at present being asked to suspend the most important of our Standing Orders to secure an expression of opinion which, I venture to say, will be by no means decisive. With regard to the question of notice we have provided that a call of the Senate shall not take' place at a shorter interval than twenty-one days from the date of making the order for it. I am not at all sure that the period of twenty-one days was provided for merely to suit the convenience of members of the Senate. I think that it was provided for with some other object. It would be just as difficult to say that an honorable senator would be here twenty-one days hence as it would be to say that he would be here fourteen or four days hence. The period of twenty-one days was probably inserted in order that sufficient time might be given, to every honorable senator to seriously consider the question under discussion. If that be so, it is an additional reason, although we have discussed the Bill, for refusing to say that; despite the Standing Orders, honorable senators shall, within a few days, decide on a very important question. I do not think I am wrong in so interpreting the Standing Orders, though I admit there is a doubt. But if the question of convenience is the only one we have, to consider, there is not much convenience in being given three weeks' notice; and, on the other hand, if we are going to intrust to the Ministry the power to break the Standing Orders, they may. unwittingly and unintentionally, give honorable senators insufficient notice. For instance, I heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> say just now that if the motion be carried, his idea is to have a call of the Senate on Tuesday or Wednesday next. I say, again, that it is not right, in view of our Standing Orders, to allow any Ministry I am not referring to this Ministry particularly - to say that honorable senators must attend two or three .days hence. ' Without having any particular senators in my mind, I may say that next Tuesday or Wednesday may not suit all. For those reasons, and for many others - and especially because I hate the idea of surrounding the first alteration of the Constitution with such conditions - I feel impelled to vote against the suspension of the Standing Orders. It seems to me more than a pity that the reason for the alteration of the Constitution should not be a great, grave, and important one, or, at any rate, that our method of bringing about an alteration should involve such conditions. Assuming that it is most desirable to alter the date of the Senate elections, it is still deplorable that we should bring the change about by breaking the Standing Orders. If the proposed alteration of the Constitution is important, this ought to be just the occasion to jealously and carefully obey every provision that was thoughtfully made, not only bv the framers of our Standing Orders, but by the framers of the Constitution. I doubt the merits of the Bill, and I allude again to the fact that on this, the first, occasion on which we have to provide for a call of the Senate in connexion with a proposal to amend the Constitution, we are asked to break the Standing Orders. For the reasons I have given I must oppose the motion. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not propose to occupy the time of the Senate many minutes. The proposal of the Government is objected to on the ground that if is one to 'break the Standing Orders which have been instituted as a safeguard. But this is not a proposal to break the Standing Orders ; it is a proposal to suspend a standing order. I think it is reasonable to assume that the power to suspend any of the Standing Orders - the power contained in the Standing Orders themselves - is also a safeguard. I take it that this power would not be there if it were not, as has been frequently discovered, that the Standing Orders, which are excellent in themselves, might sometimes render it impossible for Parliament, after sufficient deliberation. to give effect to its will. Therefore this provision has been made in order to meet such a contingency. I can quite understand that this particular standing order was instituted because it was recognised that a number of members of the Senate might be at a considerable distance from the Senate, and that it would be impossible to make a call unless some considerable period were provided. But I understand it <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> competent - our present knowledge assures us that it is competent - to make a call of the Senate completely effective so far as giving everybody notice within the time required is concerned. It has been contended that the Government are to blame - that they have been remiss in not being aware of the existence of this standing order. I take the liberty to urge that there is a great deal of excuse for the Government having overlooked the standing order, which is unusual, so far as I have any knowledge. It is not a standing order of any' State Parliament that I know of; and j, and most other members of the Commonwealth Parliament, have obtained the greater part of our experience and knowledge from the Standing Orders of the States Parliaments. I am not aware that there is such a standing order in the House of Commons; but, in my opinion, it is altogether a novel, but very wise provision in connexion with an alteration of our Constitution. It does not, however, follow that because it is wise that the standing order should be there, certain contingencies may not arise under which, it may be desirable to suspend it. I respectfully submit that the present is such a contingency, when, without injun', the standing order may be suspended so as to enable Parliament to give expression to its will. I speak of Parliament, of course, as represented -by the Senate, because, so far as the Senate is concerned, the Bill has been declared a desirable one to be submitted to the people. It is possible, in conformity with the proposed amendment, to give honorable senators notice that they will be expected to be here to vote on the third reading, and thereby give the measure the constitutional force it requires. I intend to vote for the suspension of the standing order. It has been urged by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> that we are frivolously, and with too little consideration, proposing to alter the Constitution. Parliament, of course, might without sufficient consideration propose to alter the Constitution ; but there are safeguards against any injudicious or ill-considered alteration, inasmuch as there must be approval by an absolute majority. There are, however, other and greater safeguards outside Parliament. It is provided that amy alteration of the Constitution must be carried by a majority of the people, and by a majority of the States ; so that there is no danger whatever of any frivolous or ill-considered amendment. I have no hesitation in saying that the framers of our Constitution took pains to facilitate an amendment to a greater degree than was taken in the case of the American Constitution - and they took pains because of the difficulties which have arisen in the case of the American Constitution. While I agree with all that has been said about the necessity of amending the Constitution only with care, and after thought and deliberation, I venture to say that its framers foresaw - indeed, all sensible men did - that we could only know in the working of the Constitution, from time to time, how best to adapt it to our requirements. We have learned from experience that it is desirable to hold the elections at a more convenient time, and, in order to achieve that, it is necessary to alter the Constitution. If it is an alteration which would give greater convenience to the electors. I do not agree with those who hold the view that it should not be made because it is only a slight alteration. </para>

                    <para>.- If I, by any means, am induced to vote for the proposal it certainly will be under protest. I feel that the principle involved in the proposal is bad, and that its adoption would be warranted only by extraordinary exigencies. I am disposed to take the view that the period of twenty-one days was provided in order to afford time for reflection and deliberation, and not merely for the purpose of securing an absolute majority. It is quite true that the Constitution itself provides for many safeguards. But the Senate, in the framing of our Standing Orders, thought it was desirable, in so serious a matter as that of the alteration of the Constitution, to insert a special provision in order that nobody might be taken by surprise. But the difficulty I am placed in is that I believe the Bill to be a desirable one, while, on the other hand, we are assured by the Government that the desirable object cannot be achieved under present circumstances, because it will be impossible to keep Parliament together after the 30th of this month. </para>

                        <para>- I have urged that there was a double object in view. The first was I believe to secure reflection and deliberation, and the second to secure a majority. The question is whether that reflection and deliberation can be secured within seven, days, and also whether a majority, can be secured. The fact that a majority can be secured does weigh with me. If any honorable senators were in Western Australia, I should be very much disposed to hesitate, and warn the Government against the course which they are taking. But the fact remains that all honorable senators, except one, can be in attendance to give a thoughtful consideration to the measure. That is a very important aspect of the matter, and certainly does tend to sway me. </para>

There is an amendment of the Constitution in which I feel keenly interested, and- in which the whole community takes a very great interest, and that is one to enable a transfer of the States debts to be made to the Commonwealth. I am prepared to go a long way in order to secure that object. If I were to vote in accordance with my instincts against the measure before the Senate, it might be urged against me that I would not be justified in sanctioning a departure in the case of the other measure. In these circumstances. I feel myself placed on the horns of a dilemma. I solemnly protest against the extraordinary course which is being taken. But in view of the fact that the measure to which I have just referred is of .such urgent importance that I would vote for a suspension of the standing order in that case, I have to submit gracefully to what I know to be wrong on the present occasion. </para>

                    <para>. - I voted in favour of the Bill in respect of which a call of the Senate is required ; but I do not see how I can vote for the motion. The arguments of honorable senators on&gt; this side have convinced me that the first time we are asked to amend the Constitution is a verv important occasion indeed. It appears to me that we shall have at least "three such Bills to deal with, and that in respect of each Bill a similar step will need to be taken. If there is any measure in respect of which we should not agree to suspend the Standing Orders it is one to alter the Constitution. I had the honour of being one of the framers of the Constitution in a humble way, and I do not wish it to go down to posterity that, when it was proposed to amend the Constitution in three particulars, I voted to suspend the Standing Orders, and wipe away the safeguards which its framers had laid down. </para>

                        <para>- The Senate framed these safeguards, and now it is asked to wipe them away. Frequently honorable senators object to suspend the Standing Orders to facilitate the passage of most ordinary measures, for instance, to enable the report on an amended Bill to be adopted or the third reading of a Bill to be taken at once. In my opinion the Senate would do well to lay it down as a rule that the Standing Orders shall not be suspended in the case of a Bill to amend the Constitution. If during this session we suspend the Standing Orders in order to pass three Bills to amend the Constitution, that precedent will be quoted for centuries to come as indicating the proper procedure in amending the Constitution. </para>

                        <para>- The legislators of the Commonwealth would have the precedent thrown in their teeth for all time to come. I would rather have my name associated with those who objected to a suspension of the Standing Orders for that purpose. It has been said, I believe with a very great deal of truth, that not one-half of the men who will go to the poll will understand the questions on which they are asked to vote. In support of that view, I may mention that I was discussing politics with some friends on Sunday night. One of the most active officers of the Women's National League, who for eighteen months has worked harder than any other woman in Melbourne to get persons enrolled, who has told her fellow women that they would have to vote, and take an interest in politics, and who probably knows more about politics than ninety-nine out of a hundred of her sex, said To me, " <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dobson,</inline> I shall not vote." I asked, " What is the matter?" She replied, "I have a smattering of politics. I know something of the Constitution but what do I know about these several amendments of the Constitution 7" Apart from that illustration, commonsense tells us that, in the attempt to get into the heads of persons half-a-dozen complicated subjects, as well as the policies of the Ins and the Outs, and the important question of whom they are to vote for, the utmost confusion will prevail. It will require thought, time, the help of the press, and an infinite amount of pains to make the ordinary man in the street understand the questions on which he will have to vote, and what 'the proposed amendments of the Constitution mean. We all recognise that an amendment of the Constitution to enable all the debts of the States to be taken over by the Commonwealth, is a very important matter. But it is more important that we should take care not to create a precedent which would be quoted against us for centuries to come. This question is of so serious a nature that I ventured to call attention to the state of the Senate just now. But, apparently, honorable senators do not seem to take much interest in the discussion. They appear to take it for granted that the Constitution is to be amended, and pay no heed to the Standing Orders, which were framed to prevent the Constitution from being altered with undue haste. No future proposal to amend the Constitution could surpass in importance the three alterations which are now suggested. I believe that to agree to this motion would be to establish a precedent from which the Parliament of the Commonwealth would not hereafter be able to escape. </para>

                    <para>. - I have listened with considerable interest to the criticism which has been levelled at the motion. It seems to me that some honorable senators, notwithstanding their asservations to the contrary, are quite prepared almost to place the Standing Orders of the Senate on exactly the same plane as the provisions of the Constitution. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> has evidently mixed up the two things in his mind because, in his opening remarks, he could not help referring to the standing orders relating to a call of the Senate as checks imposed upon an amendment of the Constitution by its framers. I take an entirely different view from that which has been offered by certain honorable senators as to the twenty-one days' notice of a call. I cannot think that it was required in order, as is said, to give to honorable senators an opportunity for reflection and deliberation before they agreed to the third reading of a Bill to amend the Constitution. I would draw their attention to the fact that the standing order which necessitates a call of the Senate to be made prior to the third reading of such a Bill is No. 233, which is isolated, so to speak, among our 435 Standing Orders, and included in the chapter headed "Public Bills." Later on we come to chapter xx. - Committees of the Whole Senate - which embraces standing orders 247 to 270. Chapter xxi. - Call of the Senate - embraces standing orders 271 to 276 inclusive. They deal with the procedure in relation to a call of the Senate - not necessarily relating solely to a call in connexion with a Bill of this character. Standing order 271 provides that- </para>

                    has pointed out that so far as he is aware, there is no provision in the Standing Orders for a call of the Senate being obligatory, other than that in standing order 233 in connexion with a Bill of this character. But it is quite possible for a call of the Senate to be made for any purpose that the Senate might deem desirable. Standing orders 271 to 276 make provision for any call of the Senate which the Senate may deem it desirable to order. When it was provided in standing order 233 that there should be a call in connexion with a Bill to amend the Constitution, it was not provided specifically what period should be fixed. As I said just now, I differ from the opinion expressed by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline>
                    that the object of the period fixed in standing order 271 - twenty-one days - is to give time for deliberation. In my opinion, the object is to insure the consideration of a Bill of this character on its third reading - its crucial stage - by such a number of senators that its adoption or rejection will be carried by an absolute majority of the Senate.

                        <para>- I submit that the underlying principle of this standing order is to secure that the absolute majority shall have an opportunity to vote one way or the other. Another point that has been discussed at some length by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake, Senator Clemons,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline> is whether a general election affords the most convenient time for taking a referendum in reference to an alteration of the Constitution. I was asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> to address myself to this point. I reply that the holding of a referendum at an election time must necessarily be attended by a great many conveniences. The Government, at any rate, is of opinion that the advantages far outweigh any disadvantages. In the first place, iT the referendum takes place at the same time as the House of Representatives and 'half the members of the Senate -have to be elected, you have two distinct forces operating in one direction, inducing a large number of electors to go to the poll. Again, you give to the electors the opportunity to get into direct communication with the candidates, many of whom would be ex-members of Parliament, and to ascertain from them the nature and scope of the amendment upon which they are asked to vote. But there is another very considerable convenience, and that is the question of economy. As I. pointed out some days ago in connexion with another matter, a Commonwealth general election involves an expenditure of, roughly, .£40,000. That expenditure would be incurred if the election were for the House of Representatives only, or if it were for the House of Representatives and half the Senate. </para>

In this case such an accident has occurred as might happen to any one. Whether I sat on this side of the Chamber or on the other, I should always recognise that such accidents might occur. This is our first experience of the kind, and it is not unreasonable to expect that a standing order of this character should escape observation. The standing order in question deals in general terms with any call of the Senate, whether for this or any other purpose. The Standing Orders themselves provide that the Senate mav order their suspension in any emergency, and we are not to pick out one particular standing order and invest it with' such sanctity as to say that we will not on any occasion suspend it. </para>

My honorable friend should give notice of such a standing order, which could be considered by the Standing Orders Committee. But that is not a matter to be discussed now. Honorable senators will realize that if the motion is carried, we shall conserve in a general way the object intended by the standing order, which was meant to apply not particularly to Bills of this character, but to any purpose for which the Senate might direct a call. </para>

                <para>The next standing order provides that the call shall be the first order of the day, and the next for calling over the names. Then there is a provision for honorable senators who are not present when the names are called over, but subsequently attend, and then a provision for senators who do not attend on the day fixed for the call. I mention this matter at this stage because I understand that in one of the States' Parliaments there has been some provision for making calls of this character. I was not aware of the fact until this afternoon, and I do not know what particular procedure is followed in the Parliament referred to. I submit that the motion I have moved is strictly in conformity with the standing order, but if honorable senators think it desirable that there should be some specific reference to this particular Bill, either in connexion with the motion, with the notice of the call, or with both, I shall be very glad, if possible, to meet their wishes. This is the first time we have adopted any procedure under these standing orders, and I should like to have the assistance of honorable senators in dealing with the matter, in order that we may lay down a course of procedure in connexion with calls which will be applicable to any circumstances that might arise. </para>

                        <para>- I may say, in reference to these calls, that I have had no previous experience in the matter. But there was a call made of the House of Assembly in South Australia a very long time ago. and there they have similar Standing Orders to ours. Most Parliaments make provision that any alteration of the Constitution must be approved by an absolute majority. There was, as I say, at one time a call of the House of Assembly in South Australia, and it was made simply a call df the House, and not for any particular purpose. On the date fixed the names of honorable members were called over, and they voted or not as they thought fit. </para>

                        <para>- Whilst the narrower reading I suggest might have much to support it, many difficulties might arise if it were decided that a call could be made at any stage of a measure, such as the first reading, or when it first comes before the Senate. I submit that if you rule the present motion in order, it will necessarily follow that it will be in order to make a call of the Senate at any stage of the passage of a Bill. If you decide to give to the words, " Before the third reading of any Bill." the narrower construction I have indicated, it will mean that the time must be a time when every other step has been completed, and the next to be taken is the third reading of the measure. Unless you rule in that way, it will be open to the widest application of the general words of the standing order. I am not raising any factious opposition to the motion, but I am submitting considerations as to the precedent it will create. </para>

I join with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> in recognising the fact that we are dealing with new procedure, and that the ruling which you, .sir, will give will be for our guidance in the future. For that reason, and for no other, I submit that it would have been better if the motion had stated that the call of the Senate on Wednesday, 19th September, would be for the purpose of the third reading of the Constitution Alteration (Senate Elections) Bill. I submit, also, that it would be better, in giving the notice of the call, to state the object of the call. </para>

                <para class="block">These two directions form part of the one standing order, and it seems to me, reading them together, that the clear intention is that the call shall take place immediately prior to the third reading, and that then, if, as a result, a certain majority is not obtained, the standing order tells us what will happen. If the call could take place at any time it would not be necessary to have the latter portion of the standing order. Further, let me point out, that if the call is not to take place immediately between the adoption of the report and the third reading, it will be possible, on the motion which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> is now submitting, to make the call apply to Bills not before the Senate, but which are now before another branch of the Legislature. Supposing that such other Bills reached this Chamber in the meantime, we should know nothing of them ; and when they reached the report stage, the Minister might point out that there was a call of the Senate for the 19th, and that that call was equally applicable to those Bills as to the specific Bill in connexion with which the call was originally moved. For those reasons I submit that the standing order clearly intends that the call shall take place between the stage of the report and the third reading. </para>

                        <para>- I shall point out the difficulty of that suggestion directly. If the notice is simply to insure the largest possible attendance, I think the word " before " could reasonably be read to mean at any time when the Government, or those responsible for moving for a call, could see their way to fix a particular date for the third reading of the measure. Of course, the Government would not move for an order of this character if they had not some reasonable certainty of bringing on the third reading on the date of the call. In reference to the interpretation suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> that " before " is to be taker to mean the stage immediately before the third reading - that is after the adoption of the. report - I point out that there is some difficulty. For a little time in connexion -with, this Bill  1  thought that perhaps, the course suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> would have been the proper <inline font-style="italic">nr-e</inline> to follow. But I recognised on the particular occasion when I refrained from moving the adoption of the report to which I have just referred, that if the report were adopted then and there, I should, according to the usual practice of the Senate, be called upon to name a date for the third reading. If I had named, say, the 28th or 29th September, and had afterwards to take action such as I have taken this afternoon to shorten the period of the call, I might have found myself somewhat in a difficulty. I could have set the third reading down for the next day, or some day during the week, but there would have been the difficulty that I should have been putting the third reading of the Bill on the notice-paper for a day when it could not be brought on in conformity with the Standing Orders. I should have been, practically, so far as the notice-paper was concerned, setting forth that the third reading would take place, say, on the 12th, when as a matter of fact, it could not have been taken until some other day. Had I adopted that course, I should have had to take action calculated, possibly, to mislead some honorable senators. Supposing we had adopted the report on Thursday or Friday last trie President would naturally have asked me to fix a day for the third reading. I know I could have set down the third reading for to-day, and. awaited the result of my motion for the call and for the suspension of the standing order. I should then have had to alter the date to, say, the 19th September. If, on the other hand, we had adhered rigidly to the standing order, and have fixed the 28th, I do not know what procedure I should have had to follow in order to bring on the third reading earlier. That is one of the strong reasons which influenced me in coming to the conclusion that " before " was not to be read as meaning immediately before the third reading, because, if that were the interpretation, the procedure would be very embarrassing. In other words, whether we carried out the Standing Orders in their entirety, or the Standing Orders as suspended, there would have to be a day fixed for the call before we could safely fix a day for the third reading. I use the word " safely " in the sense that honorable senators otherwise might be misled. I think that, having fixed the date by a motion of this character for a call, it is competent for us to set down the third reading for a particular day. That course would be more in consonance with our practice, and if you, sir, are of that opinion, you will, I submit, rule that the word " before " could not be very conveniently read as meaning immediately before the third reading, after the report stage. </para>

                        <para>- No.: in an ordinary case there would be no more difficulty in fixing a date for the third reading than there would be in regard to a motion for a call. The Minister is evidently afraid that, if he had fixed the third reading far ahead, say, on the 28th, and asked the Senate to suspend the standing order so as to make a call on an earlier date, he would have lost control over the third reading so far as an earlier date is concerned. A Minister can suggest a subsequent date, because the Bill would, on the day fixed, be called upon. </para>

                        <para>- The third reading is fixed by motion which may be defeated, just as the motion for the date of the call may be. There are two motions, and they ought to fix the same date, and the Minister is surely wrong when he anticipates more difficulty in one case than the other. Standing order 206 states the stage at which a date may be fixed for the third reading, and I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> is right in his contention. Standing order 233 shows clearly that the call is to' be fixed for a date already fixed for the third reading ; and both dates must be determined by motion. </para>

                        <para>- I feel a great deal of difficulty in coming to a conclusion as to what is the correct interpretation of the standing order in reference to the point raised. I am afraid that I shall have to give to it an arbitrary meaning, to the best of my ability. First of all, speaking generally, it is quite clear that a call must be not earlier than twenty-one days from the date on which the order for the call is made. That refers to all calls, because we may have calls, not only for the particular class of Bill under discussion, but for other Bills. So far as I can gather from standing order 233, it is clear that the third reading of the Bill must be put down for the date of the call. The standing order does not say so, but that is clearly what is meant. </para>

The only question which, as it seems to me, remains is - ought we to first fix the day for the third reading, or first fix the day of the call, and trust the Senate to make the dates coincide ? </para>

                        <para>- There must be a limit, but there is no particular time fixed. Twenty-one days' notice is not necessary. I think that the proper course to adopt is first to fix the date for the call, and then to put down the third reading of the Bill for that date. I arrive at that conclusion because of standing order 206. If we do not adopt that procedure, then the honorable senator in charge of the (Bill will not know the date for which to set down its third reading. </para>

                        <para>- What I have been trying to make clear to the Senate is that, at some time before the third reading of the Bill, an order has to be made for a call, and whether the call should be ordered before the date fixed for the third reading, or whether the date for the third reading should be first fixed, and then a date for a call should be named, is the question I have to decide. I think that the order for the call ought to be made first, because, otherwise, the Minister or private senator in charge of the Bill would not know for what date to set down the third reading. The whole question is at large, and I am only stating what I consider to be the real meaning of these standing orders. After all, if the order for the third reading of a Bill, and the order for a call coincide, it does not .matter much which order is made first. </para>

                        <para>- You have told the Senate that you have only discovered two cases where the provision for a call has been put into operation. I think you will admit that that is not a very wide area from which to gather the material to form a decision which in its turn might be held to bind the Senate in the future. I would ask honorable senators, who, on occasion, are easily disposed to disregard what has been done in the past, to balance those two cases against the obvious advantage of adopting the amendment. I can conceive of no objection to stating in the notice to honorable senators the particular reason why their presence is 'so urgently required that the Senate has deemed it necessary to put standing order 233 in motion. In the case of all organizations - social, sporting, political, and otherwise - of which I have any knowledge, it is the practice, when notice of a meeting is sent out, to state the business for which the attendance is required. The only argument, if it can be so termed, which is advanced against my view is that drawn from the fact that on two previous occasions no business was set out in the notice of the call. I' ask. honorable senators to allow the commonsense view of the matter to prevail and to agree to the amendment. I ask the Minister, unless there is a reason which. I cannot detect, to agree to the amendment, because there appears to be no objection to telling honorable senators why their presence is wanted. On the other hand, there must be a distinct advantage in informing honorable senators of the particular business which the Senate has deemed so urgent as to justify it in ordering a call of its members. </para>

                <para class="block">The motion now before the Senate has been moved in its amended form because of that resolution, which indicated the clear reason that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> had in moving for a call of the Senate. Surely in giving notice of the call it is desirable to state the specific reason why it has been ordered, and as the remaining stage of the Bill will be its third reading, I can imagine no phraseology more suitable to be used in the notice of the call than that which I have just quoted. It would be in conformity with that which governs the proceedings of other bodies. When, for instance, an extraordinary meeting of a company has to be called to consider a question, it is the invariable rule to specify that question in the notice, but a general meeting may be called in ordinary terms. </para>

                    <para>. - So far as giving notice to honorable senators, I see no objection ; iri fact, it seems to .me that in that respect the Standing Orders are defective. I drew the motion in its present form, believing that it was in conformity with them. I was not then aware of the two precedents which have been cited. But it would seem that if, in South Australia and "Victoria, the Standing Orders are anything like ours, the motion conforms to the usual practice. I could not see anything in our Standing Orders which would enable the Senate to make a call for a specific purpose. </para>

When we call them for a specific purpose, that implies that they would not attend except for that purpose, or that they would attend in obedience to the call, and, having fulfilled the particular purpose of it, might then absent themselves. </para>

But make the call a general one for attendance on a particular day, anti no point can hereafter be raised that having been called for that purpose, and their functions being discharged, they are relieved from attendance. The acknowledged authority on parliamentary procedure whom I have quoted - Nowell - says that no call of the House of Commons has been enforced since 1836. I presume that, before he committed himself to the earlier statement as to the form of a call, he gave consideration, not only to colonial, but to British precedents. </para>

                    <para>.- Since the Committee dealt with this Bill, a motion has been carried by the Senate practically fixing the day for the third reading. I suppose that the Government is. sure of its majority, and that it will see that the third reading is carried. But it is just as well that I should point out what may occur. A call of the Senate has been ordered for the consideration of the third reading of the Bill, though that purpose was not stated in the motion. Wednesday, the 19th September, has been absolutely fixed for the third reading. But, although that has been done, the responsibility of fixing a date for the third reading of the Bill rests entirely with the Senate. There is nothing to prevent the Senate fixing some other day. </para>

                            is endeavouring to find out, as I understand, what will happen if the Bill is recommitted, and if the recommittal occupies so much time that the third reading cannot be taken on the 19th September.

                        <para>- As soon as the report is adopted the Minister will move to fix a day for the third reading. The fixing of that day is entirely in the hands of the Senate. ' The Senate may desire that the Bill shall be recommitted for the purpose of considering further amendments. If that be done, the third reading may not be reached bv the 19th September. There is nothing to prevent the Senate fixing some other day for the third reading. I point this out to show the inconvenience that results from the course of action that has been taken. </para>

                        <para>- The chief reason why I think that it is undesirable that this Bill should be placed on the statute-book of the Commonwealth is that, under its provisions, and in consequence of them, it would be possible, if an election took place at the time contemplated by the Bill, namely, some time in March or April, that senators who might have been rejected would be taking their place in this Chamber and assisting to pass legislation. I may be met by the statement that that is quite possible - under the Constitution as it now stands. Whilst it is technically possible, the practice that at present prevails, and which is likely to continue, renders it highly improbable. At present the elections take place some time in November. It seems to me quite outside the range of probability that the new Parliament would be called together prior to the 1st of January. The Christmas holidays would intervene, and unless some national crisis were to arise, there would be no necessity for calling Parliament together before the 1st of January, by which time the newly-elected senators would be entitled to take their seats. Under this Bill the elections would take place in March or April, and, as the financial year commences on the 1st July, it seems to me not only possible, but almost a foregone conclusion, that the new Parliament will be called together some time in June. If that were so, honorable senators who had been rejected at the elections would be entitled to come here and take part in the work of legislation. In the alternative, they might absent themselves on the ground that, coming from far distant States, the short time during which they would be entitled to attend would hardly warrant them in making the journey, and in that event their States would be left with a diminished representation. To my mind, either of these alternatives is highly objectionable. To make this Bill provide for a useful alteration of the Constitution, provision should have been made to reduce the extended term proposed for senators elected in 1903, and those to be elected at the forthcoming elections. Their term of office should be fixed to begin, not on the 1st of July, but at some earlier date. For instance, the extended term, instead of being six months, might be four or five months, and the senatorial term of office should be fixed to commence on the 1st of June, or in the middle of May. That would prevent, or reduce <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> a minimum, the possibility of the difficulty to which I have referred arising. For these reasons, whilst I admit that the Bill offers some advantage, inasmuch as it provides for the elections taking place at a more convenient time of the year, I consider that the disadvantage I have pointed out outweighs the advantage. Even at this late stage, I suggest that the Government should consider whether if is not possible to recommit the Bill, in order that it may be <inline font-style="italic">so</inline> altered as to fix the commencement of a senator's term of office on the 1st of June, or earlier, instead of the 1st of July, and to correspondingly shorten the extension of the term proposed. </para>

                    <para class="block">This is a Bill of some fifteen clauses, intended to amend the existing Audit Act. Honorable senators will remember that the existing Act was passed in 1901, the first year of this Parliament, and in the first session. Its object was to make provision for the auditing of the public accounts of the Commonwealth. At the time the Parliament and the Government of the day gave consideration to the question of making proper legislative provision for the auditing of our accounts we had not very long taken over the different Departments of the States which were transferred to the Commonwealth by the operation of the Constitution. It was only natural to expect to find in connexion with the working of the public accounts of those several Departments the same variety of practice and method in the different States that characterized their practice and method in dealing otherwise with those Departments. As time has since shown, the provisions then made by Parliament were not as complete as the occasion required. It is only after some four or five years' experience of the operation of the existing Act that its defects and imperfections have been revealed. In some of the States it has been customary in connexion with certain accounts to proceed in a w.ay apparently absolutely unknown in the corresponding Departments in other States. For the sake of convenience, as well as for other reasons, which will naturally, suggest themselves to honorable senators, it was found necessary in many instances to continue for a time, at any rate, the particular practice or method of a particular State. It has since been found that, although there might be no legislative warrant' for the existence or continuance of such a particular .practice or method, it has commended itself to those who have had the charge of overlooking the public accounts. It has also been found that the provisions made in our law were probably based on the experience of the smaller areas which had to be dealt with by the several States, and were not equally applicable to the larger territorial dimensions of the Commonwealth. It is to overcome some of the difficulties which have arisen as a consequence of our want of regard to that aspect of the altered conditions that we have had to submit amended provisions in this Bill. The measure does not make any radical alteration in the existing practice. It is one which will to some extent give legislative sanction to the practice and procedure at present adopted and followed for some time past, but which might reasonably, on a strict interpretation of the law, be held to rest upon no real legislative foundation. I may perhaps briefly refer to the provisions of the Bill in so far as it amends the existing law. It has been found that in connexion with some of the States' accounts there were in existence a number of trust accounts. They have been maintained and continued, subsequently to the passing of our Audit Art, for reasons of convenience, and other reasons to which I have already referred. It was, however, discovered that it is doubtful whether there is any legislative authority for the continuance of these trust accounts. The Treasurer of the day, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner, anticipated legislative sanction being given to the maintenance of these accounts, and it is now proposed in this Bill to indorse the action in the past in maintaining them. </para>

                            <para>- It is, and I mention it now because it is dealt with in the earlier portion of the Bill. These trust accounts were legacies passed on from certain of the States to the Commonwealth. They have been found to provide a convenient method of keeping certain public accounts. By this Bill it is desired, not only to sanction their maintenance heretofore, but their continuance in the future. Although there has been no legislative authority for their maintenance under the Commonwealth, we have impliedly recognised them in our dealing with public moneys in connexion with certain items that appear annually on the Estimates submitted to and passed by Parliament. We provide also in this Bill for a definition of "guarantee fund." </para>

                            <para>-No, clause 2 deals with the application of the Bill to past transactions. Clause 3 deals with what is more or less a verbal amendment in providing for the alteration of the designation of a particular officer. Certain persons, instead of being called " public accountants," are to be called " accounting officers." The reason for that is that the term " public accountant " has received what might be described as a technical signification. I understand that the Incorporated Institute of Accountants recognises the term " public accountant " as carrying with it certain qualifications. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. As the term is used in our existing Audit Act, a junior or very subordinate clerk might be termed a " public accountant," and it is deemed advisable to recognise the ordinary signification of the term, . and to give our officers a more appropriate title. We provide in clause 4 that the definition of " guarantee fund " shall be added to the definitions under the existing Act. As honorable senators are aware, we made provision in the Public Service Act for officers of the Commonwealth to be under a guarantee. The provisions of the Act do not extend to every officer of the Commonwealth. There are officers outside the Act, such as officers of the Defence Department, and we desire to extend the principle of the Public Service Act with respect to the guarantee fund to all our officers. </para>

                            <para>- We are extending . the principle to all officers. There is really no underlying principle which should separate our officers in this regard into two classes. Subsequently, , the Bill makes provision to enable the accounts of the Commonwealth to be operated upon in a less rigid manner than at present. Money order accounts, for instance, . may, under the Bill, be dealt with directly, and by this means, we enable moneys, which belong to those accounts, . to be used directly for salaries and such purposes, without the necessity of forwarding the sums to head-quarters from every little centre. By making provision of that character, we shall save much time, and a considerable amount in exchange; and there will be no risk or danger, because there will be periodical adjustments with head-quarters. Then we make provision for the payment of accounts before accounts are certified. It has been found in actual experience that the necessity for waiting in every instance for a certificate before payment, results in a good deal of delay and hardship to persons interested. In reference to the militia particularly, the Bill enables the men to be paid, as honorable senators will see from clause 7 after the close of a financial year, for services which may have been rendered before the close of that year, the money to be charged to the Appropriation for that year. At present, it may happen that, although there are moneys in hand at the end of the year, these moneys have to be sent to head-quarters, and considerable time elapses, and much of what honorable senators call " red-tapeism " has to be gone through before the money is made available for payment to the men. Honorable senators will see that very important provisions are made in regard to the Treasurer's Advance. These provisions are to enable money voted by Parliament for the Treasurer's Advance to be operated upon with greater advantage and convenience. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake.</inline> - The Bill goes further than that, I think. </para>

                            <para>- The provisions will enable the Treasurer's Advance to be kept intact by crediting to the Advance repayments that may be made on account of expenditure for which it has been made temporarily responsible. We find, in actual experience, that sometimes money has to be paid by the Commonwealth on behalf, it may be, of some other authority. For instance, a payment may have to be made on account of the Imperial Government. A sum of , £200,000 may be voted for the Treasurer's Advance Account, and it may be necessary to temporarily pay £10,000 or £12,000 on behalf of the Imperial Government. Under the present procedure, that money, when paid back, is put into revenue, and of course, fictitiously swells the revenue to that amount, while at the same time it depletes the Treasurer's Advance Account. Under the Bill, money so paid back will be credited to the Treasurer's Advance, which will thus be kept intact, and, of course, the money will be available for use in a similar way, a second, and, perhaps, a third time. Then such payments may be made on behalf of authorities other than the Imperial Government; and that is what I meant when I said that the Bill will enable the advance to be operated with a great deal more advantage and convenience than at present. </para>

                            <para>- As I say, the Treasurer's Advance might be practically exhausted, although much may have been repaid during the currency of the financial year. The object of the provision in this respect is to enable such repayments to be paid to the credit of the Treasurer's Advance, and' so, to some extent, help to keep that advance intact. The provision will enable us at once, without going through a series of operations, to debit to a particular head expenditure which primarily falls on the Treasurer's Advance. Under existing circumstances, there is a considerable amount of rigidity in connexion with the payment, and charging of salaries of officers who may be loaned by one branch of the Public Service to another; and it is sought to overcome that difficulty by enabling, in proposed new section 36B, the money to be available in any branch, the salaries of which are provided in the same sub-division. At present there is much difficulty in connexion with this matter. When an officer is transferred from one branch to another, it may be for only one month or three months, the Auditor-General, in accordance with the law, requires an alteration to be made in the Supplementary Estimates setting out the provision for the salary of that officer. All this would lead one to suppose that the Estimates were being swollen, whereas, in fact, the amounts are not Supplementary Estimates, but what might properly be called Substituted Estimates. Cases in which the salary of an officer is charged in a particular subdivision, in respect to the office which he is temporarily filling, are also provided for, the Bill enabling the salary to be paid without going through the formality to which I have referred. Somewhat similar provision is made with regard to credits which may be taken in reduction of expenditure in a subsequent year. This is set forth in the proposed new section 36c, and the object is to prevent a similar apparent increase - what I might call a fictitious increase in the expenditure. One of the best illustrations of this is found when one Department pays another for services rendered. The Department of External Affairs, for instance, might have to pay the Customs Department certain sums for immigration supervision. If a steamer were leaving Victoria for Tasmania or New Zealand; and poundage had to be paid on mail matter carried, Victoria would pav the whole, but would debit the other States with their proportion, as ascertained by the actual mail matter carried for each State. </para>

                            <para>- I am simply using the States names as an illustration, because, as a matter of fact, it is the Commonwealth which makes the adjustment. But Victoria, as a State, would be entitled under such circumstances to be paid a certain amount by the other States. At present, if such an amount were received after the close of the year, it would be credited to the revenue for that year in the particular State Obviously that is misleading, because the revenue is thereby fictitiously increased. The proper procedure would be not to credit to the revenue for that year of the receiving States, but to credit it to the vote for the current year. Other, provisions of the Bill deal with matters more closely related to the methods and systems of auditing. For instance, honorable senators will find an extension of time for making surcharges, the Bill extending that time from three months to six months. There are other provisions, the object of which is to give some little elasticity to the existing rule of periodically auditing and inspecting accounts. At present there has to be an annual auditing of accounts; and practice has shown that in some parts of the Commonwealth the moneys in hand are so small as to be utterly disproportionate to the cost of the audit. Of course, it is not desirable to make any loose provision that in certain cases an annual audit shall not be necessary. It is desirable in every instance that moneys, no matter how small the amount, shall be subject to the review of the Auditor-General. But without making any hard-and-fast rule that in every instance there shall be an audit at least once every year, the Bill, in the extraordinary case's to which I have referred, provides that the audit shall be at such intervals as may be sanctioned bv the Treasurer, with a proviso - and this is verv important - that a list of all such cases shall be published in the Auditor-General's report each year. </para>

                            <para>- I am not in a position to say at the present moment, but I shall make inquiry, and inform the honorable senator when we get into Committee. One can recognise that in such a large territory as the Commonwealth - where settlement is in many instances very remote from large centres of population, and where it is necessary to retain such services as our Post and Telegraph service - it is quite possible that there may be small accounts where an annual audit by an officer of the Auditor-General would be utterly unwarranted when viewed as to cost in comparison with the amount involved. But it is not intended to make a provision that those accounts shall not be audited. It is proposed that wherever there shall be a relaxation of the hard-and-fast rule for an annual audit, the departure in each instance shall be sanctioned by the Treasurer, and the cause shall be listed in the Auditor-General's report. A somewhat similar provision is made in regard to detailed audits. For this provision to dispense with the details of certain audits we have a parallel in the case of New South Wales, South Australia, and Western Australia, as well as in the case of the United Kingdom. The object of the. provision is to conduce to economy, because in many cases the detailed audit can be dispensed with without incurring any financial risk. Another departure from the existing practice- is provided for in clause 12, and that is with regard to the publication of the quarterly statement of accounts. At the present time, it is published in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette,</inline> but it only contains the figures for the quarter under review. We propose to make it obligatory not merely to do that, but also, in the case of every quarter except the first, to give the figures for the financial, year up to that time. </para>

                    <para class="block">We make provision for the expenditure of moneys paid to a trust account for the investment and the disposal of any interest on any of the moneys of a trust account. In a schedule, honorable senators will find a .list of the particular trust accounts to which the Bill specifically refers. A number of them may be regarded in the light of trading accounts ; for instance, the Commonwealth Ammunition Material Account ; the Small Arms Ammunition Account; the Defence Clothing Material Account; and the Small Arms Account. These accounts are all operated at present on principles similar to those which are contained in clause 13. For example, the moneys which are realized by the sale of ammunition are paid into the Commonwealth Ammunition Material Account, and not into the Consolidated Revenue, and when the account needs to be put in funds, it is done by express appropriation. The Government Printer Account is principally a suspense account. The wages and the cost of materials are paid from the account, and when the work is completed transfer entries are made in the books charging the votes of the various Departments, thus relieving the account. </para>

                            <para>- I may say that that account, together with the Deferred Pay Account, and the Ocean Mails Account are included in the schedule mainly to validate transactions since they were taken over by the Commonwealth; but it is intended to close them almost immediately. It will be seen that the intention is to operate all these accounts in the manner set forth in the several paragraphs of clause 13. What I have said will indicate the scope of the measure. Experience in the working of the accounts has revealed its necessity. It was only natural to expect that when the accounts of the different Departments were transferred to the Commonwealth no one could be expected, in so short a space of time as intervened between that event, and the passing of the Audit Act, to grasp so completely the methods of the different States as to enable him to pass judgment on their comparative merits or disadvantages'. The experience of the last five years has shown the necessity for some modifications. In some instances the methods in use at the time of transfer were continued. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner found it convenient to carry on the existing systems in connexion with some of the transferred accounts, but he relied upon getting legislative sanction. But in connexion with the trust accounts there have been other defects or imperfections in the existing law which' the Bill seeks to remedy. The provisions of this Bill have been submitted to the scrutinizing inspection of the Auditor-General, and he approves of them. </para>

                        <para>. - The Minister has outlined the principal amendments which by the Bill it is sought to effect. I have experienced a little disappointment at the scanty character of the information which he afforded in reply to my interjection, and that was as to the acts for which an indemnity is asked. There is growing experience to show that the course of our legislation is pretty uniform. A Bill is brought in which a Minister assures us is the result of the most careful thought and the closest scrutiny on the part of the most experienced officers in the Department. Suggestions for its amendment or improvement are received here with indifference or with irritation, but, unfortunately, very little heed is paid to them. Very soon after the Bill has become law the Minister comes down with a stereotyped announcement that experience has shown that there are defects in the Act. </para>

                            <para>- I am pointing out that, at least, this Government is no better than the Governments to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> refers. There is a way of getting knowledge, and that is by experience, but it generally is a most expensive and unpleasant way. With all our legislation, it seems to me that it is necessary to pass a Bill, and wait until time and experience have demonstrated its defects, and then seek to provide for that with which a little more care in the first instance would have guarded against. I trust that, in view of the frequency with which we are called upon to deal with amending Bills honorable senators will feel disposed to subject the details of original measures to a little closer scrutiny than they have been doing. Clause 2 of this Bill appears to grant a general indemnity for acts which clearly have been done in contravention of the provisions of the Audit Act. I asked the Minister, by interjection, when he was dealing with one of them, if that was the only act for which an indemnity was required. He said that it was not the only one, but he did not indicate any other administrative acts which have been committed, and for which the principal Act makes no provision. I should like to know what they are. </para>

                    <para class="block">If there is only the one administrative act for which an indemnity is required the Minister has informed us of that act, but I should like to know definitely whether there are others, and, if so, what they are? Another matter to which the Minister referred, but very much as though it were in the nature of an amendment of the Act, is the proposal to establish a Federal Guarantee Fund. I believe that there is a provision in one of our Acts which enables that to be done. But in this Bill there is a specific provision; so that I assume that the Government proposes to create such a guarantee fund. If honorable senators will turn from clause 4 to clause 14, they will find all the machinery by which such a fund is to be established and worked. That clause empowers the making of regulations requiring officers, holding, positions which in the opinion of the Treasurer ought to be guaranteed, to contribute to the fund, and provides for its control and management. I am not, at the present moment, prepared to say whether or not it is advisable for the Commonwealth Government to establish its own guarantee fund, or whether it would be better, as at present, that our officers should be guaranteed by means of existing offices of repute. But I should have liked the Minister to give us the reasons why the Government proposes this departure. He merely stated that it is intended, but he gave no reasons why it is proposed to do so rather than to continue the practice which has hitherto prevailed in the Commonwealth, and has been general throughout the States, of relying upon insurance companies for the necessary guarantees. The next clause to which I wish to refer is one to which, so far as I can remember, the Minister did not allude. It seems to me to be an important one. At present, under section 26 of the Audit Act, all moneys received by postmasters on account of post-office orders and money orders have to be paid into the public account during the month of receipt. This Bill proposes that such moneys received by post-offices for the purpose I have indicated may be used by the Treasurer for the payment of any public moneys. There may be some reason for this proposal, but I should like to hear it justified. </para>

                            <para>- That may be a good reason, but the proposal seems to me to be open to serious question. It may be possible for the Treasurer to use moneys which ought to belong to the Post Office, and ought to be kept in a separate account, from which they should never be diverted without parliamentary approval, for purposes to which they ought not to be applied. It appears to me to be a wrong principle that moneys received by the Post Office on account of postal notes and post-office orders should be made available for the payment of any public moneys, and thus practically become as much at the disposal of the Treasurer as if they were paid into his advance account. Clause 6 is also a departure from what I regard as a very essential safeguard. Under it accounts may be paid without being certified by responsible officers. Under section 34 of the principal Act, before accounts can be paid, some officer in the Department concerned must certify that they are correct and entitled to be paid. It is now proposed to dispense with that procedure, and that the Treasurer may order the payment of any accounts he likes without waiting for the necessary certificate. If that procedure is not necessary in large commercial concerns, it should not be necessary in Government Departments ; and if it be necessary, I am not aware that the Minister has made its necessity clear. </para>

                            <para>- Why should there be more undue delay in connexion with a public Department than in a private concern? It is an admission that our Public Departments are not carried on without the same amount of circumlocution as appears to have surrounded Public Departments from the time of their institution. If a Department makes the admission that it cannot deal with its creditors except after undue delay, and therefore wants power to avoid the very necessary checks which the principal Act imposes, of course it is an admission of weakness on its part; and that is a matter that will have to be taken into account. For my own part, I think it is highly objectionable that we should give authority to the Treasurer to pay any accounts until the evidence is before the paving authorities that they have been submitted to proper examination and inspection, and have been certified as due for payment, as would be the case in any private concern, and as has hitherto been the case in Commonwealth Departments. As regards the provision concerning the postponement of audits, I have listened carefully to the Minister who has given reasons which appear to me to be entitled to consideration. The principal reason I take to be, that where the amounts involved are small, and the places where the accounts are kept are so distant from some central point that the expense of auditing them would be very serious, the audit may be dispensed with. But it is one thing to say that the annual audit need not be carried out, and quite another thing to say that there shall be no audit whatever. I think there ought to be an audit within a limited time. Some provision should be made for a periodical audit - not necessarily annual ; it might be once every two or three years. But no accounts should be allowed to run on for an indefinite period without some examination. We know that in very many cases where frauds have been committed in connexion with public moneys, they have arisen from the fact that there has been no proper provision for auditing, and that some officer has been trusted to an undue extent. It is incumbent upon us in 'dealing with this measure to see that no loophole that human ingenuity can guard against shall be left open. With regard to the proposal to alter the nature of the statements of accounts published by the Treasurer, I think that in trying to avoid one little difficulty the Bill goes to another extreme. Hitherto it has been the practice to publish statements showing the accounts quarterly. Now it is proposed to publish for the first three months of the year one quarter's accounts and at the end of six months the six months' accounts not showing the quarter's accounts separately. I, however, think that it is highly desirable to issue them quarterly, and to give the particulars for the previous quarter with them. I think some means should be afforded to let the public know what the business of the Departments has amounted to during each quarter. I have dealt generally with various portions of the Bill, but I shall have an, opportunity of dealing with the points to which I have alluded more fully in Committee. Ordinarily speaking, one deals with the principles of a measure on its second reading, but there are no principles in this Bill. It deals with machinery only. It is for that reason that I have hastily run over the clauses which appear to me to invite criticism. There is one other remark which I will make before sitting down, and that is with regard to the practice which exists to-day, and which this Bill proposes to continue, of allowing the receipts of any Department to be made available for the purposes of expenditure by that Department. That is a practice which seems to me to be entirely objectionable. " For instance, in the case of the accumulated ammunition and material account of the Defence Department, it is possible for a considerable portion of the ammunition and other material under its control to be sold, and to utilize the receipts for the purpose of making other purchases. I contend that all moneys of that kind should pass out of the control of the Department, and that if it requires money for the purpose of making other purchases, it should obtain parliamentary sanction for it. Otherwise it is evident that a great deal of material might be purchased without the sanction of Parliament. "We have such things as obsolete rifles. They may be sold and the Department may utilize the money so obtained for purchasing other rifles without parliamentary sanction. All moneys received by Departments should be paid into the Consolidated Revenue, and when a Department requires to spend money, it should come to Parliament for sanction, and for the necessary vote to enable it to apply the money for the purpose for which it is deemed necessary. </para>

                        <para>.- I am not surprised that experience should have dictated the desirableness of making some amendments in the Act passed by this Parliament m 1901. At that time, we were commencing a new state of things, and I anticipated that amendments in the Act would become necessary. Still, at the same time, I think that it is only right in a Bill of this nature that we should look carefully info its provisions and ask for information about anything which appears to be doubtful. The first note which I have made upon the Bill is with regard to clause 8, which seems to be designed to facilitate transfers of expenditure. I notice that the marginal note describes the clause as - </para>

                    <para class="block">Is it intended that that provision shall apply only to sums that have been voted by way of advance to the Treasurer? It would appear from the first part of the clause that it had a wider scope, and dealt with expenditure in excess of specific appropriations. I should also like to know the meaning of the proposed new section 36B, which will be found in clause 8 - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>The amount included in any sub-division in a schedule to an Appropriation Act for the salary in respect of an office or position occupied by an officer shall be available for payment of the officer's salary in any branch the salaries for which are provided in the same sub-division. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">Would that mean that if an officer's salary were voted for some particular kind of work and he was afterwards transferred, and did different work, the salary would still be paid to him ? I suppose that is the meaning. I suppose that that is the intention, but I do not know that it will be found to work very well. We vote money for the performance of certain duties, and I think it should be understood that the officer is going to perform those duties for the salary 'voted. The next clause seems to .me to facilitate the old practice of satisfying charges between one Department and another by means of a book entry - a practice which, I think, is undesirable. When we were passing the Post and Telegraph Act a verv strong feeling was expressed in favour of insisting that every other Department should pay for the services rendered it by the Post and Telegraph Department. I do not know to what extent that is now being carried out, but I am afraid that there is a tendency, as there has been in our experience of States Departments, to get out of that by a bookkeeping entry balancing the credits in one Department by the credits in another. The Bill makes provision for expenditure incurred on behalf of another Department being met by services performed in a subsequent year, and that is carrying the practice to which I have referred a little further than I think it has been carried in the past. To take an extreme case, we might imagine the officers of the Attorney-General's Department insisting on making a charge against other Departments for the drafting of Bills. They might say, " The Post and Telegraph Department makes a charge of so and so against us, and we will draft some Bills for that Department next year and make the account square." I know that there is a tendency in each of the Departments to escape the obligation of paying for services rendered by another. If that is allowed free scope, it will entirely defeat the effort made by Parliament to insure that, so far as possible, the Post and Telegraph Department shall be carried on on business lines, and its services paid for by every one who makes use of them. </para>

                            <para>- I am not sure whether any such payments are made now. I think book entries are made, but whether they are ever settled up or not I do not know. If my contention is correct, this Bill makes provision) for carrying on credits into the next year, and it would not be necessary to have a clearing up of accounts at the end of the financial year. I certainly think that even if the Departments do not pay for their postage there should at least be a settlement of accounts every year. I come now to the provisions with regard to audit. I do not know whether 1 am right, but I think that it is probable that the failure to audit accounts within the year might be one of the matters of omission intended to be covered by clause 2. I have no doubt that especially in out-of-the-way parts of the Commonwealth, it will sometimes be found difficult to conduct audits regularly. I think the Auditor-General might be assisted by some provision which would permit the yearly audit to be dispensed with on sufficient grounds stated in- his report, and submitted to Parliament, but I do not think that it should be on the ground that the cost involved in the audit would be disproportionate to the amount of the account. That is a ground which might be stated at all times to relieve the Auditor-General of the necessity of conducting an audit in out-of-the-way parts of the Commonwealth', where perhaps an audit is most necessary. We can hardly provide for a lesser interval than a year, and unless in case of unavoidable accident it ought not to be impossible to conduct an audit in every part of the Commonwealth during the course of a year. </para>

                            <para>- I admit that there is a great deal of difficulty in the settlement of the matter, but I think that the principle of an audit of all public accounts at least once in each year is a good om:. In such a case as that mentioned by the Minister, the reason that the cost of the audit would be entirely disproportionate to the amount involved would be a good reason for dispensing with it, but at present I do not like the idea that that should be the only reason which must necessarily be given. That might be put forward as a sufficient reason for dispensing with the audit of accounts in some places for a number of years. There is a matter connected with trusts accounts which I do not think is exactly met by the provisions of the Bill. A difficulty has arisen more than once in the Post and Telegraph Department in connexion with sums paid in respect of cable messages. For one reason or another persons who have paid certain amounts are entitled to refunds. In some cases they pay for an answer to a cable, and no answer is sent. Again, a message may be incorrectly sent, and it is right that the money paid for it should 'be refunded. In such cases there has been great difficulty in refunding money, because it has been paid at once into the Consolidated Revenue, and can only be got back by a roundabout process. This was brought under my notice at one time, when a comparison was being made between the facilities offered by the Eastern Extension Company and those offered by the Post and Telegraph Department. It was pointed out that if a man desired to obtain a refund of £2 or£3 from the Post and Telegraph Department it was impossible for him to get his money back except by adopting a circuitous process, because it had been paid into the Consolidated Revenue. On the other hand, it was stated that a man doing business with the Eastern Extension Company had simply to call at one of the offices of the company, and his money would be refunded at once. These sums might be placed to a trust account but I do not think that they are provided for in the Bill. Sub-clause 5 of clause 13 provides that moneys may be paid to the credit of the trust account to which they relate, but the clause does not appear to me to deal with the cases I have mentioned. </para>

                        <para>. - It appears to me that there are only a few of the clauses of this Bill which will give us any trouble. One is clause 6, to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has already directed attention. Power is given under that clause to pay without certification. I hope that that provision will not be agreed to, especially when it is taken in conjunction with paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of the same clause, which enables payments made on an uncertified account to be made without a receipt being taken. That seems to me to be a very remarkable feature of the clause. </para>

                        <para>. - We have heard from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> that this Bill has had the close and careful scrutiny of the Auditor- General, and we may therefore assume that there is not much in it which would justify the criticism of an ordinary senator. But there is one departure from our usual practice proposed, about which I have some doubt, and that is contained in clause 4- So far as I know, we are in this Bill asked to institute a new system, whereby the Commonwealth is to guarantee its own funds against losses due to want of fidelity on the part of public officers. I am not at all sure that I approve of it. As most honorable senators are aware, the ordinary method adopted by business houses of compelling their servants to provide, a fidelity guarantee, carries with it the additional precaution that the guaranteeing house usually makes rigid inquiries as to the character of the applicant, and gets some direct testimonial from one or more, and usually from two accredited persons, as to the applicant's character. The result of that must be that in addition to having a guarantee against loss, we have some trustworthy guarantee as to the risk we are likely to run. That is to say, an insurance company takes such precautions as it thinks fit to ascertain the risk it is going to run in reference to a particular servant, and to see that that risk is as little as possible. I take it that, if a Commonwealth Guarantee Fund is established, nothing more 'will happen than that a public servant will simply say, " I am paying my quota into the fund, and so you are indemnified against any loss." I do not suppose that the Commonwealth itself will inquire into the risk, if there be any, which is to be incurred in taking a particular person into its employ, having regard to the character of that person. I point out, however, that all the information we are likely to get on this subject will have to be derived from some regulations which are to be tabled later. I did think that I should have been able to congratulate the Government on legislating without the interposition of what so many of us object to, namely, subsequent regulations. I see, however, that, by clause 14, it is proposed to add to the present power to frame regulations the further power to so provide for the amount of the contributions of officers to the fund, and for the general control and management. It would be much better if. either now or in Committee, we had from the Minister some particulars as to the conditions of the proposed fund. I do not like the clause as .it stands, and I still further object to having the whole question of the guarantee shelved by a provision for regulations. That may be the most convenient way of settling the question, but it is most unsatisfactory to any honorable senator, when entering on a new departure, to find that the whole affair has to' be controlled bv regulations subsequently to be framed. </para>

I should much prefer that, in these matters, the Senate legislated directly. As to clause 12, I entirely disagree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> because I regard that clause as a decided improvement on the section in the original Act. Clause 8, however, is a distinct recognition of the practice of transfers between Departments. I admit that the clause deals with the transfer of credits from one year to another ; but, -at the same time, it is a recognition of a practice which I regard as dangerous and undesirable. I believe that there has grown up a practice of transferring expenditure from one Common wealth Department to another. I presume that, when one Department has exhausted its vote, it applies to some other Department, which may .have a surplus, for the extra money required. </para>

                        <para>. - The only copy I have of the regulations is that contained in Statutory . Rules No. 19, which were issued on the 14th February of this year. I am informed that these particular regulations have been in operation since soon after the passing of the Public Service Act. There was, however, some misconception as to the operation of these particular regulations, and, after an opinion had been obtained from the Attorney-General, they were re-stated in the Statutory Rules. I mention this so that honorable senators may know that these rules do not now see the' light for the first time, although they appear under the date of February last. </para>

                            <para>- No; these are incorporated with the Treasury Regulations. As I have already indicated, there was some doubt as to their effect when originally drawn from those under the Public Service Act, and. in view of some technical objection, the Attorney-General advised that there might be some doubt as to their operative effect, and it was decided to issue them in connexion with the Treasury Regulations. These regulations appear as regulations 137, and they run alphabetically from <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> to <inline font-style="italic">t.</inline></para>

There is a provision that the Treasurer may alter the rate of premium, but that any such alteration shall not take effect until the following July. Regulation <inline font-style="italic">i</inline> provides that all moneys collected shall be paid to a trust fund to the credit of the Guarantee Fund Account, while Regulation <inline font-style="italic">m</inline> provides that the permanent heads shall from time to time furnish the Treasurer with the names of any officers who should be added to the list. </para>

If any one had wanted to find out about the Fidelity Guarantee Fund under the Public Service Act he would not have dreamed of referring to Treasury Regulations. It does seem to me a strange thing that Treasury Regulations should apply to all the officers under the Public Service Act. Perhaps I had better not discuss that question until we reach clause 14, when I intend to move an amendment with the object of securing that regulations made under this measure or the principal Act shall, when laid upon the table of the Senate, be referred to as "Regulations made under the Audit Act." </para>

It might be businesslike when there was any difficulty about an account to have power to advance up to three-fourths, and to pay the balance when the account had been certified. </para>

                        <para>. - This amendment of section 34 of the Audit Act is proposed in order to meet a difficulty which has more than once arisen, and that is the difficulty of making prompt payment of certain accounts in remote parts of the Commonwealth. Very often accounts which are in themselves small are incurred by the Commonwealth in remote centres. When it is necessary to wait until the account has been properly certified by the certifying officer, and sent through the various channels to head-quarters, although the delay may be nothing for the Commonwealth, still the creditor may be embarrassed by the want of promptness in the payment of the amount. The object of the clause therefore is to insure something like a speedy settlement of the accounts of the Commonwealth in its remoter parts. It is comparatively easy of course for a man who is in Melbourne to obtain payment of an account amounting to £10 or £100. But a creditor who lives in the back parts of Queensland or the Northern Territory is considerably handicapped in that respect. It is proposed in such instances as would involve considerable delay in waiting for the certificate of the officer to make payment. At the same time, the account, before being paid, will be properly examined and checked by a competent officer. It is proposed that for the purpose of proper record a certificate shall be obtained from the certifying officer in due course, it may be after the payment of the account. </para>

The clause is of a complete and drastic character. It does not refer to small amounts or to remote places. It gives authority for the payment of very large sums without any certificate having been given. It ought not to be passed in its present form. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not like the provision. No doubt there are portions of the Commonwealth where delay in getting accounts certified takes place. But the persons who contract to do work for the Commonwealth there know perfectly the disabilities under which they will labour, and are prepared for them. This provision could be applied not only to remote parts of the Common- wealth, but also to populous centres. It is not safe to permit the payment of an account until it has been certified in the ordinary way. Such a departure from ordinary principles as is proposed might open the door to any amount of looseness in dealing with the public accounts. For that reason, I feel inclined to vote against the provision. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not think the clause ought to be passed as printed. Surely it would be quite easy for the Minister to frame a slight amendment in the direction of a safeguard. The clause is worded as widely as it could possibly be. It throws upon the Treasurer the onus of passing an account without a certificate. As a matter of practice, I presume, he would be informed by an officer that he could pass the account. He would insensibly pass on the responsibility to that officer, and so, perhaps. the evil might spread. I do not think that there is any real safeguard except in requiring a certificate before an account is passed. If the clause were passed in its present form, and the fullest opportunity were taken of its wide language, a fearful wrong might be done to the Commonwealth. I do not think that the Minister or the Auditor-General wants a provision so wide in its terms as this is. No doubt certain elasticity is desired to meet a class of cases where the amount involved has been small, and the inconvenience which the creditor has suffered by reason of delay has been out of proportion to the amount. For instance, it may have taken two or three months to get a certificate for the payment of an account amounting to But because some elasticity is required to cover a case of that kind, it is not necessary to enact this comprehensive provision. It cannot be gainsaid that, under the clause, the Treasurer, if satisfied by an officer, might permit the payment of an account for any amount without a certificate from the certifying officer. It is not necessary to give such latitude. Unless the clause be amended, I shall vote against it. I suggest to the Minister that he might postpone the consideration of the clause with the view to an amendment being drafted. It is better that an amendment should be prepared in the ordinary way ; and it is still more preferable that the clause should be amended rather than rejected. But I cannot understand any honorable senator voting for it as it stands. </para>

They would be certified before going on to the Auditor-General. I am informed that what is now proposed has been the practice in Victoria and elsewhere ; and it is simply because that practice has been queried that it is sought to provide that it shall be unquestionable in future. As a matter of fact, I have already asked for information from those who are better acquainted with this subject than I am as to the advisableness of inserting a limit to the amount that may be dealt with in this manner, and I am informed that that is not desirable. If the practice that has been followed were not permitted, the delays that would be occasioned in the settlement of accounts would be very extensive indeed.

The amount involved may be £20,000 or £40,000. The position has become a little more serious after the Minister's explanation. He has told us that payments are frequently made without certificate. I think it desirable that that system should be limited. I admit that for the credit of the Commonwealth it is advisable that there should be speedy payment of ordinary accounts. I have suggested that we should insert the words "not exceeding twenty pounds." The amount might be raised to £100 i'f the Minister prefers that. But the Committee ought not to pass a clause under which £20,000 or more mght be paid without proper authorization. </para>

There is a complete and ready answer to that; and I say at once that, if we are going to pass this clause, we might as well agree to the payment of any amount without certificate. If we are going to abolish the use of proper certificates, let us say so. First of all, however, it is not necessary to give the Treasurer such a power, because all cases of difficulty can be met by means of another clause. Consequently, what is proposed is not desirable. I go even further, and say that, under any circumstances, what is proposed is dangerous, if we admit the value and desirableness of the certificates which the Audit Act requires. Unless the clause is amended, I shall vote against it. </para>

At present, where we rigidly follow the existing procedure under the Act, considerable delay is involved in the payment of accounts in the various States, and the Commonwealth bears all the obloquy. Reference has been made to the fact that this particular clause has been drawn from a corresponding clause in the States Audit Acts, but, so far as the States Governments are concerned, the distance from the Seat of? Government to its outlying parts is not nearly so great as in the case of the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- Then we would not do it, but we would pile up expenses. Although the Auditor-General questions the legality of the practice, in the absence of any statutory provision for it, he has seen that it has worked no harm. In the circumstances I ask honorable senators not to insist on a limitation of this character. If there must be some check let it not be a limit as to the amount, the locality, or the distance, but let the limit that is placed on the exercise of this otherwise discretionary power be one which will tend to secure some check in substitution for the ordinary certificate. </para>

                    <para class="block">We desire to make provision that in cases where the Treasurer otherwise directs, it shall not be necessary to set out the words at full length. Honorable senators are doubtless familiar with the common method of taking receipts for the payment of salaries where a salary abstract is used to set out the names of the recipients, and the amounts to be received in columns of figures. The pay-sheets of mines and large business houses are drawn up in a similar form, and very often the salaries paid in larger Commonwealth offices are receipted on sheets setting out the salaries in figures, It will be admitted' that it would be exceedingly inconvenient if it were necessary in these cases to set out in words at full length the amount of the salaries to be paid. </para>

I may be told that if the list is published, any member of Parliament may be able to direct attention to the fact that the accounts of a certain officer have not been audited for a year, but I do not think that it is desirable that any member of Parliament should be allowed to do that. </para>

The publication of the list would serve no useful purpose. It is not necessary as a reminder to the Auditor-General. It is proposed, for no useful purpose, to give publicity to the fact that certain persons have not had their accounts audited for more than a year, and I think that this will be found to be dangerous rather than desirable. I ask that these words should be struck out. I am prepared to pass the clause giving the Auditor-General at his own discretion the power to dispense with an annua] audit of certain accounts, and I think the publication of the proposed list would be most inadvisable. </para>

                        <para>- - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> takes a somewhat strange view when he suggests that the publication of the list would cast any reflection on the officers included in it, seeing that the reasons for dispensing with the audit will be stated. I can mention an instance in which the existence of some such provision would have been of advantage in Western Australia. We have a State Auditor-General and Audit Act. as has every other State, but honorable senators will remember that a report of two Commonwealth officers laid before Parliament on the condition of affairs existing in the Post and Telegraph Department of Western Australia disclosed the fact that for a number of years in some branches of that Department no regular audit had taken place. I am sure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> does not hold the view that any State Parliament would be aware of any such state of affairs. If there were a similar provision in the Western Australian Audit Act - and I am sure there is not - the attention of Parliament would have been called to the fact that the accounts of a very large number of officers in the metropolitan post-office had' not been audited. No reflection is cast on the officials by such a provision, because the purpose of the fist is known. It is to indicate those officials whose reports have not been audited because of the costly character of the audit. The list would inform Parliament as to the extent to which this practice of dispensing with audits was being availed of by the Auditor-General ; and that is information which Parliament has a right to have. </para>

                            <para>- If such accounts had to be investigated in all their details, it would often involve an amount of time and money not warranted under the circumstances. It will be seen from a perusal of the clause that it is not proposed to dispense altogether with detailed audits. There must be a combination of circumstances before the power can be exercised. First of all, the Auditor-General must believe that in the particular case, a detailed audit can be dispensed with without risk, and then there must be the concurrence of the Treasurer, followed by the sanction of the latter, who has the duty cast upon him of deciding that the circumstances are such as to render such an audit unnecessary. Then, of course, there must be a list of all such cases published each year, and the Minister may be called upon to justify his action in Parliament. The clause is not for the purpose of introducing any laxity in the existing practice, but merely to meet the peculiar circumstances to which I have already referred. </para>

                        <para>. - The principal reason for adopting this clause is that it will save expense. It has been the experience of many public companies and institutions that the saving of a few pounds in the way of auditing has very often led to disastrous results. Even with the comparatively complete system of auditing we now have, there are many cases of defalcations. The Commonwealth loses a round sum in this way every year, and if a loose system of audit is recognised, the danger, not only of financial loss, but of breeding careless habits amongst Commonwealth employes, will become very serious. I do not think that this clause ought to be passed, but that we ought to insist' on audits being carried out in the old way, so as to make our finances as safe as possible. </para>

                            <para>- But there is no doubt that the Treasurer would consult some permanent official ; and I am not sure that in speaking previously on this clause I did not myself use the word "check.'1 There is no doubt that the Treasurer would ask some responsible officer whether certain accounts should be passed without a certificate ; and the amendment does not satisfy me. Any amount might be passed without a certificate, simply because some official said he had checked the account, and that it was all right. Indeed, I suppose that some officer would check the account on every occasion, even prior to a certificate being issued. My chief objection is that there is no limit to the latitude given ; and if we dispense with the certificate in such cases we might as well dispense with the certificate altogether. I do not know what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> thinks of this clause, but it is one for which I cannot vote.

                        <para>. - I hope that the honorable senator will see his way to accept the amendment. It would make it obligatory in every instance before a payment of this kind was made to have the amount checked. It would obviate the necessity for having certifying officers appointed throughout the Commonwealth at a large expense, and thus enable the Commonwealth to deal expeditiously with its creditors. Having regard to the fact that the practice has not been attended with any evil results in the past, and that those who are familiar with the practice have nojreason to apprehend any evil results arising from its continuance, I think that the Committee will be well minded if they will pass the clause with this additional safeguard. It will make absolute provision that the amount must be checked by a responsible officer, and in every instance the certificate of the certifying officer will be obtained before the account goes on to the Auditor-General. What was the original object in providing for the issue of that certificate? It was simply to insure that the account was correct. If that can be done by another responsible officer, similarly appointed, shall we not achieve the same result ? </para>

                            <para>- Surely we ought not to give such wide latitude to the Government. Suppose that a man had contracted in a remote district to do certain work for the Commonwealth for the sum of £100, and that upon its completion he wanted his money at once. The Treasurer could say, " If some official in my Department will check the account, I shall pay it straight away," and the contractor would get his money, although the contract might have been very badly performed. </para>

                            <para>- The clause says that the Treasurer may permit the payment of any account before it has been certified, but it is proposed by the amendment to enable him to pay the amount if it has been checked by a- responsible officer. That is no certificate, but merely a checking of the additions by_ a Treasury officer. The object of the provision is to allow 'payment to be made without a. certificate from the certifying officer, but it would enable the payment of ,£50,000 to be made if the contractor said that he wanted his money in a hurry. </para>

Will not every storekeeper in the vicinity trust him because of that fact? At any rate, that has been my experience. I think that a great deal too much has been made of the hardship df the small man, but I am perfectly willing to allow the clause to be amended if a proper check is provided- With the addition of the words proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> there would not be a check as to the value of the work done or as to the amount owing. </para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> is laboring under a misapprehension. He put the case of a contractor in the country who, having finished his contract, wanted payment at once, and urged that the account would be paid without a certificate. In the country there would be an officer to certify to the proper performance of the contract, and the contractor would get no payment unless that certificate were sent in. The certificate referred to in the clause is the certificate of the Treasury officer who has to add up the amounts and certify to the correctness of small details. No contractor for the Commonwealth would get paid under any circumstances unless the superintending officer had certified that he had carried out the contract according to plans and specifications. The object of the clause is merely to prevent the delay which has very frequently occurred in the Treasury because of a rush of work having come in. It is the duty of the Treasury officers to add up the items and check all the computations, and the delay which this task involves has often been the means of keeping a contractor out of his money unnecessarily. Bv this clause it is proposed,, in certain circumstances, to dispense with the certificate of the Treasury officer, but, of course, not with the certificate of the superintending officer that the contract has been properly performed. </para>
