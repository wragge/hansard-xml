I was thinking of sending it back with a request to furnish me with a definite answer to each of the questions, but afterwards I thought that possibly the honorable senator might be satisfied with the reply which had been furnished, and therefore I took the chance of giving it. I shall call special attention to the fact that the two questions have not been answered, and tell him the result of my inquiries. </para>

                </quote>
                <para class="block">On Friday last I had no opportunity of calling specific attention to this standing order, because the Senate was counted out. Honorable senators know that after attention had been called to the state of the Senate - there was, by-the-bye, a quorum present then - three honorable senators left the chamber. I believe that all three honorable senators were forgetful of the standing order ; in fact, I am quite sure that two were, because they came back when requested, and I hope that the third honorable senator was also, I shall not say ignorant, but forgetful of the standing order. As it happened, the two honorable senators who came back made up the quorum, and, therefore, it was not necessary to take any action. But when attention is called to the state of the Senate, if an honorable senator leaves the chamber in derogation of the standing order, I think it only right that in counting the Senate I should count him, because he ought to be here. He is here in accordance with the standing order. I hope that such an occurrence will not happen again. </para>

                        <para>- We need not go outside our own knowledge. Everybody is aware that a trust may be beneficent in its action. For instance, in the coal trade we have a trust for the express purpose of enabling coal owners and coal miners to work together with a view to keep up the rate of wages. That, I presume, would be considered a beneficent trust. </para>

                        <para>- Obviously that is not in accordance with the statement made by the Minister of Defence, and offends against every principle of justice. The clause would not be weakened for the purpose for which it was designed by the omission of the paragraph, and certainly it would be made a little more satisfactory. The word "shall " is used in the clause. That is to say, if the defendant is a commercial trust his competition is to be deemed to be unfair, unless the contrary is proved. That is mandatory. However fair, honest, or beneficent the trust may be, the Courts, or whoever deals with the matter, is bound to look upon it as unfair in its competition. Therefore, with every confidence, I ask the Committee to strike out the words. </para>

                    <para>. - I have already admitted - and I think I was accurate in doing so - that there are trusts that are absolutely fair, and may be beneficent; whilst, at the same time, there are trusts which are unfair. This clause simply provides that trusts shall prove that they are not unfair, whereupon there will be no further trouble. It is only where a trust is unfair that the clause will operate. The great majority of trusts are unfair, unmistakably. </para>

                    <para>. - I must express my disappointment at the meagreness of the reply of the Minister. It is, I think, incumbent on any Minister who is in charge of a Bill, when a question is raised as to the wisdom of retaining any of its provisions, to justify them. Surely <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> cannot contend that his brief remarks have justified the words to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> takes exception. I point out two strong objections to them. In the first place this clause makes a different law for different individuals or institutions. It places a trust - it may be before a criminal Court - in an entirely different light from an individual. Is it desirable to have one law for one set of persons and another law for another set? </para>

                        <para>- Because it is impossible to deal with companies in the same way as with persons, surely it does not justify dealing with them differently, as this clause proposes to do. I can see no justification for saying that where an individual is brought before a Court, he shall be dealt with under a certain law, but that where a combination of persons is proceeded against they shall be dealt with under another law. The Minister said that there is no hardship upon them. It is quite clear that those who drafted this clause thought that there would be a hardship, or words would not have been inserted which place upon trusts restraints that are not applied to ordinary individuals. I should like to quote an authority to show that trusts are not necessarily injurious. </para>

                        <para>- He made the statement which I have quoted quite recently. It is a fact, of which we are all aware, that there are trusts which are not necessarily injurious. If that be the case, it seems to be quite sufficient if power is taken, where it is considered that a trust is doing wrong, to bring it before the Court, and treat it as an ordinary individual would be treated, according to processes with which we are familiar. Merely because a trust is the defendant it ought not to be assumed that it has done certain things. Instead of following the principle which underlies all our legislation - or did until lately - that a man is to be assumed to be innocent until proved to be guilty, this clause is based upon the assumption with regard to certain individuals, that they are to be held to be guilty, and it throws upon them the onus of proving their innocence. This marks a departure from the legislative road which this and all other English-speaking communities have hitherto followed - of assuming, the innocence of a person charged with an offence until guilt is proved. </para>

                        <para>- It is because this provision marks a new departure, and because that departure is becoming more frequent and pronounced, that I ask the Committee to see Whether there is any necessity for perusing that departure in the clause which we are now discussing. To my mind, it appears to be desirable that we should not revert to a system well known in continental Europe, but unknown in Great Britain, and unknown in Australia until latterly, for the sake of such a slight advantage as might probably be gained if we retained the words, the omission of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> has moved. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not agree with my honorable friend who has just resumed his seat, that this clause puts any unfairness upon commercial trusts. The honorable senator's first objection is that there is no reason why a trust, which, according to him, may or may not be beneficial or non-injurious, should be treated differently from an individual. I reply that there is a most obvious and decisive reason. We are aware that commercial trusts have been formed for the purpose of defeating legitimate trading, and securing monopolies, and that, having secured monopolies, they have used their power in their own interest. This Bill defines what a commercial trust is, and in so doing it has regard to the growth of commercial trusts through their various stages. In the United States the first stage was an agreement by means of which persons endeavoured to secure and control trade. The Courts, however, interfered, and said that these agreements were in restraint of trade, and consequently could not be permitted to be made. After that, persons desiring to monopolize trade transferred their stock, which was to be held under a declaration of trust for certain purposes. To meet such arrangements, the words "as understood in equity" are inserted in this Bill. According to law, those persons who held stock in their own name were the legal owners, but as they executed a deed of declaration of trust, the beneficiaries under the declaration are included when we refer to a trust " as understood in Equity." This second scheme was also defeated bv the Courts. The third scheme was the creation of what was called holding companies; the effect of which was that they did not come within the terms of the judgments in the previous cases referring to agreements and declaration of trusts, but formed a separate company for the purpose of buying interests or taking over interests in various other companies. By this means a company or commercial trust was created, and illegitimate trading. was thereby secured. The Bill has been drawn for the express purpose of defeating illegitimate efforts on the part of commercial trusts. If a great monopolistic concern of this kind enters into a deliberate scheme to crush an Australian industry by unfair competition and unfair dealing, it is essential to the efficacy of a measure which seeks to prevent anything of the kind that the words objected to should be retained. </para>

                    <para>. - While listening to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best,</inline> I have been wondering whether he intended that this Bill should affect trade unions ; because there is no argument applicable to trusts used by him which could not be applied to unions of labouring men. I see no particular reason why paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> should be retained in clause 6. What is really aimed at is secured by paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">c.</inline> The one object which we have in passing this clause is to see that there shall be no unfair competition, no inadequate remuneration for labour, no substantial disorganization in Australian industry, and no throwing of workers out of employment. What is the necessity, or what is the desirability, of inserting paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> for that purpose? If it be taken out altogether, we do not, to the smallest extent imaginable, impair the efficacy of the Bill, or the clause under consideration. </para>

                        <para>- Surely we do not want such short-cuts to legislation. We might as well say at once that a commercial trust consists of common scoundrels. A commercial trust, however, is not necessarily injurious ; and to the fullest extent to which it may be injurious, it can be dealt with under paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">c.</inline> If there is a little honesty and fair play on the part of a commercial trust, it should not be treated unfairly. But this clause would shut it out even though it were carrying on operations in a way to which we could not have the slightest objection. I cannot see the smallest imaginable reason that the most devoted admirer of this Bill can allege in favour of the words. If they are left out, I cannot see that anything harmful would follow, because everything that is necessary is amply provided for. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> has admitted that it does not follow that a commercial trust is necessarily an improper thing. We all admit that if a trust has a proper regard for the remuneration and conditions of labour, and for fair competition it is not unfair. I return to the point that every word of this clause would apply to an ordinary trade union. A trade union might be conducted exactly as a commercial trust is supposed to be conducted under the definition which appears in this Bill. Even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> will admit that. </para>

                <para class="block">Best, a little while ago, that this Bill referred to "great trusts." He used the word " great." I refer honorable senators to the fact that the word is not used in the Bill. The clause under discussion refers to all sorts of trusts, small as well as great ; and a misapprehension is created by keeping before the minds of honorable senators the statement that we are dealing with great evils. I urge honorable senators to disabuse themselves of that false impression.. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> has made a remark which, instead of weakening the ground that I take, strengthens it materially. He said that if a charge is brought against any one, all that he has to do is to prove his innocence. If that argument be looked at quietly, what does it resolve itself into? That an entirely false charge may be brought against anybody. If we eliminate the words to which I object, we shall to a certain extent prevent that evil being done. At the same time, we shall not weaken the power of attacking great trusts and serious evils when they arise. To give an idea as to what is possible, I wish to quote some details of an agreement that I hold in my hand. It is similar, I suppose, to hundreds, if not thousands, of agreements existing in Australia. And remember that an agreement amongst merchants and traders to do a certain thing is, according to clause 3, to be considered to constitute those traders a trust. The agreement which I have in my hand is one by which certain distributing merchants of New South Wales bound themselves to sell a certain brand of cocoa at a given price, and bv which the agent for the manufacturer at Home bound himself to sell only to firms which observed the condition. The sole object of the agreement was to prevent what might be called sweating in selling, because the only profit on this cocoa is equal to1d. per lb. I know all about this matter, because my name appears in the agreement. </para>

                <para>SenatorPULSFORD. - Yes ; I am agent for the firm in London, and, according to this Bill, for one of the most simple and innocent agreements the world ever saw, I am liable to be described as a commercial trust, or a party to a trust, and have a criminal charge levelled at me. Such agreements are made almost by the hundred. Honorable senators will see that if ten or twenty importing firms are dealing in a proprietary article, there is a tendency for one house to quote some minute fraction under the price of another house ; but with an agreement of this kind, which, as I say, may be regarded as a simple and requisite anti-sweating agreement, a minimum price is fixed to cover all trade risks. This is a form of agreement which exists in all the States, and is necessary for the carrying on of business. So far from being of that grasping character which is attributed to trusts, it really has an opposite tendency. The sole object is to make it possible for business to be conducted. It has happened again and again that, with various competing firms, the price has become such as to return no profit, and the sale of the article has been given up. The object of such agreements is to obtain a minimum profit - sometimes a beggarly profit scarcely worth the trouble of entering in the books. </para>

It is fallacious to reason with reference to commercial trusts, which have become a world's menace, on the same lines as we should with reference to individuals. However, if we require a reason for the retention of paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a,</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> has supplied one. The honorable senator has shown the existence of an undoubted trust in c'onnexion with the cocoa trade. He has also shown that that is not a baneful trust ; and it would, therefore, not be affected, except to the extent of being called upon to prove its innocence, as could easily be done. </para>

                        <para>- Being a trust it is assumed for the purpose of the Bill that its competition is unfair until proved to be otherwise. The reason for so dealing with trusts is that, unlike individuals, they are generally extremely powerful, and created for the purpose of exploiting the public. While it is admitted that occasionally, and, generally, only tentatively trusts may be non-injurious or may even be beneficent, their general tendency is to be baneful, and, therefore, they are treated differently from individuals whose characteristic is not to be prejudicial to the public well-being. </para>

                        <para>- I am putting the worst case ; and it seems to me that, if there be a trust, the authorities may, if they choose, call upon it to prove that its operations are not baneful to the public, or likely to create disorganization in an industry. But, assuming <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> to be right, I contend that there is justification for dealing with trusts differently from individuals. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford's</inline> own showing, the trust to which he has referred is designed to maintain just and reasonable profit. But, assuming for argument sake that it could be shown - or that the trust was unable to show that it was not so - that the minimum pride was fixed in order to permit the manufacturer, even though the distributors only made a profit of1d. per lb., to charge twice, or any amount, over, what ought to be a proper charge for manufacturing. Under such circumstances, the trust would be one baneful in its character. As showing from current history the necessity for treating trusts differently from individuals, honorable senators have only to remember the recent proceedings against the fountain head of American trusts, J. B. Rockefeller, who was summoned before a Court to give evidence. I assume that the object of summoning <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rockefeller</inline> as a witness was to prove by his evidence that the trust with which he was connected was baneful ; but, as he simply kept out of the way, and would not fulfil his duties as a citizen, he was not called upon to prove his innocence, with the result that the intention of the Court to prove him guilty was frustrated. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rockefeller</inline> had been called upon by law to prove his innocence, it would have been no use his running away, and he would have come forward. That seems to be a strong reason why we should deal differently with these institutions as compared with the ordinary institutions of civilization. </para>

The Rockefeller trust is an octopus, and if we catch hold of one of its tentacles the responsibility is at once removed to another, and another, and yet another, until it is impossible to say where is the centre. In other words, if we get hold of a trust of this kind by one leg, as the saying is, it hops away on the other. </para>

                        <para>- That is so ; and that is a very strong reason why trusts should be treated differently from individuals. We can always take an individual by the scruff of the neck and give him a shake up by law, or some other means ; but such a step is impossible in the case of a commercial trust. The only way is to say to a commercial trust-" Until you prove yourself innocent, we shall assume that you are guilty." Then the trust will come out of its shell, and, if it can, prove itself innocent. There would be no difficulty in an innocent trust proving its innocence, and, if it were guilty, it would not come out of its shell at all; and, therefore, it should be treated as guilty. Otherwise, a trust would be able to carry on its operations, and the law would be ineffective. According to the Bill as presented, a trust, wherever it might be, of whomsoever it might be composed, will be treated as guilty until it proves that there is no intention to injure the public trust of Australia. It can be called upon to come out of cover, and prove that its business is legitimate; and, for the reasons already advanced, a commercial trust ought to be treated differently from an ordinary individual. </para>

What is there to make a business which is carried on by a board of management worse than the business of an incorporated company ?

                        <para>- It is only done in a few cases, and generally for what are considered to be good and sufficient reasons. The question the Senate has to decide is whether persons who trade together under a board of management are to be held to be of such a suspicious character that it is necessary the onus of proof should be placed upon them. I rose particularly to ask the Senate not to be confused by honorable senators who talk a great deal about the destruction of Australian industries, and of the question of intent. We have been told on the best authority that some trusts are not only harmless, but beneficent, and yet this clause proposes that all trusts shall be held to be guilty until they are proved innocent. </para>

The clause begins, " For the purposes of the last two preceding sections," &amp;c. ; and in order to discuss the effect of clause 6 we have necessarily to refer to the two previous clauses to see where the words " unfair competition " are used, and in what connexion.

                        <para>- I think it can. Suppose, for instance, that under paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of clause 4, a certain person - who may be a commercial trust - were charged with having contracted or combined with intent to destroy or injure by means of unfair competition any Australian industry, the preservation of which was advantageous to' the Commonwealth. Before paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> of clause 6 could operate, it would be necessary to prove, first, the existence of a combination ; secondly, that it was a combination of a particular character coming within the definition of a commercial trust; and, thirdly, competition. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> said that we had not to regard the preceding clause at all. The burden of his argument was that it would be necessary to prove the existence of the commercial trust, and that immediately the whole onus of disproving the offence would fall on that body. That is not so, I submit. The Bill makes it necessary that other things should be proved, namely, the intent to injure or destroy an Australian industry, and the fact that it is one which was worth preserving. The question arises whether they are going to do it by unfair competition or bv legitimate competition? If it were a case of a private individual, it would be necessary to prove affirmatively that the competition was unfair. And if it were a trust, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> says, the onus would be thrown upon the trust of disproving that it was unfair. I submit that there is that difference, and I agree with what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> and others have said, that it is quite possible that there may be in existence trusts which are beneficent, but the balance of public advantage requires that in such cases the onus of proof of innocence shall be put upon the defendant. We have to adopt that course in many instances. The reference which has been made to trade unions reminds me that some of the most learned Judges in the United Kingdom have ruled that a single individual may do a certain act, but that if a number of individuals do that act at the same time, and under circumstances that suggested concert, in every instance all those individuals would be liable. Suppose, for example, that a single individual refrains from attending his ordinary employment. His employer might have no cause of .complaint against him, and might be able to get even with him by stopping his wages. But suppose that ten or 100 men stopped away. Do not honorable senators know that if those persons were proceeded against in a Court, the onus of proof would not remain under those circumstances in exactly the same position as it would if one individual were proceeded against - and that without any statute law? Here we have to deal with a combination which is formed for either a legitimate or an illegitimate purpose, using the words, " illegitimate purpose " to cover unfair competition calculated to destroy an Australian industry. If the combination was formed for a perfectly legitimate and <inline font-style="italic">bona fide</inline> purpose, it would have the means of proving that. If, on the other hand, it was formed not primarily for the purpose of destroying an industry, but, having been formed, and recognising its powers in that direction, it decided to do that, the onus of proof would not be left to the prosecution. If the intent be present, it will be assumed that it was going to effect that destruction by means of unfair competition. I do not think it is a very great burden of proof to put upon a combination of that character. ' As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> said, such a definition of " commercial trust " is quite consistent with a combination which is formed for a perfectly innocent purpose, but the balance of public advantage, I repeat, requires that in those cases the combinations, which would have the means of proving their innocence, should be called upon to disprove the unfair competition. When the prosecution has submitted all the other essentials of the charge, I think it is not calling upon, defendant to do very much. For those very reasons we differentiate the case of the trust from that of the individual. </para>

It is quite sufficient to raise a presumption in the mind of the Court that it was concerted action in the way of a conspiracy. I submit that we are not imposing any hardship upon a combination which is formed for a " legitimate and honest purpose," using that phrase in relation to what we deem an offence under the Bill. </para>

                    <para>. - Without going back to the argument as to what "commercial trust" relates to, or how far it stands isolated in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a,</inline> we are agreed that in its treatment the case of a commercial trust is separated from that of an individual. For many weary months I have been engaged on. a Royal Commission, and I desire to state one of the conclusions I have arrived at with regard to the state of Australian industries, and that is that many industries would to-day be in a much more flourishing position, and that other industries might have been created, if there had been an opportunity to get larger capital. I am perfectly satisfied that industries have stopped because they have been started with insufficient capital. However else we may differentiate a corporation, such as a commercial .trust, from an individual, I think it will be agreed that one of the frequent differentiations is that a body of individuals, if formed into a trust or corporation, can command a larger amount of capital under one control than can a single individual. I think it would be a great advantage if capital were to be focussed, or, I might say, if a larger amount of capital- could be got together for more than one industry in the Commonwealth. If we put upon a commercial trust a stigma or hardship ; if it is treated differently from an individual - and, of course, I assume that it is an honest and fair trust - we shall do harm to Australian industry. I believe that the retention of paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> will to a certain extent do harm to Australian industry. </para>

                    <para>.- While agreeing with all that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> hassaid as to the proper interpretation of the clause, I want to carry the matter even further. In the case of a prosecution under paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> of clause 5,' the onus would be thrown upon the prosecution of proving everything against the commercial trust in the same way as it would have to be proved against a single individual. If, however, it were a prosecution under paragraph <inline font-style="italic">'b ,</inline> then, notwithstanding what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> said, the onus would be thrown upon the prosecution of proving that the commercial trust had entered into the contract, or continued a member of the combination, with intent to destroy or injure an Australian industry. It would be necessary, not only to prove the existence of the industry, but also that it was one worth preserving, having regard to the interests of producers, workers, and consumers. In regard to all those things the onus of proof would be cast upon . the prosecution. </para>

                    <para>- - I hope that we are getting a little nearer to the light. I did not intend to assert that the onus of proof was changed with regard to the fact of the persons being a commercial trust. It is perfectly clear that that would have to be proved first by the ordinary method. But as soon as it was. proved that the defendant was a commercial trust, the onus of proof would be shifted on to the defendant with regard to the charge that there was unfair competition. The unfair competition is .the whole gist of the offence; and it is in respect of that that the onus of proof is shifted. How is intention proved? By acts. The law presumes that a- man- intends the necessary*consequences of his own acts. That is the way in which intent is proved in regard to all the offences of which I have any knowledge. It is shown by the man having committed acts which necessarily lead to certain results. Otherwise, intention never could be proved. How is intention to murder or to steal established? Simply by proving that the person committed certain acts which led to those results. </para>

                        <para>- Under this Bill the thing that indicates the intention is the unfair competition. If there is a prosecution against a firm under this Bill, and it is proved to be a commercial trust, then the onus of proof is changed. The firm is charged with bringing goods into Australia and selling them at a price lower than that at which any firm manufacturing similar goods could compete. The thing is to prove that the act is unfair. There are, it is true, some cases in which the onus of proof rests upon the defendant. We have that in the Customs laws and in licensing laws. In nearly all cases that is done where the facts are particularly within the knowledge of the person, and where, therefore, it would be impossible or difficult to obtain a conviction unless the burden of proof of innocence were thrown upon the defendant. But where is the particular reason for that in this Bill? It may be said to lie in the fact that the defendant, in bringing the goods into the country, would know what would be the result upon other people. But it is a most difficult thing to call upon a commercial trust to disprove innocence. Is it a fair thing, in the case of a person who has done nothing else than import goods into Australia, presumably according to law, and has put them upon the market by the ordinary recognised methods, to call upon him to disprove that the competition arising from the sale of his goods will injure other persons, or will injure an Australian industry? What reason is there why the onus of proof should be shifted in this case? If an individual brings in the goods, the ordinary rule of British la.w is to apply - that he is to be held to be innocent unless proved to toe guilty. But if a combination' of several firms or persons, working together under a board of management, does the same thing, they are to be held to be guilty, until proved to be innocent; and the Bill puts upon them the onus of proving that the introduction of the goods has not been prejudicial to the interests of workers, producers, and consumers. </para>

                        <para>- No. If a commercial trust is found introducing goods into Australia and selling them in such a way that injury results to producers, workers, and consumers, the trust will be held to have imported those goods with intent. It will be proved that injury has been done,, and that there has been unfair competition. Then the law will assume Che in-, tent. When the case comes before the Court the question will be: Was the competition fair or unfair ? I see no reason why the ordinary course of British law should not be followed, and the persons affected held to be innocent until proved to be guilty. That is to say, the competition should be held to be fair unless the prosecution shows that it is unfair. </para>

We have heard something about the proper reading of clause 5. I ask honorable senators to allow me to alter the wording of that clause slightly, and to see whether we shall be warranted in allowing clause 6 to pass as it stands. In clause 6 it is proposed that the mere, fact of the defendant being a commercial trust is to be proof of unfair competition!. That being so, we can read paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of clause 5 in this way : - </para>

                        <para>- I have already pointed out that this is a principle adopted by certain continental countries, and that it is only of recent years that it has crept into our legislation. As I have said before, as an agreement in itself constitutes a trust under this Bill, it means that there is no one in Australia doing business with firms outside of Australia under agreement who would not be brought within the four corners of the measure. I go further, and say that, as clause 6 stands, we are going to make the act of being a commercial trust <inline font-style="italic">prima facie</inline> evidence of intent to destroy or injure an Australian industry. It is not a question of unfair competition at all. The mere fact of being a commercial trust in itself is sufficient to bring the defendant within the scope of the measure, and that is one of the things which the prosecution would rely upon for the purpose of showing intent. </para>

                        <para>- The Bill says, in clause 6, that one of two things has to be proved. The prosecution can take its choice. It can prove that the defendant is a commercial trust, in which case the prosecution need not bother itself as to whether the competition is detrimental to Australian industry or not. Or it can prove that the competition is detrimental to Australian industry. In all probability the prosecution would take the line of least resistance. It might find considerable difficulty in demonstrating that the defendants knew that their competition was detrimental to Australian industry. The prosecution would, therefore, in all probability, rely upon proof that the defendant was a commercial trust. I venture to say that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> were engaged in a prosecution of this kind he would urge upon the Court that the mere fact that the defendant was a commercial trust, and that the history of trusts showed that they were injurious and were formed for the purpose of extortion from the people, was sufficient to justify the Court in upholding his contention that intent existed. </para>

                        <para>- It would be all circumstantial evidence. If the trusts are as wicked as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> makes them out to be, I decline to believe that they will be parties to elaborate documents, which, on the face of them, will prove that they are trusts which are likely to be detrimental to the public. They would not work in that way ; it would only be by their acts that the prosecution would be able to prove intent. I am afraid, however, that there is not much chance of amending this clause. I draw attention to the fact that whilst a great deal has been said against the argument for striking out the words in question. I have not heard a single argument in favour of retaining them. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> has urged that we should adopt a different course in this connexion than is adopted in reference to regulating the proceedings of individuals. He said that the principle that the Court should hold a person to be innocent unless proved to be guilty has been departed from in some instances. That is, where the persons charged are the only persons possessed of the facts, and clearly that is a case in point. Persons would be engaged in competition. We have to prove undoubtedly that the competition entered into is prejudicial to an Australian industry. Suppose we go no further than a trust which is likely to disorganize and injure a trade. This being a commercial trust, it is assumed that the competition is unfair unless the contrary is proved. That is very much further than the clause goes. But, suppose we go that far ; in such a case, who is in a better position to prove the contrary as to the unfairness of the competition than the persons who have the control and the knowledge of all the factors in connexion with the business? Let us turn for an illustration: to the harvester industry. It is declared that the competition in that industry is unfair, and is, in fact, destroying the Australian harvester trade. Let us assume we have proof to that effect. </para>

                        <para>- We are now dealing with commercial trusts - with institutions which we have a right to assume are baneful until they are proved to be beneficent, or not harmful. The general history of trusts is that they are baneful ; and that supplies a reason for this clause. A trust would be in possession of legal evidence to prove the cost of construction and so forth, and would, therefore, be able to show, if the fact were so, that the price at which it was selling, although much lower than that at which Australian manufacturers could produce, was a fair price, having in view the circumstances of the production. If that proof were forthcoming, then no evil consequences could accrue under the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- I do not; I would take steps to prevent individuals importing, but importers are decent fellows all the same, whereas commercial trusts are combinations for the purpose of securing the control of trade to the detriment of the public generally. There are instances that can be cited where tentatively - and, I venture to say, only tentatively - trusts axe beneficent or unobjectionable for a time ; but the invariable tendency is for trusts, as they acquire strength, to use their power to the prejudice of the general public. It is because we are dealing with a special kind of danger that we have to adopt a special method of procedure. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. We have innumerable instances, and particularly the one I have quoted, of the baneful effects of commercial trusts. The American Harvester Trust is said, with very great justification, to be only a branch of the Standard Oil Trust, the Beef Trust, the Steel Trust - the trust which, under a hundred and one aliases, monopolizes and controls, as far as it can, the trade of the world. In connexion with oil, the trade of the world is absolutely controlled by one of the combines, which, in its early stages, was undoubtedly beneficent. That trust merged all the separate and costly managements under one head, and thereby reduced the cost of production, and was enabled to sell cheaply. But it is notorious that that trust can raise the price whenever it chooses ; and the probability is that, when one of the branches of the trust is working to destroy an industry, it secures the funds to do so by slightly raising the price of some commodity controlled by another branch - public money is used for the destruction of the industry. I have no doubt that in the harvester industry- </para>

                        <para>- Honorable senators are drawing me into what is really a second-reading speech, and my desire is to deal with the clause before us. I have pointed out what I consider to be very strong reasons for throwing the onus of proof on the suspected parties. Under the Bill, the Crown has to prove several important facts ; but in regard to the question on which the defendant must have the fullest possible knowledge, the onus is thrown upon him, as the representative of institutions, which, in the main, have been found to be baneful and dangerous. </para>

                    <para>.- I desire to say a few words in regard to the challenge thrown out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline> Why is it that we are engaged in passing anti-trust legislation? Although this Bill has a long, and, in my opinion, very erroneous title, it is really an antitrust Bill - a Bill to regulate and control trusts. While we all admit that there are beneficent trusts, most of us also admit that the great bulk of trusts are formed on selfish grounds in restraint of trade, with the object of doing away with competition, and raising prices to the detriment of the public, and the enrichment of the few. A case has been made out in America, and in England, and, in a degree, in Australia, for, to some slight extent, placing the trusts on a different footing from individuals. I do not think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> is quite right when he asks, "Why change the onus of proof?" We do not change the onus of proof except in one particular. </para>

I think I spoke practically to the same effect in my second-reading speech. It will have to be proved that a defendant has entered into a contract or combination, and, secondly, that he has entered into that contract with the intention to destroy or injure an Australian industry by means of unfair competition. In proof of the intention, some evidence will have to be given, and, I presume, it will be to show that workers have been dismissed, or that a factory has been closed. </para>

                        <para>- The plaintiff has to prove the intent, but the defendant has to prove, if he can, that the competition is not unfair. Let me give a concrete example. The plaintiff may prove that, in consequence of the competition, a factory has been closed, or that some workmen in another factory have had their wages reduced. It might be said that that was not the result of unfair competition, but was due, perhaps, to better machinery and methods in America or England. At this point, the clause would come into operation, and the defendant would be told that, because he was a trust, which the Bill is intended to control and regulate, no time would be wasted, and that the onus was on him to prove that the competition was not unfair. That is my reading of the clause, and, therefore, I must vote for the retention of paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a.</inline></para>

                        <para>- I ought to have explained before that the agreement to which I referred lapsed about a year ago, and that at the present moment I am interested in no agreement of the description, and, therefore, shall be under no liability under the measure before us. But my knowledge of many similar agreements enables me to afford some information which, if the Committee were inclined to deliberate and judge the question, as it should, from the right standard, might be accepted. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline> like one or two other honorable senators, assumes that nearly all trusts are great and evil trusts. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator overlooks the sweeping interpretation of "commercial trust" in clause 3. That definition is not taken from any other Act in operation elsewhere, but has been manufactured here, and is drawn in such a way as to include every possible form of what are merely commercial agreements. Any agreement of the kind, however innocent, will at once constitute a " commercial trust." For every trust of a great and iniquitous character, there are, I suppose, 100 or 200 trusts which are entirely innocent and beneficent in their operations. </para>

                        <para>- Why should hundreds, or even scores, of people be deemed guilty of unfair practices when, admittedly, they are not guilty of anything of the sort? That is the point which supporters of the clause are carefully and . persistently ignoring. There is no doubt that the clause would be equally as strong without these words, and that innocent and necessary agreements amongst traders would be excluded. </para>

                <para class="block">The object of the amendment is to deal with an illegitimate practice on the part of some trusts and combinations iri paying conditional or preferential rebates, with a view to crush competition, and thus secure as far as possible a complete monopoly ; in other words, to put the public wholly at their mercy. It is one of the most potent weapons which are used by trusts throughout America. In various Acts very strong efforts have been made for the purpose of putting an end to this system of preferential rebates. I am free to admit that it is chiefly injurious in connexion with matters of transport, which, fortunately in Australia are under the control of the States. According to the first memorandum on Anti-Trust Legislation, there is a special effort made in the Elkin Act to deal with the subject of rebates. It says -  </para>

                    <para>This Act is supplemental to the Commerce Act with respect to the publicity of tariff rates and charges, and also declares" rebates, drawbacks, and unjust discrimination unlawful; increases the powers of the Inter-State Commerce Com- 1 mission in regard to the institution of proceeding or obtaining evidence as well against carriers for the practice of unjust discrimination as against all persons receiving rebates, and extends the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts in cases brought to inforce criminal proceedings by declaring that violations of the Commerce Act or the Elkin Act may be prosecuted "within the district in which such violation was committed, or through which the transportation may have been conducted." </para>
                    <para>Summarizing briefly the provisions of the sections of the Act separately, section x provides that default on part of corporation common carrier, which, if made by officer thereof, would constitute a misdemeanour, shall be deemed a misdemeanour committed by the corporation, and punishable accordingly by pecuniary penalties, making in express terms the carrier corporation liable, as well as its officials and agents; that the wilful failure of any carrier to publish tariff rates or to observe legally fixed tariff rates until changed by law is a misdemeanour, punishable by heavy pecuniary penalties, it being declared unlawful for any person or corporation to offer, grant, give, or to solicit, accept, or receive any rebate, concession, or discrimination in respect to the transportation of any property in Inter-State or foreign commerce. </para>

                <para class="block">Although it is made chiefly the subject of legislation, so far as transportation is concerned, yet the very same principle is involved in trading operations within Australia. It is all very well for some persons to say that the effect is that the consumer is now getting, I will say, his oil very cheaply. But the fact remains that, if by this system of rebates which we know is largely practised, a monopoly could be secured, the public would be placed at the mercy of the Standard Oil Trust. Obviously it is a mere sprat to catch a mackarel. The Standard Oil Trust is, perhaps, more a culprit than are others. It seems to trade in various countries under different names. In Victoria, for instance, it trades under the name of the Colonial Oil Company, which, I may add, controls the White Rose brand of kerosene. There is another company formed for the purpose of dealing in lubricating oils, and by means of these devious methods, carried on in this octopus-like fashion, a very large proportion of the Australian trade in oil is secured to the Standard Oil Trust. The system which is practised can be best illustrated, perhaps, by quoting one or two papers which have been issued by the Colonial Oil Company. It supplies the oil to the wholesale merchant, to whom a rebate of1d. per gallon is allowed, and an additional rebate of½d. per gallon is allowed to the retailer, conditionally upon the Colonial Oil Company getting the whole of his trade. </para>

If a shopkeeper were asked for that brand, and were unable to supply it, naturally the customer would be driven to the shopkeeper who did deal in that brand alone.

                    <para>We are quite unable to prevent retailers cutting our price of "White Rose" kerosene, although it is always a mystery to us why retailers do not sell "White Rose" kerosene, so as to give them a reasonable profit. People must have "White Rose" kerosene, and it requires no selling; it is well-known everywhere. We quite appreciate that you have to do the same in self-defence, and only wish we could get all the retailers to sell "White Rose" kerosene at a reasonable figure. </para>

                <para>The fact is shown there that if the shopkeeper attempts to sell- any but White Rose kerosene he is not allowed the privilege of the Jd. rebate. I have reason to think, from investigation which I have made, and from information supplied to me, that this practice is injuring to a serious, if not an alarming, extent, a very excellent industry that has been established in our own. midst by the British Imperial Oil Company. This company imports in bulk, and has done so for some little time past. In extending its factories, and laying down bulky installations, it has spent something like £100,000. It pays in. wages in Australia about £25,000 per annum. But the company finds that it is quite impossible to compete against the Standard Oil Company with, any degree of satisfaction to itself or its workmen if these illegitimate methods of trade to which I have referred are practised. </para>

                    <para>. - It will be within the memory of the Committee that, in .the course of the second-reading debate, I drew attention to the rebate system which obtains in regard to our Inter-State shipping. I have an amendment in print dealing with the matter, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best's</inline> is much' more comprehensive than mine, and if his is carried I shall not proceed with that of which I have given notice. During the debate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> quoted at great length the freight rates that prevailed amongst the Inter-State shipping on the Australian coast. When I spoke I complained more against the rebate system than against the freights. As a matter of fact, the freights are high. They are higher for carrying cargo from Melbourne to Fremantle than for carrying cargo from Melbourne to London. But no doubt the freights from Melbourne to Fremantle are high because the vessels do not get very much back-loading from the West. </para>

                        <para>- I quite agree that there is a great deal in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie's</inline> contention that sea freights are less for similar distances than coastal freights, because the vessels doing ocean trade can get cargoes at both ends. But, notwithstanding that fault can be found with the freights that obtain on the Australian coast. A good case could be made out against them; but my contention is especially against the system that obtains. That system is unfair both to shippers and purchasers, and it is also unfair to other ship-owners who have hitherto enjoyed a share of the trade. </para>

                        <para>- The amendment of which I have given notice has regard to rebates. The rebate system, as has been pointed out by some of the witnesses before the Navigation Commission, has in some cases increased freight rates by 30 per cent. One of the witnesses actually said that the rebate system was just like a pistol held at the heads of the merchants. In my speech on the second reading, I quoted from the evidence of merchants and ship-owners to show that they were crushed out of the trade of Australia, more particularly on the Western Australian coast, by the rebate system. I should like to read to the Committee the finding of the Navigation Commission on the question of rebates. I think that even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> ought to be convinced when he remembers that he put his name to the report. </para>

                    <para>Upon the point that the limitation of the coastal trade io vessels complying with Australian conditions would result in a monopoly, a considerable amount of evidence was received. It was freely stated that a combine does already exist, by which the rates for passengers and cargo carried by the companies in the Steam-ship Owners' Federation are regulated. Its extent may be gauged from the fact that out of about 188,000 tons engaged in Inter-State traffic, less than 10,000 are outside the ring. It would appear that the combine has been in operation for some time, and complaints of a very strong and emphatic character were received as to its methods. lt seems to bc the practice to make rebates to shippers who deal exclusively with the members of the Federation. The extent and the manner in which this practice operates is set forth by the witnesses, Messrs. Alexander, Mcpherson, McLennan, and others. The witness, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLennan,</inline> occupies an exceptional position. He is the present representative of the chief shipowners outside the Federation, yet whilst director of one of the companies within the Federation, he assisted to draft the rebate scheme. It may be taken for ."ranted, therefore, that his information is reliable, and, in the main, it was not contradicted by' <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Grayson,</inline> secretary of the Federation. </para>

                        The method pursued in connexion with the granting of rebates would appear to be open to some criticism. An undertaking has to be given that the shipper, neither by himself nor through his agent, will send or receive any goods other than by the vessels of the Federation. According to the evidence of Messrs. McLennan,. Alexander, Mcpherson, and others, this is rigidly enforced, any departure from the agreement involving the forfeiture of the whole of the rebates on the year's transactions.
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mcpherson</inline>
                        gave an instance of how this worked out in his own case : - £,'In 1903. when I had 300 tons of iron to ship to Fremantle, I went to the shipping people to learn the rate of freight. They held a meeting, and then they gave me a quotation. They said - ' You will have to pay 18s. a ton now, but in twelve months' time, if you confine all your shipments to the ports of the north and the west to the companies within the ring, we will grant you a rebate of 20 per cent.' In other words, I had to leave with them a hostage of 3s. 6d. a ton on the 300 tons, and let it stay in their hands for twelve months. Had I not agreed to confine all mv shipments to the association, I should have had to charge 18s. a ton for the freight of the iron, and probably I should have lost the business."

                    <para class="block">That the transactions of the combine in this connexion are very large, may be judged from the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLennan</inline> that " There must be in the hands of the Associated Steamship Companies at the present time about£60,000 of these accrued bonuses which they pay out to the shippers; it cannot be less."

                    <para>. - I can hardly allow the occasion to pass without expressing my sense of pleasure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> is at last convinced that the Bill is open to improvement. With the amendment, and with the author of the amendment, so far as he intends it to go, I am entirely in agreement. But I ask whether the proposed new paragraph may not injuriously affect a class of cases with which, I am sure, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> does not desire to interfere. During the debate on the second reading I referred to a contract which had just been entered into in one of the dairying districts of New South Wales, by which an individual had undertaken to establish a dairying factory conditionally on the dairy-farmers insuring him the whole of their trade for a given term. That could in no sense be regarded as an injurious undertaking; because it was the only possible way the dairy-farmers there had of getting a capitalist to establish a factory. </para>

                        <para>- The industry was not localized, because the agreement covered the export of the butter manufactured at the projected factory. I mention this case because I am quite certain no honorable senator would desire to bring an arrangement of so innocent and beneficial a character within the compass of this legislation. It appears to me, however, that there is a possibility of this class of cases being brought within the suggested new paragraph. </para>

                <para class="block">Australian industry ; the only reference is to restraint of trade. I do not think there can be the slightest doubt that the class of cases I have cited could be shown, technically at least, to come within clause 4. Under the proposed new paragraph we are asked to go a little, further ; and I am entirely in favour of the spirit of the amendment so far as it applies to the injurious contracts or arrangements referred to. I do not propose at this stage to call for a division on the amendment, because, as I say, I am in favour of its general spirit, but I ask the Government, if they have not already done so, to obtain the advice of the Attorney-General as to whether,±he class of cases I have mentioned - which, I am sure, the Government do not desire to interfere with - would be brought within the penal provisions of the clause. If that be so, I ask the Government, after consultation with the Attorney-General, to consider whether some addition cannot be made so as to exempt innocent and beneficial agreements of the kind. </para>

I ask the honorable senator whether that is not a fact. The. honorable senator is silent, and silence gives consent ; and yet the honorable senator has misrepresented me in this- connexion. I signed that report, as the minutes will show, on the condition that only those shipping companies which complied with Australian labour conditions should ha.ve the right to trade on the coast. </para>

If we abolish rebates we shall have coolies, lascars, Germans, Frenchmen, and others competing for the trade of Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, who is opposing this Bill, is, I believe, one- of the strongest advocates amongst us for a white Australia.

It has been stated that the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company gives no rebates, and the fare from' Sydney to London, a distance of 12,485 miles, by one of their vessels- </para>

                        <para>- No; but I am prepared to show that passengers travel at less per mile on the Australian coast than in any other part of the globe. <inline font-style="italic">Rhodes' Steam-ship Guide,</inline> which deals with the whole world, gives the fares between port and port, and I defy any one to find an error therein. From Sydney3 to London, a distance of 12,485 miles, the fare runs from £65 to £75, but the minimum fare of £65 works out at r.25d. per mile. From Sydney to Colombo, a distance of 5,300 miles, the fare is £32, or at the rate of i-45d. per mile. From Sydney to Vancouver, a distance of 7.067 miles, the fare is £40, or at the rate of i-36d. per mile. From Sydney to San Francisco, a distance of 7,211 miles, the fare is £40;, or at the rate of. 1.33d. per mile. From Sydney to Hong Kong, where the boats are manned with cheap labour at 15s. 4d. a month, as against £8 ios per month on the Australian coast, the fare is £33, or at the rate of i.7id. per mile. From Sydney to Capetown, a distance of 6.349 miles, where the lowest form of white labour that is procurable in Europe, is employed, the fare is £31 10s., or" at the rate of i.igd. per mile. This is truly free-trade in carrying, where the owners, as in -the case of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam-ship Company, have the right to employ lascars and coolies at 15s. 4d. per month, or 6d. per day. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie wants that company to come into competition with Australians, who, if they live in Sydney or Melbourne, 'have to pay from ios. to 15s. per week for rent. And yet its seamen really do not receive sufficient pay to enable them to pay rent, and if they have wives and families, keep them in India, where they can live on an anna per day. Yet this honorable senator has the courage to stand here and say that he is in favour of encouraging Australian industries ! </para>

                        <para>- So do the States railways. Suppose that we pass a provision to the effect that no rebates shall be allowed under any circumstances. How would it affect the rights of the States? A football or cricket team which is selected to take part in an Inter-State match is allowed a rebate by the Railways Commissioners. It will, therefore, be seen that a provision against the grant of rebates would interfere with the business of the States railways. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> knows as well as I do that in South Australia the Commissioner for Railways carries wool from Morgan to Adelaide at a considerably cheaper rate than for a similar distance in any other part of the State. </para>

                        <para>- If, as the Minister says, the States do not come within the purview of the Bill, I am prepared to bow to his superior wisdom. Having given the passenger rates per mile outside Australian waters, I propose now to mention the passenger rates which are charged on our coast. From Sydney to Fremantle, a distance of 2,450 miles, the fare is £10, or at the rate of.98d. per mile, which is cheaper than any rate I have quoted, the lowest being that from Sydney to Capetown, namely,1.19d. per mile. From Melbourne to Brisbane, a distance of 1,080 miles, the fare is , £4 10s., or at the rate of 1d. per mile. </para>

                        <para>- An English parliamentary train does not supply either sleeping accommodation or food, but when travelling from Melbourne to Brisbane, a passenger is well-housed, and is fed like a fighting cock. From Sydney to Hobart, a distance of 628 miles, the fare is £2 10s., or at the rate of . 95d. per mile. <inline font-style="italic">Rhodes' Steam-ship</inline><inline font-style="italic">Guide,</inline> which is absolutely independent and unbiased, deals with the principal steamship lines in the world, and is as high an authority as is <inline font-style="italic">Cook's Tourist Guide.</inline> I take these guides as being absolutely correct. The fares on the Australian coast in no case amount to over1d. per mile. The fares outside of Australia, where the ship-owners have the advantage of cheaper labour, are over a 1d. per mile. Is there, then, any necessity for passing special legislation to restrict our ship-owners? I have now proved that both fares land freights are lower on the Australian coast than on the English coast. I am prepared to go further, and to prove that they are lower than on any coast in the world. There is no necessity for either <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie's amendment, so far as the Australian coastal trade is concerned. It has been said that there is no competition. I say that there is competition; but God help the Australian seaman who has to sign on a ship running in competition with a Federation ship ! He gets nothing like the wages that are paid by the federated companies, and he is absolutely starved. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie instanced a Western Australian ship-owner - Bateman - who never paid the standard rate of wages in his life. Yet the honorable senator stands up in his place in the Senate, and advocates the cause of Bateman ! </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best's</inline> amendment deals with the question of services which are the subject of competition. We are in this unhappy position on the Australian coast : We have ships trading with our ports which are employing labour at such rates that the men could not live on them in Australia. They would not be sufficient to pay his rent or to cover the cost of the bare necessaries of life. Let me point to the case of a ship which arrived in Queenscliff a little while ago. The crew was absolutely starved on the voyage from Molinda, in Peru, to Queenscliff. They declined to go any further in the vessel. The magistrates decided that they were justified in refusing to go an inch further, first, because they had been starved; secondly because their lives had been endangered from the fact that no lights were exhibited during the voyage, owing to the want of oil; thirdly, because no fog-horns were in use, and fourthly, because the lifeboat which was supposed to be available for the men in case of collision or running aground was in such a condition that paint, when put inside, ran through on to the outside. </para>

I hold that under this Bill that is an agreement into which the State of South Australia has entered with private individuals. But the Railways Commissioners of South Australia have gone further, and entered into a combination for the purpose of pooling all wharfage, and dividing it at the end of the year. I ask you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> in deciding this point of order, to take that fact into consideration. I could point to fifty instances of a similar nature. I shall put the case still more strongly. In Victoria, so far as wharfage is concerned, there is a protective duty. Goods arriving from ports outside Victoria are charged a wharfage fee of 5s. per ton, while goods produced in that State are passed over the wharfs absolutely free. I ask the representatives of Victoria if they will deny that that is a protective duty against other States </para>

                        <para>- No; but I was leading up to an amendment when the Chairman of Committees ruled me out of order because of a reference I had made to States railways. The States not only control railways, but also a great many other public services. In New South Wales, for instance, the State controls the tramways. Is this Bill to provide that the Parliament of that State shall not have the right to control the railways by, for instance, fixing the fares, or, if necessary, the freights? I contend that it would be a very bad move indeed on the part of this Parliament to enact such a provision. I could mention other States which control such services as tramways. </para>

                <para class="block">Victoria, the Railways Commissioners issue railway tickets from Melbourne to Sydney - that is to say, for a journey through two States. Would the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> apply to them? I think it would. The question to which I was more particularly directing my_ attention when the interruption occurred was whether, when a deep-sea ship arrived at a port in which there was a combination which comprised either the Railways Commissioners or the Harbor Trust, and which arbitrarily fixed the charge for landing goods on the wharf, the Bill would relate to such services. It must be borne in mind that these services are in some cases rendered by private individuals, and in other cases, as in Victoria, by the State. I declare emphatically that it is an absolute breach of the Constitution for a State to levy differential wharfage charges. </para>

When clause 6 of the Bill was under discussion, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> moved an amendment, which was perfectly in order, dealing with corporations and trusts and persons. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> argued at length whether the practices of the States Railways Commissioners came within the scope of the amendment. He proceeded to refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bent</inline> as a corporation, and to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tait,</inline> the Chairman of the Victorian Railways Commissioners, as a corporation in a lesser degree. He stated that these persons had granted rebates to persons sending goods between Echuca and Melbourne.

                        <para>- The question at issue presents itself to my mind as being one of some moment. The Bill, as you are aware, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> deals with combinations in restraint of trade. We were discussing in Committee an amendment, the object of which was to make the payment of rebates illegal. Certain States railways - those in my own State, for instance - grant rebates. I submit that it is competent, in view of the purpose of the amendment under discussion, to debate the question whether the clause and the amendment do refer to States railways or not ; if they do, whether it is constitutional or proper that they should do so ; and if they do not, whether it is desirable that they should. In view of the fact that we have before us in Committee an amendment dealing with rebates, and that there are States railways which pay rebates, it seems to me to be competent for honorable senators to argue how far the clause and the amendment cover the practice of States railways that grant rebates, and what legislation ought to arise out of that practice. </para>

Certain offences are created by clauses 4 and 5 of the Bill. The measure goes on to say that if a contract is entered into, or a combination continues to exist, with intent to injure or destroy certain industries, or to compete with them unfairly, an offence is committed. This Bill can only refer either to a person, a foreign corporation, or a trading or financial corporation. The sole question is whether </para>

                    had a right to discuss States railways. I submit that he had no such right. First of all, States railways cannot possibly be comprehended within the limits of the Bill. In order to bind the Crown it is necessary that the Crown should be specifically mentioned. Consequently,, if the States railways are in the names of the States, the Crown must be specially mentioned, in order that they may be affected. It may be said that the railways in some of the States have been handed over to Commissioners. But the Bill cannot apply to Commissioners of Railways. The Constitution gives us power to make laws with reference to foreign corporations, and trading and financial corporations formed within the Commonwealth. That is all that this Bill seeks to do. The Railways Commissioners of the States have their existence by virtue of Statutes constituting them corporations. But that class of corporation does not come under this Bill at all, because it is not a foreign corporation, nor a trading or financial corporation formed within the 'Commonwealth.

                        <para>- Of course. I rose to remind you that in consequence of your ruling, the question then at issue, which was analogous to the present question, was discussed at great length. You know, of course, that I am referring to the inclusion of States servants under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. I then agreed with you that it would be inadvisable for you to rule on a constitutional point, and that, as long as the debate did not traverse the Standing Orders, it should be allowed to go on. The question now before the Chair is exactly that which then had to be decided. </para>

                        <para>- Perhaps I am wrong, but the position, as it appears to me, is this. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> was discussing the possibility, or otherwise, of including certain States services within the scope of this Bill. Whether he was using that as an illustration or not is not much to the point. He was discussing the advantage or disadvantage of using this Bill to control such services. When we were dealing with the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, we discussed the applicability of that measure to States services, and whether it was desirable or not to include them. You were asked whether such a point should be discussed, and your ruling was that it was purely a constitutional matter, that it did not, in your opinion, contravene the Standing Orders, and that you were bound to allow the debate to continue. I have quoted from memory, but I think I have correctly stated your ruling on that occasion. If so, I ask you. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> to reconsider the matter before you rule on this point. </para>

In order to have objected to the discussion which then took place, you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> would have been called upon to object to a clause which was in the Bill - an impossible position. As to the constitutional point which has been raised, I direct honorable senators' attention to section 102 of the Constitution, which provides the only way in which we can deal with States railways, so far as rebates are concerned. </para>

                        <para>- Who cannot possibly be a State, because clauses 4 and 5 deal only with persons or trading corporations. The question which I have to consider is whether in this Bill, as referred to the Committee, amendments can be introduced dealing with States railways or with States services. I do not think that such amendments can be introduced. Altogether apart from the question whether the Senate has power to deal with States railways, or with States wharfs, or any States services solely within a State, the other question raised is : Can the Committee in this Bill make amendments so extending the Bill as to bring within its scope the States as to their railway services? It is evident' that we cannot send a State to gaol <inline font-style="italic">j</inline> and I believe that one of the penalties under this Bill is a fine of .£500 or imprisonment for six months. I entirely agree with the ruling of the Chairman of Committees. As to the Arbitration and Conciliation Bill, that raised quite a different question. So far as I" recollect - and I only speak from recollection - when that Bill went into Committee it contained a clause which mentioned the States ; and whether that clause could be discussed and amended was quite a different question from that now raised. I think that the Chairman of Committees is right in his ruling. </para>

                    <para>.- I am exceedingly pleased that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> has introduced this amendment. I had contemplated submitting an amendment of the kind, but the proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> covers the ground. The Bill would be exceedingly incomplete, and our powers would be far too limited to effectively protect the public if some provision of this nature were not included. In submitting the amendment <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> gave us an illustration at length of the evils which might accrue to the community, and the hardships which might be inflicted on rival traders by, a foreign company or trust having power to give these obnoxious rebates. I wish to quote a case in which a corporation carrying on business in Australia, and largely composed of- Australian people, with its office and centre within the Commonwealth, may also exercise a pernicious influence on every trader in the same line of business, and on the public interest generally. I allude to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company Limited, who, ever since 1896, have had&gt; a system of rebates on condition that their customers enter into an agreement to deal only with them. I am specially interested in trying to obtain for people engaged in the business of growing, manufacturing, and distributing sugar that fair measure of justice to which they are entitled, and which it should be our business to see they get. I have here a copy of an actual agreement which every customer of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company is compelled to sign in order to get the rebate. This agreement, which was entered into bv an Adelaide firm, is in the form of a letter which the company dictate, and get their customers to sign. It is as follows : - </para>

                <para class="block">The company are prepared and willing to give a 'bonus of 10s. on every ton of sugar purchased by the customer direct or through! the wholesale agents, provided as I said before, that for the term mentioned, or until three months notice has been given the customer shall purchase only from the company. It is by such methods that this company has built up the huge monopoly it at present enjoys. An examination of* the Customs returns willi show that the company refines and distributes 81 per cent, of the total sugar consumed in Australia, while the other two refiners, who are in a small way, have to be content with the remaining 19 per cent. It is by this pernicious system that the company is enabled to occupy its present strong position. In the case of a trader who passes through his hands 3,000 tons of sugar per annum - mci that is not an enormous quantity - a bonus of 10s. per ton represents £1,500, and if that trader buys sugar from any other manufacturer, he loses the whole of that money. That means that the company actually gives a bribe of £1,500 to that customer to boycott every other manufacturer in the same line of business. It is worse than plain highway robbery. Those interested in the Colonial Sugar Refining Company pose as pillars of the Church, and as men of the highest business standing and integrity. A mere recital of the facts is enough to make an honest man more indignant than he would be with a highwayman, because the latter does risk his neck, whereas the shareholders of the company risk nothing, while they thus rob the traders and the public. Let me show honorable .senators how this beneficent company deals with the grower. In the far north of Queensland in the last sugar season there were two mills exactly similarly circumstanced. They stood within a few miles of each other, and the cane was grown on either side of one dividing fence. One was a co-operative mill, while the other was owned by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and mark the result. The proprietary mill, for cane delivered at the mill, gave the grower the large sum 01 13s. 7d. per ton, while the co-operative mill, after paying interest and redemption on the money borrowed from the Government for the building of their premises, and providing for depreciation and other charges, paid the 'grower 20s. 6d., a difference of 7s., all but id. But that does not disclose the whole position. It must be remembered that, owing to the monopoly the company was the buyer of the raw material from the central mill, and secured the most profitable portion of the manufacture of the sugar produced by that mill. What do the people of Australia owe to this corporation which treats the actual growers in such a shameful manner ? What does the country owe to a corporation which bribes the merchants and traders to boycott other manufacturers and distributors ? What this Parliament owes to the people of Australia is to protect them from the rapacious instincts of this predatory company. </para>

                    <para>__ The Government intend to accept this amendment in regard to rebates. I do not wish to discuss the question at any length, because it has already been fully debated. I have always considered rebates unfair under almost every circumstance that can be imagined. A rebate is given for the purpose of gaining a benefit somewhere; it is never given without the expectation of obtaining an advantage over a trade rival, or for some similar reason. In the oil trade the rebate is given for the purpose of securing the trade of certain people, who are not allowed to deal with any but the trust. It is a vicious principle, which is only acted upon in order, as I say, te reap some advantage or another over fellow traders. In Adelaide, a short time ago, a coupon company started operations, and supplied the coupons to grocers, who agreed to give them to their customers in proportion to the goods purchased. These coupons were subsequently exchanged for certain articles or presents. </para>

Defence is in order? This amendment relates to rebates granted to persons who deal exclusively with those who grant the rebates. Under the coupon system the coupons are not given to persons who deal exclusively with the givers of the coupons - they are a species of small cash discount, and there is no undertaking on the part of the recipient; that they will deal only with the persons from! whom they receive them. I submit that the clause in no sense covers that class of transaction. </para>

                    <para>. - It is all very well for the Minister to use wild phrases, such as " rebates are vicious," but if he were better acquainted with the subject, or, at any rate, if he were to think more carefully before he spoke, he would hesitate before he said straight away that a rebate is a vicious thing. One of the most ordinary forms of rebate is that which is given by, a tradesman to a large customer. In commercial life nothing is commoner than for a tradesman to say to a customer, " If you send me 100 tons, I shall give you a rebate." </para>

                        <para>- No; the carrier will say, " Then I will give you a rebate," and the term is properly used there. In Australia, there is no system more universal than that of giving a rebate in consideration of the quantity of goods offered. It is absurd for the Minister to talk about that sort of thing being vicious. To so stigmatize that form of commercial transaction is ridiculous. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, because the man is taking a large quantity. Is a rebate vicious because a man takes a quantity? The amendment provides that if the defendant offers any rebate, refund, discount, or reward upon the condition that the person deals with the defendant to the exclusion of other persons dealing in similar goods or services, it shall be an offence under the Act. Does the Minister consider that the provision would apply to the case of a contract being entered into for a term of years in consideration of getting a rebate? Suppose, for instance, that a trader were to agree with a customer that, if the latter would enter into a five years' contract, he would grant him a rebate on his ordinary terms. Does he intend the Committee to pass a provision which would affect such a transaction? I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> to say whether it would apply to a case of that kind ? </para>

                        <para>- The Minister will agree with me, I think, that that is a normal form of contract. Does lie think that in commercial life it is a bad thing to give a contract for five years on one side, and to give , a rebate on the other, in consideration of getting the contract ? Is that the sort of thing that we wish to put down? Any number of traders or carriers have a fixed tariff or rate. It is quite possible for such a carrier or trader to offer a rebate to a customer in all <inline font-style="italic">bonâ fides.</inline></para>

                        <para>- It depends upon what the honorable senator calls a rebate. If a carrier quoted one rate for a 50-ton lot and another rate for a 100-ton lot, would he call that a rebate? </para>

                        <para>- It would come under the head of either a rebate or a refund, or a discount. And the consideration would be the getting of a contract for a period of years, during which, undoubtedly, any other person would be excluded from dealing with that customer. If this paragraph were enacted, it would make a tremendous inroad upon ordinary methods of trade. I cannot believe that many honorable senators think that such a departure would be desirable at the present time, or that a custom which is found in every trading community is necessarily bad. I ask honorable senators whether it is a bad thing for a man to be prevented from giving a refund because he gets a five years' contract ? </para>

I can quite conceive that it might be held by some persons to be unfair as against all others engaged in that industry or trade. But we ought to hesitate before we pass a provision of this character without giving full consideration to the wide-spread effect it might have on trade and commerce. Surely, in passing a Bill which is called an Australian Indus tries Preservation Bill, we do not want to harass and impede honest trade? </para>

I do not think it is dishonest ; but I see very great danger in passing a provision which, says that that is wrong. I ask the Minister not to agree to the amendment straight away. I agree with him in regard to many of the evil practices which have been carried on under the name of rebates. I do not for a moment defend any malpractices, but I wish to avoid the error of punishing the innocent when we are chasing the guilty. I think that the Minister would be well advised if, before agreeing to the amendment, he would take advice on the point which I have raised, and possibly on other points which may be suggested. Surely he does not want to do an injustice to honest traders ! He has stated that, in his opinion, the case I cited would come under the amendment. I believe he recognises with me that such a case would carry with it no dishonesty. </para>

If, however, it is bad, I ask the Minister to say whether, in the instance I gave, it is harmful or wrong? </para>

                        <para>- Yes. What the amendment is seeking to do is to prevent the granting of rebates, which, in their nature, are injurious. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> has cited the case of the Standard Oil Company, while <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has mentioned the case of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. It would be possible, I am sure, for other honorable senators to mention trusts operating in the Commonwealth, or likely to be formed therein, which would come within the scope of the Act. Therefore, it seems to me that the lengthy remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> dealt with only one phase of a very big question. I am entirely with that honorable senator in a great deal of what he said, both this evening and' a few days am, when he was discussing the question of the operations of the alleged shipping trust in Australia. I believe it can be proved beyond the shadow of a doubt that the figures he quoted as to the freights and fares charged by Australian companies in comparison with those charged by other companies are correct. </para>

If. it does apply to the alleged shipping trust, and it can be proved that it is not doing anything in restraint of trade or injurious to the people of Australia, still that does not relieve us of 'the responsibility to consider other things which the Bill seeks to cover. It has been contended this afternoon that there are other trusts or combinations which it seeks to cover. Both this afternoon and the other- day, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> spoke as if the Bill were intended to deal with only the alleged shipping) trust. </para>

They can get redress in another direction; and the proper measure in which to give it to them is the Navigation Bill. If we reject <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best's</inline> amendment purely on the ground that it will act unfairly to the Australian shipping companies we should put ourselves in an absurd position. This Bill does not deal with shipping only. It deals with combines generally. </para>

                    <para>. - In discussing a matter of this kind we should take to heart the lessons to be derived from other countries. The Standard Oil Company of America actually obtained its strength from the fact that it was able to play off one railway company against another by the clever way in. which it manipulated' rebates. The same thing might possibly happen here. Although the amendment might apply to the shipping ring, there are many other directions in which the rebate system may unfairly operate. I do not think that the remark of the Minister of Defence to the effect that the rebate system is vicious was a bit too strong. I have already read the opinions of witnesses before the Navigation Commission, who referred to the rebate system in even stronger terms. Some spoke of it as being pernicious, others as being a menace to Australian trade, and others as a means of coercing the merchants of Australia. These are statements sworn to by trustworthy witnesses. We have also to bear in mind that there are rebates and rebates. If a rebate is given by way of discount there is not much harm in it. But when rebates are held in hand for twelve months, and in some instances 2½ years, there is a great difference between them and harmless discounts. It is the manner in which they are manipulated that makes their effect harmful. The rebate system has been condemned by the Navigation Commission. Had it not been that, as a member of that Commission I formed strong opinions on this subject, I should not have spoken at such length this afternoon:. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> put his name to the report of that Commission, he indorsed that part of it which deals with rebates. </para>

                        <para>- - The InterState companies monopolize the Inter- State trade. Seeing that they have the whole of that trade to themselves, and that the fares charged by the ocean-going steamers are at least 20 or 25 per cent, higher than the Inter-State vessels charge, there can be no unfair competition between them in those respects. The only way in which the competition of the oversea ships can be said to be unfair is in respect to the pay of the seamen ; but, inasmuch as they do not compete for the Inter-State cargo trade, there is no need for us to take that factor into consideration. </para>

He referred to the accommodation provided, to the disadvantage of the deep-sea vessels. Any one who has travelled by the deep-sea boats will agree with me that neither in speed, accommodation for passengers, nor in any other way, can the Inter-State boats be compared with them. I have a great respect for the manner in which Inter- State companies have in recent years improved their services. But there was' great room for improvement, and they still have many things to make better before they can be said to be equal to the deep-sea lines. I regard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best's</inline> amendment as an absolute necessity. If there is to be anything like fair competition- and that is one of the objects of the Bill - it is necessary, that there should be a provision in the Bill to put an end to the vicious system of rebates. </para>

                        <para>- I shall endeavour to conform to your ruling, sir. I do not think that during the whole debate I have even mentioned the competition to which Australian seamen are subjected. I mentioned the competition1 among the shipowners, but never since I have had the honour of a seat in this chamber, have I referred to the competition which the sea- men have to fight against. I propose, however, to do so now, with the permission of the Chairman. Unless an industry can pay it cannot remunerate the workmen. At present the seamen have to face the competition of the whole world. What is the dumping of American harvesters compared with the dumping of foreign labour on the coast of Australia ? If we abolished the rebates to-morrow we should have the cheapest labour in the world on our coast. </para>

Yet that honorable senator advocates the abolition of rebates, and has absolutely misrepresented me in regard to the signing of the report of the Navigation Commission.

                        <para>- I withdraw every word I have said. My opinion is that if the rebate system be withdrawn, it will have the .effect of introducing cheap coloured labour on the Australian coast. After all, a ship is a factory, used for the purpose of enhancing the value of goods by their transport; and the introduction of coloured labour would be an absolute menace to a place like Australia. </para>

What is intended is that the Court shall have regard to the efficiency of the management, and so forth, being equal and up-to-date ; but the sub-clause is open to the construction that if one factory is inefficient and out-of-date, the competition of an efficient and up-to-date factory shall be regarded as unfair. With a view to more clearly expressing the intention of the clause, I move - </para>
