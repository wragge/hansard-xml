                        <para>- Has the Minister of Defence read the newspaper account of last night&#39;s proceedings in the South Australian Parliament ? When the Premier of the State was asked if he would introduce a Bill assenting to the survey of the proposed line from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta, seeing that the Federal Senate had virtually agreed to it, he replied that he proposed to do so, subject to the conditions already named in regard to. the mute. Does the Minister understand that the South Australian Government reserve the right to approve or reject the route determined upon ; and, if so, is he, in spite of that fact, going on with the Bill ? </para>

                        <para>- Of course, I shall go on with the Bill. The statement referred to makes no difference at all. I have not yet had time to read this morning&#39;s newspapers, but I have no doubt that the honorable senator has correctly represented the substance of the parliamentary report. The remarks attributed to the Premier are exactly in accord with those expressed bv him in a written communication to the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth. South Australia is quite willing to allow a survey to be made, but is determined to have a voice in the selection of the route of the line before consenting to its construction. </para>

                        <para>- I read a statement of that kind, about six months ago, but have taken no notice of it. I am not aware whether there is any truth in it ; but, if true, it affects us to only a limited extent. The military authorities know nothing about the matter. If I took notice of every newspaper paragraph, I should not have time to do anything else. </para>

                    <para>- In reference to the call of the Senate, which took place yesterday, three senators did not answer to their names when they were called. One senator was absent on leave ; the other two attended in their places during the day and&#39; made explanations which appeared to me to be satisfactory. Therefore, I do not think that any action should be taken. </para>

                        (Tasmania) &#91;10.45}. - So far, I have taken no part in the debate on the Bill, and I do not propose now to speak at any length, notwithstanding the hints which have appeared in one or two quarters. There are some points which I think have not been dealt with very fully. As a representative of Tasmania, which I believe is almost unanimously opposed to the measure, I feel that I should not be doing my duty if I did not oppose its passage and offer a few remarks on the mode in which it has been brought forward to the displacement of public business important to the whole Commonwealth, and not to a part thereof. In the first place, I desire to deal with some points which I think are sufficient to justify a very strong opposition being offered to the motion. With me, it is not a question of whether this railway should be constructed or not, or whether we should practically commit ourselves to its construction by voting for a survey, but whether the Commonwealth should be directly or indirectly saddled with the responsibility of the work. At some time sooner or later, there is not the slightest doubt that a connexion between the great State of Western Australia and the eastern States will become a necessity. Whether that will be accomplished by means of an ordinary coast line such as is now proposed or by what a good many persons would like to see - a transcontinental line which&#39; would tap the heart of the country and open up practically a new State for colonization and settlement - I cannot say.

                            <para>- I am not going to quarrel with the representatives of Western Australia, because undoubtedly, they feel that they are only doing their duty in advocating this proposal. On the other hand, I feel that it is my duty to oppose it in every constitutional way, because I think that honorable senators hardly, appreciate the position in which it is proposed to place the Commonwealth. Over and over again Ave have heard honorable senators carefully make the reservation that they are only voting for a survey, but they&#34;: forget one very important feature. What is the flimsy claim put up now by Western Australia for the construction of the railway bv the Commonwealth? It is the shadowy pretence that some public men - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon, Mr. Deakin,</inline> and a few others - went to Western Australia, and said that this line- ought to be constructed. It is sought to fasten upon the Commonwealth an obligation, because of the sayings of men who were irresponsible at that time. If that demand is set up at the present time, because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> and others, who had no responsibility in years gone by, went to Western Australia, and, no doubt with the best of intentions in advocating the cause of Federation, promised that so far as they could help Western Australia to get this railway connected they would, what will be claimed next session if bv passing; an Act of this Parliament we should acknowledge a responsibility? Can we vote the money for a survey and afterwards repudiate the responsibility that we thereby took upon ourselves ? Presently eighteen senators will have to appeal to their constituents, and perhaps some of those who have so carefully guarded themselves against approving of the construction of the railway may not come. back. Then what becomes of their safeguards? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker,</inline> who is one of them, told us that he was only voting for the survey of the line, and not committing himself n n \ further. So far as the honorable senator is concerned, that may be perfectly right but his action with that of other senators may impose a corporate responsibility on the Senate, which cannot be lightly repudiated. </para>

                    <para class="block">When it is proposed to construct a real transcontinental railway, Tasmanians will not display any un-Federal spirit. When&#39; the Northern Territory belongs to the Commonwealth, and it is proposed to construct a railway to Port Darwin, Tasmania will be willing to bear her share of the cost Now we are practically asked to&#39; commit ourselves to the construction of an intermediate section of a railway of which the beginning belongs to one State and the end to another. Further, it is proposed to enter upon the survey of the line without having, secured even the tacit approval of South Australia? I believe that if the true feeling of the people of that Slate could be recorded it would be found th&#39;a&#39;t it was not in favour of the construction of the railway at the present time. You, sir, told us, and rightly so, that in compliance with a promise made at Port Augusta you deemed it to be your duty to vote for the proposed survey. But there were strong indications that you did not approve of the work, and that you also considered that the people of South Australia were opposed to it. Why are we here? To do what our constituents desire,- or to fly in the face of their wishes? I have not opened my mouth upon this question, except in occasional discussions upon minor points, because I had no desire to repeat arguments that had been very well put over and over again, and because I had reason to believe that the majority of senators would not approve of the proposed expenditure. But I was mistaken and much disappointed. I now ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> not to commit Tasmania to her proportion of the proposed expenditure until he has had an opportunity, in eight or ten &#39;weeks&#39; time, to ascertain the wishes of his constituents. He may think that he is committing Tasmania to only her share of the cost of the survey, but I think differently, and I am sure that the people of Tasmania will share my view. I appeal to the honorable senator not to commit an act which may result in a most unjust imposition upon the State he represents. Now I come to what may be called the business aspect of this question. Would any capitalist, or association of capitalists, ever dream of putting money into a venture of this kind? It is true that Western Australia ha.s told us that she will reserve 25 miles of the country upon either side of the line. What for, and for. whom? I am reminded of the generous little boy at school, <inline font-style="italic">who,</inline> having two apples, ate one and kept the other for himself. Twenty-five miles of the country upon one side of the line is to be reserved for Western Australia and  25  miles on the other side also for Western Australia- </para>

All through the piece the advancement of Western Australia has been considered as of more importance than that of the Commonwealth. There has been more time wasted in the consideration of this measure than in dealing with the most important proposal that has been submitted to us. Last year Tasmania was worse off to the extent of &#163;250,000 owing to her having entered the Federation. </para>

                            <para>- But the &#163;250,000 is not left in the pockets of the people. Some portion of it may be, but it is absurd to &#39;say that they have been able to retain anything like even one-half or three-fourths of the amount What they are compelled to do is to starve all their public works, and. unfortunately, to also starve their public servants to some extent. Yet, whilst all this is going on, some of the representatives of Tasmania are voting away money which she cannot afford to pay. </para>

                            <para>- According to the statement of the Commonwealth Treasurer, Tasmania has already lost about &#163;1 ,000.000 through entering the Federation. And yet we are being asked to commit that State to the payment of her proportion of an expenditure of ,&#163;4,000,000 or ^5,000,000. I say that this is shameful treatment to mete out to her. Every Ministry that has been in office since the Commonwealth was established has&#39; dis? played the most callous indifference with regard to Tasmania. Western Australia is the most un-Federal of all the States. It was in her Parliament that the first proposition for the dismemberment of the Federation was discussed. Yet Western Australia asks Tasmania, whose timber trade she tried to kill, and practically succeeded &#39;n killing, so far as her own mines were concerned,, to assist her in the proposed work. Western Australia is the one State that has been pampered from the beginning. She has had special consideration extended to her in being permitted to tax the goods of the other States for five years. </para>

                            <para>- Another very important feature- of this matter is that there is power under the Constitution - rightly given - for the Parliament to acquire and nationalize railways with the consent of the States. I venture to express the opinion that it is a power that the States will never consent that the Commonwealth shall use. But suppose that at some time the Commonwealth did exercise this constitutional right. What are we doing in this instance? We are actually enhancing the value of property which we may afterwards desire to acquire. There are at present two lines of railway which run for a few hundred miles inland from the coast. We are proposing to connect them and convert them into a trunk line. Why should we increase the value of property which, at some time, the Commonwealth may desire to acquire? I can assure the Senate that I am not speaking for the purpose of taking up time. If that were my desire, I could have fortified myself with material that would have enabled me to continue much longer. But I have spoken because I feel that it is my duty to enter my protest, and to make an appeal to one of the senators from the State which I represent. I do this, not in any unfriendly spirit towards the honorable senator to whom I allude. But I call upon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> to weigh carefully what he is about to do. What urgent necessity is there at the end of a session to push this Bill through? Would Western Australia suffer from the postponement of it until next session? Is this the sort of measure that ought to be pushed through in the last session of a Parliament when we have an opportunity to ascertain decisively the wishes of our constituents with regard to if? What better excuse could there be for the honorable senator to ask his colleagues - who, I am satisfied, have taken advantage of his good nature - to relieve him from the exercise of what no doubt he&#39; considers to be his loyalty to them in respect of this Bill ? </para>

                            <para>- I appeal to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> because - and I say this publicly - in my opinion his colleagues have taken advantage of his good nature to induce him to support this Bill. I feel satisfied that they have not hesitated to sacrifice him, should his constituents look upon this matter as being injurious to them, when he goes before them, as he must do, within a short period. They have not considered his position in the slightest degree, and it would be a proper and a manly thing on their part to relieve him from the duty which no doubt he feels called upon to discharge towards them from a sense of loyalty. </para>

                            <para>- I reply .that it is usual for members of Cabinets to reserve to themselves the right to vote upon certain questions in accordance with their personal opinions. When I became a member of a Cabinet in Tasmania, I reserved to myself the right to vote in a certain manner on the question of the taxation of the unimproved value of land if it were brought forward by a private member. In nearly every Cabinet such reservations are made. It is not always possible to form an absolutely homogeneous Government, whose members are agreed upon every question of public importance. </para>

It cannot be said that the measure is the project of one Ministry alone. Every Government we have had in the &#39; Commonwealth has brought it forward. It is alleged that those who take the Federal &#39;view of the question are actuated merely by sentiment. Upon this question, three senators representing New South Wales entertain one view, and three another. Yet I venture to say that their electors would not find &#39; fault with them upon that account. I should be very glad to hear the views of certain honorable senators in regard to establishing communication with the northern portion of Australia. It will be interesting to note the attitude which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> will assume towards the construction of a transcontinental line of railway to Port Darwin.

What has been done is but a step in the direction of a national work which must be accomplished some day, and it requires no prophet to foresee a time when both the Pacific and the Indian Oceans, and Port Darwin and Adelaide, will be brought into touch with each other by unbroken transcontinental lines. These railways are part of the fulfilment of the Continent&#39;s destiny, and, so far as settlement and the development of Australian sources are concerned, until these lines are built, we are still at the threshold of Commonwealth progress. The present expansion will imperatively demand their construction before many years, if the Commonwealth does not take the business in hand before. On the ground of rapid communication alone, these enterprises will have to be carried out; and when it is remembered how considerably the .time of transit between the eastern States and Europe may be shortened by these lines, especially if we get the talked-of service by way of the Persian Gulf and Asia Minor, or even if the Siberian line develops as was expected before the war, it will be seen that these undertakings cannot be over long delayed. It is a question of Commonwealth defence also. </para>

                        <para>Railway lines are required for the rapid transit of troops, and transcontinental lines are essential to the concentration of forces at any point of attack. Our unprotected northern coasts are a standing invitation to any possible invader, and to marauding expeditions. At present the northern and western seaboards of the Continent are virtually isolated from the Federal Defence system, and these parts of the Commonwealth, which contribute to the cost of defence in common with the rest of the States, have a not unreasonable ground of complaint on this score. It is entirely a selfish argument to say that these coasts might be harried, and Perth and Fremantle held to ransom .by any enterprising attacking force, without the security of the Test of Australia being in any way menaced. That attitude would be an unworthy one on our part, even if the Northern Territory and Western Australia stood outside trie Commonwealth altogether. The common Australian &#34;bond and the common racial tie would move us to take up their causes as our own, and that being admitted, we cannot be surprised if our fellow taxpayers within the Federation claim to be considered now, without waiting until the actual moment of trial comes. If the arguments based on the requirements of defective defence are considerably far-fetched, as there is always a tendency to do in the piping times of peace, there remains the argument based on the demands of commercial and developmental expansion. </para>

                        <para>.- I cb not intend to delay the third reading of this measure, although I hold very strong views upon it. When I was a candidate for this Chamber five years ago, I denounced the proposed railway. Some twenty-five years ago, I had something to do with the construction of a line from Port Augusta to Farina in South Australia, and, as a result, I know that the country through which the proposed railway would pass is a veritable desert, owing to its lack of a sufficient rainfall. The very fact that it is still unoccupied, notwithstanding that daring men are to be found who are willing to take their lives in their hands, and to travel to any part of the world in order to develop country which is capable of development, is conclusive evidence of that. Yet this piece of country is still undeveloped. </para>

                            <para>- The country has been tried several times, but it requires superhuman efforts to traverse it, even in the most favorable season. I think that the view I am expressing, so far from being a narrow, is really the common-sense view ; and I believe that if the people of the Commonwealth were polled to-morrow there would not be 5 per cent, in favour of this proposed survey. Of course, South Australia is, to some extent, interested. I can quite understand that the people of Port Augusta, whom I knew twenty-five years ago, are in favour of this expenditure; but that is only natural on the part of any community. Western Australia is a wealthy State ; and, if the State Legislature had any faith in this railway, they would prove that faith by undertaking a survey. I am glad to see the provision in the Bill that the &#163;20,000 must not be exceeded without the sanction of Parliament. This is a territory which cannot be traversed without special precautions in the provision of camels, ana so forth ; and if a railway were built to-morrow, water would have to be carried for hundreds of miles, or provided by some artificial means. This is as wild-cat a scheme as any on earth. There are tens of millions of acres throughout Australia awaiting development ; but we know that this work is in the hands of the States themselves. As to the defence aspect of the question, we know that we depend on British and Australian ships, and not on any railway - over which it would take a week to travel, and which might- be broken mid-way at any time by an enemy. Further, we know that on a gauge of 3ft. 6in. no average speed greater than 25 miles would be attained, and modern vessels can travel quite as quickly. We are now within a few weeks of a general election, and I ask why this question could not be submitted to the people. If it were submitted I have not the slightest doubt that there would be an overwhelming majority against the proposal. In any case, honorable senators and members of another place who have voted for this Bill will have to answer to their constituents. I regret that, owing to my being paired with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> I shall not be able to vote against the third reading. </para>

                        <para>.- As a reason for the construction of this railway it has been contended that it would be very useful as a means of defence. The railways iri South Africa were useful, but it must not be forgotten that Lord Kitchener was obliged to keep an army of 55,000 men to protect the lines. I am not going to pit my opinion against that of Major-General Edwards, which was giver some fifteen or twenty years ago? </para>

                            <para>- It appears to me that Western Australia is better able to take care of herself than . is any of the other States. When the last census was taken it was found that in the western State there were 70,000 able-bodied male adults between the ages of eighteen and forty-five, and I suppose that by this time the number has increased to 100,000, all able to bear arms. These men are the very pick of the eastern States. They were attracted to the west by the gold discoveries; and it will be seen that, so far as numbers are concerned, Western Australia needs no assistance from the eastern States. No land force that could reach Australia would be a match for the men of Western Australia, if the latter were drilled and taught to shoot straight and often. If it be said that a railway be required, it must be for the transport of munitions of war. My opinion is that the best defence for Western Australia would be a citizen soldiery and the fortification of Fremantle, so that an enemy could not get within shelling distance. It is really not a question of men, but of big guns; and 12-inch guns could not be transported from the east by rail in a few days, if they could be transported at all. If it were desired to transport war materiel bv land from Port Augusta to Fremantle, any enemy in. Australian waters would not attempt to land where we were prepared to meet him, but would possibly endeavour to obtain a footing at Eucla. It is proposed to build a jetty at Eucla, and connect it with the proposed line with 60 miles of a. branch railway. Such a jetty would have to be extended far into the water to permit of big ships to go alongside, seeing that it is intended to land tens of thousands of tons of railway material there. If so. any big vessels belonging to an enemy would also be able to go alongside; and nothing, it seems to me, would be easier than to destroy this so-called transcontinental railway. </para>

                            <para>- Fortify a place which is 400 or 500 miles from nowhere ! The suggestion that this line should be built for defence purposes is an extraordinary one. I am quite certain that it would be unnecessary to send to Western Australia, where the- cream of our male population reside, such men as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker, Senator Macfarlane,</inline> you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> or myself, to do the fighting of Australia. In the event of a war, what would be wanted over there would be not men, but big guns. We have not the big guns, and even if we had, we should not send them to the gold-fields; we should mount them at Fremantle to keep the enemy at a respectable distance. When <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest was Premier of Western Australia, a survey was made of the proposed line towards Esperance Bay, and the right honorable gentleman introduced a Bill to construct a section of it some 120 miles long to Norseman. The people of Esperance wished it to run to Norseman, but the Forrest Government declined to listen to their request, pointing out that such&#34; a line would be completely isolated from the railway system of the State, and that consequently a large sum would have to be expended in constructing railway workshops on it, and producing all the necessary appurtenances. The same argument could be applied with still greater force to the proposal to construct a railway 1,100 miles long, with a line of different gauge at each end of it. The people of the eastern gold-fields will insist upon the construction of a railway to the nearest port - Esperance, 220 miles distance - which would render it unnecessary for them to travel to Fremantle, 387 miles away. The distance from Adelaide to Esperance by sea is only 840 miles. I remember reading an extract from a report by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pendleton,</inline> the Commissioner of Railways in South Australia, to the effect that a line to Esperance would take half the traffic from the railway now under consideration. Three of our most influential senators, the leader of the Government, the leader of the Opposition,, and you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President</inline> - all South Australians - are willing that this survey should be. made at the expense of the Commonwealth; but are not willing that South Australia should contribute to the cost of that railway. </para>

                            <para>- They know that if it were constructed all hope of building a line from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek - the only truly transcontinental railway - for the next twenty-five years would disappear. Another point is that South Australia is expending &#163;500,000 in building a dock at Port Adelaide to accommodate the large mail steamers, although, if this line be constructed, they will never call there. The people of Adelaide might, from the top of Mount Lofty, occasionally see the smoke from the funnels of one of those vessels fiftv or sixty miles away ; they would certainly see nothing more of it. I am inclined to think, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> that you know something about the country along the route of the proposed line, and would not be prepared to take up land there for pastoral or agricultural purposes. I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker,</inline> as an old banker, would not think of putting even 5s. into such an investment. We have been told bv <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahv</inline> that this line would develop Western Australia. If a valuable gold mine were discovered along the line of route, it certainly would not be handed over to the Commonwealth. Western Australia is going to send out a party of prospectors with our survey party - which is to take care of them - so that she may seek discoveries calculated to increase her wealth. The boast is that Western Australia, per unit of population, is the richest country in the world, whilst Tasmania is one of the poorest amongst new countries. Yet this State, which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest claims has raised 300 or 400 tons of gold, is asking Tasmania to pay nearly as much towards the cost of this survey as she is prepared to pay herself. Dives begging from Lazarus is how the case presents itself to my mind. A couple of years ago one of the inducements held out to South Australians was that the line would be a splendid thing for their State, as by means of it she would be enabled to supply wheat, meat, and foodstuffs generally to the eastern gold-fields. We hear nothing about that now. What we hear now is that if this line is .made it will open up beautiful country for 200 miles east from Kalgoorlie, and sufficient in area not only to supply Kalgoorlie and the eastern gold-fields, but the whole of Western Australia with foodstuffs. If that be true, and I hope there is such good country there, why does not Western Australia construct this line herself, as Queensland has constructed the many lines built in that State for the development of the country. In Queensland there are a number of separate railway systems, and that is one reason why Queensland railways do not pay so well. Each system must have its own equipment in the way of workshops and staffs, and separate expenses of management. The separate management and equipment which would be required in connexion with the railway under discussion, would help to make it a non-paying line! because the expense of working it would be enormous. I do not know that it is necessary that I should say very much more on the subject, but I should like to rub the railway deficits in again. Whilst Western Australia cleared &#163;250,000 in three years, and South Australia cleared &#163;82,000 during the same period, the other four States, for the same three years, showed a deficit of &#163;2,550,000. Queensland lost nearly &#163;1,200,000 in that period with a population of about 500,000. Western Australia, with a population of some 250,000, having cleared &#163;250,000 in three years, asks Queensland, who has been losing at the rate of nearly &#163;1 per head per annum on her railways during the same period, to contribute 13 per cent, of the cost of this survey, and of the construction of the line, whilst she herself contributes, on a population basis, only per cent. But the case of Queensland, bad as it is, is not nearly so bad as is that of Tasmania. In that State they have a deficit of about &#163;100,000 a year on their railways with a population of 170,000 or 180,000 people. </para>

                            <para>- Roughly, that is about the amount. It is somewhat difficult to trace it, because Tasmanians are carefully concealing it now, but during the two years ending 1904, I think it amounted to &#163;260,000, and it is probable that the actual deficit on the railways of the State during the last three years amounted to something like &#163;100,000 a year. That is an enormous loss. Victoria has about eight times the population of Tasmania, and I might ask honorable senators to imagine Victoria with a railway deficit of &#163;800,000 a year. Proportionately New South Wales would have a deficit . of &#163;900,000 or &#163;1,000,000 a year, and if the States referred to showed deficits to the extent indicated we should hear a lot about it. During the past few years owing to a few good seasons our railways in Victoria have been paying interest and working expenses, but the people of this State have paid out of their own pockets no less a sum than &#163;7,000,000 to meet constantly recurring railway deficits. They are now being asked to put their hands into their pockets to construct a railway which no one believes will pay for at least a generation, and to contribute 30 per cent, to meet the deficit, whatever it may be, on the working of the line, and it is bound to be something pretty stiff, whilst they are to have no voice in the working of the line. The business of the four eastern States in this matter is to do the paying, and look pleasant while the railway is worked for the advantage of one particular State. I tell the people of South Australia that it will be a positive injury rather than an advantage to their State. The people of the four eastern States have spent between &#163;15,000,000 and &#163;20,000,000 to wipe off railway deficits, and they are asked to construct a line - that is what it really amounts to - which every one expects will entail a loss of probably not less than &#163;100,000 a year. It is a monstrous proposition. </para>

                            <para>- No, but it is coming to that. I could understand an honorable senator saying, &#34; I shall support the survey, and if the report of the surveyors is satisfactory, I shall support the building of the railway, but I cannot understand &#39; any one saying that, however adverse the result of the survey may be, he will vote for the railway. If I were satisfied that this railway would be a paying concern, which would meet expenses and interest on construction, I should not see so much objection to the proposal if the Commonwealth were given a sufficient area of the territory through which the line will pass. If the construction of the line were handed over to a body of capitalists they would probably demand a strip of territory 100 miles wide. In this case the people of one State, Western Australia, have offered to reserve - for themselves - a strip of land 25 miles wide on either side of the line for a distance of 475 miles out of the total distance of 1,100 miles. It is agreed that it would be a good thing to construct the real transcontinental railway from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek, but we attach as a condition to that that we shall receive 500,000 square miles of country in the Northern Territory. I should be prepared to vote for that to-morrow, and if that line were constructed the mails would be delivered at Adelaide eight days earlier than by the railway here proposed. Suppose that by going from Adelaide to Fremantle by this railway a day could be saved. Of course, we know that in a few years, before it could be constructed, even if a route were surveyed to-morrow, we shall have large turbine steamers which will travel at .&#39;the rate of 20 miles per hour. They would do the journey in as short a time as could a railway train, because the distance between those ports is so much less by sea than by land. That I believe is inevitable. The revenue which has been calculated for the railway is based upon present fares. But do we not know perfectly well that if the line were constructed the shipping companies would bring down their fares, just as they have done along the eastern coast, by about one-half, and starve the line in that way? Furthermore, who would get off an ocean-going steamer at Fremantle and travel a distance of 1,750 miles by railway through what is, for a great part, a desert, when he could travel from Fremantle to Adelaide without a charge of one single sixpence? The fare for a first-class passenger from Fremantle to Adelaide would be about &#163;9 or <inline font-style="italic">&#163;10,</inline> because there is a difference of only 37 miles between the distance from Fremantle to Adelaide and the distance from Adelaide to Brisbane - to which the fare is &#163;10. After crossing the ocean from &#39;the old country, no person would care to get out of the steamer and pay &#163;10 for the sake of arriving at Adelaide ten hours earlier than he would do if he went by boat - unless, of course, he had a special reason for taking that step. It is not the first-class, but the second class passengers from whom the revenue of a railway is derived. The other day I mentioned that 73 per cent, of the passenger revenue from the railways in the United Kingdom is derived from third-class passengers, although the trains also carry first and second class passengers. But in Australia the great bulk of the passenger revenue is derived from the second-class. What second-class passenger, who was going to or returning from Europe, would pay the fare by the railway when he could travel by the steamer to or from either Melbourne or Sydney for the same price as he could travel to or from Fremantle? A man can join a boat at Sydney and pay no more for his fare to Europe than if he went on board at Fremantle. It is not likely that, except ia a few cases, the railway would be used by a man who was proceeding to or from the old country. Persons with plenty of money might travel in the cold weather, but not in the hot weather. Fancy a man being cooped up in a railway train for sixty hours in such weather as there must be along the route of the proposed railway ! <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O&#39;Connor</inline> estimated that it would take sixty-one hours to cover the journey, and he has been quoted, rightly so, I think, as a very reliable authority. But. since then, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Premier</inline> James has estimated that it would be covered in forty-four hours. Since <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O&#39;Connor&#39;s</inline> estimate was prepared, it has been done by a steamer in seventy-five hours. Frequently it has been done in from eighty-three and ninety hours. Suppose that it would take sixty-one hours as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O&#39;Connor</inline> estimated, the saving on some trips, even with the present steamers, would be only from fourteen to fifteen hours. I am afraid that the Bill will pass, but I hope that it will not. If I thought that by talking until this time to-morrow I could stop its passage, I would continue. </para>

                            <para>- Some representatives of Western Australia, including my honorable friend, are perfectly sincere in thinking that the railway&#39;, if constructed, would be a success. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has thought over the matter so much that he is also quite sincere in thinking that the. eastern States should do all the paying. I give him credit for being absolutely sincere in the matter. But he only takes a one-eyed sort of view. He seems to think that the eastern States should do all the paying and that Western Australia should reap all the benefit. He has looked at the proposal from one point of view for so long that he believes that it is the only one from which it should be viewed. He wonders why some persons in the eastern States take such extraordinary and crooked views of the matter. I believe him to be perfectly honest in his convictions, and he is just as wrong as he is honest, as he very often is. </para>

                            <para>- The Premier has also laid it down that South Australia must have a voice in determining the route and the gauge of the railway. If, after making a survey, it were proposed to take the direct route, because it might not suit the Commonwealth to go away northwards, the Government of South Australia would say, &#34; If you do not run the railway by Tarcoola, so that we can take our people to and from Port Augusta, a distance of some 400 miles, we shall not allow von to make it at all.&#34; In fact, they have already said as much as that. One argument which has been used has been that every Government has brought forward this proposal. The reason why that has been done is because every Government has liked to secure) the support of the representatives of Western Australia. There could be no other reason for their action. Even if it meant that the Government would have to leave the Treasury benches, and give way to better men, who, I know, are available. I would vote against the proposal at this moment. I have such a strong feeling against this wild-cat proposal that I would not hesitate for a moment to cast my vote n gainst it, no matter what the result might be to this or any other Government. I have been looking forward to hearing a speech&#39; from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith,</inline> who I notice has been very quiet about this railway during the last few days. But the representatives of Western Australia are so very sensitive, that I am afraid to refer by name to one of them. I thought I was doing a very nice thing just now, but I found I was on the wrong track, and therefore I shall not make any remarks of that character. </para>

                        <para>. - I should like to correct a slight mistake I made when speaking yesterday. I stated that I had not previously said anything upon this question, but I find that last year I had a few words to say with reference to the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens.</inline> The Minister, in moving the third reading of the Bill, asked us to permit it to be cleared out of the way. I do not complain of his anxiety, because he must realize that the Bill is an apple of discord that has been thrown amongst honorable members, and that it may very well be left in abeyance until matters of far. more urgent importance have been dealt with. So far, I have not spoken on the main question at all, and I may be asked why I did not speak upon the motion for the second reading. Like- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy,</inline> 1 was under the impression, and reasonably so, that the majority of senators were opposed to the principle contained in the Bill, and I thought that I would be serving the best interests of the country by refraining from speaking, and thus facilitating the progress of the business, The opponents of the Bill understood that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> was on their side, and were astonished to see him voting for it. Last year the honorable senator expressed his feeling very strongly against the Bill, but did not record his vote upon the division that took place shortly afterwards. I am not finding fault with the honorable senator, because I take it that he knows his own business. He can pledge Tasmania to the expenditure of &#163;1,000 or &#163;100,000 if he chooses. That has nothing to do with me as the representative of another State. I am merely concerned to account for the impression in the minds of a number of the opponents of the Bill. We know the reception which the Bill met with when it was first brought before us. The representatives of Western Australia did not suppose for a moment that they had any chance of carrying it. Only one or two honorable senators spoke, and the measure was talked out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson.</inline> Last year the Bill was replaced on the business-paper by resolution, and was very fully debated. Honorable members who advocated the proposed survey quoted long extracts from reports that had been submitted years ago, and from the opinions of persons who had been sent out at the cost of the Western Australian Government to explore the country, and collect information for the enlightenment of the Federal Parliament. After all this information had been cited, the Senate deliberately, by nineteen votes to ten, decided that they would not further consider the question unless the South Australian Parliament gave its consent to the construction of the line. I now ask why we should stultify ourselves and make the Senate look ridiculous in the eyes of the people by coming to a contrary decision? I, for one, decline to be a party to the Senate&#39;s stultifying itself in this way. There is another reason for voting against the Bill on the present occasion. When we considered it last year, there was no immediate chance of eliciting the opinions of the people upon it. There is such a chance now. When I was travelling through Queensland, prior to the last election, the Western Australian railway was never mentioned. There was a sort of general idea that Western Australia and South Australia desired to be connected by railway, but it was never considered that the Commonwealth would be asked to construct that line. The subject was first brought prominently before the people of Queensland at a meeting in Brisbane, which was addressed bv the Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin.</inline> I happened to be present, and heard what he said. When he explained the project, a laugh went up. No one thought that the honorable gentleman was in earnest in advocating the line as a Federal project. It was considered that, while the people of Western Australia and South Australia might desire to be connected by railway, the Commonwealth was not called upon to incur the expenditure. The matter was referred to at some length in the newspapers at the time. I have not extracts from them to quote to the Senate, but I am quite sure that the proposal was ridiculed. Not that I lay much stress upon articles published in newspapers, because I am well aware that they are frequently written by men who have not sufficient information, and whose writings are coloured by the views of the proprietors of the journals for which they write. I do not attach as much value as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> does to newspaper extracts. He has, to-day, quoted ;i long screed from the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald,</inline> to the effect that there is reason for making further inquiry into the proposal. But we are all aware that leading newspapers have frequently upheld propositions which would have been most disastrous if they had been adopted by the Parliaments of the States concerned. I remember that a few years ago, the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Daily Telegraph</inline> supported a projected tramway steal. I am satisfied that if what was then contemplated had been accomplished, the people of New South Wales would have regretted it from the moment when they parted with their tramways until they were compelled to buy them back again. Foi yi-ars, in Queensland, we were cursed with black labour, not because there was not an agitation against it, but because newspapers which pretended to represent public opinion had sufficient influence to induce the Parliament of the State to maintain a policy that was in direct opposition to the opinions of the majority of the people. &#34;Very frequently, newspapers manufacture public opinion rather than represent it. Long screeds from journals like the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> ought to have very little influence upon our minds, though such an extract as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> quoted may be verv soothing to him. It must be very comforting to know that his attitude on this question commends itself to the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald,</inline> and to see his own speeches, to a large extent, reproduced in the form of articles in its columns. The States which we represent will be very seriously affected if the proposed undertaking be. carried out. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> has already put before us the position that is occupied by Tasmania. I desire to view the matter from a Queensland .standpoint. I am aware that supporters of the line will exclaim. &#34; Let us think continentally in matters of this kind. Let us view it as if we were entirely independent of State influences.&#34; Personally, I am not prepared to pledge the State of Queensland to an expenditure of probably &#163;650,000 upon the construction of the proposed railway. I contend that the question of its construction cannot be dissociated from that of the survey of the route which it will traverse. In the course of his speech, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> quoted, a. number of <inline font-style="italic">ex-</inline> tracts from the utterances of members of the&#39; Western Australian Parliament, who advocate secession because they consider that this Parliament has failed to carry out. an alleged promise that the transcontinental railway should be constructed. I propose, by way of reply, to put before him the view which is entertained - not by irresponsible members of the Queensland Parliament - but bv the Treasurer of that State. That gentleman, in speaking of the financial results of Federation, to Queensland, said- </para>

That is the fair and legitimate argument advanced this morning by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy,</inline> who told us that at the present time Tasmania is about &#163;100,000 to the bad each year. While Victoria and New South Wales may have surpluses, and there may be a little to the good in Queensland this year, there are the accumulated deficits; and it is necessary that those deficits should be wiped out, even if extra taxation has to be imposed. But if extra taxation is necessary for this purpose, that is one of the strongest reasons why we should oppose the expenditure of money on even a survey, putting aside the pledging of the credit of the States to the extent of hundreds of thousands of pounds for the construction of the proposed line. Queensland senators are always taunted by Western Australian senators with the fact that the northern State has the benefit of the sugar bounties. However, I shall not deal with that question at the present moment, but simply give the opinion of the Queensland Treasurer as follows: - </para>
                    <para>Despite the compensation of the sugar bounty, Queensland has paid a heavier price for Federation than any State in the Commonwealth, and it would be unreasonable to expect her to continue to pay as dearly as she is now doing foi the privilege of remaining n member of the Union. </para>

                            <para>- The words are those of a man who knows the financial position of the State the affairs of which he has been guiding for some time. We are admonished to &#34; think continentally,&#34; and to spread out our arms and embrace the whole interest of the Commonwealth; but we owe a duty to those people who sent us here to guard their interests. I believe as strongly in Federation to-day as I did when the Commonwealth was inaugurated. I was not one who said that he did not believe in the Bill, but believed in Federation, and that he would endeavour to get returned to the Parliament in order to carry out objects of which he did not approve. I believed then, as now, that Federation is the best means to insure that the destinies of Australia will be guided in a direction leading to the benefit of, at any rate, all the white people of the country. But representatives of Tasmania and Western Australia tell us that Federation has not done those States any particular good. We are told that the people of Western Australia received specious promises that have not been fulfilled - that they were so much influenced by the promises of three or four men who had no power to carry them out, but neglected to say so, that Western Australia entered into a Union from which it has received no benefit whatever. On this point I have read the words of the Treasurer of Queensland, and while I do not indorse them iri their entirety, I know that, although in some directions that State has benefited by Federation, the Union has been detrimental, especially to some of the industries established before the inauguration of the Commonwealth. But because there is a credit and a debit. I am not prepared to say that it is time Queensland left Federation. I am prepared, however, to vote against any Commonwealth Government, of whomsoever it may be composed, who squander money on projects which have never been remitted to the electors, even if my vote should have the effect of turning that Government out of power. We are all here to protect the interests of the Commonwealth, and in that regard- I am just as sincere as can be&#39; any honorable senator. But if some one outside says to me, &#34;I am hard up, give me a shilling to get a feed,&#34; that is no reason why T should say, &#34; Here, old chap, put your hand in my pocket, and help yourself.&#34; That, however, is the position which honorable senators seem to think Queensland ought to take. Some gifts, instead of a blessing, sometimes turn out to be a great curse, and then the recipient turns round and uses language, which, to say the least, is not very complimentary. It is my opinion that if this Bill were passed, and the survey carried out satisfactorily, and if South Australian representatives, who do not believe in the construction of the railway, but only in a survey being made, could be induced to change their opinion, the railway, when built, would make the people of Western Australia the most disappointed on the face of the Continent. For a long time, at any rate, the people of Western Australia would have to find a certain amount of money for interest on cost of construction and working expenses ; and they would find the benefits from the railway not nearly what they had been induced to anticipate. The Treasurer of Queensland, in the remarks from which I have already quoted, dealt extensively with the financial position of the State as affected by Federation, and his final words are - </para>

I wish to deal with this matter from the point of view of Queensland, which has expended a very large sum in the construction of railways. The representatives of Western Australia have told us again and again that its condition is so prosperous that it has been able to absorb the unemployed of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and Tasmania, and to offer employment at fairly good wages to all who go there. We are glad to hear that in some part of Australia. - we care not whether it be in the north, south, east, or west of the Continent - the mining developments have &#39;been such as to enable people scattered all over Australia to find employment on going there. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. We base our objection to this Bill on the statements made by the representatives of Western Australia.&#39; I would point out that Queensland has a very large railway mileage, and a heavy interest debt in respect of it. Allowing for depreciation, the amount expended by her on the construction of lines is &#163;25&#62;765&#62;457- We have a public debt of over &#163;30,000,000, equal to something like &#163;76 per head of the population. </para>

                            <para>- I think that the honorable senator is mistaken. Our indebtedness is large, but I do not believe that if is as great as he suggests. I would remind the Senate that Queensland has never called upon any of the other States to assist her in building her railways, or to share with her the losses incurred in respect of them. According to quotations read by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline> the leader of the delegates from Western Australia at the Federal Convention distinctly stated that that State was financially so sound that if necessary she could construct at her own expense a transcontinental railway to the South&#39; Australian border. None of us would have any objection to Western Australia constructing lines all over that State, and offering South Australia, substantial compensation for the right to extend this line over the border ; but when she demands that the other States, which have borrowed largely in order to construct at their own expense railways from which, in some cases, they have received no return, should bear the cost of this survey, she makes a request that is unjustifiable. I hope that the Senate will reject it. Let us look a little further into the results of railway construction in the different States. If honorable senators will refer to page 575 of Coghlan&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Australian and New Zealand Statistics</inline> for 1903-4, the last- edition published, they will find that in every State of the Commonwealth, with the exception of Western Australia, losses on the operation of the railway systems have had to be made up from the Consolidated Revenue. In Queensland in 1899-1900 the loss amounted to 1.35 per cent. ; in 1900-1 to 2.67 per cent. ; 1901-2, 2.01 per cent.; 1902-3, 2.44 per cent.; 1903-4, 1.56 per cent. The only State that showed a surplus on the management of the railways was Western Australia, and <inline font-style="italic">Coghlan</inline> states, that in 1899-1900, Western Australia not only succeeded in paying working expenses and interest on the cost of the construction of her railways, but made a net profit on their working of 2.29 per cent. I do not think that there is another State in the Commonwealth which has ever shown a profit of 2 per cent, on the working of her railways. The profit made in Western Australia in <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> 900-1 was .83 per cent.; in 1901-2, .07 per cent.; in 1902-3, .27 per cent. ; and in 1903-4, 1.07 per cent. During the period referred to the New South Wales railways in one year only, 1900-1, showed a profit over working expenses and interest on cost of construction to the extent of .19 per cent. </para>

                            <para>- The figures which I have been able to quote from <inline font-style="italic">Coghlan</inline> show the results from the working of the railways in Queensland and Western Australia. I propose to submit a case for the consideration of the representatives of the latter State. Suppose that two persons had engaged in the same kind of business, but in different places, that one of them was receiving a fair income from his enterprise and investment, and that the other, although he had displayed as much energy, and invested as much if not more capital, was not earning the interest on his investment. If the successful man wanted to develop his own piece of country, would it be regarded in commercial circles as fair for him to go down to the other man who also had started from scratch, and exerted like energy, and POSsibly enterprise, and say, &#34; I want to develop a little more of the country I own. I do not (know that I am very well able to do so. I certainly am doing a great deal&#39; better than you are; but nevertheless I think you ought to chip in with me, and provide the means whereby I can further develop the country out of which I am doing so well.&#34; We are all very well acquainted with the person who is not doing well, and who meets us in Bourke-street or Collins-street, and says, &#34; Look here, old chap, I knew you in the west, I am very glad to see that you have got on. I was one of those who assisted you to get into your present position, and if you have a shilling or two to spare it will come in very handy.&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> is smiling. I suppose, because he has been in that position on many occasions. But how would it be if he and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> went down the street, and met a poor unfortunate man who they knew had gone down in the west, and said, &#34; We are in a pretty fair position, and we think that it is about up to you to lend us half-a-crown. &#34; Of course, they would not think of doing that. Yet that is the very position which they take up regarding this railway project. I have not been able to ascertain the actual sum which the railways of their State have returned to the Treasury. I have only been able to give from <inline font-style="italic">Coghlan</inline> the percentage of interest which they have returned over and above the amount of working expenses, and interest on capital. But I am able to state the amount which we in Queensland have been called upon to contribute out of the general revenue for a number of years. </para>

The honorable senator, with his long parliamentary experience, should be aware that a Treasurer&#39;s estimates&#39; are &#39;usually to be re lied upon. Of course, I do not blame honorable senators for not being fully acquainted with the local politics of Queensland. They do not expect me to be well posted in the details of the politics of their States. But when a senator from Tasmania or South Australia tells us what is the practically unanimous opinion of the people of his State upon a certain proposal, I accept his word. </para>

                            <para>- So I do. I am not denying that Western Australia thinks that she requires the survey to be made, and the railway to be constructed. I am not quarrelling with the Western Australian senators who impress that view upon us. I was in Western Australia some time ago, at the invitation of the Western Australian Government, who treated me remarkably well ; and although not pretending to have an extended knowledge of the affair&#39;s! of that State politically, commercially, or industrially, I have no doubt that the Western Australian senators honestly and straightforwardly represent the opinions of the majority of their people. I believe they are doing their best in the interests of their State; and why should I be denied the right to do exactly the same in the interests of the State I represent? Up to the present the public debt of Queensland amounts to &#163;41,545,000. We have .spent on our railways about &#163;25,000,000, and in the year 1901-2 there was a charge on the Consolidated Revenue in respect of those railways of &#163;513,128 over and above the interest earned. </para>

                            <para>- No, and that is the very point I am stating. I know what the Government attempted to do, but they did not do it. The position is absolutely analogous to one which arose in the New South Wales Parliament some time ago, when I took identically the same point of order, and it was confirmed. In the sessional order to which I have referred there is absolutely no provision for &#34;otherwise ordered,&#34; so far as private business is concerned. Private business is by the sessional order absolutely fixed, and stated for Thursday afternoons. What the Government did on the nth September was this: They did not repeal the sessional order to which I have referred, or move to suspend it, but they invited the Senate to pass, and the Senate in all good faith, and, I submit, also in ignorance, passed a motion to do something which under the sessional order could not be done. Before the motion passed on the nth. September could be validly passed it was necessary to have rescinded the sessional order. It is patent to any lawyer that you cannot destroy a superior instrument by an inferior instrument. You cannot destroy an Act of Parliament by a regulation, a standing order bv a sessional order, or a sessional order by a mere motion or resolution, unless the sessional order contains a proviso to enable you to vary it at any time. The sessional order to which I refer contains no such proviso. </para>

On the nth September a motion was passed under which, instead of private senators&#39; business taking precedence before the tea hour, it was to have precedence after the tea hour, the Government assuming the power to transact public business up to the tea hour. In pursuance of that motion the Government are now proceeding to perpetrate an outrage on our sessional orders. </para>

                            <para>- I have not quite finished my statement. If you, sir, are prepared to rule in mv favour, so far &#39;as I have gone, I shall take up no more time, but if otherwise, I should like to be permitted to finish my statement of the case. It is a serious thing that the Senate in a disorderly manner should set aside its sessional orders. If it is competent to pass a motion altering the transaction of business in a certain way that conflicts with ai&#62; existing sessional order it is quite possible to do the same with our Standing Orders, which are arrived at and confirmed by a process similar to that adopted in the passing of our sessional orders. Our Standing Orders are not passed in the way in which Standing Orders in some of the State Parliaments are passed. In New South Wales the Standing Orders require the confirmation of the Governor in Council ; ours require nothing of the kind. They are simply the acts of the Senate; our process of creating a sessional order and a standing order is exactly the same, and the authority of each is equal, with this one difference, that the Standing Orders are for all time, whilst the sessional orders are for the session only. I am dealing with a sessional order, but I submit that its validity and authority is exactly equal to that of a standing order. We know that a standing order cannot be wiped out by a motion unless by suspending the Standing Orders first. No attempt was made on the11th September to suspend the sessional order to which I have referred. If the Government made a mistake in the method adopted for the conduct of business, it is not right that the repute of the Senate should be blemished in consequence of a Ministerial blunder. We are the custodians of our own honour, which is involved in the proper conduct of our business in accordance with law. I have ref erred to the sessional order of the 14th June. </para>

                            <para>- So was the other resolution. I do not think that that derogates in any way from the point of order; but I am pointing out that the honorable senator must treat the two resolutions as exactly the same. I see his point, but the honorable senator is trying to draw a distinction between the resolution of the 14th June and that of the11th September, and really there is no such distinction between them as the honorable senator suggests. Neither of them are standing orders. </para>

Sessional orders are simply resolutions which may be altered or varied at the will of the Senate. </para>

I make that statement, because I have to bear a certain portion of the blame as well as the officers of the Senate, because we ought not to have permitted the motion of the nth September to be carried without calling attention to the fact that the first part of the resolution of the 14th June could not be altered or amended unless it was rescinded. There is no valid difference between the two resolutions. One cannot be called a sessional order and the other not a sessional order. What is a sessional order? It is an order of the Senate which will continue during the session. Both, of these sessional orders will continue during the session, so&#39; that they are both on a par.

                            <para>- The motion of the 14th June is the only one with which we have to deal now. Up to half-past 6 o&#39;clock private business takes precedence. But of course the senator in charge of private business may re-arrange it if lie likes. A senator in charge pf a motion that has not been moved may not move it, and a senator in charge of a motion that has been moved may ask that his business be re-arranged. What is to happen after half-past 6 o&#39;clock is a question that I shall leave for decision hereafter. </para>

                            <para>- Mav I ask a question? I understand the position to be that private business will now be proceeded with. I also understand that unless the course indicated by the standing order is followed, private business will also come on next Thursday ; because, as has been pointed out, if our procedure has been out of order -in the one case it is in the other. My question is therefore - are we to understand that now we have got back to the position in which we were before the Minister of Defence moved the motion which is now ruled to be <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires,</inline> because a former order was not rescinded? Am I also to understand that private business will come on every Thursday unless a motion to the contrary is moved in proper form ? </para>

                            <para>- I think that is so, so far as regards private business on Thursdays. Had the words &#34; unless otherwise ordered &#34; been inserted at the beginning of the first resolution with which we have been dealing the subsequent procedure would have Been all right. Bui those words not being there the only question is that unless otherwise ordered private orders of the day take precedence ot private notices of motion on alternate Thursdays. Whether that has been rescinded by the second resolution I will not decide at present. The question is, what are we to do now ? </para>

                            <para>- The Minister of Defence has mentioned to me - and I think that it is only just that I should take some share of the blame of what is undoubtedly under your ruling an error - that the same procedure as has been followed this session was followed last year. The position now seems to me to be that private business should proceed from the present moment. The original order of the 14th June fixed that Government business should on three days take precedence of all other business on the notice-paper, except questions and formal motions; with the exception that private business should take precedence of Government business up to the dinner adjournment on Thursdays. It would seem that the only proper course is to place ourselves right so far as procedure is concerned, and go on with private business this afternoon. That would seem to be the logical course to follow. Then comes the new sessional order, which of course, so far as it is not vitiated by the order of the 14th June, is perfectly good and valid. It would be absurd to vitiate the whole of that additional order, because the results achieved since we began the morning sittings would in that case be illegal. </para>

                            <para>- I think quite rightly ; but some of my honorable friends say that the whole of the new sessional order is invalid. I hold that that is an absurd contention. That sessional order is perfectly good so far as it does not involve a rescission of the sessional order of the 14th June; and, therefore, it is perfectly valid and good as governing our procedure with regard to sitting at half-past ten in the morning. It is also perfectly good in giving conditional precedence to private business after the dinner adjournment. The only particulars in which it is <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires,</inline> or inconsistent with the previous sessional order is so far as it relates to the precedence of business before the dinner adjournment on Thursday afternoons. It seems to me that the proper position is that we ought to go on with private business now, and that, under the new sessional order, private business should continue after the tea adjournment. That seems to me to be the only consistent way to deal with the matter. </para>

                            <para>- The point that requires elucidation is this : The sessional order of the 14th June gives precedence to Government&#39; business up to the tea adjournment, and thereby implies that after the tea adjournment, private business will take precedence. The sessional order of the 14th June says that on Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays during the present session Government business shall take precedence of all business on the paper, except questions and formal motions. That is positive. But then it makes an exception - that on Thursdays private business shall take precedence up to the tea adjournment. The resolution of the nth September contradicts that by giving precedence to private business after the tea adjournment. So that it seems to me that, under the first sessional order, the precedence of private business after the tea adjournment must be done away with. </para>

                            <para>- Undoubtedly. The first part of the order is positive. It gives precedence to Government business on three days, with one exception, from 2.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. on Thursdays. Can it be contended that the sessional order of September can alter part of that resolution, and not alter the other part? </para>

                            <para>- In my opinion, the position at which we have arrived is this : You, sir, have already ruled that Government business is out of order at the present stage. But the question for your decision now. is how far, and in what particular direction, our procedure is mow affected by the resolution of the 14th June, which says that, unless otherwise ordered, private orders of the day shall take precedence of notices of motion on alternate Thursdays. The Senate &#39;did otherwise order by the resolution of the nth September. </para>

                            <para>- Will the President say ? I. admit frankly that we are in a position in which it would be extremely difficult for any honorable senator, President or otherwise, to decide which private business has the right of precedence. Under the circumstances, I think the most advisable course would be to suspend the sitting until 7.45 p.m. </para>

                            <para>- But I am raising it now ; and I should like, with all respect, to give your opinion a little further investigation. At the beginning of the session we passed a certain sessional order, providing that we should meet here on certain days, and that Government business should take &#39;precedence on certain days. We have had a ruling that the new order of business on the nth September was not carried in accordance with our Standing Orders, owing to the fact that seven days notice was not given. I now raise the question whether we can divide a resolution carried in that way, and say that one part is legal, and the other part illegal. It may not be amiss to make some reference to what the law is in relation to a by-law. A Statute gives the authority to make bylaws, and- a portion of a by-law may be <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires,</inline> and a portion may be quite within the power contemplated by the Statute. But the question arises whether a by-law that is partly <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires</inline> and partly legal is not altogether <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires</inline> itself - the legal part as well as the illegal part. Our motions for the conduct of our business are made by virtue of an authority under a Statute, and those .motions can have no greater effect than has- a by-law under a Statute. In the case of a by-law made by a municipality by virtue of a. Statute, if the by-law is <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires</inline> as to part, and within the law as to the other part, can the part within the law be regarded as valid? <inline font-style="italic">Hardcastle,</inline> whom I quoted last night, says - </para>

                        <para>There is some difference of judicial opinion as to whether a by-law is severable. In <inline font-style="italic">Clark</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Denton</inline> (1830) r B. and Ad. 92, 95, Bayley, J., said that a by-law, if severable, can be good in part and bad in part, and in <inline font-style="italic">Dyson</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">L. and</inline><inline font-style="italic">iV.1V.</inline><inline font-style="italic">Railway Co.</inline> (1881), 7 Q. B. D. 32, Lindley and Mathew, J. J., treated the by-law there in question as severable. But Cockburn, C. J., said in <inline font-style="italic">Saunders</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">South-Eastern Railway</inline> (18S0) s Q. B. D. at p. 463, &#34;that not only is it essential to the validity of a by-law that, it bc reasonable, but also that a by-law being entire, if it be unreasonable in any particular, shall be void for the whole.&#34; When breach of <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> by-law is punishable as an offence, it is difficult to divide the by-law so as to leave the valid and quash the invalid portion, but there seems no insuperable obstacle to doing so in a proper case. </para>

                    <para class="block">It is pointed out that there is a question whether the by-law - for &#39;which we may read &#34; motion &#34; - is inseparable. If we cannot separate the part that is good from the part that is bad, then everything that that Chamber has done between the hours of half -past 10 in the forenoon and the usual hour of meeting is a simple nullity, and the motion for the third reading of the Bill -submitted this morning was made at a time when the Senate was not legally in session - when we were nothing more than a voluntary meeting of individuals. We are in the extraordinary position that if this sessional order be not separable, then the motion for the third reading was not in order. The point I take is that this question is a question as a whole; and if the sessional order is <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires</inline> as to part it is <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires</inline> as to the whole, and the President is not called upon to decide that one part is good and another part is bad. If my contention be correct, the effect of our meeting here at half-past 10 o&#39;clock this morning, and the submitting of the motion for the third reading, had no more effect than if we had met in the Town Hall, as members of the Senate, to discuss this particular measure. </para>

                            <para>- I shall occupy but a very few&#39; minutes. In justice to myself I do not think that I should remain silent and apparently agree to arguments, and a decision which do not commend themselves to my judgment. I look upon the matter in this way : The sessional order of nth September was not a suspension of the existing sessional order, and was not an attempt to suspend it. It was a fresh sessional order which the Senate passed, which turns out to be contradictory in some respects to the other sessional order which remains unrepealed. I submit, therefore, that the position now is that we have at the present time two sessional orders referring to the same business, and each having exactly the same validity. According to the well-known rule of the interpretation of documents, where there is any inconsistency the later prevails. </para>

No one adjourned the debate upon it, and no one fixed the resumption of the debate for any particular day. That is the point of order I take. According to your ruling, the proceedings were valid until 2.30. After that hour they ceased to be valid, and the whole thing has gone by the board. </para>

                            <para>- The Senate made no order for the resumption of the debate on the Bill, and the debate that took place after 2.30 was not in conformity with the usual procedure. I say that so far as the Bill is concerned it must disappear from the notice-paper, and I submit that as a point of order. There is another matter to which I should like to &#39;direct attention. You, sir, have said that the Chief Justice of the High Court, when Chief Justice of Queensland, decided that every Parliament has a right to regulate its own procedure. Undoubtedly that is correct. I point out that according to your ruling since 2.30 p.m., the proceedings of the Senate have not been regulated by this Parliament at all. We have laid down certain rules which govern our procedure, but it has been contrary to those rules, and therefore, so far as our proceedings since 2.30 p.m. are concerned, we have been merely a disorderly rabble. </para>

                            <para>- I think it is better that we should arrive at some understanding now. It seems to me that if we were to adopt the course suggested, we should&#34; lose two or three hours, and at 7.45 p.m. we should have the whole -trouble over again. Let us come to some arrangement as to what the proceedings shall be. I think they should be arranged in this way. </para>

                            <para>- This would take us back precisely to the position .under the first sessional order which has been referred to, which provides for the consideration of private members&#39; -business on Thursday afternoons until 6.30 p.m., and for the resumption of Government business after the tea adjournment. You, sir, have ruled that that sessional order stands, that private senators&#39; business should be taken at 2.30 p.m. on Thursdays, and Government business after 7.45 p.m. You have said that that order of business on Thursdays stands, although we endeavoured to pass a sessional order arranging the order of business somewhat differently- I therefore suggest that, in accordance with your ruling, private business should now be proceeded with until 6.30 p.m., and after the tea adjournment Government business will be taken. If that course be adopted there will be no further trouble. </para>

                        <para>. - It will be remembered that a fortnight ago I addressed the Senate at some length on this Bill. The points to which I then devoted attention I desire to briefly summarize. My objections to the measure were, first that it represented a breach of the compact which was made when the States entered into the Federation, inasmuch as if it became law- it would take from the States powers and functions which they enjoy to-day, and which were left to them upon the signing of the Constitution. I also objected because the Bill makes a tremendous advance in the direction of unification. I pointed out that after full discussion all the States had adopted a Federal and not a unified system of Federation. I contend that after having secured the adherence of the States on the ground that we were inviting them to join a Federal Union, it would be a gross breach of faith to seek, by amending the Constitution, to take away from them, against their will, powers and privileges, and even territory which they would not voluntarily surrender. I went on to point out that those who sought to bring about this change ought to have accepted the responsibility of proving that the present system of individualism had proved an absolute failure, and showing that Socialism offered better results than does the existing system. In that connexion, I pointed out that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> had refused to take up the onus which undoubtedly rested upon him as the father of the Bill. Not one single word did he utter in his speech to show that the present system is wrong, or that the proposed system would give better results. He dealt practically entirely with the evidence submitted to the Tobacco Monopoly Commission, and as he rested his case upon that evidence, and upon the finding of the Commission, it became incumbent upon me to deal with the statement which he then made. I expressed great regret that he had sought fit to bring into the discussion the particulars of any individual industry. I said then, as I say now, that it would have been far better for him to discuss, as a matter of principle, whether nationalization is good or bacl, rather than to bring into the discussion the question of what particular industry should be nationalized. The time for inquiring whether the tobacco or any other business ought to be nationalized is when we have determined that nationalization is good, and should be adopted. But instead of dealing with the principle of nationalization, and seeking to show that in the interests of Australia it was desirable to have a system of State industries- </para>

                            <para>- I think the honorable senator has missed my point. I offered that as my explanation for devoting so much time to the tobacco business. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> thought fit to rest his case solely upon the tobacco business, and, therefore, there is no other course open to me but to follow him through his arguments. During my speech the honorable senator frequently interjected and affirmed that if I accused him of taking certain evidence I was open to a similar accusation. Where I have taken the evidence of one witness it was because he was the only witness who had spoken upon the points to which I referred, and I challenge the honorable senator to show that I have taken the evidence of any one witness where there were other witnesses who had given contradictory evidence. </para>

                    <para class="block">The only evidence to which I referred there was the official translation of the French Regie report, certified to by the Consul for France, and put in by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jacobs.</inline> He was merely the individual by whose hand it was presented to the Commission. Therefore, to say that I have taken his evidence is not only untrue in itself, but is utterly misleading. It is simply playing with the facts. It is no more his evidence than it could be said to be my evidence if I took certain figures out of Coghlan&#39;s statistics. If I were to assume that, because I had taken certain statistics from his work they were mine, it would be very rightly put down as a piece of unwarranted presumption. Therefore, for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> to charge me with using the evidence of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jacobs</inline> when I was using the figures from the French Regie report, was not only misleading, but, I think, intentionally so. Again, when I was dealing with certain facts, the honorable senator referred me to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.. Ferguson.</inline> I presume that for that reason he is prepared to accept <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ferguson</inline> as a witness on the points which were in dispute between him and me. In order that I shall not incorrectly place the matter before the Senate, I propose to invite the attention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> to that portion of my speech which is reported on page 4047, and in which he made this interjection - </para>

It is sufficient for my argument at present that .the honorable senator disputed a contention of mine that the price paid in France was considerably less than the price paid here. </para>

                        <para>But those who can afford something better than the States factories can produce are permitted to import for personal use only a quantity up to twenty-two pounds per annum on payment of about 13s. per lb. Foreign-made cigars are imported by the Regie to a limited extent. Twenty per cent, is added to their cost, and then a duty of13s. is also levied. Wages vary according to the proficiency of the men from 2s. 9d. to 3s.11&#189;d. per day. The women receive from1s.2&#189;d. to1s. 7d. per week of ten hours. I have not been able to ascertain the price given by the Regie, but I noticed in a trade journal that in France in 1903, France imported from the Philippine Islands 315,391 lbs., the value of which was about 2&#189;d. per lb. </para>

                    <para>Now that quotation opens up two other points upon which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> denied my statements. The one point was as to the price of the leaf, and the other as to the wages paid in France. The honorable senator said that he had gone through the figures, as worked out by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jacobs</inline> from the French official reports, and that those figures were misleading and incorrect. I am going to challenge that statement. I have gone through the figures now for the second time. I say that there has been a mistake, but that that mistake is more favorable to my point of view than at first indicated. The cause of the error has arisen from taking the franc at a level money value,10d., instead of its actual currency exchange value, which is a few points less. The figures of the official report show that there are 1,746 men and 14,946 women employed in French tobacco factories. Here I would point out to those who advocate the nationalization of this industry the enormous discrepancy between the number of women employed as compared with men. </para>

                            <para>- I think I can show why my figures differ from those of the honorable senator. He is taking the wages paid in certain branches, whilst I am taking the total number of hands employed in the whole industry, and the total wages paid. That seems to me to be the proper way to work out the average amount earned. My figures are all taken from the evidence submitted to the Commission based upon the Regie report. </para>

                            <para>- I think it is probable from the honorable senator&#39;s interjection that the discrepancy between his figures and mine is due to the fact that he has taken a portion of the hands em&#39;ployed whereas I have taken the whole &#39; lot. I myself could obtain different results! by taking the wages paid to some of the -hands instead of those paid to all. The report shows that the average hours worked per day are ten. Consequently, on the figures I have given, the wages are is. 7 2-ioths per day. That includes the wage&#39;s of all employes, men, women, boys, and girls. I have already given the wages for men, but I am now giving the figures for all the hands employed. Stated in other terms, they amount to i.92d. per hour. </para>

                            <para>- I am simply taking the evidence placed before the Commission. If the honorable senator takes the total number of hands employed and the total wages paid, he cannot produce any other result. The figures which have been challenged, and which the honorable senator said were <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jacobs&#39;</inline> figures, were taken from the French Regie report,  and  gave the wage as 15s. 6d.  per  week, or 2s. 7d. per  day,  or 3-rd.  per  hour. I desire to see  how  far  the  statement is supported by the evidence of the witness, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ferguson,</inline> to whom I have referred. On page 3 of the minutes of evidence. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ferguson,</inline> referring to Austria, is reported as saying - average wage of operatives a trifle under &#163;20 per annum per head. . . . equal to not .quite 8s. per week of 52 working hours. </para>

                    <para>Now, 8s. per week of fifty-two hours works out at 1.87 pence per hour, confirming <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jacobs&#39;</inline> evidence, which shows these wages to average 7s. 8&#189;d.  per  week, or  i.8d.  per hour. The discrepancy is so slight as to make it strange  that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> should ask why I had taken <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline></para>

                            <para>- I made a statement about the price paid in France which the honorable senator denied, and when I prove my point he asks me why I do not deal with the case of Japan. It is impossible to carry on an argument intelligently if the honorable senator behaves in that way. t reiterate that the price paid for tobacco in France is lower than the price paid in Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> asked me why I did not take the evidence of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ferguson,</inline> and when I refer to that gentleman&#39;s evidence, I find that it absolutely confirms my statement. I gave just now some figures relating to the wages paid in France, and it was in reference to this that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline></para>

                    <para>Pearce, as reported on page 4048 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> said by way of interjection - </para>
                    <para>I have averaged the wages given there, and I find that they are entirely erroneous - that the figures on which they are based do not bear out the conclusion. </para>
                    <para>That, of course, refers to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jacobs&#39;</inline> calculation of the relative wages per week and hour in France and in the Commonwealth. As I pointed out, those calculations were based on the translation of the report of the Regie, 1902, the correctness of which was certified to by the French Consul in Melbourne. In the case of Australia, I think I am correct in saying that the wages cited were those paid in the six factories concerned in the combine, and they are ali set out in the evidence on page 327. As to wages in France the evidence shows that in 1902 there were 575 working operatives, whose wages amounted to 504,913.45 francs. The ordinary work-people comprised 1,746 nien and 14,941 women - a total of 16,687 - and they earned a total amount of 16,154,025.17 francs. If we take 25 francs to the sovereign, we get a total of &#163;666,355 los. nd., which gives per worker &#163;38 12s. o&#163;d. per year, or 14s. io&#163;d. per week. That is the average for the whole, although <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> told us that that weekly wage represented about the lowest paid to girls. </para>

But, even so, I leave it to the Senate to determine how the omission of some 900 workmen would influence the average rate of wages of about 17,000 persons. Honorable senators may load my calculations Avith those additional wages, but it will still be found that the wages in France are much lower than in Australia. The facts which I have stated refute entirely <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley&#39;s</inline> contention that the lowest wage paid to girls in France is 15s. per week. &#39; </para>

                            <para>- I refer to these matters because the statement which I made before was challenged. That statement (was incorrect; but the error was against my argument, and not in favour of it. My previous figures brought out the average in France at 15s. 6d., whereas I find that it really is 14s. 10&#188;d. The difference arises from the fact that the witness took the French R6gie report, and that the franc was calculated as worth iod., whereas it is worth 9.6od. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> Pearce  challenged another statement of mine when, in an interjection, he asked if I had noticed what he termed the significant fact that the French Commission: of 1875 referred to prices in 1902, and how it was that&#39; the members of that Commission were able to prophesy. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> either now, by interjection, or when he replies, to show me in the evidence the slightest justification for his interjection. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator was not afraid of being ruled out of order when I spoke previously. I am discarding a good many of his interjections in contradiction of statements I made, because I should weary the Senate if I followed him through them all. When I spoke previously I pointed out that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> by interjection, had stated that under State nationalization of this industry we should be employing more men for less hours and for the same result. The honorable senator challenged me when I made that statement. I asked him whether he would defend it, and he said he would if he had made it. I then asked him whether he denied having made it, and he was not &#39;prepared to do so. I have since gone to the trouble to find out where the statement appears, and it is to be found at page 3002 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> for the 17th August of this year. During the honorable senator&#39;s speech <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> interjected - </para>

                            <para>- I did not suppose that my honorable friend was going to deny one of the contentions of those who, like himself, hold socialistic ideas. I am glad to be able to give him the reference to his remarks, although it took me two hours to find it. In connexion with the Tumut competition, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> in some of his statements made very grave reflections upon the tobacco manufacturers who organized the competition, and I think also, although probably the honorable senator did not intend to do so, upon the officials of the Agricultural Department of New South Wales. He said that as a matter of fact the growers had no representative to look after their interests, and were not aware of what leaf was sent to England. He made other reflections which I have referred to, and do not propose to repeat. But their effect, if not challenged, must undoubtedly have been to convey the impression that the manufacturers had been guilty of some acts which were not merely mean and dishonest, but almost criminal. The honorable senator lent colour to that impression by stating that from his knowledge of the combine he was prepared to believe them capable of almost anything. The competition was advertised, and if any honorable senator is sufficiently interested in the matter I can show him the poster or handbill in which the terms were set out. I have here what I believe to be a genuine copy of the poster, because in order that there should be no possibility of a mistake I compared it with the one submitted to the Agricultural&#39; Department of New South Wales, with the invitation to allow its officers to conduct the competition. In addition to casting some reflections upon the manufacturers in this connexion. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> asserted that 8d. per lb. was not a fair price for the leaf. On both these points, I propose to produce evidence which I think the Senate will accept as sufficient, not merely to satisfy itself that no injustice was done, but also to show that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> spoke without sufficient warrant when he made these very serious imputations on the manufacturers. The competition arose in this way.: The manufacturers offered a prize in four districts for the best two ton lots of tobacco grown in those districts. One of the conditions was that, in addition to paying the prize to those who produced the best leaf, the manufacturers were prepared to purchase at 8d. per lb. the whole of the parcel securing the prize, irrespective of its market value. But in no sense did they bind themselves to pay 8d. per lb. for any tobacco other than that contained in the prize parcel if it was&#39; not worth that prize. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable senator can bring evidence as unbiased, and as little open, to challenge as that which I am prepared to put before the Senate now, I will accept it, but I do not want evidence from the scores of retailers who tattled to the honorable senator at street corners. </para>

                            <para>- I shall then be satisfied. But no evidence of that kind which the honorable senator can submit will be evidence as to the quality of the tobacco. I am going to show how the particular parcel of tobacco which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has said was worth more than 8d. per lb., and in connexion with&#39; which that price should have been paid for larger parcels, was sent to England. </para>

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story</inline> raises a different point. He says that this tobacco was worth more to the combine than 8d. per lb. I shall come to that, but I. desire now to deal exclusively with the question as to what was its fair market value. The fair market value of a house may be &#163;.1,000, and, because I can afford to give &#163;1,200 for it, that does not make the latter sum the fair market value of the property. This tobacco was selected and packed by Hr. Campbell, the Director of Agriculture in. New South Wales. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has said that the men had no one to look after their interests, and had no knowledge of what tobacco was sent to England. When I state that the Director of the New South Wales Agricultural Department conducted the despatch of the tobacco it will be admitted by any one who is not utterly biased that that is as fair a guarantee as can be given that no trickery was allowed to take place in connexion with&#39; the shipment. </para>

The. first prize tobacco was very badly graded, and was not anything up to the mark i expected. The season was not a very good one, for one thing, and the tobacco was graded in a way that it contained a lot of rubbish, which should not have been present. </para>

                    <para class="block">That is the verdict of an official who judged the competition. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has often said that nothing like 8d. per lb. has been paid for a stock of first-class leaf. But if he looks at question 2563 he will find that, apart from the trash, 8d. per lb. was paid for not less than 24 per cent, of the total quantity, and /d. per lb. for 34 per cent, of it. I mention those facts in order &#39; to show that a very considerable quantity of that tobacco did realize a very good price indeed. But that is apart from the experiment. The tobacco was sent home, and on the 7th August, there appeared in the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Evening News</inline> a statement which evidently was obtained by its representative from the officials of the Department,  and  which, after reciting the conditions of the competi-:ion, contains this passage - . </para>
                    <para>This shipment was selected from the tobacco bought under the terms of the growers&#39; competition, and was chosen and .packed under the supervision of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. \V.</inline> S. Campbell, the Director of Agriculture. There were two parcels forwarded, each containing about 1,000 lbs. of selected leaf,, and it is considered bv the company that, from the manner in which it was packed, there is no likelihood of it having deteriorated in transit. The whole of the surrounding circumstances were explained to <inline font-weight="bold">&#39;Mr. Coghlan,</inline> who was requested to test the fair market value of the leaf, and to render account sales in detail, showing the purchase price and al! charges. </para>
                    <para>A cable received from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coghlan</inline> a few flays ago informed the company that the highest price offered was 44d., which is confirmed by our correspondent&#39;s message that the tobacco has now been sold .at 4d. to 4&#189;d. As the company paid 8d. for the leaf, in addition to charges, the result is disappointing both to them and to the growers. At the same time, the Director of Agriculture is of opinion that on other occasions Tumut has produced better tobacco leaf than that grown in the season in question. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable senator admits prime Virginian tobacco realized from 5d. to 5 Jd. at the sale, it seems to account for the fact that the tobacco sent Home realized from 4d. to 4&#167;d. It realized a. very fair price. If the combine had thought of ringing the changes and sending Home tobacco other than that which had won the prize, surely they would have sent tobacco which would not have realized as much as that sample did. Surely that is a proof that the tobacco was honestly sent Home, and that the price it realized is a confirmation of the evidence submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Creesey</inline> as to the value of these articles. </para>

His first point was that there had been trickery, and I appeal to any man with an open mind that I have disposed of that accusation. The next point was that some trick had been played with the tobacco, in that some inferior stuff had been sent Home. It is quite clear that the best tobacco from the Tumut district was sent Home, and, although <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Campbell</inline> admitted that, owing to the season, it was inferior even for Tumut tobacco, still it realized from 4d. to 4jd. per lb., as against the price of from 5d. to 5^-d. paid for fine Virginian tobacco. The price clearly confirms the report of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Campbell,</inline> and lends all the evidence of <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> to the whole transaction. I now come to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce&#39;s</inline> argument that if the tobacco is worth&#189;d. per lb. in London, then, with a duty of is. <inline font-style="italic">6d.</inline> per lb. here, it is worth is. io|d. per lb. on the floor in a Sydney warehouse, excluding, for the purpose of my argument, transit charges. That is, I presume, the point which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story,</inline> by interjection, raised just now when he said that it was worth more to them. </para>

It is not possible to use the great bulk of Australian-grown leaf in substitution, for American leaf, and that statement is confirmed bv the fact that tobaccoes made from locally produced leaf are selling at much lower prices than tobaccoes made from imported leaf. </para>

I rely on the evidence of official witnesses rather than on that of tobacco growers and interested parties. I think that the evidence of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ferguson</inline> is abundantly clear on the point that the production of Colonial leaf is defective to-day, but we are not producing the article which is required by the Australian taste. I want now to deal with the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fearce</inline> that if Australian tobacco is worth 4&#189;d. in London, then, with the duty added, it ought to be worth is. 10&#189;d. here. I propose to make a quotation from&#39; the speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> on page 3628 of <inline font-style="italic">Ilansard -</inline></para>

                        <para>T drew attention, when dealing with the Australian Industries Preservation Bill, namely, the lessening the cost of production, and the increase of profits to the manufacturers. There is indisputable evidence that in the case of certain brands of tobacco, there has been an increase of. price since 1901. Of course, I know that the combine contend that this is due to the Tariff, but it is significant that in some States the Tariff, so far from warranting an increase in price, should have been followed by a decrease. In South Australia,&#39; for example, practically no local leaf was used prior to Federation. Every bit of leaf which entered South Australia at that time had to pay a duty, and the Excise was not higher then than it is at present ; therefore, the throwing down of the Inter-State barriers opened to the Australian manufacturers a market - for local leaf. Ever since, those manufacturers have been largely using local leaf, which, of course, pays no duty ; and in their sworn evidence they give the average price as under 5d. per lb. </para>

                            <para>- I can assure the honorable senator that the duties do not affect the case I am presenting, the difference being so small. If honorable senators turn to the evidence of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ferguson,</inline> they will there find the rates of duties in the various States. The point is that, so far as raw material is concerned, the manufacturers in South Australia had to pay duty prior to Federation, whereas since then at least one-fourth of their raw material has been duty free. The duty before Federation was greater than the whole cost of Australian leaf at the present time, so that, on the manufacturer&#39;s own showing, and on the facts as presented to the Commission, it cost more to produce tobacco in that State prior to Federation than it has cost since. There has&#39; been no substantial increase in the price of foreign tobacco leaf since Federation. The position is much the same in the other States as in South Australia. It will be found that, on the whole, so far from Federation having made it more expensive to manufacture, it&#34; has resulted in a saving. </para>

                            <para>- We have to assume that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> in making, the statement that Federation had made it less expensive to manufacture tobacco, was speaking from evidence submitted to the Commission. But, so far as  I  have been able to examine the evidence - and  I  have,  I  suppose, gone into it as exhaustively as any senator, even including members of the Commission themselves - there is a general consensus of opinion on the part of the combine witnesses, wholesale dealers, and retailers, that the rise in price was due to the Commonwealth Tariff. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> denies that statement, I should like him to indicate evidence to the contrary effect. In New South Wales, as the result of Federation, it is costing 3d. per lb. more to manufacture ; in Victoria, 9d. per lb. more; in South Australia,10&#189;d. per lb. more; and in Queensland, 6d. less. I take the case of South Australia particularly because in that State, owing to the fact that no local leaf was grown, the manufacturer there had to obtain all his leaf from other States, or from abroad. Before 1901 imported leaf paid1s. 7&#189;d. per lb. ; now1s. 6d. per lb. is paid on imported leaf, in addition to 1s. Excise. </para>

                            <para>- That is right enough; but when statements are made in this reckless fashion it tires one&#39;s patience. On the figures I have given there is a difference of10&#189;d. against the manufacturers&#39; working to-day as compared with the conditions before Federation. Let me illustrate the effect of the alteration. Before Federation the duty paid on 100 lbs. of imported leaf at1s. 7&#189;d. was <inline font-style="italic">&#163;8</inline> 2s. <inline font-style="italic">6d.</inline> After Federation the duty and Excise on 75 lbs. of imported leaf come to <inline font-style="italic">&#163;9</inline> 7s. 6d. The Excise on 25 lbs. of local leaf at1s. comes to <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> 5s. That means that the manufacturers pay <inline font-style="italic">&#163;10</inline> 12s. 6d., as against <inline font-style="italic">&#163;8</inline> 2s. 6d. paid prior to Federation, a difference of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> 10s. on every 100 lbs. of tobacco, amounting to 6d. per lb. It may be asked why have I calculated on the basis of 75 lbs. of imported leaf arid 25 lbs. of local leaf. I do that on the evidence put before the Commission. </para>

                            <para>- The leaf was all imported, whether it came from other States or from America. But the point is that the manufacturers absolutely pay more to the Government on every pound of tobacco manufactured in South Australia since Federation than they did before. It does not matter for the purposes of my argument whether they pay more by 6d. or <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1.</inline> The argument is that it costs more to manufacture, while <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce&#39;s</inline> contention was that on the whole Federation, so far from having made manufacturing more expensive, has reduced the cost. That is one of the statements in which, I think the honorable senator has allowed his sense of fairness and his judgment to be warped by bias. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> also said that there had been no advance in the price of foreign tobacco since Federation. I should like him to indicate the witnesses upon whose evidence he relies in support of that statement. Practically all the witnesses who were likely to know, stated that there had been a rise in the price of leaf. The honorable senator may say that he does not believe the witnesses because they are interested parties. If that be his attitude, well and good. But upon the evidence, it is not possible to come to any other conclusion than that the price of foreign leaf has risen considerably of late years. For instance, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Benjamin</inline> quoted a circular stating that the cost of raw material had risen to a serious extent. Messrs. Snider and Abrahams, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Alston,</inline> tobacconists, testified that the price had increased lately. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cameron, Mr. O&#39;Neill, Mr. Dixson,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilkins,</inline> all made similar statements. In fact, the evidence so far as I have been able to follow it, absolutely disproves <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce&#39;s</inline> statement that imported leaf is not costing more to-day than previously. Therefore, I say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> made his statement without justification. I invite him to show me any part of the evidence which proves that the price of leaf has not increased. I should like to direct <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce&#39;s</inline> attention to one of those incorrect readings of the evidence which he has put before the Senate. This is one of the most serious of the instances; and I should say that it was the most serious, were it not that I anticipate that as soon as I drew his attention to the fact he will admit his error, and say that he has been misled - that he will withdraw a statement involving considerable injustice to those to whom he refers. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> as reported on page 2812 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> said - </para>

Only one inference could be drawn from that statement, namely, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> desired to lead the Senate to believe that one witness connected with the combine had &#34; naively &#34; admitted that the combine was not so simple as to raise prices when there was likely to be a crisis in the industry.

I take his present attitude to indicate that he stands by his statement. All I can do is to place the facts before honorable senators, and leave them to decide. But I repeat that there is not a single word in the evidence to justify <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> in referring to the combine in that way. </para>

                        <para>- The only other aspect of the question to which I desire to refer is the financial aspect. I am not against the nationalization of an industry, if it could be shown that the nationalization would result in benefit to the revenue, to the people employed, and to the public generally. My objection to nationalization is that, in my opinion, it would be attended by results the very opposite of desirable. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has placed several estimates before the Senate as to the probable profits which would be derived <inline font-style="italic">from</inline> a State monopoly. It is an encouraging sign that, with each succeeding estimate, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has been less optimistic. As he has been brought closer into touch with the realities of the industry, his figures have shrunk to more modest proportions. I am not quite certain what the honorable senator&#39;s first estimate was, but I know that at one time he claimed that the profit, over and above the revenue now derived from Customs and Excise, would amount to , &#163;700,000. To-day, however, as the result of the inquiries made bv the Royal Commission, his estimate of profit in round figures is &#163;400,000. To this extent I have been able to discover that the Royal Commission has had some beneficial result. At one time, I thought that all the work would mean only so much waste of time and effort. But the labour has not been entirely thrown away, if it has enabled the honorable senator to so adjust his calculations as to reduce his original estimate of profit by nearly 50 per cent. </para>

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carter&#39;s</inline> estimates were just as contradictory as the two estimates of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> to which I have already called attention. We can always reconcile conflicting judgments by saying that we have obtained further information ; but when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carter</inline> is quoted, on the strength of his life-long experience in the industry, as the sole authority, I of course desire to know what his qualifications are. I first find that, as recently as February, 1904, since which date there has been no great development in the tobacco industry, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carter</inline> published a pamphlet, which was in the possession of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> while the Commission was pursuing its inquiries. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carter</inline> does not disguise the fact that he is a staunch advocate of the nationalization of this industry, and in that pamphlet he makes a most glowing estimate. Only a few months afterwards, however, when he came before the Commission, he gave en entirely different estimate. </para>

                        <para>With regard to the probable results of the nationalization of the industry, we have every reason to believe that it would be distinctly beneficial from a revenue point of view. France, Italy, Austria, Hungary, and Japan, all derive large revenues from this source. France in 1902 obtained a net revenue of ^13,297,464. Italy, 1902, ^6,419,237; Austria, 1901, ^6,107,000. Japan, after sending officials to study the financial system of European Governments, and after trying the system of taxation by &#39;Customs and Excise duties, took over the whole tobacco industry last year, and made it a security for her Avar loans, to the extent of ^60,000,000. France has a revenue from tobacco per head of population of 6s. 10¾d., or of 3s. i-4d. per lb., the average retail price for all forms of tobacco, cigars, and cigarettes being 4s. 1&#189;d. per lb. (See <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jacob&#39;s</inline> statement, question 6257), the average wholesale price being 3s. 10.7c!. per lb. </para>

The average retail sale price of all forms of tobacco, cigars, and cigarettes, is 6s. 10 4-/d. per lb. The average wholesale being 5s. 3 4-7CI. per lb.

                    <para class="block">On these figures the honorable senator sought to show that a certain revenue was to be obtained if the Commonwealth took over the industry. In dealing with the matters set out in this portion of the report, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has naturally taken only the wages paid in France, and has not shown what would happen if those engaged in the industry there were paid the wages which are paid in Australia. I have changed the French wages to Australian wages, and I find that if Australian wages were paid in France the total wages paid in the industry in that country would amount to &#163;1,601,571. I have taken the number of hands employed in the French factories, and have multiplied by that number the figures for the wages paid in France, as disclosed by the report, and I find that the total wages at present paid in France amounts to <inline font-style="italic">&#38; $0,150.</inline> This shows that, if France paid Australian wages, the present wages paid in that country would have to be increased by &#163;871,424. If the same quality of leaf were used in France as in Australia, and if France paid the same price for it as is paid here, she would have to pay for it no less a sum than ;&#163;4,838;642. </para>

If we add the difference in wages to the amount which would have to be paid for the leaf at Australian prices, the increased cost would represent &#163;5,710,066. The present revenue of France from the industry is &#163;13,297,464, and if the increased cost be deducted, we shall find that the revenue would be &#163;7)587,398, as against &#163;13,297,464, which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> said is the present revenue obtained from the industry in France. To secure a like revenue, here is the objective towards which he aims. </para>

                            <para>- If, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story</inline> suggests, wages in France, although lower than wages in Australia, have a higher purchasing power, that goes to show that goods in Fiance, and amongst them tobacco, are sold cheaper than in Australia, and, if prices there were increased, the increased purchasing power of wages in France, as compared with that of wages in Australia, would disappear. </para>

                            <para>- No, because tobacco is not purchased only by the operatives in tobacco factories. However, 1 cannot hope to convince an honorable senator who gave his adherence to libel principle of nationalization before he heard a single witness in the case. With regard to the Japanese monopoly, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has stated that last year it realized in net profit upwards of &#163;4,000,000. This is a big figure, but I point out that in that year a special war tax was on. I may tell honorable senators in this connexion that the Japanese Consul in Sydney, writing under date 30th August, 1906, says - </para>

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has referred to a year in which the revenue from the industry amounted to upwards of &#163;4,000,000, and I am justified in showing that in another year it had fallen <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> &#163;2,753,412&#39;. That might be due to some adjustment&#39; of taxation .consequent upon the cessation of the war, but I mention it to show that it would not be safe to assume that Japan derived a permanent revenue of &#163;4,000,000 from the industry. The honorable senator anticipates for the Commonwealth, should the industry here be taken over by the States, a revenue of &#163;400,000, but that must be cut down by a number of deductions for which the honorable senator has made no allowance. He has allowed nothing for interest upon the cost of resuming the industry, and I take it that he does not propose confiscation. He has allowed nothing for. interest orr capital or wear and tear, and nothing for higher wages, whilst he knows as well ha I do that we have a. minimum wage provision in our Public Service Act, and the industry in the hands of the State would come under the operation of that section. The honorable senator lias not allowed anything for higher prices ip growers, and it is clearly the intention that there should be higher prices paid to growers ; and a most important factor is, that fie has assumed that all cigars, cigarettes, and tobacco are to be sold in single packages, that every cigar is <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> be sold, at per cigar, when he knows that a very great quantity are to-day purchased in bundles and dozens at a lower price. Further, the honorable senator has allowed only 20 per cent, for cost of distribution., whereas it will be found that at question 1 113 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carter^</inline> the witness on whom the honorable senator relied for his estimate, said that 25 per cent, was not enough to allow in the tobacco business. Yet the honorable senator works out his figures on a 20 per cent, basis for distribution. When all these deductions are allowed for it will be found that instead of a revenue of &#163;400,000 being derived from the nationalization of the industry, this amount must be considered a gross over-estimate. It is, I think, clear that bv a slight adjustment of taxation to-day the Commonwealth, under existing conditions, could obtain more revenue from this industry than we could ever hope. to obtain from it under a system of nationalization. </para>

                        <para>- I desire, sir, to ask your ruling as to whether it will be in order to proceed with this order of the day now? To-day you have ruled that certain irregularities have occurred, and consequently we had to suspend the consideration of the measure. I submit that we must go back to the point at which those irregularities began. If we have taken any action subsequent to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford&#39;s</inline> motion of the nth September on the assumption that it conformed with standing order 127 in relation to the Bill it must equally be out of order. On referring to the <inline font-style="italic">Journals</inline> of the Senate, I find that up to Wednesday, the 12th September the proceedings in relation to the Bill were in order. In other words, we had taken no steps on a Thursday, when, under the sessional order private business was bound to come on between 2.30 p.m. and 6.30 p.m. The <inline font-style="italic">Journals</inline> show that on Thursday, the 13th September, between those hours we entered into a discussion of this Bill in Committee. It follows that it was out of order, because according to your ruling to-day, that period of four hours was, on account of the sessional order, given over to the consideration of private business. We considered the Bill on that date just as we did to-day on the assumption that the resolution of the nth September had put that proceeding in order. I submit that inasmuch as the proceedings on the Bill on that Thursday were out of order, there is no course open to us now except to resume, after due notice has been given and other formalities have been complied with, the consideration of the Bill at the stage at which it had legitimately arrived, and that is in Committee on clause 2. I submit that it is a necessary corollary from your ruling that we must go back to that point. </para>

                        <para>- My ruling has been asked as to whether the Clerk is in order in calling on the third reading of the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Survey Bill. I think that the calling on is in order, and I do not agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> when he states that if irregularities have occurred we must go back and start at the stage at which they commenced. I think that the Senate condoned all those irregularities by the proceeding which it took. Every honorable senator is to a certain extent responsible for them. </para>

                            <para>- That may be so; . but, after all, is it a great question of principle whether when the Senate which made the Standing Orders for its guidance has been guilty of irregularities in reference to them all the proceedings irregularly taken are invalid. I do not think it is a matter of so much importance as has been made out. In respect of the acts of the Senate, outside the Chamber it does not matter whether it has committed irregularities or not. That is only a question for the Senate itself to consider. </para>

                            <para>- Directly the irregularities of which we had been guilty were pointed out we amended our proceedings and went on. But the other question is whether everything we have done which was irregular under our procedure, owing to the omission of a few words in the sessional order of the 14th June, ought to be annulled. I am not prepared to say that that is so. That resolution provided that on Thursday Government business should take precedence of all other business except between 2.30 p.m. and 6.30 p.m. I would point out that each dav&#39;s sitting is a sitting for that day, that so far as this Bill is concerned our proceedings were regular up to 1 o&#39;clock to-day. Up to that hour there was no opportunity for the Minister of Defence or any one else to ask the Senate to adjourn the debate, and fix a date for its resumption. It is quite clear that the suspension of a sitting is only a suspension. If at 1 o&#39;clock we had suspended the sitting until 7.45 p.m. undoubtedly we could have gone on with the consideration of the Bill. The fact that private business has or ought to have intervened at 2.30 p.m. does not seem to me to alter the result of a suspension of the sitting, in reference to a matter which is then under consideration. I think that the interruption of the consideration of the motion for the third reading of this Bill at 1 o&#39;clock simply suspends the proceedings for the time at which it took place. </para>

                            <para>- I fail to see how it can be done. You may ask us to condone an irregularity, but you must admit, I submit, that we are out. of order. If I understand that your ruling is merely to this effect - that you advise the Senate to condone the irregularity, and go on with the debate - I think that if we pay strict regard to our standing order we cannot do that. I admit that the whole question is a difficult one, and it is for that reason that I ask you to rule on the point regarding taking up a debate that has not been adjourned. I am asking you to do that with all respect, because it is an important point in our procedure, and I submit that you have not ruled on it yet - unless I understand your ruling to be that we shall condone the irregularity, and go on. </para>

                            <para>- The whole of this procedure is out of order, but I try to be very patient. After I have given a ruling - which I am afraid I did not make very. clear; at all events, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> did not seem to understand it - the &#34;honorable senator has made a long speech criticising it. I am going to give the ruling again, and after I have given it, I do not want to have any &#34;further debate on the matter: A sitting of the Senate for one day is one sitting. We may suspend that sitting for an hour, or two hours, or half-a-dozen hours; and afterwards we start again exactly as we left off. There is no necessity to move for the adjournment of any debate interrupted by the suspension. It is quite clear that if we had at 1 o&#39;clock suspended the sitting till 7.45 p.m., we could have resumed the debate on the third reading at 7.45. I do not think that any one can deny that. If at 6.30 on&#39; a day on which there is no question of private business and public business, we suspend a sitting till 7.45, we do not adjourn the debate then proceeding. We proceed with the debate after the suspension. If we can suspend a sitting for an hour and three-quarters. we can suspend it for four or five hours, as long as we are in the one sitting day. </para>

We ought then to have gone on, according to our Standing Orders, and according to our sessional orders, with private business. But by some irregularity we did not. Ultimately, however, we got back to a proper basis, and went on with private business. Between 4.30 and&#39; 6.30 we dealt with private business. Would the suspension of the debate on a motion before the Senate at 1 o&#39;clock, have made it irregular to resume that business at a later hour? I do not think it would. I admit that there is no standing order one way or the other. -It is a question of commonsense, and a question of the convenience of the Senate, as it seems to me. </para>

I perfectly admit the competence of any senator who chooses to do so to move. to dissent from my ruling when he thinks that I am wrong; and I shall always cheerfully submit to any verdict to which the Senate may come upon such a motion.

I think you intended to say that you did not like to have your rulings dissented from&#39; for party purposes. Neither do I. But if I may be permitted to refer to the last occasion when I had to dissent from your ruling, it will be remembered that the division disclosed that there was no party purpose, inasmuch as the vote was even, whereupon, under our standing order, the question had to pass in the negative. The voting on that occasion was 13 to 13, which in itself, added to the fact that you and the Chairman of Committees - whose rulings were then in dispute - voted <inline font-style="italic">orv</inline> one side- </para>

                            <para>- If that remark were made by an ordinary member of the Senate, I should immediately take active and decided steps to resent it. Coming from the Chair, I can say nothing; but if you were on the floor of the Senate I should, I say, undoubtedly resent it. My remark was not made for that purpose at all, and I think that you are taking an advantage of your position from the Chair, which you yourself will, on reflection, probably regret. Now I am going to deal with my objection. You yourself, in your ruling, have just made the admission that there is no standing order which supports it. I took a note of your remarks. You said further that this matter must be decided, after all, by common-sense. You emphasized that remark &#39; by repeating it. I submit, therefore, - and I do so with the greatest of respect - that if there ever was an occasion when a member of the Senate might dissent from your ruling, this is such an occasion. Surely, if common-sense is to decide the question, there is no better course than to submit it to the common-sense of the whole Senate. You yourself would be the first to say, I am certain, that if common-sense is to be the sole arbiter, we could not do better than submit the question to a vote of the Senate. You have also said - I noted the exact words - &#34; I am quite willing that the Senate should decide it.&#34; I wish to give the Senate an opportunity of deciding it. What better occasion could there be for the Senate to decide upon a ruling given by you, believed by some honorable senators to be erroneous, than when you yourself have said that common-sense must decide the question, and that you are perfectly willing to submit it to the Senate ? Now, with regard to another point. If I had been desirous of interfering with the ordinary course of business, I need not have intervened until we had proceeded past half-past 10 o&#39;clock, when no new business could have been taken. If I had waited .until thirty-one minutes past jo, and then had raised an objection to the proceedings, I should have brought the sitting to an end ; because the debate on the dissent from your ruling would have had to be adjourned until the next sitting day. </para>

                            <para>- Surely the Senate will recognise that, although I am raising this point at a time when there is, so to speak, keen party strife, it is a point that it will be well to have settled. I venture to say that you have given a ruling on no more important point than this. I also venture to say that you yourself were in difficulties about coming .to a conclusion. I feel sure that you will admit that. Under such circumstances, therefore, is it not a proper matter for the Senate to consider, and to come to a conclusion upon? It is obvious that certain-irregularities have occurred. You admit that, under ordinary circumstances, when it is desired that a debate on one subject shall cease and other business be taken up, the invariable practice of the Senate is for some one to move the adjournment of the debate. After that is done, a motion is submitted that the adjourned debate be made an order of the day for some subsequent time. In this case that was not done. If such a motion had been submitted with regard to this measure, any one could have opposed it. </para>

Under ordinary procedure, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> would have resumed his speech after lunch, but it is questionable whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> could have done so to-day. I submit that, for this and other reasons, your ruling, sir, is beset with grave and great difficulties. I recognise that you- are forming a procedure for the Senate, the value of which I recognise. From time to time you give us your rulings, which are used in the interpretation of our Standing Orders, and the very ruling which you have given to-night will, no doubt, be included amongst your other determinations on disputed points. But is it not right and desirable that the Senate should express an opinion whether or not it upholds your ruling ? You will, I am sure, acquit me of any desire to see your ruling rejected; my only wish is that the Senate may have an opportunity to express the opinion which you have invited it to express. </para>

                            <para>- I rise to a point of order. I contend that this is not a motion which you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> can receive, for the reason that it was not moved, as, according to the standing order, such motions must be moved, immediately your ruling is given. I furthermore draw your attention to the concluding words of the standing, order, namely, &#34; unless the matter requires immediate determination.&#34; I take the view that the Senate is greater than its Standing Orders, and yet, unless the discretion vested in you is to be exercised, one honorable senator may prevent the Senate from proceeding with any business whatever. It would only be necessary for an honorable senator, as soon as a Bill was called upon, to dispute some ruling of yours, and immediately the whole business must be postponed until the following day. I believe that the intention, in inserting the words I have quoted, was to prevent any honorable senator being able thus to cause a dead-lock in the business. This is surely an occasion on which you should exercise the discretion vested in you. I contend that the objection was not taken at once, as it should have been, and that, even had it been taken at once, you ought to exercise your discretion and say that this measure is a matter which &#39;requires immediate attention. </para>

As to the second point, I submit that this is not a question of discretion, but a question of whether it is absolutely necessary that the matter should be determined now. There is nothing connected with the third reading of this Bill which renders it imperative that the discussion should proceed now. Unless it be assumed - and I am sure you will be the first to resent such an assumption - that it is part of your duty as President to give decisions te assist the Government in getting through particular measures- </para>

                            <para>- So far as concerns the first point - that notice of dissent from my ruling should be given at once - I have, ever since I became President of the Senate, given the greatest latitude to every honorable senator in this connexion ; and I am not going to refuse to accept the motion on the ground suggested. I may have permitted, not only on this, but on other occasions, honorable senators to speak after I have given a ruling, when it would have been better to prevent discussion ; and I am afraid that that latitude has induced honorable senators, in some instances, perhaps, to dispute rulings which otherwise would have been accepted. However, that is by the way. As I say, I am not going to rule this motion out of order on the ground that the objection to it was not taken at once. Now I come to the second question, and I ask what is the meaning of the words &#34; unless the matter requires immediate determination.&#34; I confess that I am in some doubt as to the meaning, and as to who is to decide, but I do not think it can possibly say that the debate on a particular Bill shall take precedence of the debate on any other Bill. I am very sorry at having to arrive at this conclusion, because - but perhaps I had better not say. However, I rule that the debate stands adjourned until to-morrow. </para>

                    <para>.- When the Bill was last before the Committee the point was raised that a portion&#39; of clause 11 of the Spirits Bill, which provides that Australian spirits must be matured, should not operate until a certain date. I promised honorable senators that I would look into the matter, and see if I could meet the objections levelled at the clause. It was pointed out that clause n of the Spirits Bill conflicted with the second paragraph of clause 2 of the Bill now before us, and in order to meet the case I have had an amendment drafted to strike out all the words after &#34; Provided &#34; in the second paragraph of clause 2, and to insert in lieu&#34; thereof the words - &#34; that spirits distilled wholly from grape wine and spirits n.e.i. may, until the thirty-first day of December, One thousand nine hundred and seven, inclusive, be delivered at the respective rates of duty specified in the Excise Tariff 1902.&#34; </para>

                    <para>. - The suggestion is that the Committee should pass this item on the promise of the Minister that he will recommit clause 2 in order that we may make the alteration indicated. I think we are perfectly safe in permitting the item to pass on such an understanding. But I would point out that if - brandy made from grape wine is put into human consumption at any time before 1907, and it has not been matured by two years storage in wood under Excise supervision, it will be subject to an Excise duty of ns. The provision will utterly and entirely defeat the object that the Tariff Commission had in view when it framed its recommendation, which has met with the cordial approval of a large majority of the Committee. I am convinced that if we permit raw spirits to go out immediately under a duty of its., it will be sent out by the distillers in preference to storing it for two years in wood. In other words, the Australian distiller will much prefer to pay an Excise duty of ns. on his raw spirit, and send it out for consumption as brandy than to keep it maturing in wood for two years, and then have to pay an Excise duty of only 10s. I wish to make him store it in wood in order to secure a good name for Australian brandy. The members of the Tariff Commission are at one that unless the distiller stores his spirit in wood for two years, he will not do what we desire he should do. I am going to suggest later on that we should make him pay an Excise duty of 13s. if he desires to put his spirit at once into consumption, with the alternative that if he keeps it in wood for two years we will let him take it out of bond at an Excise duty ot 1 os. </para>

                    GOULD, (New South Wales) &#91;8.32&#93;.- The reason assigned for not allowing spirits to be distributed without maturity is that it might be injurious to the public health. It has been assumed that distillers will be prepared to pay an extra duty of is. per gallon in order to get their spirits into consumption at once, and
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline>
                    has said that if the Excise is made 13s. per gallon or a difference of 3s., -he will not object to spirits that have not been matured going at once into consumption. If it is really a qu.es- tion of preventing the consumption of immature spirits in the interests of public health, the difference between 3s. and is. per gallon should not be considered by the Committee. Whilst immature spirit distributed for consumption might not be so palatable or so good as spirit matured for two or three years in wood, no evidence was given before the Commission to show that its consumption has been responsible for any injury to the public health, and if sv.ch spirit is fit for human consumption;, there should be no special or undue restrictions placed upon it. Of course if it is unfit for human consumption, steps should be taken to prevent its being placed on the market.

                        <para>.- If the honorable senator had followed the remarks I made on the second reading of the-Bill, he would know that I indicated that I see no necessity for requiring these spirits to be matured for two years in wood under Customs supervision. I explained that a Committee of the House of Commons, after taking the evidence of men skilled in questions concerning the public health, came to the conclusion that there was no necessity to make any restriction. Of course there is always the power to prevent the distribution of spirits shown to be unfit for human consumption. That power will still be reserved, and if there is any ground for supposing that certain spirit is unfit for human consumption, and the analyst gives a certificate to that effect, the Minister will decline to allow it to go out of bond except as methylated spirit. I have referred&#39; to this matter because it is intimately associated with the question of revenue to which I propose to refer, and because if I had not done so, my position might be misconceived. In the report of the Tariff Commission, it is shown that the distillation of brandy has increased in South Australia, New South Wales, and Victoria, and if that be the case, there should be no necessity to reduce the Excise duty as proposed, in order to protect the industry, and put more of the money of the people into the pockets of the distillers. I should like honorable senators to bear in mind that local distillers pay duty only on proof spirit, which is a decided advantage, although I suppose importers get over the difficulty in most cases by importing spirit at proof or over proof, and then breaking it down. It might be said that if local distillers are given a greater amount of protection, that will lead to the employment of a larger number of persons in the industry, but the fact remains that distillation in the Commonwealth has increased under existing conditions with a protection of 3s. per gallon. If that be the case, we have a right to consider the interests of the revenue. The Minister said that he had been advised by his officers that probably there will be a loss to the revenue of from &#163;70,000 to &#163;80,000 or &#163;90,000 a year. That is, I know, a calculation which has also been made privately, assuming that only a small proportion of imported spirits be replaced with locally distilled spirits. It should be borne in mind, however, that if that is likely to be the loss of revenue in the first year, and we are to encourage a larger amount of distillation, it must increase year by year, and before very long we shall be called upon to face a loss of twice &#163;80,000 or &#163;90,000 a year, and possibly, as years go on, treble the amount.&#39; It was suggested by an honorable senator the other day that when that time did arrive, we might then very well take action. That is one way of dealing with the matter, but I wish to impress upon the Committee that while the revenue is gradually decreasing the expenditure is steadily increasing. In a day or two we shall be called upon to consider a Bill which provides for the payment of &#163;500,000 in bounties, at the rate of &#163;50,000 or &#163;75,000 a year, during a period of years. The enactment of the Bill would make an additional inroad upon the revenue. Then the Government propose to introduce penny postage, which, if adopted, would involve a loss of &#163;120,000, or possibly more, per annum. In the face of those proposals, we are now called upon to cut down the revenue from the spirit duties, and at the same time to give an additional benefit to the local distillers, although it has been proved that at the present time they enjoy ample protection for their industry. It has been pointed out here by their representatives that both Tasmania and Queensland need to get as large a revenue as possible through Customs and Excise &#39;duties. We have been resisting very strongly a proposal to spend &#163;20,000 upon a railway survey ; but here is a proposal which, if adopted, would affect the amount of the revenue year by year. I ask honorable senators to pause before they consent to throw away more revenue, especially when it has been shown that that sacrifice is not necessary in order to promote the interests of local manufacturers. Although it is true that every industry gives employment to additional men, still it is always possible to pay too high a premium in order to secure that result. I do not propose, however, to submit an amendment until I have heard an expression of opinion from honorable senators. I have no wish to injure existing industries, which I know from the evidence and the report of the Tariff Commission, have greatly improved. Four members of that body suggested that the Customs duty on spirits might be reduced to 13s. a gallon, in order to make a difference of 3s. between the two duties, while two others were prepared to &#39; reduce the Customs duty, by the sum of 6d. </para>

So far from agreeing to that recommendation the Government submitted a proposal to increase the Customs duty to 15s., and increase the protection to 5s., but it was rejected by the other House. The proposal of a proportion of the members of the. Commission, I understand, was to fix the difference at 3s. or 3s. 6d. per gallon. </para>

                        <para>.- The Select Committee of the House of Commons, after listening to the evidence of experienced chemists, came to the conclusion that the rectified spirits which were introduced into brandy or whisky were of a pure character, and that, even when they were introduced without being sufficiently matured, the flavour was improved. There is no reason to make a distinction unless it be on the ground of protecting the public health. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to correct an impression which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould,</inline> and other honorable senators, may have produced with respect to the object of some members of the Tariff Commission in providing for the storage of spirits in bond for two years, and to explain why <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> and myself were prepared, under certain circumstances, to agree to a reduction of the import dutv by 6d. per* gallon. The object was chiefly to insure that the pure grape brandy of Australia should acquire a reputation. Some members of the Commission considered that if either pure grape brandy, or pure malt whisky, were stored in wood for two years, certified by an officer, and labelled as such, it would acquire a certain reputation, as well as promote the public health. On the other hand, with respect to the reduction of 6d. in the import duty to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> and I agreed, it was recommended that imported spirits should also be stored in wood for two years. It was also recommended that the low Excise duty of 10s. per gallon should be allowed on pure grape brandy, made in a specified way, and pure malt whisky. It will be noticed that the Excise duty on blended brandy or blended whisky is higher. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> and I agreed to admit imported brandy at 13s. 6d. per gallon, it was on the condition that it should be certified to <inline font-style="italic">be</inline> pure grape brandy, and not brandy blended with a highly rectified spirit. In the same way, imported whisky was to be a pure malt whisky, and not a whisky containing a certain proportion of malt whisky, and a far higher proportion of a highly rectified spirit. If we could get any reliable certification that spirit is pure grape brandy or pure malt whisky which has been stored in wood for two years, I should still be prepared to concede the reduction of 6d. per gallon. But I feel quite sure that no pure grape brandy is imported. Not enough of the article is made in Europe to supply its requirements, and it commands a verv high price. From my knowledge of distilling in both Ireland and Scotland, I know that there is scarcely such a thing as a pure malt whisky distilled. All whisky is distilled from malt and grain. </para>

                    <para>- - I was very glad to hear the speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> because I expect that he will join with me in seeking to raise the Excise duty on pure grape brandy. If he is prepared to allow a reduction of 6d. pes gallon on imported spirit, surely he will give similar facilities to the local distiller. We have been accustomed to a difference of 3s. between the Customs and Excise duties, but here it is proposed to make a difference of 4s1. per gallon, where it is not wanted, because the industry has been doing very well. We ought not to do away with a very large source of revenue which is required. In accordance with the opinion of six out of eight members of the Tariff Commission, the difference ought to be fixed at 3s. 6d. per gallon, and four considered the present duty of 3s. sufficient. </para>

                <para class="block">Honorable senators will see that a proposal is made by the Government to make an allowance on brandy less than 16.5 under proof. At present a spirit 16.5 under proof pays the same duty as proof spirit does. In that way a considerable advantage is given to the local &#39;production over imported spirit. I think that adi the arguments go to show that, apart from the recommendations of the Tariff Commission, it would be a reasonable thing to increase the Excise by is., in order to put grape brandy in the same position as it stands under the Excise Tariff of 1902.

                    <para>. - I do not think that the honorable senator has given sufficient reasons why we should alter the schedule as proposed. The Tariff Commission has recommended that grape brandy distilled in a pot still, matured by storage in wood for a period of not less than two years, and certified by an officer to be pure brandy, shall pay 10s. per gallon. The other branch of the .Legislature has adopted that recommendation, and I ask the Committee to adhere to it. </para>

                    <para>.- I am sorry that we cannot obtain an estimate of the effect upon the revenue of any alterations that may be proposed in the schedule. We know that the whole schedule is estimated to reduce the revenue by &#163;70,000 or &#163;80,000, but we do not know what will be the effect of an alteration in any particular item. The question of revenue is a serious one. I point out that if the recommendations of four members of the Tariff Commission were carried out - that is to say, if brandy were allowed to come in at a reduced import duty - the effect would be to reduce the amount of protection on the article to 3s. If the second rider attached to the Commission&#39;s report&#39; were carried out the effect would be to reduce the protection to 3s. 6d. There is not the slightest possibility of the Government acting upon either of those recommendations in the direction of altering the import duty. But we might safely adopt the recommendation of the members of the Tariff Commission who signed the second rider, so far as the amount of protection is concerned. As four members of the Commission have proposed to reduce the margin to 3s., making the duty ns.y -and two members have proposed to reduce the margin by 6d., which would be equivalent to; altering the Excise to 10s. 6d., I think we might reasonably add 6d. to the Excise for the sake of securing more revenue. </para>

                        <para>- I am sorry to hear that statement, because this was a recommendation made by the whole of the Tariff Commission, and it has a distinct bearing on the amount of protection we have given. What we said was, &#34; Treat imported spirits and locally manufactured spirits in the same way with regard to the question of under proof, and then we shall deliberately, in order to get high-class brandies, give a margin of 4s.&#34; For a freetrader like myself to make such a concession is a great deal ; and I do not know how either <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> or myself can support the item unless the whole of the. conditions are complied with. Spirits vary, pf course, as to the percentage under proof, but they are taxed per centum&#39;; and if a tax is applied to the locally manufactured spirit on one standard, and to imported spirit on another, I desire the Committee to understand that the difference, which means the protection, will be considerably increased in some cases. All the members of -the Tariff Commission, including, the four protectionist members, did not desire such a result, but were perfectly willing that the protection of 4s. should be inclusive - that there should be no means of making the difference greater. I really desired to vote for item No. 1 as it stands, but I should be departing from my own recommendation if I did so, and I should find myself in a position in which I should be compelled to accept the increased Excise duty later on, because the Government refused to give the same allowance. </para>

                    <para>. - I cannot make the promise desired by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons.</inline> This matter has been considered by another place and by the Government, and the conclusion has been arrived at that if we make the allowance suggested we shall only be losing revenue. If a proposal which the Government made in another place had been agreed to this particular recommendation of the Tariff Commission might have been adopted. The proposal was to increase the import duty, and also the Excise duty by1s., and by that means lose practically no revenue. However, the members of another place would not agree to that proposal ; and the Government have declined to adopt every recommendation of the Tariff Commission which would tend to decrease revenue. We are losing a very large amount of revenue just now, and we cannot afford to lose any more, and we should lose more if we adopted <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons&#39;</inline> proposal. Of course, there would be no loss if we raised the Excise duty. </para>

                    <para>.- The recommendations of the Tariff Commission, with a few verbal alterations, are embodied in the schedule. I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> desires that some promise should be made on the part of the Government that the concession referred to in the recommendation should be given effect to. But the recommendation is made only on the understanding that the Excise duties proposed by the Commission are adopted. I could understand <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> making his suggestion to the Government if the schedule had been carried as it stands, but surely it is premature to talk about a concession of the kind at this particular stage. </para>

                    <para>. - It seems to me that this item is somewhat ambiguously worded. As I read it the foundation of this blended wine brandy must be wine. I know that several honorable senators read it otherwise. As regards the 25 per cent. of the blend referred to, it need only be rectified up to 40 per cent. over proof, whilst, as regards the proportion of 75 per cent., it may be rectified to any extent, but it must be wine spirit. </para>

                        <para>- Or rice, or any other kind of grain. What is required of this particular blend of spirits is that it shall be composed of 25 per cent. of spirit distilled from grape wine under certain conditions. With regard to that I have nothing to say ; but it is provided that 85 per cent. of the blend may be composed of spirit distilled from any kind of grain, in any way. From what we have heard in the course of the debate, if it is distilled from barley it will be more suitable for whisky than for other spirits. If used for other spirits it must be distilled to a high degree of strength, usually by means of a patent still. So that we have a provision here for the use of 75 per cent, of what is called silent spirit distilled from grain in such a way that the peculiarities attaching to the grain are removed, and it becomes a product which, according to experts, is absolutely indistinguishable from spirit distilled from molasses. What I am asking is that the discrimination against molasses spirit, which it is not asserted is unwholesome, shall be removed. I claim that with regard to the proportion of 75 per cent, of the blended spirits dealt with in this item, there should be no bar against spirit distilled from molasses. </para>

                    <para>. - This matter was very fully debated in another place. It is a fact that the Tariff Commission did recommend that these spirits should be blended so far as regards the proportion of 75 per cent, with spirit obtained from any source, but after due consideration the Government came to the conclusion that the blend should be spirit distilled from grain. Grain spirit blends naturally with whisky. The blended spirits dealt with in the item represent really what is known as the ordinary brandy of commerce. Item No. 2 does not refer to the brandy of commerce, but to an absolutely pure wine brandy. </para>

                        <para>- No; so far as we are concerned, it will be blended spirits. The only question is whether we should allow a blend of molasses spirit, potato spirit, and all kinds of spirits with the spirit distilled from grape wine, or whether we should allow a blend only of a grain spirit. The question was decided in another place in the way shown in the item, after a very considerable amount of discussion, and I think without any division. Although I cannot make out so good a case for the use of grain spirit only, in this instance as I can with regard to whisky- </para>

                        <para>- Here is another error due to slavishly following what somebody else has done. We should have a little bit of originality about our proceedings. We had some originality this afternoon. Let us keep it up. I would ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> if he cannot devise some phrase which would be more acceptable than an all round proposition covering distillation from anything under Heaven. I know what the honorable senator desires to accomplish, and I am with him. I desire that at least under this item of the schedule the wholesome spirits distilled from molasses, which is in itself a wholesome material, may have a show. The schedule also provides for whisky to be distilled from grain. Any kind of grain would &#34;fill the bill.&#34; Under the clause grain which was musty, weavilly, semi-destroyed, or rotten, would be grain, and I think could be used for distilling purposes. Surely spirit distilled from such grain would not be as wholesome to the consumer as spirit distilled from molasses ! The great natural industry of Queensland should not be excluded in the interests of other States which do not produce molasses. The cane-growers of New South Wales have just as much right to be considered in this legislation as have the grain-growers of South Australia or Victoria. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> can modify his amendment as I have suggested, I shall be very happy to vote with him. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not think that the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> is as bad as the clause. If honorable senators will refer to clause 7 of the Spirits Bill, they will see that it attempts to carry on the effort which has been made to give a distinctive importance to the very best qualities of spirits which can be produced in the Commonwealth. It reads as follows : - </para>

But when we turn, to clause 3, we find that there is no description or certificate provided for. The descriptions were not contained in the Bill as it was originally drafted, but were inserted in the other House. The clause comes in as an absolute hybrid. It is suggested that we should make special provision for a kind of brandy. Suppose that it was made from 25 per. cent, of grape wine and 75 per cent, of grape spirit, that would not be brandy. Still, it could be sold as brandy. </para>

                        <para>- There is no provision to prevent the article from being labelled anything. It would really be a hybrid. It would be an Australian product, in which no Australian could take any pride. I do not think that there ought to be such a provision made, and I would much sooner see it struck out. If such a mixture could be produced, it ought to come under the item of &#34; spirits, n.e.i.&#34; At any rate, we ought not to encourage distillers to produce it. I intend to oppose the clause. By his amendment, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> is practically asking the Committee to allow Joshua Brothers or any other firm to take spirits which they can purchase at 9d. per gallon, and by the use of 75 per cent, of that spirit and 25 per cent, of grape wine produce an article subject to an Excise duty of only 12s. per gallon. My only fear is that if the amendment were made such spirits would be largely produced and consumed. What I would suggest to the Minister is that he should strike out the item. </para>

                    <para>.- It is evident that the &#34; brandy of commerce &#34; has been produced in order to perpetrate a fraud upon the public. There is no compound brandy which is not distilled wholly from grape wine. In the <inline font-style="italic">two</inline> previous clauses we have provided for different blends of brandy, namely, pure grape brandy and blended brandy, and having done that we have done all that is required. I am inclined to agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> that the best thing we can do with blended spirit is to let it come under the item of &#34; Spirits n.e.i.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- If there is a possibility of the clause being passed I shall vote for the amendment, because I desire to insure that the public shall get as pure a spirit as possible. There is no doubt that the arguments of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> in that connexion are unanswerable. The Minister said that grain spirit blended naturally with wine spirit. But I hold that it is an unnatural union. One of the main objects of the Bill, I think, is to establish a high standard of Australian liquor. Therefore we should not do anything which would militate against its accomplishment. If, however, we gave a protection of 2 s. per gallon to blended spirit of this kind, it would not be likely to tend in that direction. It should be borne in mind that the blended spirit would also come into competition with pure Australian malt whisky, and with blended whisky. If it were allowed to compete with blended whisky it would injure an article which is eminently safe and good. I have heard medical men say that the worst drink a man can take if he has to drink at all is bad brandy. I do not intend to encourage the perpetration of a fraud upon the public. I feel inclined to vote against the clause, but if it is not possible to secure its omission, I shj.ll support the amendment, because spirits distilled from molasses are, I hold, just as good as spirits distilled from grain. </para>

                        <para>-I think that we should strike out the item. If distillers are going to prepare a. liquor which will not be creditable to the Commonwealth, and which is a blend between grain and grape spirit, it should pay Excise duty as spirits, n.e.i., and only receive the advantage of the difference between the Excise duty and the export duty - namely,1s. per gallon. What is proposed, however, is to permit the manufacture of a spurious kind of spirit, and to give to it the enormous protection of 3s. per gallon. It has been argued by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> that molasses is a very wholesome material from which to manufacture so-called brandy. The stuff from which this spirit is made is certainly not fit for food. I can assure the Committee that the so-called molasses which is used for spirit distillation is stuff that even a blackfellow would not eat. It is simply the dregs or residue remaining after all the wholesome molasses has been extracted. I have seen such stuff sold in Java for 5s. per ton. </para>

                    SMITH.The colour proves that it is not made from pure sugar, which is white. We ought not to give a substantial protection to distillers to produce a spirit which will not be creditable to the Commonwealth, and which is 25 per cent, grape spirit, and 75 per cent, grain spirit ; the grain, as
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline>
                    has pointed out, meaning any kind df grain. We ought not to allow the enormous loss of revenue which will undoubtedly result from permitting the wide margin of 3s. between the import duty and the Excise. If we struck out the whole item, it would still mean giving a margin of1s. to the distillers. The present Excise is 13s., and the export duty 14s., the protection being ample. I shall vote for excising the item.

                    <para>. - It is provided that blended whisky shall consist of not less than 25 per cent, of pure barley malt spirit, whilst the balance of 75 per cent, may be made from other grain. It seems to be fully established that, unless there is some special restriction as to the method of distillation, molasses spirit is as wholesome as that produced from grain. According to the item as it stands, any kind of grain may be used for the production of 75 per cent, of the spirit forming the blend. My desire is to permit of the use of molasses spirit in making up blended whisky, and I should be content if the word &#34; materials &#34; were substituted for the word &#34; grain.&#34; I am not particularly wedded to that term, but am willing to adopt it, because it has been recommended by the Tariff Commission. If it would prove more acceptable to the Committee, I should be prepared to substitute the word &#34;molasses.&#34; With regard to 75 per cent, of the proposed blend, it would be absolutely necessary to distil the spirit to a high degree of purity in order to eliminate the deleterious elements, and the product in the form of silent spirit would be indistinguishable from the molasses spirit, which would be just as wholesome..

                    <para>. - I trust that the Committee will not agree to the amendment. Whisky as made in Scotland and Ireland is composed entirely of spirit distilled from pure barley malt or from grain. I have never heard of any such thing as a whisky made of any other than grain spirit. As a rule, in Scotland and Ireland, whisky contains about 25 per cent, of malt spirit. The dextrine in the malt converts the starch in the crushed grain into sugar, and the sugar in the process of fermentation produces alcohol. The spirit is distilled mostly in patent stills, the product of which is often of quite a low alcoholic strength as that made in the pot stills, and is equally as good for human consumption. Whisky blenders in the old country are not permitted to use any other than grain spirit. I would remind honorable senators that we are giving Australian blended whisky a name, and are imposing upon the blenders the necessity to comply with certain conditions. If we attach the name &#34; Australian blended whisky &#34; to a product composed partly of pure barley malt spirit and partly of spirit produced from molasses, we shall interfere seriously with the reputation and sale of the article. </para>

                <para class="block">Such a product might be called rum or &#34;molasses spirits.&#34; If the words &#34;any other materials&#34; be used, the spirit might be made from potatoes, beet, or any other material, and the Australian blended whisky would not sell. If the whisky made in the Commonwealth is to have a good name, it must be made from pure malt; and, when so made, it will be certified as Australian standard malt whisky. There may, however, be a blended Australian whisky, the materials of which are clearly set forth in the Bill. </para>

                    <para>. - I should like to point out the difference there is between the proposal before us and the recommendation of the Tariff Commission. In dealing with the question of blended whisky, the Tariff Commission recommend that such shall be whisky &#34; which shall have been separately distilled by the pot still, or similar process, at a strength not exceeding 35 per cent, over proof.&#34; The proposal in the Bill is that this blended whisky shall have been distilled at a strength not exceeding 45 per cent, over proof. The Commission had a lot of evidence as to the different methods of distillation, and we came to the conclusion that if whisky be wanted - although I admit the point is in doubt - it ought to be distilled in a pot still. In progress report No. 2 there is considerable reference to the comparative merits of the pot still and the patent still. I do not need, however, to read more than the following: - </para>

                <para class="block">This increase up to 45 per cent, represents an intention and a desire to allow this blended whisky to be made by the patent still, whereas the Tariff Commission, in limiting the strength to 35 per cent., showed a desire to almost compel the use of the pot still. All the members of the Tariff Commission attached considerable importance to this point. If honorable senators are going to vote for the item as it is, they will practically encourage the use of the patent stiil, and give effect to the desire of certain distillers to oust the pot still. I believe that the evidence in the United Kingdom and elsewhere is distinctly in favour of the pot still for making the best whisky. </para>

                        <para>- There is a limitation with regard to the method of distillation applying to the 25 per cent., which is intended to retain the impurities which give a distinctive character to the spirit. But with regard to the 75 per cent, of the blend, there is no such provision. It may be a spirit distilled in a patent still or in any other way whatever, and after it has undergone that process, it is indistinguishable, no matter from what material it has been distilled. It may be distilled from any kind of grain, but if distilled at such a strength as to eliminate the so-called impurities, it will be indistinguishable from spirit distilled from molasses, which all the experts say is as <inline font-style="italic">wholesome</inline> as spirit distilled from any kind of grain. The experts&#39; say that spirit distilled at a certain strength become absolutely featureless and neutral, and the same whether distilled from one material or another. This item makes provision for the use in the blend of 75 per cent, of that kind of spirit. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope that the Committee will not adopt this request. It is true that this item provides that as regards 25 per cent, of the blend, it shall be rectified up to 45 per cent, &#39;over proof, but nothing is said as regards the balance of 75 per cent. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> suggests that it will be composed of a neutral spirit. So far as my information goes, the honorable senator is entirely wrong. Grain spirit can be rectified even up to 60 per cent, over proof, and retain much of its destructive character.. The point is that no distiller would think for a moment of rectifying his grain spirit up to such a strength as would, make it a neutral spirit. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake&#39;s</inline> case depends on the supposition that this, whisky will be made of 25 per cent, pure malt spirit, and 75 per cent.&#39; neutral spirit. But to make true whisky the 75 per cent, must necessarily retain a large degree of its distinctive character. Rectification might take place to a strength between 40 and 50 per cent, over proof, but even above that .strength the distinctive character of the grain is retained. The honorable and learned senator desires that the item should be so amended that it will be possible to substitute molasses for grain spirit in this blended whisky. If molasses spirit is used it must be a neutral spirit. There must he no trace of molasses in it, or that would spoil the whisky altogether. I think that members of the Tariff Commission will support my statement that it is vital to this item that the spirits of which the blend ds composed must be grain spirits. </para>

                        <para>- If it is made from molasses spirit the blend will not be- a whisky at all. In my second-reading speech I quoted at some length from the opinions of leading distillers to show that the chief constituents from which whisky must be made are oats, wheat, maize, and, of course, barley. If spirit be made from molasses it is deliberately misleading the public to dare to call it whisky. We should be careful in dealing with this Bill that the public shall not be supplied with, a spirit under the name of whisky which is not whisky. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot say. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> has raised a point which has been discussed a great deal of late; - 1&#34; refer to the relative merits of the pot and patent stills. The Coffey, or patent still, has been used by the leading distilleries of the world for the past sixty or seventy years. The DCL distillery, which has an annual output of 10,000,000 gallons, has used that still during the whole of the period I have indicated. They employ maize, rye, and oats, and the product of all or any of these is distilled either in the pot still or in the patent still. </para>

                        <para>- Dunville and Company, distillers, of Belfast, who manufacture about 2,500,000 gallons of spirits annually, use both the patent and the pot stills. So far as I understand the relative merits of these two stills, it cannot be denied that excellent whisky can be marie from both. The only difference between them is that the patent still is more rapid in its action. If we are careful of the degree of strength to which a spirit may be rectified, it is quite immaterial whether it is distilled by means of the patent or the pot still. But for the reasons which I have urged, we should not support the request of <inline font-weight="bold">.Senator Drake.</inline></para>

                    <para>. - I shall oppose the amendment, but not because spirits made from molasses are , more injurious than any other highly-rectified spirit. That is not the question at issue. During the past twelve months I have heard a great deal in reference to the respective virtues of the pot still and the patent still, and I really cannot understand why the House of Representatives has departed from the recommendation of the Tariff Commission in respect of the manufacture of whisky. From the sworn evidence tendered to that body, I am satisfied that the very best whisky is always produced by means of the pot still. Of course those who have &#39;adopted the patent still have done so because it is more rapid in&#39; its action, and cheaper. But if we! desire to secure a genuine spirit, it must be distilled by means of the pot still. Why another place has sanctioned the distillation of whisky at a higher strength than that recommended by the Tariff Commission I cannot understand. Honorable senators must always recollect , that the higher a spirit is rectified the more costly does it become, and consequently when a distiller is manufacturing whisky out of grain as well as out of malt, he will naturally rectify it only to that degree of strength which is absolutely necessary to produce whisky. Consequently, the idea of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> that spirit  made from different varieties of grain will be rectified to such a high degree of strength that it will become neutral spirit, is nonsense. </para>

                        <para>- But I would point out to the honorable senator that the cost of doing what he suggests will be too great .for any distiller to incur . If we permit whisky to be blended with spirit of a higher degree of strength than itself, it will naturally require more breaking down and will not contain the properties which, are essential to a good whisky. I do not know whether any honorable senator intends to submit an amendment in favour of adhering to the recommendation of the Tariff Commission that spirit shall only be rectified up to 35 degrees over proof. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable senator does that I shall support him. I shall oppose any attempt to blend with malt spirit any spirit other than that which is manufactured from grain. That course of action is not prompted by the fear that molasses spirit is unwholesome. Rum may Be just as wholesome as whisky or brandy. But rum should be distilled from the byproducts of sugar, brandy from the products of the vine, and whisky should be manufactured from grain. I may tell honorable senators that grain and malt are often mixed before distillation takes place. But here we provide for a different method. We declare that there shall be at least 25 per cent, of malt spirit in the spirit distilled. As the production of whisky from malt is more expensive than its distillation from grain, it necessarily follows that in any blend distillers will use the maximum of the one and the minimum of the other class of spirit. I trust that we shall not allow any spirit other than that which is produced from grain to be blended, with, any article which is sold as whisky. </para>

It will be observed that, although the distillation of pure barley malt spirit is allowed up to a strength of 45 per cent, over proof, it is not to exceed that limit. The Tariff Commission recommended that it should be allowed to be distilled up to a strength not exceeding 35 per cent, over proof. I should imagine that a sufficient reason was given in the other House for increasing the maximum strength to 45per cent, over proof. I see that some witnesses speak of 35 per cent, over-proof as being the limit to which its distillation should be allowed. </para>

                        <para>- I think that, except in regard to spirits of the finest quality, the Excise should equal the import duty. It is proposed to levy a duty of only11s. per gallon on whisky, 75 per cent, of which may be spirit distilled from rice, rye, or any kind of grain, only the remaining 25 per cent, being pure barley malt spirit. The former Excise was 13s. a gallon. As the import duty is 14s., there is a difference of 3s. a gallon in favour of the local distiller. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> has pointed out that pot still whisky costs probably 4s. a gallon to produce, but I do not think that we should give as much protection to a poor spirit such as this blended whisky as we give to blended wine brandy, for instance, which has also an Excise of 11s. I therefore move - </para>

                    <para>. - I hope that the Committee will not insist that gin shall be matured for two years in wood. It was shown during the second-reading debate that it would be a great injustice to subject good gin to treatment that would discolour and injure its sale, because intending purchasers would naturally be suspicious if given an article of the colour of light brandy or whisky. Maturing in wood for two years would provide a deliberate incentive to adulteration. When the spirit is pure white the introduction of adulterants is difficult, but when it is coloured the presence of a foreign ingredient is hidden. We shall not improve the quality of gin by requiring it to be matured in wood for two years. Gin so treated loses its distinctive appearance, and its commercial value must necessarily suffer.

                    <para>- - I freely admit that the Tariff Commission has blundered, so far as this question is concerned. We came to the conclusion that all these spirits would be improved by being matured in wood, forgetting that gin, which is highly rectified and colourless, would be injuriously affected by being so treated. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith&#39;s</inline> criticism was quite justified. If these words were allowed to remain in the item injury would be done to the industry. They should not appear in the schedule, as the effect of storage in wood would be to cause the discoloration of gin without any value being added to it by reason of its having matured for the period fixed. </para>

It has been clearly demonstrated by some of the leading scientists in Great Britain that gin does not require to be matured for two years, and that it loses its commercial value by being stored in wood, since it not only becomes discolured, but has a tendency to deteriorate.

I believe the matter is dealt with by regulations under the Distillation Act, and I would ask the Minister of Defence to make inquiries with a view of asserting whether this spirit is of the character described by me, and if so, to direct that the vignerons in Queensland shall be allowed to use it. </para>
