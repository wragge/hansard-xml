                    <para>. - I find from a newspaper extract that an old personal friend of mine, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles,</inline> has made some remarks with regard to certain imports, which, I presume, would be affected by the passing of this Bill, and they are of such an erroneous nature that I believe I am justified in drawing the attention of the Senate to them. Speaking from wrong information, no doubt he believed what he said. In a speech he referred to a sum of no less than ;£i 1,000,000 in sovereigns having been sent to America to pay for goods which were imported therefrom, and which might very easily have been produced in our own country. I happen to know something about the figures to which he referred, and I take the liberty of mentioning' the facts here, so that he may not repeat the mistake. The goods may possibly be considered to have been exported by American trusts and others. I happen to possess information about some of the transactions. </para>

                        <para>- It was made in respect of the same years as the honorable senator referred to. Great Britain, as we all know, is a debtor country to the United States for food products, and Aus.tralia is a debtor country to Great Britain for importations. From London the banks in Australia got instructions to send large remittances in gold to San Francisco not to pay for goods bought from America, but for goods which Great Britain had bought there. In place of sending the gold to Great Britain and thence to New York, it was sent under those instructions direct to America. The honorable senator therefore was under a misapprehension in supposing that the payment was in respect of goods brought into Australia from America. Let me read exactly what he said. Speaking at Cobram on Tuesday, of last week I presume, he said - </para>

                    <para>During the same five years Australia sent only £5,500,000 worth of merchandise to the United States, but sent £11,000,000 in sovereigns to be distributed amongst the manufacturers, middlemen and operatives of the great Republic of America, instead of distributing that enormous sum amongst the manufacturers, middlemen and operatives of the great Commonwealth of the south. Had that £11,000,000 in sovereigns been expended in Australia not a single person need have been out of work during the period named. About 80 per cent, of the people of Australia are native bom, and he asked them to think over these plain statements. If after having given the matter full consideration any Australian not being interested ' in the shinning trade, or getting a living or making a fortune out of imports, would send good Australian money across the sea for articles which could be produced in his own country by his own people, he was at all events unpatriotic, if not a fiscal crank. </para>

                <para class="block">I think it will be seen - and I hope the public will recognise and take note of the fact - that sometimes our honorable friends on the other side make grave mistakes as to the reason why gold is sent to America. It is often sent there to pay for goods which are got from our own countrymen in Great Britain, to whom we wish to offer a preference. The statement I have quoted was, if I may say so, unworthy of my honorable friend. </para>

There is no question that it is one of transcendant importance and entirely novel ; that in its drafting those concerned had nothing to guide them ; that from first to last it had to be thought out here, and that it is honeycombed with possibilities of trouble. So far from, any time having been unduly consumed in the consideration of this important and momentous measure, I venture to say that it has not been sufficiently discussed, and that the exact consequences of many of its clauses are not even yet perceived by its authors. </para>

                        <para>- It was owing, perhaps, to the absence of some honorable senators who, at times, deliver long and tedious speeches to which nobody wants to listen, and which are simply addressed to the reporters, in order that they may be read by their constituents. These honorable gentlemen were in another part of the building, and the consequence was that the argument was very close and exceedingly well reasoned. All the amendments which were moved by me were marked in my copy of the Bill to be moved, and I felt it my duty to move them. In doing so, I said just as little as was possible to make the meaning of each proposal clear to the Committee ; there was no waste of time. I do not see a printed copy of the Bill in the Chamber. In standing order 204 there is a direction that a Bill, if reported with amendments, shall, before the adoption of the report is moved, be printed, and the object of the direction is that we shall be able to see in what form it appears when the amendments have been made. That is the reason why, I take it. the consideration of a Bill, when reported from Committee with amendments, is delayed until a future day. The standing order reads - </para>

                        <para>- Undoubtedly, the honorable senator has correctly interpreted the standing order. The object of postponing the adoption of the report is that honorable senators shall be able to see a fair copy of the Bill as agreed to in Committee ; but, under the circumstances - as he knows we did not adjourn until nearly 3 o'clock this morning - it is difficult for the printer to supply printed copies of the amended Bill in time for our next meeting. If we cannot get them, they cannot be circulated. </para>

                        <para>- Last night I raised the question as to whether the expression " future day " in the standing order did not mean a future day in the ordinary calendar sense. It would seem from what has occurred that that interpretation would be more in consonance with the meaning of the .standing order, because the object of the delay is no doubt to enable honorable senators to have a copy of the Bill with the amendments printed therein, so that they may know what they are speaking about. It might happen that a sitting of the Senate would .extend so far into the next day that it would be absolutely impossible for the standing order to be complied with. </para>

                        <para>- I have not the slightest objection to let the Bill stand over until next Tuesday if honorable senators wish to go through it careful])1, but it is a most unusual course for them to adopt. There is not the slightest necessity for it either, because the Bill will undoubtedly be in print next Tuesday, and then they will have an opportunity to move its recommittal on the motion for the third reading. That opportunity would be quite equal to moving its recommittal now. Nothing is gained by the action taken by honorable senators opposite. </para>

                    <para>. - The Minister distinctly gave a promise that the Bill will be taken on Tuesday next. This is an absolute and gross breach of faith. Did I not withdraw my point of order ' upon the distinct understanding that the Bill would go over until Tuesday? I appeal to the Senate as to whether that is not so. Every honorable senator present heard my words. I said that if the Minister was content that the Bill should go over until Tuesday I would withdraw my point of order. That took away the advantage which I possessed. Now, however, the Minister proposes to take the Bill at a later hour to-day. He is, consciously or unconsciously, doing something which lacks the element of fairness. He will see at once the position in which he places me. Having abandoned the strong position which I occupied on the understanding that the Bill was to go over till Tuesday, he now moves that it be taken at a later hour to-day. </para>

Perhaps then honorable senators will allow me, if they fail to get the Bill back into Committee, to take the third reading shortly afterwards. That may be a fair understanding. I do not wish to lose another day. </para>

                    <para class="block">This is a Bill which consists of three clauses. The object of it is to make provision for altering a certain portion of the Constitution.

It is there provided that the Constitution shall not be altered except in the following manner: - </para>

                    <para class="block">With that provision in the Constitution, the first election of 'members of the Commonwealth Parliament was held on the 29th March, 1901. Thirty-six senators were returned, with respect to eighteen of whom it had to be provided that they, were in the first class, while the eighteen others were in the second class. In every instance, the term of service of the thirty - six senators began on the 1st January, 1 901. By consequence, the term of the senators of the first class became vacant on the 31st December, 1903. It was necessary to make provision for the election of eighteen senators to take those vacant places on the 1st January, 1904. The election was consequently held in December, 1903. The election for the House of Representatives in the first instance was also taken on the 29th March, 1901. By reason of the fact that the term of office of the members of the House of Representatives had not, under the Constitution, expired on the same day as that of the members of the Senate "of the first class," it was necessary at the last general- election, 11 order to have the elections for both Houses on the one day, that the members of the House of Representatives should forego a certain portion of their term. The senators and representatives were elected simultaneously in March, 1901. but Parliament did not meet until May of the same year, when honorable members of both Houses were sworn in. </para>

                            <para>- I think there lias been a very general expression of opinion throughout the Commonwealth that if the elections were held in March, or thereabouts, that would be preferable to their being held in November or December, or even October. One of the reasons is that the month of March or thereabouts is much more convenient for a large number in the farming community. That opinion has been very freely expressed in more than one State, and in more than one way. and this Bill has been introduced in order to meet what the Government consider a reasonable desire on the part of the great majority of the electors, and also to obviate, as far as possible, the sending of the Chambers, to the country at different times. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has asked if any guarantee is given that the elections will always be held in March. No; the Government are not in a position, and no other Government would be in a position, to give such a guarantee. But we assume that under ordinary normal circumstances - in the event of the House of Representatives continuing its full term without any penal dissolution - this Bill will, as far as is possible, secure simultaneous elections in the autumn, rather than, as at present, in the spring, or early summer. </para>

                            <para>- I may inform honorable senators that the Government tried very hard to provide in this Bill for the case of an extraordinary dissolution of the other House. Several methods were very carefully considered, but the Government came to the conclusion that, so far as any arbitrary arrangement was concerned, the disadvantages were greater than the advantages. It was intended to have a provision to meet a contingency of that kind, and the one first suggested was open to a great deal of very serious criticism. Other provisions were proposed, but, eventually, it was found that no system, which could be thought of at the moment, could be adopted without entailing considerable disadvantage. </para>

                            <para>- Perhaps so. These, however, are matters which can be best discussed when the Bill is in Committee. I tell honorable senators frankly that these considerations received a great amount of attention from all the members of the Cabinet, and different suggestions to overcome the difficulty were presented, and most carefully considered. The Government will welcome any suggestion calculated to meet any possible difficulty which may present itself. The Bill aims at insuring simultaneous elections for both Houses, and seeks to so arrange that it will be possible to hold the elections during the first, rather than during the second, six months of the year. </para>

The alterations proposed by the Bill might at first sight appear to be merely verbal ; but that is not the case. Clause 2, which deals with the rotation of senators, proposes to strike out of section 13 of the Constitution the words "the third year," and to insert instead "three years," thus making the term of every senator so many years from the beginning of his service. By clause 2 it is also sought to strike out of _ section 13 of the Constitution the words " in the year at the expiration of which," and to insert instead " within one year before." The second paragraph of section 13 of the Con,stitution is as follows: - </para>

                            <para>- The Constitution makes no provision as to when the election of senators shall be held, further than that it shall be within the year at the expiration" of which the terms of certain senators cease. The Bill makes no alteration in the principle, but, while altering the date on which the term shall cease, provides similarly that the election to fill the vacant places must take place within one year before the expiration of such term. We do not deviate from the principle, but simply alter the date on which the term of service shall cease. </para>

At the same time, it will be possible, in all cases until an extraordinary dissolution has intervened, to hold a simultaneous election for the House of Representatives, and to have that election as nearly as possible to the first assembling of the newly elected Parliament. There are other provisions in the Bill which may be regarded as consequential on those which I have already indicated. There is provision for the extension of the term of service of certain of the present senators. There is no differentiation between present senators except what <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> brought about by the operation of the Constitution as at present. Eighteen honorable senators will finish their term of service on the 31st December next. </para>

If we affirm the principle, it must take effect at some time or other; and, when it does, this addition of six months, under certain circumstances, is inevitable. The Bill has been circulated for some time, and as honorable senators are familiar with the provision of the Constitution in this connexion, they will have little difficulty in appreciating the necessity for the extension of the term of service of certain senators. </para>

                        <para>. - Insofar as this Bill aims at consulting the convenience of the electors, it is of course entitled to a favorable reception at the hands of the Senate. But many of the remarks addressed to the Senate by the Minister in support of the measure seem to me to be quite beside the question, and to overlook what to my mind is the one fatal objection to it. Let me point out that all that is contended for in favour of this Bill would disappear absolutely if the life of the other branch of the Legislature were terminated by an extraordinary dissolution. We have these dual elections now only so long as the House of Representatives runs its full time. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. We are now asked to take the serious step of altering the Constitution to secure an advantage which might be limited absolutely to one election. The advantage could not be derived at an election to take place between this and the end of the year, as the Bill could only cover an election taking place later than that date. Before then there might be not one, but two, extraordinary dissolutions of the other House. That is a matter upon which, of course, we can speculate, but as to which no one can decide with any degree of assurance. </para>

                            <para>- That is so; but I suppose that members of the Senate can at all times do that with any measure brought before them. We are being asked to amend the Constitution, a course which should not be lightly undertaken, for an entirely imaginary advantage, it being assumed that a dual election which has taken place once only in our Federal history will continue indefinitely. I say again that the whole of the benefit of this Bill disappears absolutely the moment the other House fails to complete its full term. </para>

                            <para>- My honorable friend will pardon me; but I think that it does necessarily disappear. By shortening the term of the existence of the other House, it might be possible, as was done on a previous occasion, to have the elections for both Houses on the one date. But when that is done, it might be that the next Parliament, in a time of crisis, would have its life cut short and another election take place. Is it, then, to be assumed that the other House would foreshorten its life by one-half of the usual term, and go out. in the middle of the three years term, eighteen months after an election ? </para>

                            <para>- It might do so. The members of the other House did undoubtedly, in the public interest, make a sacrifice by consenting to an earlier election than the Constitution required ; but it is not to be supposed that they will continue to do that, nor is it right that they should. If, for instance, a penal dissolution of the House of Representatives were to take place in the middle of a three years term, it would be idle to suppose that the members of that House would agree to shorten the life of the next parliamentary term by eighteen months. Even if they were willing to do so, they would have no right to do so. They would have been elected for a three years term to do certain work, and so long as they were competent as a House to discharge the work required to be done, they, would have no. justification for abandoning their posts and going up for re-election before the time for which they had been elected had expired. I have endeavoured, so far, to show that the Bill offers no advantage applicable to the forthcoming election. It offers a possible advantage, though by no means a certain advantage, in" connexion with elections which may take place in the future, but should a penal dissolution of the House of Representatives take place, that advantage might or might not entirely disappear. I now come to what appears to me to be the most serious blot in the Bill - a blot so serious, and a defect so startling, that unless it can be explained away I shall be compelled to vote against the measure. <inline font-style="italic">H</inline> is proposed, by means of this Bill, to hold the elections some time during March or April. Our financial year starts on the 1st July, and it seems to me that the inevitable result would be that Parliament would be called together before the 1st July. I say that- </para>

                            <para>- I see the strongest of constitutional reasons for it in the slovenly way into which Australian Parliaments have got of meeting to deal with Supply for the year long after the money has been expended. What ought to be done is- that Parliament should be called together before the year for which it has to make financial provision, is entered upon. We follow' that practice here, and meet now in the autumn of the year, with the knowledge that the financial year for which we have to make provision is ahead of us. </para>

                            <para>- We might alter anything, but I should like to know to what we are leading, when we are asked to alter the Constitution in this way for an imaginary advantage. If we were to alter the financial year, we should probably then find that we would be no better off than we are now. For the reasons I have given, if Parliament were called together on the 30th June, we might have sitting in the Senate honorable senators whose time was about to expire, and who had been rejected at the last election. That might be perfectly constitutional and legal, but would it be desirable? Is it desirable that we should have senators rejected by the electors in April coming here to legislate in May or June. </para>

                            <para>- It is not inevitable under our present system, where we erect senators to the end of the calendar year. Unless, in the case of some extraordinary national crisis, we are under no necessity to call Parliament together until the end of the year, and before the new senators are entitled to take their seats. I admit at once that in our Constitution provision is made for what I have referred to. but I do ask honorable senators whether it is likely, in practice, to be found desirable. In the first place, I think that it is very probable that an honorable senator rejected in April would fail to attend Parliament' in May or June, especially if he had to come from a distant State, and the result of that would be that the representation of his State in the Senate would suffer. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly, and I am glad that my honorable friend now sees the practical objection I am urging. In such circumstances the very basis of the Senate would be undermined. The one thing for which our friends from the smaller States - small in the matter of population - fought most strenuously when the desirability of Federation was being discussed was equal representation in the Senate. I say that if this Bill were carried into effect, in all probability, so far as one can foresee, the result of the adoption of the proposal would be that the smaller States would be absolutely deprived of that equal representation to which they attach so much importance. I should perhaps be inclined to waive that objection if there were any reasonable grounds for assuming that the elections for the two Houses would always take place on the one date. </para>

My assumption of their hesitancy to do that is the strongest argument I can find for pointing out the defects of this Bill. I do not believe that Australian electors are prepared to elect their parliamentary representatives nine or ten months ahead of the time at which they are called upon to assume their duties. </para>

                            <para>- I admit that the power is there, but the mere fact that it is there must be taken in conjunction with the other fact I have pointed out that there being no reason for supposing that this Parliament will be called together immediately prior to Christmas, the present Constitution is not greatly open to that objection. What <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> proposes to do in this Bill is not merely to make it possible, but to absolutely insure the very difficulty he points out. At present, under the Constitution, the disadvantage is only possible, but under the proposal now submitted it would be absolute! v insured and guaranteed that it would become operative and effective I shall not labour the point, but I put it to honorable senators to say whether they think that the possible advantage of securing the elections for the two Houses on a simultaneous date - an advantage which can in no sense be regarded as permanent, but only as accidental - is not more than outweighed by the fact that we should be running the nsk of having honorable senators in this Chamber who had been rejected at the elections, and whose term of office was about to expire; or in the alternative leaving their States without efficient representation, which, to my mind, would be equally objectionable. For these reasons, unless strong arguments are brought forward to destroy those which I have used, and to meet the objection I have raised, 1 shall have to vote against the second reading of the Bill. </para>

                        <para>. - This is a Bill to amend the Constitution, and, as such, it ought to be approached with great deliberation and caution. We ought to be extremely chary of making alterations in the Constitution. I fully appreciate our powers of amendment, and they should be used whenever a case of overwhelming, necessity arises, and the wellbeing of the whole people is concerned. But, if we err at all, we should err in the direction of over-cautiousness, because it is not only the Constitution of the Commonwealth as a. political body, but it is also the charter of the States, having been accepted by their people as a compromise between the sovereignty which had previously been exercised bv the States and the new sovereignty which it created. </para>

                            <para>- I know al] the steps which are necessary in order to insure an amendment of the Constitution, and they are not too rigid to be overcome in the case of necessity ; but I still adhere te* my view that, as the fundamental instrument of government, we should be very chary in making amendments therein. There is a tendency, I am sorry to say, at certain times - and it has been emphasized of late-with parties or individual politicians who have schemes, perhaps perfectly right arid proper ones, for carrying out certain matters under the Constitution, as soon as they are confronted with a difficulty in the Constitution, to say, "Oh, let us amend it." Practically, the principle they adopt is, " We hold certain views with regard to particular matters. If they are not in accordance with the Constitution, so much the worse for it : alter it." </para>

                            <para>- I am only pleading now for deliberation and caution, and the honorable senator must see the application of my remarks. During the past few years I have heard a great number of amendments in the Constitution proposed, and in almost every case, after having gone very carefully into' the matter, I have come to the conclusion that the Constitution is right, in the interests of the whole of the people, and that the proposals are not right. I believe that no amendment of the Constitution is necessary at the present time, and I should not be disposed to budge from that position unless an overwhelming case were made out to my satisfaction. In the present case, I have come to the conclusion, that there is no necessity to amend the Constitution. The reason which is put forward generally is that we have had two elections close to the end of the year, that that is an inconvenient time for certain sections of the people, and that therefore the Constitution should be altered in order to allow1 the elections to be held at some other time in the year. </para>

                            <para>- I thank the honorable senator for the correction. The first general election was held in March, and the last near the end of the year. We are told that, on account of the inconvenience of that period, we should proceed to amend the Constitution. Even if that be so, and there is nothing in the Constitution to require the elections to take place in December, I would point out that in such a vast territory as Australia, and with such varieties of climate we should never find any time in the year which would be equally convenient to everybody and every section. If we altered the Constitution so as to have the elections in March, we should assuredly find certain sections of the public complaining that that was a most inconvenient time to them. Pursuing the same course, there would be another agitation to amend the Constitution, in order to have the elections held at another date, and we might be engaged from year to year in tinkering with the Constitution, in order to find a date which would suit everybody. That, however, is impossible. The Constitution at the present time allows one year - from the 1st January to the 31st December - for the holding of elections for the Senate. The objection which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> raises to elections taking place a long time before the expiration of the term of office of senators is not, I think, sufficiently strong to justify us in making any alteration in the present arrangement, because I do not agree with him that there is anything to lead us to believe that an honorable senator who knows that his term of office will expire at the end of the year will be less attentive to his legislative duties than he would be in other circumstances. There are several honorable senators who have allowed it to be known for twelve months that they are not going up for re-election at the end of their term of office, but we have not found them in the discharge of their legislative duties one whit less attentive than they were previously. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that a senator from another State who had made up his mind not to stand for re-election would be less attentive to the discharge of his duties than he had been before. That is not, I think, a consideration which should weigh with us, and, as I have said, the Constitution allows the senators to be elected at any time .in the year, if that course be considered desirable, when there may be an election taking place for the House of Representatives. I want to call attention to a point which apparently has escaped the notice of Ministers, and, perhaps, of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> and which must be remembered throughout the debate, and that is that the election of the senators is a States matter. It is the State Governor who issues the writ, and the State Parliament which makes the law in regard to the time of choosing the senators for a State. </para>

                    <para class="block">That, to my mind, makes, it perfectly clear that the election of senators is in the hands of the States. We cannot compel the Governor of a State to issue writs for the election of senators at any time if he does not choose to do so. Under the law made by its. Parliament he may select any time in the last year of the expiring term of office. In one State one period may be more convenient ; in another State another period may be more convenient; and there is nothing in the Constitution that I can see to prevent the States individually from choosing various times for the election of senators. Suppose that we had an election for the House of Representatives taking place in March, and that in a particular State it was considered inconvenient to hold the election of senators at any time later than that, the elections could take place simultaneously. It is of no use for us as a Federal Parliament to raise questions as to the desirability of senators being chosen a long time beforehand. The answer to that is that the Constitution allows the whole of the year for the purpose, and puts the whole matter in the hands of the State, so that it can choose its own time. Under these circumstances what advantage can be gained by passing this Bill? Supposing that the proposed alteration of the Constitution were made so far as the time for electing the senators was concerned - and that we are told is the object - it could be entirely passed over by a State, and the only difference which would be made then, and which we have the power to make, would be to add six months to the term of office pf the senators next elected. The particular object which it is supposed would be attained by the proposed amendment of the Constitution would be no advantage whatever. It would be very inadvisable for us to pass the Bill unless we could attain some definite and useful purpose. With regard to the other House we have nothing to do with their electoral arrangements. </para>

Its members are not elected for a fixed term, and if we altered the Constitution with the idea that the elections for the two Houses would be held simultaneously, and that thereby expense would be saved, it might be upset in a moment bv a dissolution of the other House taking place at some time not coincident with the end of the term. Unless I change my opinion bv reason of any arguments I .may hear, I shall feel compelled to vote against the second reading of the Bill. </para>

                    <para class="block">If the Bill were passed it would increase the term of office of a senator to six and a half years. It might, perhaps, be said that the greater would include the less, but I consider that we have no right to refer this Bill to the electors unless we also submit that particular provision. With regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's</inline> remark as to the difficulty of our not meeting until the expiry of the financial year, I think it could be got over, if there is to be an alteration made, by making the date the 1st May instead of the 1st July. If we .met on the 1st May the financial year would have two months to run, but if the 1st July is to be adhered to as the date we ought to make the financial year close later than the 30th June. It is very desirable, on constitutional grounds, I take it, that the Parliament should meet before the expiration of the financial year. It has been said that it is somewhat irregular for an election to take place months before the new senators will enter upon the discharge of their duties. But in the United States, the President is chosen in November, and assumes office in March of the following year. When the Bill gets into Committee, I shall take the opportunity to suggest that the 1st May be substituted for the 1st July, so as not to interfere with the present financial year. I also think that it is necessary to alter section 7 of the Constitution, because I take it that " a term of six years " means no more than six years </para>

                            <para>- Of Of course it is impossible absolutely to insure that the election shall be held in any particular month. We cannot insure that the elections for the House of Representatives and the Senate will be held simultaneously. A penal dissolution would spoil that arrangement. But the Bill appeals to me in this way. We are now within a few weeks of the end of the session. The general elections are to be held at the end of November or in December. Three years ago the same thing happened, and we had the spectacle, as we have it now, of a number of members of both Houses, not dealing with the business of Parliament as they otherwise would do, being anxious to rush away to their constituencies. Members naturally are not giving measures that due consideration which they would give to them if the elections were to be held some two or three months after Christmas, and if there were not this hurry to get away. We are perfectly well aware that in both Houses at the present moment, but particularly in another place, there is a desire on the part of members to meet their constituents. </para>

                            <para>- Cer Certainly not, but if an alteration of the Constitution were made as proposed, it might conduce to the better consideration of measures, and therefore to the convenience of the public, by insuring a better class of legislation. This Bill, if passed, will make it possible for every election after the coming one* - supposing there is no penal dissolution - to be held in March or April, instead of in December. Every Parliament, even if it meets early in the year, is not in the habit of rising until near Christmas time. In each session of the Commonwealth Parliament the ten.dency has been to sit almost to the end of the year, except in a year in which the general elections are to be held. The present system means - we saw it three years ago, and we see it now - that as the elections have to be held some time before Christmas,' and we do not meet until June, the session in which to deal with business of considerable importance is very short. A number of very important measures now await consideration. Many members of both Houses would like to have an opportunity to consider them, but there is not sufficient time. Many of the Bills will, in the circumstances, be amongst the "slaughtered innocents." <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> laughs in a sneering way. </para>

If the present system is continued, it will probably continue to meet in June, and if there are to be elections in December that means a very short session. </para>

If the elections were in the following March, it would be possible to deal with the work of the session in a proper manner. But, under present circumstances, the inevitable result is that towards the end of the session measures which many members of Parliament would like to see passed are either cast aside, or have to be considered in Houses half the members of which are away. That is actually what is being' done to-day. We find members leaving when the House is sitting to address mid-day meetings, while others are away in different parts of the country. </para>

                            <para>- N - No; I have been showing that if the present system were altered, it would not only suit the convenience of the people and of Members of Parliament, but that better legislation would result, and fuller consideration would be given to important questions. That seems to me to be the chief argument in support of the Bill. I am perfectly in accord with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> that it is not desirable to alter the Constitution hastily. No one wishes to do that. As a matter of fact, the Constitution itself prevents us from making alterations in an ill-considered manner. Every proposed amendment has not only to be fully considered by both Houses of the Parliament, but has also to be accepted by the people when submitted to them. If it can be shown that it will in any way improve our legislation and our manner of performing our duties to make the alteration proposed, that is, I think, a sufficient justification for the Bill. </para>

                        <para>.- I can see no objection to the Bill, except the uncertainty that must be present in the mind of everybody about any Bill that is brought forward in the expiring hours of a Parliament, when, in our hurry, we may overlook some consequence which might, perhaps, be very inconvenient, if not dangerous. The Bill merely provides, so far as I can see, for an addition of six months to the term of senators who are to be elected this year and of those who will be elected three years later. I do not pay much attention to the dangers which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> and others have outlined. They seem to me to be imaginary possibilities rather than probabilities. The measure is introduced partly, perhaps, for the convenience of some Members of Parliament - or, rather, partly for the convenience of one House - but mainly in response to a desire that the date of the elections should be altered. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> that no matter what date we fix, no matter what season of the year we determine is the most convenient, circumstances may upset all our arrangements. As a matter of fact, March would not suit us in Queensland, because it is the rainy month. It is certainly inconvenient to be electioneering in wet weather in tropical and sub-tropical country. When elections have been held for the State Parliament in February or in March, and the streams have been flooded, candidates have frequently been prevented from travelling. </para>

                            <para>- April and May would suit us better. Those months are usually chosen for the elections for the State Parliament for that reason. How much force is there in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's</inline> contention as to a probable dissolution of the House of Representatives rendering all our efforts in passing this Bill null and void? The tendency of the Federal Parliament <inline font-style="italic">is to</inline> have regular periods for the elections; and I am inclined to the opinion that there never wall be a double <inline font-style="italic">dissolution</inline> of the House of Representatives before the Parliament expires by effluxion of time. Members of the House of Representatives view, with a great deal of dread, not the uncertainty of the elections, but the travelling which an election entails. Many members of another place have constituencies larger than the State of Victoria, while candidates for the Senate appeal to constituencies many times larger than some of the countries of Europe. An election is not contemplated with any equanimity, in view of the appalling distances which have to be travelled, and the immense amount of work entailed. Members of the House of Representatives were inconvenienced by the last general election, on which occasion they very generously sacrificed several months of their term of office in order to save the States and the Commonwealth expense. The question of expense will operate against a state of things such as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has described. A separate election for the Senate would mean an extra expenditure of something like £50,000, and this in itself would, I think, prove an effectual bar to a dissolution. </para>

                            <para>- As a rule, when there is a dissolution of a Legislative Assembly, it is in consequence of the action of members who have turned out the Government. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has suggested that a sitting senator, who had been rejected at the poll, might, pending the expiration of his term, take his place in the Senate, and share in the work of legislation. It is a matter of some surprise that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> should at last have assumed the attitude of an advanced reformer. I never before heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> complain because in New South Wales, and other States, the system largely obtains of appointing to the Legislative Councils, men who have been rejected by the electors for the Legislative Assemblies. I suppose that the majority of the members of the Legislative Councils in the various States have at one time or other been rejected by the constituencies - that they are men who have lost the confidence of the people, and yet, as members of Second Chambers, are allowed to shape legislation.. </para>

                            <para>- But there is a difference. In the case of senators, their term will not have expired, and, therefore, the case is more one in which somebody else has been selected than one in which senators have been rejected. I imagine that such a case as that suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> would be very unusual. A period of thirty days may elapse after the return of the writs. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator contended that we should exercise great care and deliberation in making any alteration in the Constitution. There is an advantage about a written Constitution, and there is also an advantage about an unwritten Constitution. Some writ ten Constitutions are a complete bar to progress. Our Constitution, however, contains safeguards which would, I hope, prevent any radical alteration against the interests of the people. In order to effect an amendment of the Constitution, there has to be the consent of a majority of the people and of a majority of the States ; and surely that is sufficient to prevent any detrimental change. The only alterations sought under the Bill are in regard to the date of the elections, and to the extension of the term of honorable senators by six months in either case. I think we may give ourselves the credit of saying that that is a very desirable alteration. </para>

                        <para>. - I think that more alteration of the Constitution will be necessitated by this Bill than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> imagines. On examination, the arguments against the Bill seem rather to multiply than otherwise. In 1902 we passed an Act relating to the allowance to members of the Federal Parliament, and providing that the pay of senators should date from the day of election. If we pass the Bill as presented to us, there may be two sets of senators, and the allowance to one set, if it dates from the day of election, will mean to the Commonwealth the expenditure of a few thou and pounds. The Act to which I refer provides - </para>

                    <para class="block">It is quite clear that if we make the change in the Constitution suggested by the Bill, the Parliamentary Allowance Act will have to be repealed or amended, or it will remain as a more or less fatal objection to the measure. It is contemplated that senators may be elected some months ahead, and, as I have pointed out, that may mean considerable expenditure in the way of allowances. At present, when the elections take place towards the end of the year, the expenditure is very little; but if we pass the Bill there will be a good deal of difference in this respect. Another point is that there will be some difficulty in making the arrangement desired for the time of meeting. At present we avoid holding the session in the hot months ; but, with a general election in the month of March, we should be called upon to meet at ai very undesirable period of the year. I should like to call attention to the fact that, although the other House is nominally elected for three years, the members go for reelection about every two years and nine months. Such an arrangement is almost compulsory, in order to coincide with the arrangements of the Senate. The other House might continue for three years from the time of its first meeting ; and, if it did so, an election could not take place for three years and three months. </para>

                            <para>- It is because of that possibility that it can now be proposed to have the general election in March. But if there be an election in March, 1907, there could be an election in July in. 1910. It would seem, therefore, that there are difficulties in the way of bringing the elections for the two Chambers together automatically. In the past we have been able to have the elections together; but it must not be assumed that that will always be the case ; and I do not see how the position will be improved by the change suggested by the Bill, to which, as I said before, a consideration of the provisions of the Parliamentary Allowance Act of 1902 suggest a difficulty which is more or less fatal. </para>

                        <para>. - We should bear in . mind two factors which are responsible for the measure before us. One factor is the .convenience of the electors, and the other is the question of cost. I do not know whether the press have exaggerated the inconvenience caused to the farming community by holding the elections during the harvest ; but the press is borne put by the fact that scarcely more than one-half of the electors take any interest in the matter. Either there is a terrible amount of apathy and neglect on the part of the electors, or the elections are held at a very inconvenient time. Then there is the question of expense. I believe that it is an absolute fact that if it should be necessary to hold the elections, for the House of Representatives and the Senate at different times, that would involve an additional expense of £40,000. We have had several very thoughtful speeches, which have gone to show that -this Bill is not half so simple as it looks. We should bear in mind that we are taking merely a preliminary step, and that any Bill we pass providing for an alteration of the Constitution must go before the people for ratification. We have, therefore, no ultimate responsibility in the matter, although we incur some responsibility even by suggesting an amendment of the Constitution. I think that the Bill will be of comparatively little use, .and I shall be inclined to let is pass into the waste-paper basket unless some arrangement can be made for conducting elections for both Houses at the same time, even should a dissolution of the House of Representatives take place before the end of the three years. I can see no reason why in such circumstances we should not pass a measure extending the term for which the House of Representatives should sit to cover the balance of the three years, should a dissolution take place before the expiration of that term. Unless we can do something of that sort, I can quite see that at any moment the advantages of this Bill may be taken away by a dissolution df the other House. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> made a most excellent speech, but I think he. exaggerated slightly when he said that the Bill would be of no advantage to the electors. I believe that there is a harvest time in every State, and that to hold the elections in November or December would be most inconvenient. That might not be the time of the sugar harvest, but it is the harvest time for apples, fruit crops generally, and hops, and this is of small consequence compared with the harvest time for grain throughout the States. </para>

I was led to inquire what might happen if the Governor of a State were to issue writs at a time which, -while it might suit the convenience of a State, might not suit the convenience of the Commonwealth Parliament, but I presume that the States and the Commonwealth will always be prepared to act together in that matter. The electors will have the final voice in the decision of the question dealt with in this Bill. If it be passed it may have the effect of saving us an occasional expenditure of ,£40,000. In the circumstances, I think we might take it into Committee, and consider there whether the disadvantages, and difficulties of the measure are found on reflection to increase or decrease. </para>

                    <para class="block">I remind honorable senators that this is one of the measures which the Senate can amend. The votes dealt with were some years ago separated from the ordinary Estimates in order that the Senate might be given that opportunity. Last year for this purpose we voted ^41-6,911, and spent £3i9&gt;72°&gt; We propose this year to vote £479i724Last year ,£97,000 of the amount voted was not spent, and that is probably due to the period of the financial year at which the Bill similar to this was finally passed. </para>

                            <para>- There is noth-ing wrong so far as I know. Precisely the same thing has occurred in South Australia year after year. We always had an unexpended balance at the end of the year. There were two sheets brought forward, one dealing; with excess on votes, and the other with unexpended balances. It' was very often found that the excess on votes came to about the same as the unexpended balances, and one was practically put against the other. We have here established a Treasurer's Advance Account, and though I cannot at the present moment give honorable senators the exact particulars', I have little doubt that since the commencement of the present financial year the whole of the £97,000 unexpended balance from last year's vote has been absorbed. That is to say, the works had been commenced, were not completed at the end of the past financial year, and have been continued into the present financial year. The Treasurer makes the necessary advances against those works, and I believe honorable senators will find that the unexpended balance of £97,000 has in this way been absorbed by this time. Honorable senators who, like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake,</inline> have had practical experience in office, are aware that it is impossible to estimate what will be required to carry out the public works projected in a particular year with such accuracy that,, in a total expenditure of about  £500,000,  there will not be a considerable sum unexpended at the close of the year. Contracts may be entered into and the works may be in progress, but may not have absorbed within the financial year the whole of the money voted for the purpose. The Treasurer has laid down a rule that he will not permit the expenditure of .money in connexion with new works until Parliament has appropriated it. That is a very wise provision, and I now ask honorable senators to assist me in- getting this Bill through at the earliest possible moment, in order that the officers of the Home Affairs Department who are intrusted with the duty of carrying out these works will be able as quickly as possible to undertake their construction with money voted by Parliament. The Treasurer will not give them the slightest advance for new works, and they cannot go on with them until Parliament has voted the necessary money, I repeat that the Treasurer has made a very wise rule, but a consequence of it is that if we allow three or four months of the year to elapse before we vote the necessary money we have on.lv the balance of the year in which to spend it. </para>

                            <para>- No, there is a general vote under which absolutely necessary repairs are provided for. ft is only where we are dealing, with absolutely new works that the Treasurer says that until Parliament gives the' necessary authority he cannot permit the expenditure of the money, since the Auditor-General may say to him, " What right had you to expend this money?" The Treasurer has therefore put a stop to expenditure in that way. </para>

                            <para>- I cannot from memory refer to any particular works at the present moment, but I have no doubt such things have occurred. They certainly occurred in my experience in the State Parliament of South Australia. Sums have often been voted for works, and it has subsequently been considered advisable not to expend the money. Such things will always occur. I do not propose to refer to every item dealt with in this Bill, but 1 shall direct the attention of honorable senators to those which are most important. A vote of £4,000 is provided towards the cost of erecting a store at Darling Island, Sydney, for the purpose of the Defence Department. It is only fair that I should inform the Senate that this work is estimated to cost eventually £22,300, and this item of £4,000 is a first instalment towards the cost of the work. </para>

                            <para>- It is for a magazine. At the present time we have some magazines situated close to Circular Quay, which we took over from the New South Wales Government as transferred properties. It is found that they are very inconveniently situated. They are not very close to the wharf, and there is no communication with them by rail. We have a piece of land at Darling Island on which we can erect magazines to take the place of those we occupy at the present time. When the proposed magazine is erected at Darling Island we shall hand back the magazines we at present occupy, and the land on which they are situated to the New South Wales Government, The advantage of a magazine at Darling Island will be that we shall have the wharf on one side, and communication by rail at the back. We shall thus be able to convey warlike stores in New South Wales to the places at which they are required bv water or by rail. </para>

It appears to me that what is proposed is the most economical course we could take. We should have to pay £20,000 Or £30,000 to the Government of New South Wales for the stores at present occupied as transferred property, whilst as I have said, they are most inconveniently situated for the purpose. </para>

                            <para>- The trawler is intended to perform pioneering work in connexion with the deep-sea fisheries on the coast of the Commonwealth. We believe that the waters beyond the three miles' limit have not yet been explored, and that they ought to be explored for the purpose of ascertaining first what fishes of value they contain ; and, secondly, in what manner they may be caught. Trawling is the method most frequently employed in connexion with such fisheries, and under certain conditions it is ' the most effective method. </para>

                            <para>- There are other methods of deep-sea fishing which, of course, the trawler will try. Over rocky bottoms there is what is known as great line fishing, and. in addition, there is surface fishing with drift nets - the method bv which herrings are captured in Europe. So far as we know Australia is the only civilized country with a large sea-board which has done nothing to establish this industry. I propose to explain what has been done in this direction by the Government of Cape Colony. It was said by some persons that so far as that Colony was concerned, there was no deep-sea fishing which would be profitable. But the Government determined to purchase a vessel for the purpose of testing the point. In 1897, therefore, they purchased a vessel called the <inline font-style="italic">Pieter Faure.</inline> a modern type of steam vessel, on which a skilled crew was placed.

                        <para>The amount of fish imported into Australia is 13,000,000 lbs. annually, valued at about ^300,000. The local supply is spasmodic, and the people away from the sea-board have virtually no opportunity of obtaining it. This is shown by the fact that the consumption is only 9-4r lbs. per head per annum. The quantity landed in Great Britain is 47.5 lbs. per head per annum. Fish is three times as expensive in New South Wales as it is in Great Britain. The value of the fish obtained by Canada is about 16s. per head, by Norway about 14s. 6d., and by New South Wales 2s. iod. As the fisheries of New South Wales are more developed than in any of the other States, a comparison with the Commonwealth would be less favorable. Reference has already been made to the large amount of known edible fish on the Australian coast. The question of their habits, however, is not well understood, and their location is not defined. </para>

                            <para>- We might like to take a few members of the Opposition outside the three-mile limit and clear the political atmosphere. I propose to call attention to only the more important items on the Estimates, especially to new items. On page 15, for instance, there is a new item of £1.0,000 for installing wireless telegraphy. The Marconi Company and others have been approaching the Defence Department with a view to the adoption of that system in connexion with the defence of the Commonwealth. I have considered all through that it is more a matter for the Post and Telegraph Department to take up than for the Defence Department. However, the minute I have on the subject reads as follows: - </para>

It has not yet been determined in which part of the Commonwealth the system will first be introduced, but full inquiries will be made into a number of proposals which have been submitted to the Department, and when a decision has been arrived at, tenders will be invited to instal the system </para>

                            <para>- He cannot take steps to instal the system anywhere. It will be observed that large sums are set down for Defence purposes. Altogether £169,156 is asked for, less anticipated unexpended amount of £39,156, making £130,000 to be spent. This is an amount that has been voted year by year since a paper was laid before Parliament - I think in 1903 - explaining that about £500.000 was proposed to be expended upon new war-like material. The £160,000 now proposed to be expended will exhaust the sum which it was thus proposed to spend for this purpose. Considerable alterations have been made in the proposed allocation of the money at different times. Last year, instead of buying a quantity of saddles and similar accoutrements, I induced Parliament to agree to buy rifles. This year honorable senators will see that there is an item of £8,000 for purchase of accoutrements, saddle trees, stirrups, and bits. These are required for the Australian Light Horse, field and garrison troops. The next item is £53&gt;°4° for guns, harness, waggons, and ammunition for the Field Artillery. The purpose of the vote is to provide - 12 18-pounder quick-firing guns, carriages, and limbers, with 300 rounds of ammunition each, to complete three batteries attached to the garrison force; 36 18-pounder ammunition waggons and limbers for the 24 guns arranged for last, and for the 12 guns above mentioned. </para>

                            <para>- The type we are going to obtain is that recommended in the report of the Imperial Defence Committee. I forget the name of the gun. I am not sure whether it is the Colt gun or the Maxim automatic machine gun. I know, however, that the Imperial Defence Committee recommended us not to get anymore pom-poms. When I saw that recommendation, I telegraphed at once to Captain Collins, in London, to countermand the order which we had given for the supply of those guns. </para>

                            <para>- A sum of £r 2,000 is set down for the purpose of purchasing cadet rifles. The intention is to provide 300 Francottes and 5,500 Wesley Richard rifles for our cadets. The rifles already in the Commonwealth, and those ordered will together complete the number of miniature rifles required by us. the total number being 16,000. Then there is the large sum of £21,500 for small arms ammunition. We propose to purchase 4,000,000 rounds. That quantity is necessary to keep up our stock of reserve ammunition. We have not sufficient at present to meet what military authorities consider to be our requirements. But we are getting close up to the quantity we ought to have in reserve. I also ask for £50,000 for the purchase of 10,000 magazine Lee-Enfield rifles and parts. </para>

                            <para>- I expect so. I sent for the cut-offs for the other rifles to which the honorable senator refers. Why the War Office did not send them out, I do not know. These cut-offs are merely little discs which can be obtained without any difficulty. It is undoubtedly an advantage to have them and, therefore, I have taken steps to see that they are provided. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. It is recommended by the Imperial authorities, and is being furnished to the Imperial troops. We are getting the exact pattern of rifle with which the British Army is being supplied. According to the latest return, we have about 26,000 Lee-Enfield rifles, single-loaders. Of quick-firers we have in the Commonwealth at present 36,093. We have on order 8,604, making a total of 44,733. I propose to order 1 0,000 more, making 54,733. But it also has to be remembered that the members of our rifle clubs are armed with rifles, and that we have in addition a considerable number of single-loaders. </para>

                            <para>- We shall have 54,733 quick-firers when the rifles to be ordered come out. These are all thoroughly effective up-to-date magazine rifles. The single-loaders which we have are, however, very useful rifles indeed. In fact, I know officers who have been in the Boer war, and who say that they would not wish their men to be entirely armed with magazine rifles. They would prefer that some should have single-loaders. The tendency is, when the men are armed with magazine rifles, for them to fire away their ammunition too quickly. Then they' have to go to the rear to get fresh ammunition, and sometimes it is difficult to supply them. Some of the officers consider that it is better to have a proportion of the men armed with single-loaders and the rest with magazine rifles, in preference to the whole number being armed with magazine rifles. Passing from military matters, it will be observed that the sum of £12,000 is set down for New South Wales in connexion with the Post and Telegraph Department for the extension of telegraph lines, instruments and material. Honorable senators will notice a note at the bottom of the page stating that £2,400 of this sum is for work necessitated by the proposed erection of the new telephone line between Sydney and Melbourne. </para>

                    <para>In order to remove any idea that a personal favour has been extended to me in connexion with this motion, I may say that in my opinion a rather important principle is involved. Though I may be the one affected to-day, other honorable senators may be affected in the future ; and as these regulations have to lie on the table for only a given number of days after passing the Executive, this is virtually the last day and hour when any formal objection to them can be taken with any effect. Although <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> did me the personal favour of placing this afternoon at my disposal, I should like it known that the motion deals with a matter of public rather than of personal importance. I shall not take up the time of the Senate more than I can possibly avoid. These are regulations under an Act of Parliament for which, to a certain extent, Ministers have now no further responsibility, except as regards the regulations. I hope to be able to show that there are reasons why these regulations ought not to be allowed to stand ; at any rate, I hope to show good reasons why they should be altered and improved. Although I condemn and dislike the Act, I shall avoid, as far as possible dealing with its principles. I recently called attention to the fact that the Act has imposed on the Minister a duty, which I do not blame him for exercising, of drafting regulations, and submitting them to Parliament and to the country. I point out that though these regulations have been published, and will have the force of statutory rules, they will not come into operation for some time, because it is necessary that due notice shall be given to importers, and, further, they cannot take effect beyond the boundary of His Majesty's Customs warehouses. It will be seen, therefore, that there is no violent hurry for the acceptance of the regulations. Any postponement of their disallowance would not involve the country or the Minister in any great difficulty or trouble, but would merely give further opportunity for consideration. </para>

All I can do is to ask the Senate to disapprove and disallow, and I am pointing out that any disapproval would not prevent the drafting of other and better regulations, or result in any damage to trade or commerce. I hope to be able to suggest a much simpler way than is presented by these regulations, to carrying out the idea of the promoters of the measure - a way which would not result in irritation to the trade at large, but would result in as much benefit to the public as can be hoped from regulations of so extreme a character. I do not propose to disagree with the regulations affecting food, medicine, and so forth, because I frankly admit it, so far as I can judge without any particular knowledge of the trades, that those regulations may result in some good. I shall deal only with the regulations so far as they affect the materials of which I have personal knowledge, confining my objection to the regulations as they affect - </para>

                    <para class="block">That is a somewhat different matter to which I shall refer later. It is well known that the Commerce Act copying the Merchandise Act of Great Britain, prescribes first of all that where a voluntary description is applied to any goods whatever the description shall be a true one. That is reasonable legislation to which no one could object. I admit that it led for some time to disturbance in trade in Great Britain, because there were certain conventional descriptions with regard to quantities, weights, and so on that were thoroughly understood between merchants, importers, and those with whom they dealt, but which were not literally true descriptions. The law occasioned some trouble for a <inline font-style="italic">time,</inline> until people became accustomed to it, and then it worked very well. Now, if any goods are described, they must be as described. That is quite proper, but the difficulty here is that under our Commerce Act we go further, and require a compulsory description of goods. </para>

                            <para>- It is not in all cases, but I am dealing with those cases in which a description is compulsory. In order to save the time of honorable senators, I briefly enumerated my reasons for objecting, and I shall state those reasons. First of all, the very great difficulty of defining what goods are required to be marked, or described, under the comprehensive heading of " apparel." I refer to the difficulty which confronts the importer who, with the best intention in the world, is ordering stuff from Home, in ascertaining what must be described, and what might come in without description. The second reason is uncertainty as to the nature of the description itself. What sort of description will the Customs officials require? I refer to the uncertainty of the nature of the description owing to the diverse character of the goods themselves, and very often to the diverse materials in any one particular article. The third reason for objection is with regard to a very great variety of articles, the uselessness of the description for accomplishing any good purposes, or for accomplishing the purposes of the Act. </para>

                    <para>I shall before I sit down, that a description which might be useful to carry out the purposes of the Act could be adopted in the case of some goods whilst it would be impossible to provide such a description in the case ofl other goods. It will be admitted that in passing any Act of Parliament, we should have some useful purpose in view. With regard to the first reason for my objection, I direct the attention of honorable senators to the very comprehensive character of the general heading of " apparel." If any honorable senator happens to have a <inline font-style="italic">Tariff Guide,</inline> and most importers take care to possess themselves of one, he will find that under that general heading, an enormous variety of made-up goods, and of materials from which goods are made, are imported. I again direct attention to the regulation itself. It deals not merely with apparel, but with the materials from which apparel is manufactured, and it is comprehensive enough to embrace every piece of stuff that goes into a draper's shop. </para>

                            <para>- Mosquito net might possibly be used in the manufacture of an article of apparel. But admitting, that certain articles used in connexion with household' furniture might be excluded, the term embraces almost every variety of textile fabric used in the manufacture of clothing for men, women, and children. I have no hesitation in saying that that comprises almost the whole of a draper's stock in trade. I take it that it is not the wish of the Senate, or of any member of it, to unnecessarily embarrass the importer. If incidentally we embarrass people, we cannot help it, but I am sure that we have no desire to legislate merely for the purpose of irritating and embarrassing people. This term " apparel " covers the most comprehensive varieties of goods and articles made up from different kinds of fabrics, and a merchant who last month, to-day, or next month, is sending Home his indent orders, must naturally expect to meet with inquiry from his agents as to what goods are to be described. The Home buyer or agent reads the Act, and the regulations under it, and endeavours to ascertain what it is intended should be described. I have before me a letter received from the buying agents to a large wholesale firm in the city&gt; which illustrates some of the difficulties, ft is but a sample of one of the ordinary notes in which comments are made by <inline font-style="italic">O</inline> buyers with regard to certain goods they are under instructions to purchase.

                            <para>- There again the honorable senator tells us what he thinks might happen under the present administration, but he cannot accept responsibility for everything that some ill-informed, well-intentioned, but over-meddlesome Customs official .may do. Do we not know that in the different States different methods are now adopted in administering the Customs Act? The terrible scandal which has arisen in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford's</inline> own State is a proof that different methods are adopted in different States. </para>

                            <para>- I shall not further discuss that now, but we know that in different States Customs officers will hold different views, will have different opportunities for acquiring knowledge, and will exercise their powers under the Commerce Act, according to their own ideas, and in different ways. Dealing further with the descriptions of goods that will be required, the agent of the firm to whom I have referred mentions " bearskins." This, is a conventional term applied to a woven fabric, and not to a bearskin at all. With the greatest desire to do what is required of them under the Commerce Act, the merchant at home would have great difficulty in describing what "bearskin" was. </para>

                            <para>- No, because the honorable senator never buys bearskin. His wife might go into a shop, and buy a bearskin cloak for herself, but if she did she would know perfectly well what she was doing, and she would know that she was not getting bearskin any more than she would be getting sealskin, if she asked for that material. These are conventional terms for fabrics made up in imitation of these skins. </para>

                            <para>- People know perfectly well that a sealskin jacket, as generally so described by the trade, is not made from the skin of the seal, but that it is an imitation. The trade name has become a conventional term, and a merchant ordering 100 sealskin jackets to be invoiced at 20s. or 15s., would not think it necessary to take the trouble to say that he did not want jackets made of the skin of the seal. </para>

                            <para>- There is no occasion for it. I wish to point out that the compulsory marking of these goods is quite useless. The agent to whom I have referred mentions a number of other materials. "Venetians," for instance. We know that Venetian cloth is not necessarily made in Venice. The Italian cloth we get is more often made in Bradford than in Italy. Then there are alpacas, Sicilians, silesias, and sateens. This last is a cotton fabric made in imitation of satin, and it might be supposed to be silk. </para>

                    <para class="block">He proceeds to deal with lines on the same plane. I have referred in my list to fabrics only ; but there is another and very much more difficult line of goods, and that is articles of apparel and attire, which are made up of different fabrics. For instance, we might have a variety of fabrics composing, a lady's costume. What sort of description would be of any use in that case? Our object, I take it, is to ultimately protect the public. We do so initially by requiring that all goods coming into the Customs warehouse shall be marked, in the hope that the mark will remain when they have gone out, or that the State will follow up the idea of registration and enact a provision which will compel the marking of the goods on the same lines as we initiated. That would be all very well if the States had legislated. But so far they have not shown much eagerness to follow up this legislation, and that, I may say incidentally, is another reason why the Minister might verv well be asked to hold his hand in this matter. </para>

There is a number of articles in respect of which we require a description, but which ought to come in under either the Food and Drugs Act or the Health Act of the State, and which could be more usefully super.vized by the State authority. We stop at the boundary line. No matter what description, may be required, once the goods have left the Customs warehouse they are no longer bound to retain that description. . </para>

                            <para>- That difficulty can be overcome by prescribing that the percentage of wool shall be stated. When we require that " wool and other materials " shall involve a description of every other material used in the composition of the fabric we impose on those concerned what may be at times an impossible task. Honorable senators will realize the position if I read the remainder of the letter - or "Wool and other ingredients," but the Statutory Rules just issued state on page 3, clauses D and E, that the description shall set out the substances contained in the material. Considering that firms which manufacture tweed apparel do not make the material a compliance with this regulation is impossible, as far as they are concerned. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable senator knew anything about trade matters he would know that there is avery great deal to prevent a man from getting a true description, because the manufacturers closely guard their secrets in regard to the making up their fabrics. I am sorry to say that the honorable senator seems to have made up his mind that anything which will embarrass and irritate the importer must necessarily be good. I propose to give a practical illustration of my remarks. I have referred to the absolute uselessness of the regulations as regards protecting either the importer, who is able to protect himself, or the public, whom we assume to be benefited by the Act. What is our object in requiring a description? Is it any advantage to a person to know that the article he is buying in a shop is made up of wool and cotton? </para>

                            <para>- I wish to discriminate between two things if I can get honorable senators to follow me. The descriptions required under the Act are very vague and uncertain. If a fabric is composed of one material, say cotton, a man is required to say that it is composed of cotton. If it is composed of cotton and linen he is required to say that it is union. If it is composed of wool, he is required to say, that it is an all-wool fabric. If it is composed of wool and cotton, he is required to say that it is wool and cotton. The Minister might go so far as to insist upon the percentage being put in. It would cause an enormous amount of trouble to the importers, but still it might not be open to very much objection. </para>

                            <para>- Everything which the exporter at Home does has to be paid for by the importer in Australia. If an analysis of cloth has to be made at Home, who but the importer has to pay for it? Again, if an importer desires that his goods shall be put up in a special way - for instance, that large pieces of stuff, as sold by the manufacturer, shall be cut into smaller pieces - he has to pay for that being done. Now, what is the use of a description? Is it of any use in regard to cotton goods? It really is not. Because a fabric which is made entirely of cotton might vary in price, as calico does, from 2d. to 1s. 6d. per yard, or even, more for the finest textures of long cloth. As they are all pure cotton goods, of what use is a description ? </para>

It is possible to buy at a shop in Bourke-street or Chapel -street, Prahran, an absolutely pure linen handkerchief of coarse quality for 6d. It is possible at the same time to buy a Scotch lawn cotton handkerchief for1s. No one would gain anything from branding the one handkerchief as linen, and the other as cotton. </para>

                            <para>- Well, if argument will not convince the honorable senator, perhaps ocular demonstration will. If, for the purpose of protecting the purchaser who, for reasons of health, wishes to buy an entirely woollen garment, it is considered desirable that no fabric shall be marked " all wool," unless it complies with that description, I shall raise no objection. But that object can be secured in a very simple way ; and I venture to say that it is the only good that we can secure by these regulations. If the Minister of Trade and Customs would allow me to deal with this matter in my own way, T believe that I could show him how all the good that can be accomplished under the regulations may be accomplished in a very simple manner. But even to brand an article " all wool ' ' is not necessarily to guarantee it to be superior to a union article. I hold in my hand a piece of very common fabric in which it may be said there is only a percentage of wool. It is 54 inches wide, and is sold at1s. 8d. per yard. But this fabric would be described in exactly the same manner as another which is sold at 2s. <inline font-style="italic">6d.</inline> per yard, and as a third which is sold for 4s.9d. All three are union fabrics - Yorkshire tweeds containing a certain proportion of wool and cotton. The one designation " union tweed " would cover them all. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; but the point is that the same general description applies to each, although there is such a wide difference in their value. I have here another piece of stuff which I can guarantee to be absolutely pure wool. It is what is known as a cross-bred serge, made of the lowest description of wool. It is sold wholesale for 2s. 6d. per yard - about half the price of the best specimen of Yorkshire tweed which I have shown. Therefore, the description " all wool " or "union" does not necessarily imply superiority. </para>

                            <para>- It is. The owner of this article assured me that he would guarantee it if submitted to any kind of analysis. Another sample which I produce, and which is sold wholesale at 3s. 4d. per yard, is also all wool of a finer texture, though it would not keep its colour for any time. Other samples of all wool material are sold wholesale for 9s. and 11s. per yard. Where, then, is the advantage of compelling importers to describe every piece of stuff which comes in ? There is no protection to the public. The regulations are absolutely useless for that purpose. Take an example. I have here a pair of military socks sold retail at 6d. per pair. In the pair which I now exhibit the material is 95 per cent. cotton and 5 per cent. wool. Here is another pair of military socks containing 80 per cent. of wool and 20 per cent. of cotton. The one description would apply to both articles, although they differ so widely in quality. </para>

If a man goes into a shop and buys an article' which looks very nice, and he is told that it is pure linen, though he afterwards finds that it is merely a piece of cotton, he will not purchase at that shop again. The same happens in other branches of trade. The purchaser necessarily has to depend upon the reputation of the tradesmen' for the quality of the goods that he buys; and that specially applies to the textile fabrics trade. I have here also some specimens of ladies' hose. Here is a pair which is sold at is. It is absolutely pure wool, and could be submitted to any analysis. Another pair, of finer quality, is sold for 3s. But both are pure wool. There could be no discrimination between them in the description applied to them under the regulations. I have admitted that a trade description might be of value in the case of some articles, but the regulations are of no use whatever to enable the public to determine the quality of an article. It may be that the person desires to purchase an all-wool material for hygienic purposes.' I have no objection, therefore, to the description "all wool " being applied' specifically to articles which are made entirely of woollen material. Or it might be provided that any article containing less than 90 per cent, of pure wool should not be allowed to be described as woollen, and there might be a heavy penalty for an offence. But to go further, and insist upon a general description being applied to articles which are widely different in quality and price, secures no good purpose, and simply has' the effect of embarrassing trade. What sort of reputation will the Australian Parliament secure for itself if we insist upon this legislation? It is because I honestly think that the regulations have absolutely no useful effect, and not because I wish to inflict any rebuff upon the Minister, that I ask the Senate to support me in disapproving of them. </para>

                    <para class="block">Why did he leave that matter alone, although it is mentioned in his motion? It appears to me that the regulations in regard to jewellery are exceedingly fair. They simply provide that if a man imports jewellery he shall mark it as being of 9, 10, 15. or 20 carat gold, as the case may be. It has been a justifiable cause of complaint throughout the Commonwealth that hitherto jewellery has come in as gold when, as a matter of fact, the amount of gold in it has been infinitesimal. In respect of apparel, what the Minister of Trade and Customs really wishes to do is to insure that people who import goods into the Commonwealth shall give a true description of them. The Minister is exceedingly desirous, as I know from conversations that I have had with him on the subject, npt to do anything which would unduly hamper people engaged in trade. He does not wish to impose conditions with which it is impossible for them to comply. Now, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> wrote to the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> on this subject some time ago. His letter was published on the 2nd August.

                            <para>-- As to cotton and woollen goods, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> has not, in my opinion, advanced a single argument why they should not be brought within the regulations. The honorable senator drew attention to the fact that, if the hose of the' character he displayed here is mainly of wool, it has to be so labelled. </para>

                                <para>- Importers are not experts in all things. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> has not shown that the regulations impose any burden or inflict any evil on the community. What he has shown is that it is very necessary for the States to supplement this legislation, in the same way as they supplemented the secret commissions legislation passed by this Parliament. Several of the States have passed Secret Commission Acts, with the result that within those States there is a perfect chain of legislation to deal with the evil. If the honorable senator has made out a good case at all, it is in favour of States legislation of the kind to insure that the descriptions shall be retained on the goods in the retail shops, which would give a guarantee to both wholesale and retail customer. There is another strong objection which applies to the whole motion. We are asked, under cover of this motion, to practically repeal the Commerce Act. </para>

Of course, I think that, perhaps, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford,</inline> to a certain extent, brought the remark on himself when he assumed that he knew all about the matter and that nobody else did. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> to withdraw the word. </para>

                                <para>- I presume that there are various matters on which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> may be the best authority in the Senate. Any person may possess more complete knowledge of certain matters " than is possessed by some other persons. The very simple suggestion I made was that honorable senators might not perhaps have grasped the full consequences of this matter.. I went on to say that a shipment of drapery might cover several hundred descriptions of drapers' goods. To require that each one of these should be specifically and accurately described would be to impose on those handling the goods an amount of work which perhaps is not quite understood. That is the point I desire honorable members to consider. If any one imports a shipment of seeds of a particular kind, it is a very easy matter to describe them, but if a wholesale or retail draper imports a shipment that covers 300 or 400 descriptions of drapery goods, it is obvious that there might toe a great mass of work involved in meeting the requirements of the Customs in regard to those goods. While insisting upon honesty, I think we should not needlessly add to the labours of the mercantile people of the Commonwealth. This is the ground on which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> asked that these regulations should be suspended, or, at all events, that they should not be enforced for the present, but should be reviewed with the object of securing modifications in them which will render them less burdensome to traders. </para>

                        <para>. - As we are likely to adjourn a few minutes before the usual hour, and I shall not therefore unnecessarily detain any one, I take advantage of the opportunity to refer to a matter with which I dealt at an earlier hour this morning. I wish to ask the Minister of Defence if, before Tuesday, next, he will seriously consider the question of giving the Tariff Commission some instructions, on behalf of the Government, as to their future work and conduct. I wish to put before the Senate the position in which the members of the Tariff Commission are placed. As every one knows, we have had a very hard task to get through, and, without going into detail, I may say that we have had to work almost continuously for eighteen months. We now find ourselves in this position : that, in the closing days of a busy session of this Parliament, it is possibly necessary and desirable that we should bring forward fresh reports for the consideration of Parliament. If we could get any intimation from the Ministry, on whom rests a responsibility which, I think, they should not shirk, the members of the Tariff Commission would do their utmost, in spite of the extra pressure which must necessarily be put on six of them who are members of Parliament, to present further reports for the consideration of Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- The members of the Tariff Commission who are also members of Parliament have much to do during the remainder of the session; but whatever demands may be made upon their time they are prepared, if it is desirable, and if Parliament will have an opportunity to consider their work, to do what they can in order to submit further reports. I think I speak for every member of the Commission, although I have no authority from them to do so, when I say that the Tariff Commission: consider that, having in view the fact that the session is likely to close at the end of next month, or shortly afterwards, and having regard to the public business' to be submitted for the consideration of Parliament, the Government should say distinctly that they cannot undertake to ask Parliament to do more than a certain amount of work. If they would do that, the Tariff Commission would be relieved of their responsibility of doing work which really is beyond the Ordinary capacity of men at the present time in giving attention to public business in Parliament as well as to the presentation of these reports. If Ministers would say that certain reports would be submitted for the consideration of Parliament, .the members of the Tariff Commission would do their utmost, even though -they should have to work on Saturday and Sunday to present further reports. That would be done by them, irrespective of the party views which they may hold, but they feel that they should not be called upon at this time to do work which might, and probably will, be pf no immediate value ; that is to say, to prepare and send. in. reports which Ministers recognise cannot possibly be submitted to Parliament for consideration this session. This matter was referred to last night bv <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs,</inline> and that should be sufficient to prove that <inline font-style="italic">what</inline> I say has no party bearing whatever. It is simply a request made practically by six members of the Commonwealth Parliament that Ministers should undertake a responsibility which no one on either side will blame them for accepting. I hope that on Tuesday next <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> will be in a position to give the information desired. I trust that in what I have said I have put the position in which the members of the Tariff Commission find themselves at the present time clearly and precisely. </para>

The honorable gentleman is also reported to have expressed a doubt as to whether any such arrangement was being made, and gave some reasons for that doubt, amongst others, that the contractors have given an undertaking to call at Sydney and Melbourne, and further, that it is impossible under the terms of the contract for them to enter into any arrangement to carry mail matter for any other country than the Commonwealth, whilst the poundages received in connexion with such mail matter would belong, not to the company, but to the Commonwealth. I have not had an opportunity to interview the Postmaster-General to ask him whether the statements attributed to him in this connexion are correct, but I have every reason to believe that his views have been correctly reported. </para>
