                    <para class="block">I believe that there is no other section of the Constitution worded with that strength, and certainly there is no section of it which is so slow in coming into full effect. I fancy that very few persons are aware of what is at the bottom of the bookkeeping system, or how greatly it interferes with the business life of Australia, and how much it retards the development which otherwise would take place. Trade between the States is supposed to be free; but it is not free, because Customs entries have to be passed, and a great deal of work has to be done in connexion with them. A few weeks ago, I asked the Collector of Customs in New South Wales how many entries for inter- State business were passed through the Sydney Customs House last year. He told me that the total number was 90,628, exclusive of Victorian transfers, the number of which I do not know. I think it is pretty safe to say that, throughout Australia last year, at the very least, 300,000 entries were passed for goods relating to inter-State trade. Naturally, that is a great tax on the trade. It takes up a good deal of time, and involves a great deal of work. It must be remembered that it is essential that all these entries&#39; should be prepared with very much the same degree of accuracy as is required with regard to the entries of oversea goods, otherwise those who make the entries are liable to prosecution. The requirement of accuracy is essential, because on the accurate wording of the entries depends the proper adjustment of the revenue between the States. When Federation came about, and this system first began, the financial position in Australia was a very strange &#39;one. In the earlier years of Federation there was a great deal of trouble. I think that in 1901 and 1902 there was a deficit in each State; in some States it ran up to &#163;300,000 and &#163;400,000; and the total deficit, I believe, was considerably over &#163;1,000,000. The position meant that those in charge of the finances of the States were more or less in doubt as to what effect the Federation would have upon their finances. All of them felt the necessity of obtaining through the Commonwealth as large an amount of revenue as they possibly could, and all of them, I think, were more or less suspicious each of the others, and feared that the arrangement of a joint purse might not be to their advantage. I am glad to notice that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harper,</inline> with many of whose conclusions and statements I have not been able to agree, thinks that the bookkeeping system ought to be abolished at an early date. In his memorandum on the subject he says - </para>

                        <para>These provisions, although probably necessary <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> re-assure the Parliaments of the States, and possibly the best that could be devised in the then circumstances, are evidently crude and unsatisfactory. They are known as &#34; the bookkeeping &#34; and &#34; the Braddon &#34; clauses, and so far as the bookkeeping clauses are concerned, they entail enormous trouble and expense to the public, and to the Administrations of the various States, as well as to the Commonwealth. </para>

The honorable senator, who talks about 300,000 entries being dispensed with, and it still being necessary to keep up the same number of clerks, ought to reflect for a moment. </para>

                            <para>- There is another point to which I desire to refer, and that is the returning to the States of three-fourths of the net revenue from Customs and Excise duties. Frequently we hear a discussion on the subject of the return of this proportion, and it is assumed that because the Commonwealth returns something over the proportion it is unduly generous. I wish to point out very emphatically that the Constitution does not empower the Commonwealth to limit its return to the three-fourths. The wording of section 87 has nothing to do with the amount returned. It says that not more than one-fourth shall be applied annually by the Commonwealth towards its expenditure, and that the balance shall be paid to the several States. The Commonwealth must not in any circumstances spend more than one-fourth, therefore it must return to the States not less than three-fourths. That seems to be overlooked by a good many persons, who imagine that three-fourths is the sum which the Commonwealth ought to return, and that as long as the States get three-fourths they may very well be satisfied. </para>

                        <para>The fact that the Commonwealth has thus restricted its outlay and passed to the States nearly one million per annum in excess of what the Constitution requires, should set at rest, once and for all, the erroneous allegations which have been made. Unfortunately, this considerate action on the part of the Commonwealth Parliament has apparently led, on the part of the States, to demands, not only for the return to them of the three-fourths fixed by the Braddon clause, but to their claiming as much more as they can possibly set, with the result that practically Federal finance, which ought to be independent and free, is criticised and found fault with in the interests of what are considered to be States obligations, and these expectations and claims tend to complicate the settlement on equitable terms of the future financial relations of the States and the Commonwealth respectively. </para>

                    <para class="block">I beg to dissent from that view. The Commonwealth is bound to be as economical as it can be, and to return every penny of its surplus to the States ; but under no circumstances must it spend more than one-fourth of the Customs and Excise revenue. Some little time ago, within three or four months of the constitutional time for the permanent bookkeeping system to end, I felt that the subject should1 be looked into. I did look into it, and came to the conclusion that the circumstances were such that it would be possible this year to &#39;terminate the bookkeeping&#39; (system. When I say that I came to the conclusion, I mean with some consideration for the special treatment required by Western Australia. I found that my own State would be called upon to make an immediate sacrifice; but, on close study, T found that the sacrifice was largely more or less, imaginary. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. On examining the figures, I found that the trend of the returns for the years 1902-6 was very encouraging. A distribution on a population basis in the year 1902-3 would have taken &#163;400,000 from New South Wales, and given &#163;199,000 to Victoria, which equalled a change in the position of those States of &#163;599,000; while the estimates for the year 1905-6 reduced this total to &#163;144,000. That reduction, with general buoyant revenues, in the States, seems to me to make the adjustment fairly easy. The other States also showed close approximations to this result. The figures which I have given did not include those for Western Australia. That State showed a less glaring difference. In 1901-2, a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> distribution would have taken from Western Australia ,&#163;658,000, but a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> distribution in 1905-6 would have taken only &#163;428,000 ; showing in that direction also some approach to a fair level. I ha.ve said that Western Australia should have some special treatment. I have looked into the matter of the population of Western Australia from this point of view, and I wish to give the Senate a few figures which bear out what I say. They are somewhat remarkable. We all know that the male population of Western Australia is larger than its female population, but how much larger it is few people know. I have made a calculation of the proportion of males above fifteen and under sixty-five per 100,000 of the population at the census of 1901. The figures are - New. South Wales, 32,000; Victoria, 30,000; Queensland, 35,000; South Australia, 31,000; Western Australia, 46,000 ; Tasmania, 31,000 - average for the Commonwealth, 32,000. These figures show that Western Australia is 44 per cent, above the average, and 48 per cent, above the average of South Australia and Tasmania. But a more marked difference still is found by taking the proportion of males above twenty-one and under fifty, which I think may be accepted as the period when money can be earned most freely. The proportion of males above twenty-one and under fifty per 100,000 of the population at the census of 1 901 was in New South Wales, 22,000; Victoria, 21,000; Queensland, 25,000; South Australia, 21,000; Western Australia, 38,000; Tasmania, 21,000 - average, 23,000; showing that in Western Australia the average is 65 per cent, above that in the Commonwealth generally, while it is no less than 80 per cent, above the average in South Australia and Tasmania. Of course, I am not able to give the figures for the present time. There is no doubt that the excess in the West is not so high now as it was in the census year. Taking the figures for the census year, and bearing in mind that there is some change since then, honorable senators will realize that the position in&#39; Western Australia is such that she can imperatively call upon us for special treatment. Then I notice that- had the male population between twenty-one and fifty years of age actually in Western Australia at the census been surrounded by a population on the average of the population existing in Australia generally, her aggregate population of 184,000 would have been 303,000. Those figures, I think, make it fairly clear that the claim which Western Australia puts forward, and which I recognise - which I think we all recognise - for special treatment, is based upon sound and indisputable grounds. After a close examination of the bookkeeping matter, I noticed the . much larger postal revenue that exists in Victoria and New South Wales, and I came to the conclusion - it struck me at once - that we could not abolish the book-keeping system without uniformity of postage; and that practically the adoption of a penny postage rate was involved in the abolition of bookkeeping. It is true that we might impose twopenny postage instead of the present rate in. Victoria, but in view of the fact that the trend throughout the Empire is towards the penny standard, I think it will be recognised that public policy and the wishes of the people generally will tend towards the adoption for the whole Commonwealth of the rate which now exists in the State of Victoria. Therefore, I found that to abolish the system of book-keeping we should have to establish penny postage. The smaller States, it appears to me, cannot afford penny postage without the abolition of the book-keeping system. With the abolition of that system they can afford it. Since I published an estimate some few weeks ago, honorable senators are aware that the financial proposals of the Government for the year have been put forward. Included in them is a calculation with reference to the proposal for the adoption of penny postage. The following are the figures of the estimated loss which will arise in the various States: - New South Wales, &#163;51,000; Victoria, &#163;12,000; Queensland, &#163;22,000 ; South Australia, &#163;20,000; Western Australia, &#163;16,500; Tasmania, &#163;13,000; total, &#163;135,000 for nine months. My own estimate, published some six weeks ago, was &#163;160,000 loss for the twelve months ; so that there is not a great difference between my estimate and that of the Government. I put down the losses of the several States as follows: - New South Wales, &#163;75,000; Victoria, &#163;15,000; Queensland, &#163;20,000; South Australia, &#163;20,000; Western Australia, &#163;15,000; Tasmania, &#163;15,000. I notice that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harper,</inline> in his memorandum, fails to recognise the necessity for the abolition of the book-keeping system if penny postage is adopted, although he is not opposed to penny postage. He evidently does not see the point. </para>

                            <para>- I find that the final returns for 1905-6 vary those calculations. For one thing, the returns show that Western Australia would not need &#171;o large a fixed sum. Honorable senators, especially those from the West, are aware that the revenue of that State has fallen . somewhat during the last few years, so that the fixed sum would not need to be so high as I have reckoned. </para>

The Estimates for 1906-7, which have been issued within the last ten days, make a considerable difference in -the position. Those Estimates include calculations based on a penny postage; and there has been issued a special table based on a distribution of the surplus that it is estimated will be found to exist at the end of the present year, amongst the various States, excluding Western Australia. The table shows that should the estimated revenue for this year be received, and should it be distributed <inline font-style="italic">per capita,</inline> New South Wales would lose &#163;296,000, Victoria would gain &#163;6,000, Queensland would gain &#163;113,000, South Australia would gain &#163;110,000, and Tasmania, would gain &#163;66,000. </para>

                            <para>- Certainly. The difference made in the position of New South Wales is remarkable. To ask New South Wales to surrender practically &#163;300,000, to divide amongst the other States is a &#34; big order &#34; ; but the matter requires looking into. In my opinion, it is safer to rely on the actual figures of 1905- 6, rather than on the Estimates for 1906- 7. The Estimates show an expected increase from Customs and Excise of &#163;211,000, of which sum no less than &#163;170,000 -is credited to New South Wales, leaving only &#163;41,000 as the expected in* crease in the whole of the other five States. That very remarkable fact is the explanation of the question which I put to the Minister yesterday, as to the basis on which the Customs and Excise calculations for the current year are based. It seems to me very remarkable that the Treasurer, in an expected increase of &#163;211,000, should look for- &#163;170,000 from the one State of New South Wales. </para>

                            <para>- No ; there has been no public statement made. When I looked closely into the matter of expenditure, I found to my surprise that New South Wales is contributing <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> towards the defences of Australia, less than any one of the other five States. I suppose honorable senators are rather surprised at that statement.&#34; On the Estimates for 1905-6, I made the calculation that, dividing the whole of the expenditure on defences for that year per 100,000 of the population, the New South Wales charge would equal &#163;18,108, the Victorian charge would equal ,&#163;21,594, the Queensland charge &#163;22,678, that of South Australia &#163;18,994, Western Australia &#163;18,634, and Tasmania &#163;18,542. </para>

                    <para class="block">Wales, namely, &#163;18,108. When I look at&#39; the Defence Estimates for the current year and examine the figures given on page 34, I find that the debit against New South Wales is &#163;297,000, and that, if the distribution were on a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> basis, New South Wales would be debited with &#163;28,000 more. Victoria is debited with &#163;278,000, but on a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> basis, that State would be &#62; debited with only &#163;26.1:, 000, or &#163;17,000 less. Queensland is debited on the Estimates with &#163;133,000, while her <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> share would- be only &#163;1.14,000, or &#163;19,000 less. I shall not give the full figures for the other States, but merely say that South Australia is debited with &#163;6,000 short, Western Australia with &#163;2,000 short, and Tasmania with &#163;2,000 over. We&#39; have here the partly-unnoticed effects of the gradual changing proportion of population. Honorable senators know, I suppose, that New South Wales is now entitled to an additional &#39; member in another place, and that, according to the very full .figures which have been furnished? the percentage of the New South Wales population is gradually rising. But the defence arrangements being continued on the same basis as prior to Federation, the difference to which I have referred} is gradually increasing. While in the years 1901-6, New South Wales paid short of her average about &#163;60,000, that State, according to the Estimates now before Parliament, is to be charged, in this one year alone, &#163;28,000 short. That is one factor which indicates that a movement iri the direction of a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> distribution is not so unfair to New South Wales as might appear on the surface. I desire to draw attention to what is going on in connexion with the transfer of goods from one State to another. This is a matter that is worth <inline font-style="italic">tL</inline> little quiet study. Every year, in certain of the smaller States, the collection of Customs, revenue on the spot is decreasing, and credits are increasing for goods transferred from other States. That means that those smaller States are becoming more and more dependent on the other States. In the year 1902-3, Queensland was credited1, in this; connexion, with &#163;115,000, the next year with &#163;159,000, the next year with &#163;176,000, and last year with &#163;214,000. I should like to refer to a newspaper cutting which I have here. It appears that two or three years ago, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner, when he was </para>
                    <para class="block">Treasurer, was anxious to bring to an end the bookkeeping system, and thought he might make some arrangement for giving a lump sum to the States in lieu of monthly credits. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner proposed to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kidston,</inline> the Premier of Queensland, that the latter should accept &#163;125,000 a year, but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kidston;</inline> pointed out that the amount which Queensland was receiving was largely growing, and that if he accepted &#163;125,000 his State would very likely be a good deal out of pocket. When I say that the amount for Queensland last year on goods transferred from other States was &#163;214,000, honorable senators will see that that Stare would have been &#163;90,000 out of pocket had the arrangement suggested a few years ago by Sir George Turner been accepted by her. Ibr the State of South Australia the annual credits for the last four years have been ,&#163;2:1,000, &#163;21.000, &#163;28,000, and &#163;37,000. For Western Australia the annual credits during the four years have been &#163;38,000, &#163;90,000, &#163;129,000, and &#163;136,000. In the State of Tasmania the annual credits have been &#163;98,000, &#163;107,000, &#163;101,000, and last year &#163;113,000. The credits to these&#39; States are,&#34; of course, balanced by debits to the States of New South Wales and Victoria. </para>

                            <para>- Whether &#39; for good or evil, as regards the whole of the Commonwealth, honorable senators will see that our fiscal policy tends to a lessening of the Customs revenue in the smaller States. The bases of the matter are altogether hidden in mystery, and I am not going to attempt to estimate what the various States lose by receiving goods which are manufactured in other States rather than by receiving goods from other countries from which they would obtain revenue in the shape of Customs duties. </para>

                            <para>- Just so. I refer to goods locally produced in every way. I do not here raise the question of protection at all. What takes place may be good for the Commonwealth as a whole, but what we have to look at to-day in regard to our fiscal policy is its bearing on the question of a <inline font-style="italic">-per ca-pita</inline> distribution of revenue - whether it be wise or unwise that we should adopt a system which tends to deplete the revenue of the smaller States and to unduly raise the revenue of the larger States. Does not what I have stated raise a very strong argument in favour of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> distribution? There is another factor which should be borne in mind. I observe that in the two States chiefly interested in the transfer of goods, Queensland and Tasmania, the aggregate actual receipts, Customs and Excise, and including also transfers to which I have referred, seem to be falling off, whilst generally in the Commonwealth that is not the position. Here are the aggregates of the last four years for Queensland : For 1902-3, &#163;1,261,000; 1903-4, &#163;1,132,000; 1904-5, &#163;1,095,000; and last year, &#163;1,183,000, showing an&#39; increase on the previous year. For this year the estimate indicates an expectation of receipts to the value only of &#163;1,1.50,000, a drop of &#163;111,000 on the amount which was received four years ago, notwithstanding a considerable increase of population, and, I think, also of prosperity in the interval. In the State of Tasmania, in 1902-3, the Customs receipts were &#163;361,000, &#34;and those receipts gradually fell in the .three following years to &#163;342, 000, &#163;33i,&#176;00&#62; and &#163;326,000, and for the year on which we have now entered the Treasurer expects about the same low rate from Tasmania as last year, namely, &#163;327,000. I ask myself whether there is anything the matter with these States which indicates a general retrogression, and which would lead us to expect that their Customs receipts should fall in this way. I turn to the postage receipts, and I find that in Queensland and Tasmania the receipts from the sale of postage stamps has increased at least as fast as in the other States. That being so, I come to the conclusion that there should have been some increase in the Customs receipts of those States in fair ordinary circumstances, just as there has been in the case of the other States of the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- Yet the honorable senator is supporting the continuance of a policy which has exactly the reverse effect, and it is the poorer States which the Government are treating in a meagre way. T direct attention to returns made public quite recently of production in New South Wales and Victoria. In 1904 the value of the production of primary and manufacturing industries combined in the State of Victoria totalled 31.7 millions sterling, and in New South Wales they totalled 39.4 millions. The value per head of population amounted to &#163;26 4s. 3d. for Victoria, and &#163;27 4s. 7d. for New South Wales. If New South Wales is making more money per head than Victoria, should we not expect to find some larger return in her revenue, and should we not be prepared to see her paying under a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> arrangement some larger amount than she would pay under the existing system ? Taking the returns for last year, which, so far as Victoria is concerned, were made public only yesterday, the value of the production of the primary and manufacturing industries in that State for 1905 is estimated at 34 millions sterling, whilst the value of the productions of the primary and manufacturing industries of New South&#39; Wales for last year is estimated at 46.7 millions sterling. </para>

                            <para>- Undoubtedly; but whatever be the source, it is there. Whether a man has a sovereign in his pocket the product of wool or the product of potatoes, it is equally there to spend. The value per head of production in Victoria last year is given as &#163;27 19s. 6d., whilst for New South Wales it stands at &#163;31 1 1 si. 4d. In other words, in 1904, there was an excess of &#163;1 os. 4d. per head in New South Wales, whilst for last year it was given as &#163;3 ns. iod. These figures may not be quite accurate, but I think it is fair to assume that there&#39; is a larger, and perhaps a&#34; materially larger, earning of wealth per head of population in New South Wales, &#39;and if that be so, will that State refuse to recognise the fact in matters of revenue &#34;and expenditure? I think not. &#39; &#39; &#39; &#62; </para>

                            <para>- No, no. The honorable senator must not say that. I wish to be fair and just. I think it is the duty of every one of us to remember that we are members of the Commonwealth Parliament, and not to forget what is involved in the word &#34; Commonwealth.&#34; Each one of us should seek to do what is right by other people. If a man picks up a sovereign belonging to some one else, he wishes to restore it at once, and if I find myself in possession of any information which calls for a re-arrangement of different charges, it is my bounden duty to make public that information. Referring to Coghlan&#39;s figures, showing the value of property and income per inhabitant, published in his book for 1903-4, when things were generally less prosperous than they are now, I find that he puts the value of property and amount of income in New South Wales at higher than in the other States. That again, to some extent, explains what appears to be a somewhat material discrepancy in the return as to the greater amount provided by that State. I have another set of figures, which I should like to give honorable senators if they will bear with me. I quote from page 47 of the Treasurer&#39;s statement for the year 1905-6. I wish to direct attention to the percentages of the receipts and expenditure in the various States. It is a remarkable thing that, whilst in New South Wales and Victoria the percentage of receipts is in excess of the percentage of expenditure, in Queensland, South Australia, and Tasmania the percentage of expenditure is greater than the percentage of receipts. For New South Wales the accounts show receipts 36.55, as against expenditure, 34.97; an excess of receipts amounting to 1.58. For Victoria, receipts 27.90, expenditure 26.65 ; an excess of receipts amounting to 1.25. For Queensland receipts 13.13, expenditure 15.39; an excess of expenditure amounting&#39; to 2.26. In South Australia, the. percentage of receipts is 8.37, and of expenditure 9.47, showing an excess of 1,10 in expenditure. In Western Australia, the percentage of receipts is 10.25,andof expenditure 9.2.2, showing an excess of 1.03 in receipts. &#39; In Tasmania, the percentage of receipts is 3.80, and of expenditure 4.30. showing an excess of 0.50 in expenditure. In &#39; the&#39; smaller States, except Western Australia, the expenditure is larger, relatively, than, the receipts. </para>

                            <para>- The figures include all the expenditure under the Commonwealth. I have also some figures which represent calculations of my own, based upon figures given on page 36 of the <inline font-style="italic">Accounts of Expenditure for</inline> 1905-6.. These - figures are, I think, remarkable. The estimated expenditure per head is as follows : - New South Wales, &#163;11s. 3d. ; Victoria, &#163;10s. 3d. ; Queensland, &#163;1 6s. 9d. ; South Australia, &#163;1 3s.11d. ;. and Tasmania, &#163;1 2s. 3d. ; showing that the expenditure per head is very much larger in the smaller States than in the larger States. After deducting the expenditure, there was left on those accounts the following balance of revenue : - New South Wales, &#163;1 13s. 3d. ; Victoria,. &#163;111s. 6d. ; Queensland, &#163;1 7s. 9d. ; South Australia,&#163;1 6s. ; and Tasmania,. <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> 7s. 2d. </para>

                            <para>- The Treasurer proposes to terminate the bookkeeping system and the Braddon section together, and he proposes to terminate the former by adopting a calculation based upon the receipts of years yet to come - that is, the five years ending 1910. It is obvious that all sorts of things might happen in the interval. There will be, I suppose, a continuation of this movement between the States. I think that honorable senators would hesitate very much before they decided to accept a fixed sum based upon the payments for years, which would be far ahead, and during which all sorts of things might happen, when certain States might have a large accession of revenue, and other States might suffer considerably. The idea that is behind this proposal for the payment of a fixed sum is, I think, a mistaken one. I do not like the scheme, because I do &#39; not think it . is fair. If we adopt a fixed sum for any given time, every State will be suspicious, and will examine the payment it receives in comparison with the fixed sums paid to other States. No doubt, if its population should increase more rapidly than that of other States, it will say, &#34; Our fixed sum is not fair.&#34; The system would give rise to a great deal of the element of uncertainty which now pertains to the payments, and which makes the States dissatisfied with Federal finance. </para>

                            <para>- I prefer the bookkeeping system as against a fixed sum perhaps, but not as against a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> system. Fixed sums perpetuate strife and uncertainty. That I think would be the case, and I ask honorable senators to reflect. It is desirable that we should keep in our mind the strong distinction between accounts that represent business and accounts that represent1 pure government. It is here, I think, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harper</inline> has gone wrong. His proposals with regard to business seem to me most extraordinary, but I do not wish to go into the question of States - debts, as it does not enter into the consideration of this motion. a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harper&#39;s</inline> scheme is a good one so far as he proposes to terminate the bookkeeping system at once. He advocates that it shall terminate upon a calculation based upon the receipts for some years which have elapsed, but the plan is surrounded by, and depends upon, such remarkable proposals that I think they are really out of court, and cannot be considered. The injustice that would be perpetrated by his proposals with regard . to some States make them too ludicrous almost to talk about. He suggests the talking over of all the debts quite apart from the assets. I find that Queensland has one mile of railway to every 172 of her people, while New South Wales has only one mile of railway to every 420 of her people. How can we amalgamate the debts when we do not amalgamate the assets? I do not desire to detain the Senate much longer, but I wish to quote two extracts from a letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Henry, of Tasmania, who was a member of the Federal Convention. Writing to me on the subject of my paper published a few weeks ago, he says - </para>

                        <para>I am strongly in sympathy with your aim in endeavouring to end this most unfederal arrangement, on the expiry of the five years&#39; period. I am surprised that the traders of Australia should have suffered the infliction for so long, without a hot protest against it.

                    <para class="block">In view of what has been disclosed by the accounts bearing upon the adjustment of revenue, and of the varying degrees of expansion in the different States, the proposal for the payment of a lump sum, I submit, is not fair to the smaller States. We have, I think, great need of simplicity in the P federal accounts. There is abroad a great feeling of uncertainty, and, to my mind, the adoption of a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> system of payment would commend itself.

                            <para>- Something of that sort. I thank honorable senators for their patience in listening to me in dealing with a matter which has been exceedingly dry. But&#39; it is one in which is wrapped up a subject of very great importance. We are, perhaps, in this Parliament, dealing too much with matters of minor consequence, which, when looked at fifty years hence, will appear very small in comparison with this subject, which is of very great importance indeed. Federation was accomplished largely with the view of bringing about free and uninterrupted trade and intercourse between the people <inline font-style="italic">oi</inline> Australia ; and it is with the object of securing that absolute freedom that I have made my statement, and submitted the amendment which I have the honour to move. </para>

                                <para>- We can congratulate ourselves; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> deserves our thanks for the time and trouble which he has devoted to working out the figures which he has quoted, and for giving us the results of his investigations. I agree with him that we are, perhaps, devoting too much attention to some questions which are of very small consequence; and I certainly agree with him that many urgent questions are receiving but little attention from Parliament, and from the Government. Representing as I do the State which is looked upon by all parties - even by the mover of the motion - as one die conditions of which are exceptional, and as <inline font-style="italic">as</inline> disturbing factor in Federal finance, I naturally take a somewhat different view from the speakers who have preceded me. In the first place, I object to a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> system of distribution of a general character, which would include the State of Western Australia, because of the manifest unfairness of such a proposal. In the second place, I object to the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford,</inline> for the reason that it places Western Australia in the position of a poor relation, to whom a grant in aid must be made, although the money would be contributed by the taxpayers of Western Australia. The honorable senator admitted that the only constitutional way in which his view could be met would be by making a grant to Western Australia, that money having previously been contributed by the: taxpayers of the State. . Another objection, which has been emphasized by the speeches to which we h&#39;ave listened, is the want of information to enable us to arrive at a determination just and equitable, not only to Western Australia, but to the other States. &#39; The latter seems tome to be the &#39;strongest objection. In- my own State, prior to Federation, we had a Federal party and an anti-Federal party. In the State Parliament the anti-Federal party predominated. They appointed a Commission to investigate the position in which Western Australia would be placed as the result of Federation. That Commission took all the evidence which it was possible to get- evidence from the State Treasury officials, from statisticians, and other authorities. I remember that one of the conclusions of the Commission was that Federation would mean a loss to the revenue of Western Australia in the first year of &#163;300,000. We all know how that prediction has been falsified. Not only has not Federation meant a loss to the revenue of Western Australia, but it has resulted in a very large gain. We see, therefore, the danger of proceeding upon information which is not full and complete. </para>

When we remember that trie State of Western Australia, has to face a deficit in her State finances of &#163;119,000, we can realize that an additional loss of &#163;330,000 would strike a very heavy blow at her stability. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable senator may have done that in his speech, but his motion does not say sp. We have to discuss the terms of the motion, not the charitable intentions of the honorable senator who moves it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> has gone fully into the question of what would be the result .if Western Australia were excluded from the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> system, and the Budget papers show that, even if Western .Australia were excluded, one State, New South Wales, would lose &#163;184,520. In looking through the valuable and informative tables circulated with the Budget, I have been much struck by the fact that we really have not sufficient information to enable us to come to a sound- conclusion on this matter. We have no information as to what would probably be the effect within the next few years. It seems to me that the wisest course would be to continue the bookkeeping system for another five years, at any rate. Then the &#34; Braddon blot &#34; will have to be dealt with, and we shall have five years&#39; additional information to guide us. </para>

                                <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford&#39;s</inline> figures point to the conclusion that there have been factors at work in the various States that have not yet reached finality. We cannot even say that we have reached finality in reference to the distributing centres of our trade. Whether Sydney land Melbourne (will- eventually continue to be the great distributing centres for the Commonwealth we do not know. The figures seem to show that a process of change is going on. In a young country like Australia there are constantly disturbing factors. The discovery of new gold-fields may entirely alter the balance of trade and of population. Therefore the Commonwealth will be wise to go slowly in this important matter. </para>

                                <para>- For that reason, I am opposed to a sliding scale, which has all the defects I have indicated. We have nothing on which we can justly base a sliding scale for terminating the bookkeeping period for Western Australia, or, for that matter, for any other State. In this connexion, I desire to point out that, according to the Budget Papers, page 83, the loss and decline in revenue that would have accrued to Western Australia if the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> system had been adopted from the first, has not been uniform. In the year 1 901-2, if the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> system had been in force, Western Australia would have lost &#163;656,000, whereas in the next year she would have lost &#163;579,834 In the next year, Western Australia would have lost ,&#163;453,000, and in the following year &#163;425,000. In the last year there would have been a difference of only about ,&#163;28,000, whereas in the two previous years there would have been a drop of &#163;100,000 and ,&#163;80,000 respectively. It will be seen, therefore, that the drop has not been uniform, and that a sliding scale, based on the experience of the last five years, would be&#39; absolutely unreliable. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> attempted to justify the motion on the ground that the Commonwealth Government in 1904-5 inaugurated a system of <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> distribution of expenditure. As the honorable senator rightly pointed out, Western Australia, as a newly-settled State, the developments of which have been largely confined to the last sixteen years, was in a backward condition, so far as concerns public works, and the Government had to ask Parliament for a larger sum for public works in the transferred Departments than was required in the other States. The result of a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> distribution of expenditure is &#39;that Western Australia gets much more than what may be regarded as her share. But while that is so, if .&#39;honorable senators will turn to the figures, they will admit that it would be scarcely right, in order to rectify a wrong, by which Western Australia has, during the last five years, gained less than &#163;100,000, to inflict another wrong, by which that State would lose over .&#163;1,000,000 in that period. If the <inline font-style="italic">-per capita</inline> system of expenditure is wrong, and so inequitable in the opinion of Parliament that it should be abolished, by all means let us end it, and go back to the other system by which each State is debited with the expenditure on new works and with &#34; other &#34; expenditure. Such a system would certainly be more just to Western Australia than to seek to rectify a balance of &#163;100,000 by taking from the taxpayers of that State over &#163;.1,000,000 in five years. </para>

                                <para>- I am afraid the honorable senator has not been listening, or he would know that the decline in the five years has not been gradual. In one year&#39; the drop amounted to &#163;100,000, in another year to &#163;80,000, and in a third year to only &#163;27,000. </para>

                                <para>- Yes; but not a gradual or -equal drop ; and, therefore, I say that the experience of- the past few years is an unsafe basis. In any_ case, while some States mav have reason to complain, Tasmania has none. Up to the present time - taking into account the amount on the present Estimates - Tasmania has received &#163;769 more than she would have been entitled to if the expenditure had been on a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> basis. Tasmania, at any rate, has not suffered; and if Western Australia has gained, it has not been at the expense of Tasmania, but at the expense of other States. </para>

The figures given&#62; in the Budget papers show that the figures quoted by the honorable senator were estimates of expenditure. What Tasmania has been debited with are not estimates of expenditure, but the amounts actually expended. </para>

Then <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe,</inline> in support of his motion, quoted the utterances of several speakers at the various Federal Conventions. But what possible value can the opinions of those speakers have as applied to the present financial position? We admit to-day that we have difficulty in making up our minds as to the future financial position of the Commonwealth ; but how much more uninformed were the speakers quoted by the honorable senator? </para>

We are now dealing with the question of a financial estimate based on experience ; and in this connexion the speakers at the Conventions were admittedly in the dark. On financial matters, all that the members of the Conventions could do was to estimate ; and the bookkeeping section itself was an admission that they could not correctly forecast the future from a financial point of view. What is the value of the opinions of the members of the Convention in support of a proposal for the abolition of the bookkeeping system? Such opinions are absolutely valueless. </para>

To-day we have the data of five years&#39; experience, but even that we find so inadequate as to cause men to arrive at different conclusions. There is much difference in the theories which are submitted as to the future; and this should teach us, at any rate, that the opinions quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> are absolutely of no value in the way of enabling us to arrive at a right decision. The honorable senator also complained of the serious financial position of Tasmania, and the loss suffered by that State under Federation; and in support of the position he took up, he pointed to the falling off in the Customs revenue for the last five years. The honorable senator showed a decrease in this revenue of some &#163;100,000. But what is the lesson to be learned ? </para>

                                <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> should remember that so far as concerns the diversion of trade, there is a credit and a debit side. During the first two years of Federation there was a serious d&#39;rought in the Commonwealth, and during the whole of that time, when the potato, oat, barley, and wheat crops were a practical failure on the mainland, Tasmania had the whole of the Commonwealth, with the exception of Western Australia, as a free market. Indeed, there was a duty imposed in order to protect the producers of Tasmania against the competition of New Zealand. There are figures available to prove an enormous increase in the export of such products to the Commonwealth from Tasmania in those years. </para>

                                <para>- They are not taxed now in respect of a number of imports on which they formerly had to pay taxation. Is that an injustice to the State? What is the State? I take it that the State is the people of Tasmania, and it is impossible to describe as an injustice to the people of that State the fact that they are now taxed to the extent of &#163;100,000 less than they were five years ago. What is the injustice from the State Treasurer&#39;s point of view? His finances have been disturbed by the diversion of trade, and the abolition of Inter-State duties. But the money still remains with the people of the State. Honorable senators from Tasmania do not contend that the State is any less prosperous than it was. They have given no proof that there is less money in the State, or that her people are any poorer. The fact is that the money is still there, and is still taxable, and if the State Treasurer has a grievance, it is not against the Commonwealth. Does he grieve because the Commonwealth will not put on large revenue duties which are not required in four of the other States? </para>

                                <para>- In answer to that interjection, I say that the taxpayers of Western Australia are the poorer, because we have had that Inter-State Tariff. I never defended, but, on the contrary, always denounced it, and I did what I could as an individual, and an elector of Western Australia, to abolish it. The interjection, therefore, has no point as addressed to me. I say that the Western Australian special Tariff has been a burden to the people of that State. Whilst it has beer of advantage to the Treasurer of the State, it has taken the money out of the pockets of the people of that State and has been disadvantageous to them. </para>

                                <para>- No; I will not, because it is a very much lower Tariff than the Commonwealth Tariff. In the case of many items, the Commonwealth Tariff imposes duties 100 per cent. higher than the Western Australian special Tariff. But I will admit that by means of that Tariff, Western Australia has exacted revenue from the Inter-State trade. It has been a good thing from the point of view of the State Treasurer, but not from the point of view of the people of that State. Exactly the reverse position is shown in Tasmania. My contention is that Tasmania can herself remedy the grievance of which her representatives complain. The money is retained by the people of the State, and is still available for taxation ; and if the people of Tasmania desired to adjust their finances they might have done so at any time by the introduction of a system of State taxation. </para>

                                <para>- I may not; but it appears to me that no determined effort has been made by the people of Tasmania to readjust the finances of the State by means of an equitable system of land taxation. Until some such effort is made, they have no right to complain that, the Commonwealth has disarranged their finances. It must be admitted that the money is in the pockets of the people of Tasmania, and can be reached by taxation. </para>

                                <para>- It has been suggested that a probably more equitable system for the distribution of revenue and expenditure would be one based on the adult population of the various States. I thought there might be something in that, because of the large adult population of Western Australia. I went to some trouble to discover the number of adults in the different States. Of course the latest definite figures with respect to population that we can get are those provided by the census of 1 901. Since that time our population has been very largely increased. I found it necessary, therefore, to take the percentage of adults in the figures for 1901, and apply the same percentage to the population figures for 1905, with a slight modification in. the case of Western Australia, because during the last three or four years our percentage of adults has decreased. I found that the system proposed would make very little difference when compared with the system of distribution on a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> basis. The following would be, roughly, the results of the application of the system suggested :- </para>

On page 10 of the paper he has circulated, in dealing with the supplementary provisions of his scheme, he makes a proposal in sub-clause 3 of clause 35 to the following effect: - </para>

                        <para class="block">Australia differentiates it from all the other States, inasmuch as its proportion of Customs revenue provided in accordance with the Braddon clause leaves a large balance over and above the amount payable by it for interest, and it is worthy of consideration whether it would not be advisable to arrange with that State that in the event of Parliament passing a Bill for the construction of the West Australia railway from Port Augusta, money to the extent of &#163;5,000,000 for its construction will be found by the Commonwealth on account of West Australia, and that for a period of, say, fifteen or twenty years, the Commonwealth will provide the interest and sinking funds upon the &#163;5,000,000 so invested, and, at the end of that time, when presumably conditions in West Australia will have assimilated largely to those of the other States, the State Government will thenceforward pay the interest and sinking fund as if the debt had been incurred by them in the first instance. If that arrangement were made, it would supersede the proposal&#39; for repayment to the State referred to in paragraph 13. </para>
                        <para class="block">He says that Western Australia is differentiated from the other States because of abnormal revenue conditions. That is to say that, at the present time, our revenue-producing capacity is a,t its highest, giving a greater return per head of population than any other State of the Commonwealth. In fifteen or twenty years time he believes that our revenue conditions will have approximated to those of the eastern States, and the revenue productivity of Western Australia will have decreased. During the term at which it is highest, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harper</inline> suggests that the Commonwealth should pay interest and sinking fund for that State, but when it reaches its lowest ebb he suggests that Western Australia should be asked to pay interest and sinking fund for herself. One has. only to consider that for a moment to see what a ridiculous proposal it is. During the time when Western Australia- is best able to bear a burden, owing to her revenue-producing capacity being high, she is to be assisted, and when she is least able to bear the burden, when her revenue conditions have approximated to those of the eastern States, it is to be imposed upon her. </para>

To my mind this paragraph largely discounts the value of the honorable member&#39;s other conclusions. For the reasons I have given, it is my intention to vote against the amendment. I think we should allow the bookkeeping period to continue for another five years, in order that we might be supplied with further data on- which to base conclusions as to the future treatment of the finances of the Commonwealth. I, of course, also intend to vote against the motion, because it proposes what would be manifestly inequitable to the State which I represent. </para>

                    <para class="block">I regret to have to trouble .the Senate again with this subject, but it is one of the greatest importance. Until we have a system of defence which has a national foundation, and is as safe as it&#39; can be made, I shall deem it my duty, on all occasions, to appeal to the Senate. I admit that the Minister of Defence has, perhaps, the most intricate and difficult Department to administer. Like his predecessors, he has already had great difficulty in determining how to meet the different views which ha.ve been expressed on naval and military defence - universal training and cadet training. I do not wonder that sometimes he is puzzled as to what course to take. But I do not think that either he or any one else can contend that our system of defence has a national foundation. The great question before the people of the United Kingdom, and one of the great questions before the Australian people, is the question of universal training. The reason why I am so greatly disappointed with the Minister&#39;s very meagre cadet scheme is because the Prime Minister published in the daily newspapers his views on the subject of defence, boldly setting forth &#39;that he was in favour of a scheme of universal military service. I understood from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> and some of his colleagues that every member of the Cabinet, possibly with one exception, held similar views. It is no wonder then that we are disappointed when we are given a scheme which applies to only the boys and youths of the Commonwealth, which is not compulsory, and which does not attempt to place the slightest control upon the boys when they have left school, except in regard to the senior cadets, who, of course, are a mere handful. In that way alone it is a very meagre scheme indeed. Lately, three systems of cadet training have been proposed. In the first&#39; place, a Committee of Defence, presided over by <inline font-weight="bold">Colonel Williams,</inline> proposed to train 22,956 cadets at an annual cost of about &#163;30,700. I think that these officers must have intended that some kind of compulsion should be used, because they state distinctly that it is essential to the organization of all the existing cadet schemes, which, as we know, were under the Education Department in some States and under the Military authorities in other States. They went on to say that the organization should provide for the training of all boys in school, and of all boys who had left school, up to. I think, seventeen or eighteen years of age. </para>

                            <para>- The second scheme, which emanated from Lt.-Col. McCay, provided for the compulsory training of all boys during their attendance at school. It made no provision for boys who had left school, but in regard to those boys Lt.Col. McCay said that it might be possible to form voluntary cadet corps. That is one of my objections to the whole of these schemes. We do not want to talk about what is possible. We do not wish to leave the boy the master of the situation, and to say whether there shall be a citizens&#39; army or not. That appears to me to be a weak spot in Lt.-Col. McCay &#39;s scheme; but, on the whole, I think it is the best that has been admitted. , He promised to make a beginning with 20,000 cadets at a cost of &#163;22,000, but he went on to say that at the end of the fifth year he would have 60,000 boys being trained, at a cost of &#163;43,500. Perhaps I had better read the passage to which I refer. It is as follows : - </para>

                    <para class="block">The Minister of Defence has departed from that scheme, and adopted one of his own. I think it would have been much wiser, and far more satisfactory to those who take an intense interest in this subject, if he had followed the principle of Lt.-Col. McCay&#39;s scheme, and been able to show that at the end of five years there would be a reasonable number of boys undergoing military training. But we are cut down to about 23.000 cadets, at an annual cost of &#163;20,000 or&#163;22,000, and that appears to be the end of the matter. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. I am quite aware that the Minister&#39;s scheme can be extended, but it is unbusiness-like. Suppose that the movement spread, and that more than 23,000 boys offered themselves, no provision would have been made for the training of the additional number, and consequently their ardour would be damped. On the other hand, under the voluntary system we have 10,000 cadets. If the Minister does not enrol the 23,000 cadets under his scheme, there will be no power to attract the boys, unless we tempt them to join by means of the uniform, and that again is another weak spot in the scheme. Under his scheme, Lt.-Col. McCay said that no uniform would be required for the boys, but under the Minister&#39;s scheme a complete uniform is required. A State-school master who conferred with Colonel Hoad seemed to place great reliance upon the uniform, and the Minister, I think, places- too much dependence upon it. At all events, he intends to provide &#163;7,500 a year for uniforms alone. The military men whom I have consulted say that a uniform, which would cost 15s., is not required that it would be a waste of money to give it to boys of twelve, thirteen, and fourteen years of age, and that what they ought to get is a regulation cap, belt, and pouch, at a cost of2s. or 3s. In my honorable friend&#39;s scheme I do not think that economy with efficiency has been sufficiently kept in view. I should say that in New Zealand there is a splendid cadet force. I admit that it is voluntary but during the last few years it has increased enormously. I believe that the </para>

                            <para>- No; I understand from the Minister that the uniform is to cost 15s., and is to last for two years&#39;, practically costing 7s. 6d. a year. In New Zealand the authorities allow only 2s. per head for cap, belt, and pouch, but they make a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> allowance of 2s. 6d. as against the <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> which my honorable friend proposes to give. Here is an allowance of 4s. 6d. per head as against 20s. If the Minister condemns the officers&#39; scheme as being a little too costly, I think that his own scheme may very fairly be described in that way. I would suggest the adoption of a scheme under which, for the first two, if not three, years, nothing but a cap. belt, and pouch should be required, and afterwards the boys might be put into uniforms if they could be afforded. If, however, we could not afford that expenditure - and I understand that that is the sole reason for having such a very small scheme of defence - let us do away with the uniform. What we want are the boys and rifles and ammunition. If we cannot afford to provide a uniform, do not let us curtail the education of the boys, do not let us have a half and half sort of scheme when it is possible to have a thoroughly good scheme of a national character. Here is another argument which I ask my honorable friend most earnestly to consider. Unlike the officers, neither he nor Lt.-Col. McCay has made any &#34;provision for the boys who have left school. Had he before him any statistics when he settled upon his scheme? Did he Lear in mind that the great bulk of our boys leave school at the age of thirteen or. thirteen and a half? </para>

                            <para>- In all the States except two, boys can leave school at the age of thirteen years. In the great bulk of cases if a billet worth 2s. 6d. or 5s. a week could be got, the boy would leave the State school, especially if he were the son of a workman, or mechanic. How can such a scheme be called a national scheme? How can it do away with the necessity of, perhaps, universal training amongst adults? In a return, the statistician for Tasmania gives the number of youths of the age of twelve years, and , under the age of nineteen years, in each State, and states the total number at 295,359. Let us compare the number of youths in each State with the scheme of roy honorable friend and. notice how it works out. In New South Wales there are to be 8,520 cadets, senior and junior. There happen to be in that State between the ages of thirteen and nineteen 114,918 youths. So that the Minister&#39;s scheme provides for between&#39; one-thirteenth and one-fourteenth part of the youths of New South Wales. In Victoria his scheme provides for 7,020 cadets of both classes, whilst there are in this State 87,170 youths. He therefore provides for about one-twelfth, of the number. In Queensland* 3,110 cadets are provided for, and the number of youths is 36,270. The Minister therefore provides for about one-twelfth. In South Australia, 1,990 cadets are allotted, and the number of youths is 30,128. The scheme, therefore, provides for about one-fifteenth. </para>

                            <para>- I understand that the reason why Ministers have come to such a feeble decision with regard to universal training is that they believe that Parliament would not vote the necessary money. I am perfectly satisfied that Parliament would not vote the money for any large and elaborate system, and therefore I am putting aside for the moment the scheme to which I believe we shall have to come ultimately - a scheme of universal training, as in Switzerland&#39;, for all youths between 17 and 23 or 16 and 22. I tell my honorable friend plainly that the only possible way to escape from that is to extend the cadet system and to make it compulsory for the youths at our schools to be trained. Lt.-Col. McCay, when he was Minister, agreed to the extension of the cadet system, and I ask my honorable friend to do the same. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister practically tells us that it is Tor Parliament to decide. It is not. It is for Ministers to take upon themselves the responsibility of laying down a policy. Instead of that, however, my honorable friend is waiting to see which way the cat jumps. That is not what we expect from a Minister of Defence. We shall never be able to get this matter into anything like order until the Minister at the head of the Department shows a determination to lead Parliament. I can quite understand that the Minister would not be able to lead Parliament in the direction of great expenditure. He cannot compel Parliament to spend &#163;50,000 if it will vote only &#163;30,000. But my complaint is that he does not even, put before us a scheme to accomplish what he professes to desire. He puts forward a plan which involves the spending of altogether too much money on uniforms. </para>

Let me quote a few opinions on this subject. The first is that of Bishop Barlow. He said - he trusted the Governments, both in the State and Commonwealth, would soon abandon that narrow, short-sighted, perilous policy of reducing to an unworthy and almost unworkable minimum the grants for the defence of our homes, and he trusted still more that public opinion might soon be roused to demand that every incentive should be given to train and encourage Australia&#39;s sons. </para>

                            <para>- It amounts to a criticism of what the House of Representatives did a little while ago, when it cut down the Defence vote. My honorable friend is evidently afraid that the vote for his Department will be cut down again. I next desire to quote an account by an, anonymous writer in the <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> of the Japanese military manoeuvres. </para>

                            <para>- This writer is an officer who attended the military manoeuvres in Japan after the Chinese war. He gives an account of how, in the Japanese schools, the boys are taught drill, and are instilled with ideas of patriotism, courage, and devotion to their country. That is what we require to do here. On the occasion of the military manoeuvres referred to. the school boys were marched out the night before and camped close to the field. Officers were detailed to attend them, and to explain to them the meaning of the manoeuvres which they witnessed. This writer says that compulsory training has been the making of the Japanese nation. Marshal Oyama and the leading citizens of Japan are agreed that the two main elements which have contributed to the success of modern Japan are the adoption of constitutional government and of compulsory military training. </para>

                        <para>A system could be used to increase the chest measurement by three or four inches, make the body supple, and increase the nervous vitality that enabled a race to make its way. Awarding the first place to the Japanese system, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Bryant</inline> went on to say that nearly all the systems were closely connected. It was disheartening to notice the number of weedy men in an Eight Hours&#39; Day procession. He had been an examiner of recruits for the past sixteen years, and during the last two years it had been the exception to examine a well developed young man. To neglect the physical culture of the rising generation was criminal, and it should be included as a branch of education under qualified instructors. Medical officers might also make inspections, and in doing so would be able to note the health of the pupils. He suggested that if the Government would not take this in hand, a league should be formed to work out the details of a national scheme. </para>

                        <para>The criticisms of the Royal Commission on the War in South Africa as to organization, and the suggestions of individual members, interesting and important as they are, could have hardly come as a surprise to any one in any way cognisant of the shortcomings of our military system. By far the most pregnant of the suggestions contained in the report is that of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Goldie, to which Lord Esher, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir F.</inline> Darley, and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Edge apparently give their adherence - viz., compulsory national military education. Sir George Goldie proposes the institution of national cadet schools, officered from the Regular Army, in which all youths not in the Navy or merchant service or efficient members of Volunteer cadet corps would have to serve for a term. </para>

                        <para>There is one way, however - a way which ought to be used without delay - in which the physical advantages of drill could be brought to all, at an age when it would be of great value. Compulsory drill ought to be enforced in every school. In the schools the entire rising male population is mustered. If every boy before he was 14 had done 60 drills of one hour each he would, at all events, know how to hold himself and how to walk, and if, in addition, he had by that age fired 100 rounds from a cadet rifle, divided between 50, 100, and 150 yards, he ought to have mastered the art of holding straight. Boys of that age are very teachable, they would take kindly to the drill, and keenly enjoy the shooting ; what is drudgery to the recruit of 18 would be play to them. A considerable increase in the militia and volunteer permanent staff is necessary for peace training and even more requisite on mobilization, and these sergeants could, when not required with their units, be dispersed (and even live) within easy reach of the schools which they would drill. Lord Methuen was very strong on this point. He advised - &#34; Make it compulsory in schools that all boys should be drilled.&#34; &#34; Every boy at school should be able to shoot and drill, and that would help you a great deal.&#34; </para>

Do I understand the Minister to be of opinion that the States Governments would raise any objection? My own opinion is that no objection would be raised ; but, as a matter of fact, the Minister of Defence has simply taken the easiest course. Why did the Minister not give us an opportunity to discuss the scheme? We take a great interest in this matter, and leagues have been formed in Sydney and Victoria with the object of bringing about universal training. The Minister of Defence had two or three schemes before him, but he set to work and created another of his own - which, by the way, I regard as the worst - and did not give us an opportunity to discuss it. I urge upon the Minister to listen to the opinions of honorable senators, and, after consultation with his officers to improve the scheme. From an article in one of our own newspapers, under the heading, &#34; The Training of a Nation,&#34; I take the following, which shows what is the opinion of <inline font-style="italic">The Times -</inline></para>

                        <para>If we can trust much that we read in current literature, the British people are in sore need of physical training, and, indeed, of discipline of more than one kind. Thus, we may discover a great good in what, to a certain extent, is an- evil, and the British population may be made more capable and presentable than it now is. On this point, the <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> speaks out very plainly, and, evidently, but echoes a fast-growing public opinion. It says, &#34;Drill for everybody, familiarity with a rifle for everybody, and higher education as applied to war for all who possess superior intelligence would do nothing but good&#39; all round.&#34; </para>

                        <para>Lord Raglan states that the National Service League, of which he is President, recently communicated with the principals of these -schools, pointing out that a system of preliminary training in drill and the use of the rifle would, besides imbuing the boys with a sense of manly discipline and true patriotism, enable them to carry out their military training properly, much more easily, and at much less sacrifice of time than would be necessary if no ground work had previously been laid. The league offered to give annually two prizes - a gold medal and a silver medal - for the best trained boys in each school. &#34; I am now,&#34; says Lord Raglan, &#34; able to state that we have received answers from nearly all the public schools, and that they have been favorable in almost every! case. This fact, indicating as &#39;it does the complete acceptance of our principles by the head masters of 90 per cent, of the big schools, shows that it would be easy to carry a Bill making military drill and rifle shooting compulsory as the ground work of a truly national reserve.&#34; </para>

                    <para>Under these circumstances I hope the Minister will make some promise that he will consult with his officers with a view to presenting a scheme of wider dimensions than that which he at present favours. I notice that, under the scheme of the Minister, a considerable proportion of the training has to be carried on in school hours ; and that, in my opinion, is a great mistake. The curriculum of the States schools has been getting wider and wider, and it may be that too great a range of subjects is attempted. The object ought to be to teach the boys reading, writing, and arithmetic, with history and geography, of which they ought to have a firm grasp, so that they may be able to take any situation that offers. </para>

                            <para>- I know that the boys do a little gymnastics and drill; but rifle shooting and manoeuvring could not be taught in school hours. One writer points out that a boy at school, between the ages of ten and seventeen, is practically compelled to devote, I don&#39;t know how many thousands of hours to cricket, football, and other games, and contends that if a tenth, or a fifteenth, part of that time could be devoted to military drill, the. boys would be partly trained .soldiers at the end of their school life. I, therefore, ask that the scheme should be amended in this connexion, because it has been impossible to introduce the military training in the school hours between nine and four. It is inevitable that the boys must&#34; be asked to drill sometimes on half -holidays, and do part of their work out of school hours. Another writer on this -point, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. C.</inline> E. Dawkins, says - </para>

I do not think the Boer war would have occurred had the Boers had any idea that there was a citizen soldiery behind the regular army. Out of 137,000 soldiers who went to the front, over 50,000 were, I believe, condemned as ineffective, owing to want of training, poor physique, or absence of skill in shooting and riding. </para>

It is for that reason that we find every general, colonel, and major recommending the drilling and training of boys and citizens generally. We should have a citizen army, and then we should be able to meet in the best possible way any emergency that might arise. </para>

If we can afford to establish an Australian Navy, and Parliament desires its establishment, let us have it, but do not let us forget the foundation, or build it in an unstable manner. I have not exhausted more than one-half of my notes, but I shall resume my seat with the expression of a hope that the Minister, when he hears the criticisms which I hope other honorable senators will offer, will confer with his officers and see whether he cannot propose some scheme which will be a little more universal than that which he has submitted, and which will make some provision for boys who, although they may have left school, are still running about the street. If the honorable senator will do that, he will confer a great boon upon the Commonwealth. </para>

            <para>
        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir JOSIAH</inline>SYMON (South Australia) &#91;5.29&#93;. - I wish to ask the Minister not to persevere with his motion for the reconsideration of clause 1. Yesterday we changed the short title of the Bill, and substituted the words, &#34; Lands Acquisition &#34; for the words &#34; Eminent Domain.&#34; The short title of the Bill is now &#34; The Lands Acquisition Act 1906.&#34; We have already had two divisions on clause 1, and I think that the Minister should give some reason against the short title which has now been introduced into the Bill. The Minister having brought down the Bill with the short title, &#34; Eminent Domain Act,&#34; gave reasons for the retention of that title. No one could complain of that as unreasonable. On the other side, we gave reasons why it was an inappropriate title, and as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drakeclearly</inline> pointed out, might possibly be a misleading title. The clause was debated on two occasions; on one the existing title was retained, and on&#39; the other we substituted the title now appearing in the Bill We have, therefore, to deal with the measure as though it had come before us with the short title, &#34; Lands Acquisition Act 1906,&#34; and what possible objection can there be to that title? Surely before we go back into Committee for the purpose of re-opening the discussion, some reason should be given against the use of the short, clear, and intelligible title, &#34; Lands Acquisition Act.&#34; Why should we go back into&#39; Committee to reconsider the, matter simply because, it may be, the draftsman of the measure has some fancy for the title, &#34; Eminent Domain &#34; ? Is it worthy of the Senate to do that? If there is an objection to the title &#34;Lands Acquisition Act &#34; - and as no objection has yet been urged against it - it ought to have been mentioned. But for the Government to solemnly ask for a recommittal with a view to displace a short title - to which no possible objection can be taken - in favour of the title which was deleted yesterday is, in my experience, unparalleled. It is reducing the proceedings of the Senate to a perfect farce. If the title &#34; Land Acquisition Act &#34; possesses some innate vice, and that is pointed out, good and well. But in the absence of such a reason, surely it is reducing the Senate to a position which it ought not to occupy, to ask it to go back into Committee in order to re-open the question. </para>

                    <para>- We all respect the Minister for his long experience and his other qualities, but has he ever known an instance of &#34;such a thing being done without some objection being taken to the substituted title? If the short title were vicious, I should be the first to say let it be deleted. The question has been dealt with twice. It was exhaustively dealt with on the original title to which grave objection was taken. With the Minister it is simply a question of preference for the original title, but no objection is taken to the substituted title. Why should we go back into Committee to reconsider that question when the Bill has to go to the other House ? If the Government are wedded to the original title in that House, they will have an opportunity, if they think fit, to seek to restore it. I move - </para>

                        <para>- Yes. How did this matter come up for consideration yesterday ? At a certain stage I moved for the reconsideration of several clauses, and when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> moved to include clause 1, I offered no opposition., and accordingly it was included. If my recollection serves me rightly, I do not think that when he moved his amendment he gave any reasons in support of it. I did not speak either, and a division resulted in the reversal of the previous vote in a Committee of 20, as opposed to a Committee of 27 on the first occasion. </para>

                <para class="block">I wish to adhere as closely as I can to what I indicated just now would be my course. When the Bill was brought into the Senate the short title was Eminent Domain Act. That title was canvassed on the second reading, and in Committee it was moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> that the words &#34; Eminent Domain &#34; be struck out, and &#34; Lands Acquisition &#34; substituted. The arguments both for and against were set forth, and I need not repeat them. &#34; Eminent Domain &#34; is a term which aptly and correctly expresses the sovereign right of a politically organized society to resume for public; purposes the property of individuals. </para>

I saw it reported of a person who attended a meeting in Sydney that, when reference was made to an &#34; absentee tax,&#34; he said that he was &#34;opposed to a tax on tea of any kind.&#34; Persons who are capable of misunderstandings of that kind are the sort of people who would ask where the Eminent Domain was. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir JOSIAH</inline>SYMON (South Australia) &#91;5.50&#93;. - I do not propose to occupy the attention of the Committee upon this question for more than a few seconds. I should have been glad to have it decided without coming to Committee again, but I quite recognise that honorable senators desired to afford . an opportunity for reconsideration. The present title of the Bill is &#34; The Lands Acquisition Act.&#34; Does that describe this Bill, its purpose, and its intention ? Undoubtedly it does. Is it plain to the man in the street, who is affected by this measure? Undoubtedly it is. Is it- plain to lawyers who have to advise upon this measure? Undoubtedly it is. Does it correspond with the title of the Act that is now upon the statute-book, and which we propose to repeal? Undoubtedly it does. The man who wants to see what the law of the Commonwealth is with respect to the acquisition of land for certain purposes looks into the index of the Statutes, and sees there &#34;Lands Acquisition Act 1901-2.&#34; If he wants to ascertain whether there has been any repeal, he looks down the list of Acts subsequently passed. He finds no mention of an Act repealing the Act of 1901-2. He does not know what &#34; Eminent Domain &#34; is. I say, as I have said before, that ninety-nine out of one hundred persons, even amongst the lawyers of Australia, would not know what &#34; Eminent Domain &#34; meant in connexion with legislation of this kind. I suppose that I have had as much experience as most lawyers, but I confess that I should not know that it was intended under this fancy expression to provide merely for the acquisition of lands for public purposes. I say, without hesitation or fear of contradiction by any lawyer in Australia, that, off-hand, lawyers would not know that an Act called the &#34; Eminent Domain Act&#34; was simply to enable the Commonwealth to acquire land for public purposes. The important use of a short title is to indicate the nature of the Act to Which it relates. You can, of course, use any fancy name you like. But that is not a sensible thing to do. It is desirable to use a title which will indicate to the people what the object of the measure is. It is for that reason, and not because I am opposed to the use of picturesque names, that I object to the title originally given to this Bill. We should use a title whose meaning will be apparent at once to any person who wants to know what the powers of the Commonwealth are with respect to this matter. My honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> has raised no objection to the title of &#34;Lands Acquisition.&#34; It is not possible to object to it. It is the one title which exactly describes this measure. If my honorable friend had&#39; shown that it was misleading or inaccurate, or might confuse people, we might have been with him. But he has given no reason. The title of the Bill now is &#34;Lands Acquisition,&#34; and I trust that honorable senators will not agree to strike it out. </para>

Can we conceive for a moment of the ordinary layman, without any special experience, taking that title to refer to the acquisition of lands, and the payment of compensation? </para>

                        <para>- But such a title might be connected with fifty subjects; there is nothing in it to indicate that it refers to the acquisition of lands for public purposes. The title &#34; Eminent Domain &#34; would rapidly become known to the general public, and prove infinitely more expressive than the term hitherto used. I admit at once that if the title as introduced had been &#34; Lands Acquisition &#34; I should not have taken any exception to it. </para>

                    <para>.- It would hardly appear that we hope to conclude our parliamentary work within six weeks or two months, when we take, as we have done already, two divisions on the mere title of a Bill. One title suggested expresses clearly to the ordinary mind the intention of the Bill, while the other presents a sort of speculative puzzle. Is it not common-sense to call a spade a spade, and thus do away with the picturesque title of &#34; Eminent Domain &#34; ? In the first instance I supported the title of &#34;Eminent Domain.,&#34; because I believed there might be some subtle legal reason for its adoption, but up to the present I have not heard advanced in its favour any reason that convinces me. </para>

                    <para>. - Since the long discussion on this clause yesterday an amendment has been drafted which, while meeting the views of those who are opposed to the original terms, will be perfectly consistent with other provisions. The amendment that was submitted yesterday, and the spirit of which, at any rate, was adopted, incorporated a portion of section 3 of the present Act with the addition of some further words. If that amendment, as then agreed to, be permitted to stand, it will, to some extent, overlap clause 15, which provides that the Governor-General may approve of the acquisition of land by the Commonwealth, by agreement with the owner. The first part of the amendment adopted yesterday on the motion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> provides that the Governor General may agree with the owner of any land which is required for public purposes, and with any State where such land is Crown land, for the absolute purchase by the Commonwealth, and so forth. It will be seen that this portion of the clause, as amended, is really a repetition of clause 15, and to that extent unnecessary. </para>

                        <para>- On the spur of the moment yesterday, when the amendment was submitted, I expressed the opinion that all cases were provided for, seeing that by the Bill the Governor-General was empowered to acquire land by agreement with the owner, and that &#34;owner,&#34; according to the definition, included a State. I also said yesterday that I desired to communicate with those experienced in the working of the existing Act, as regards the acquisition of land from the States. The same difficulty presents itself in the amended clause as is presented in the law as it stands now. We desire to have absolute control given, so that the States authorities, in disposing of land by agreement, may rest their authority on the force of this Bill. Honorable senators agreed yesterday that it was desirable that that result should be achieved, but some criticism was levelled against clause 6 as it stood. It was contended that it was offensively worded, or was expressed in some terms that were unnecessary. I intend to submit an amendment which will adopt the spirit of the amendment agreed to yesterday, and will, I think, effect the object we all desire to attain. It has been prepared by the draftsman of the Bill, and is expressed in a form consistent with the other provisions of the measure, and will, I believe, carry out the object of the Committee - to make the acquisition of lands from tine States the subject of negotiations rather than of compulsory acquisition.. I propose to negative clause 6 as it stands, and to submit the amendment as a new clause in lieu of it. </para>

                        <para>- In the amendment I submit we do not purport in terms to vest the Governor of a State with that power, but we say that where he actually does purport to convey, any instrument or assurance executed by him. shall take effect according to its terms, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any law of the State. If, for instance, the Governor of a State gives a grant of land to the Commonwealth, free from a reservation or condition which would apply to a private grant, we say that he shall be at liberty to do so. A law of the State might perhaps come into conflict with our law in the matter ; but to the extent to which it is in conflict with our law it becomes inoperative under the Constitution. I think that the terms of the amendment are much more in accordance with what honorable senators desire should be the tone of the provision, and I have therefore much pleasure in submitting it for the approval of the Committee. </para>

                    <para>.- There can be no doubt that the amendment omits to some extent what certainly was offensive in the clause as it stood. The main objection I took to the clause as it stood was that it enacted direct legislation by the Commonwealth with respect to what the Governor of a State should do. The amendment now submitted carries out in spirit, and almost completely, the terms of the amendment I proposed. Of course, my amendment was drawn on the floor of the Senate, and it could not be expected that it would be expressed in the precise language in which, after thoughtful consideration, it might have been clothed. I regard as completely unnecessary, and still take objection to, the words , in the clause as now submitted - &#34; and notwithstanding anything, in a law of the State.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- No. Some lawyers did contend that they were necessary, if the form in which the clause, as at first submitted was to be adhered to. But I do not think that any one can validly suggest that it: is necessary to retain these words in the form in which the provision is now expressed. When the several States surrendered to us the various powers which are now embodied in the Constitution, and enabled us to acquire land, what was meant was that we should be enabled to acquire that land free from all encumbrances. That is the meaning, of the term ira the Constitution - that we are empowered to take land free from all encumbrances, or any lesser estate, as we may think proper. Consequently, a clause of this character, which provides that any instrument taken by us shall validly and completely vest property in the Commonwealth, is merely an exercise of our powers under the Constitution. In the circumstances, when we say that land shall vest by force of this Act in the Commonwealth according to the tenor of the instrument or assurance executed by the Governor of a State, that is all that is necessary, because that in itself implies that we have exercised the full powers given us by the Constitution, and where the exercise of that power is inconsistent with the laws of a State, we know that the law of the &#39;Commonwealth must necessarily prevail. That is implied not only in the sub-section of section 51 of the Constitution, dealing with the acquisition of land by the Commonwealth,, but it is also directly stated in section J09. If the words &#34; and notwithstanding anything in a law of the State&#34; are left out, the proposed clause will be less offensive. I believe that they are merely surplusage, and I therefore move - </para>

                <para class="block">We know that under the Constitution the Commonwealth Parliament has power in any Act that it may see fit to pass to acquire land bv compulsory process. That would cover all reservations usually made. In the clause as now submitted, we are asked to say that the Governor of a State may agree to sell land to the Commonwealth, and that upon the execution of the conveyance the whole estate in the land shall vest in the Commonwealth, notwithstanding the fact that it may be in direct contravention of the laws of the State. A State Parliament may pass a law to provide that certain land shall be sold subject to certain reservations, and if the Commonwealth should require that land free from all reservations, the proper course to adopt would be to acquire the land by compulsory process, and not to attempt by means of an agreement between the State and Commonwealth Governments to over-ride a law dealing with the alienation of land passed by the Parliament of the State. We have the necessary power under the Constitution, and we could exercise it by the compulsory acquisition of such land. The </para>

It is perfectly true that where the Commonwealth law is in conflict with a State law, the Commonwealth law must prevail, but we should infringe States rights and interfere with States legislation only where it is absolutely necessary to do so. It is not absolutely necessary in the case under notice, because the compulsory provisions of the Bill are quite sufficient for the purpose. </para>

                    <para>- As I said before, both in speech and by interjection, I think that the clause without the words sought to be deleted would be quite sufficient to give to these conveyances and assurances the effect which we desire to give to them. But, so far as the existing Act is concerned, there is, and has been, a doubt in the minds of certain responsible officers of the States. I think, and I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> also thinks, that it empowers the States to dispose of these lands, regardless of any conditions which might attach, to them in the case of private disposal. Still a doubt exists, and it is most likely that in the absence of these words a question would be raised as to the effect of the provision. </para>

I appreciate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best&#39;s</inline> statement that, so far as the rest of the new clause is concerned, it is intended to effect the object which we all have in common, and meets his wishes, as it is not worded like the original provision which, to him and others, seemed offensive. If we retain these words, then there can be no possible doubt raised as to the intention of this Parliament that the laws of the States, so far as they are inconsistent with the provisions of our Lands Acquisition Act, shall not have any application when lands are being disposed of by way of private agreement by the State to the Commonwealth for a public purpose. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir JOSIAH</inline>SYMON (South Australia) &#91;7.51&#93;. - I entirely agree with the view that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> has expressed. Without the words which he seeks to delete the clause would be absolutely clear and effective. It is a matter of, so to speak, constitutional conveyancing. We are putting in, not by virtue of our powers simply as the Parliament of the Commonwealth, but by virtue of the Constitution, a new clause which says that when an agreement is made between the Governor of a State and the Governor-General of the Commonwealth for the acquisition of a piece of land on the execution of the assurance or conveyance the land shall absolutely vest in the Commonwealth. What more is required?My honorable friend says that the retention of these words might indicate the intention of this Parliament. The intention of this Parliament is nothing. The force of the new clause will be derived from the Constitution, which says-that we can enact a provision of this kind.

                        <para>- That I doubt very much, if by that term my honorable friend means the aspirations pf the general body of the &#39;people. Of course, if there is a wrong to be righted, or if there is an immediate grievance to be redressed, then, undoubtedly, any Government should act quickly, and if they act quickly, as a rule they act wisely. But I think honorable senators will feel that there is no pretence for suggesting that such conditions exist under present circumstances, and that, therefore, the best thing is that there should be no action, particularly when we are dealing with so sensitive a subject as the trade and commerce of the country. Whatever it may be with other matters, certainly in relation to the trade and commerce of the country we should avoid as far as we can interferences that are not insistently called for by the existence, as I have said, of a wrong to be righted or a just grievance to be redressed. The reasons for that we all understand. The timidity of commerce is perhaps just as great as are its courage and its enterprise. That statement is not a little paradoxical; but whilst we all know that there are courage and enterprise in trade and commerce, and that without these qualities trade and commerce would be poor and stagnant, yet there is great timidity in connexion with such affairs. Interferences of this kind are very liable to operate upon that timidity, and bring about results distinctly mischievous. It would- be sheer hypocrisy to talk of urgency in connexion with this Bill. My honorable friend the Minister of Defence, who is as appreciative of what is a fair position to take in relation to matters of legislation as any one, did not make any appeal to the Senate on any such ground as that of urgency. The gestation of this legislation shows that it certainly has not been, treated as a matter of urgency by any Government in this Commonwealth&#39;. We had it announced in the Governor- General&#39;s Speech in 1903 - in the second session of the first Parliament - that proposed laws were to be introduced to deal with the subject of rings and trusts. We had it again in the Governor-General&#39;s Speech in the first session of the second Parliament in 1904. We had it again in the statement of the business to be laid before Parliament in 1905. It stood over until 1906. Why should it not stand over until the new Parliament - until the constituencies before whom we hope to go before long have an opportunity to hear the subject discussed, and, if they choose, to express their own opinions in regard to it? In 1906 we have the Bill introduced. It was introduced in such a questionable shape that at was practically re-drafted. </para>

                        <para>- This Bill was introduced in the present year, and, after a few weeks and a partial discussion, it was withdrawn, and practically re-drafted. I think that indicates that, notwithstanding the references in previous Governor-General&#39;s speeches to the design and intention of legislating upon this subject, the result was simply a measure crude, ill-thought-out, badly framed, which, when subjected to the light of a comparatively brief examination- in Parliament and the press, had to be re-drafted, and a fresh frame laid before Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- The amendments occupied about a column and a half in the press, and constituted practically a new Bill - lock, stock, and barrel. The Bill itself was not taken off the file,. but practically a new Bill was introduced. This is that Bill, with certain amendments. I venture to say - and I think I shall Le able to show honorable senators - that this Bill is no improvement upon the measure as originally introduced.. It is crude, ill-thought-out, and in its provisions it appears to me - and I think it will so appear to honorable senators on consideration - that it will not carry out what ought to be the intention, namely, to prevent restraints of trade. Instead of preventing restraints of trade, it will really create barriers, and put difficulties in the way of trade. Instead of securing that free competition which should have been its original intention., it will prevent free competition, and throw trammels and restrictions around the trade of this country which will be exceedingly mischievous. Again, the Minister of Defence made out no case for the introduction of this Bill now. He scarcely tried to make out a case. He stated to the Senate no occasion requiring the immediate introduction or operation of such&#39; a measure. My honorable friend in fact said with regard to suggestions- which might be made ais to the existence of trusts or monopolies in Australia, that he really did not know, and did not care, whether there were any. </para>

                        <para>- What does my honorable friend mean by saying that there, are no injurious trusts in the Commonwealth. He is always clear and always emphatic. When he desires to make himself understood it is impossible for any one to misunderstand him. My honorable friend could have said nothing else. I am not quarrelling with his statement. It is, I think, absolutely true. I myself am not aware - and I say it readily on the authority of the Minister of Defence - that there are combines or trusts in Australia demanding the enactment of such legislation as this. But I do think that it was an unwise thing for my honorable friend to say that he did not know, and did not care. With all deference and respect, I do not think that that is the attitude which a Minister should take in offering such&#39; a Bill as this to the acceptance of the Legislature. It is an important matter whether there are trusts and combines in Australia. It is an important matter whether there are trusts and combines that are injurious or destructive. We must all agree with the Minister when he said that there are combines and combines. There are combines which are not at all injurious - which are beneficial in many ways - beneficial to trade, and beneficial to the community. But those are not the trusts that are in view, and which demand a Bill of this kind. When I find such a statement made, and when, as a representative in the Senate of the people of one of the States, I am asked to give attention to a Bill for the preservation&#39; of Australian industries, I think I am entitled to ask, as a justification for voting for it, what industries are threatened? There are none threatened. No instances are given of any industries whose preservation requires this piece of legislation now. If any are threatened., from what quarter or by whom are they threatened? It is silly for Parliament to be asked to pass a Bill for the preservation of Australian industries when not a word is said, and not a fact is laid before Parliament, showing that any are assailed. Then again- which industries are they? This is a. Bill for an Act for the preservation of Australian industries - the industries of the whole Commonwealth. Is the pastoral industry valuable? Is the agricultural industry valuable? Is the mining industry of value to Australia? Are these industries covered by this Bill and intended to be dealt with by it? Surely before we are asked to consider a Bill of this kind we ought to have some facts placed before us. so that we may deal with it in a concrete shape as remedial legislation. Again, the Bill is one for the&#34; repression of destructive monopolies.&#34; What are they? I do not understand what a &#34; destructive monopoly &#34; is. I can understand an injurious monopoly - the kind of monopoly against which legislation has been directed in other coutries, such a monopoly as has the effect of raising the price of the necessaries of the people. That is the kind of monopoly that I should have expected some information about. But I do not understand what is meant by &#34; repres- . sion of destructive monopolies &#34; in this Bill. We are entitled to ask that some instances of monopolies should be cited to the Senate, which are in fact, or in their tendency, &#34;destructive. The Minister of Defence says that monopolies are not necessarily mischievous, but that is all he has told us. </para>

                        <para>- Arid I am sure my honorable friend could afford to pay. But we are not dealing, with the coal combine just at present. The Minister of Defence did not mention any monopoly that was evil, but he said that it was not right to conclude that monopolies, as such, are bad. The only bad monopoly that, I know of is that which raises the prices of the necessaries of the people. A monopoly of that kind I personally detest. Such a monopoly results from the exclusive right, however acquired, to sell a commodity ; and it may be brought about by agreement, with the intention to choke competition and capture the market - the objective, in point of fact, is to raise prices. </para>

                        <para>- I am not thinking of luxuries, but of the necessaries of the poor, who have to be protected. I am dealing, from my point of view, with monopolies which are intrinsically bad, if their object is to raise the prices of the necessaries of life. Here we have one of the underlying principles which actuate men to be free-traders. Free-trade is the enemy of monopoly in every shape and form, and of every restraint and restriction imposed on trade. The best antidote to monopoly of an injurious character is the free air of competition. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister has said that before, but he has evidently not investigated the nature of the so-called monopolies. It is a matter of perfect indifference whether or not monopolies exist in England. There are different kinds of combines and monopolies. It is a fallacious idea that, because a business grows to huge dimensions, it therefore represents a monopoly in the sense of the term applied to the condition of things we desire to prevent. In England, so far as I am able to gather, the so-called monopolies are simply combinations, the result of agreement amongst persons - agreements which exist here and in every department of trade and commerce everywhere - to prevent cut-throat competition, and insure fair prices and a fair profit. What possible objection is there to such agreement? </para>

                        <para>- This Bill was intended to cure, but does not cure, monopolies, and the object of such legislation should be to create free competition. Honorable senators will find that the object of the Sherman Act, and similar Acts, is to promote free competition which is endangered by combinations in the United States. The only monopoly which, in the eye of the law, ought to be permitted, is that which flows from good quality and cheapness. Applying that principle, the real object of the Bill - not the surface object - is not to promote competition for the benefit of the consumer, but to restrict competition for the benefit of the manufacturer. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly ; and my belief is that the Bill would be an utter failure, so far as its declared intention is concerned. What evidence is there of any just grievance on the part of the manufacturer? What facts have been stated to the Senate to justify a Bill for such an object? Of course, we know there is a tinge - at least, a suspicion of a tinge - of political or party purpose in the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- Then that accounts for it; I am pleased to hear he is not a Scotchman. If what I observed in the newspaper this morning is true, this gentleman has a fine claim on the sympathy and assistance of the Commonwealth Parliament ! He is in the same position really as a foreign trade. Do honorable senators call that fair competition? What do his rivals in the trade think of it? He shifts his business from the domain of factory laws, and goes outside that domain in order to escape from the beneficent provisions of those laws, and that beneficent administration to which his rivals in the trade are subject. </para>

                        <para>- I saw enough in the newspapers this morning to make me doubt the wisdom of any Government or Parliament assisting a gentleman who adopts that kind of competition with his rivals in trade. It was stated in (.he newspapers this morning that, instead of having one apprentice or improver to each man, he has six to each man. Several other matters are also referred to on the same lines, but these details are irrelevant to this Bill. All I desire to point out is that it is an undoubted and notorious fact that the Bill owes its origin to the efforts of that gentleman, and I say that if these statements are true, he is conducting an unfair competition himself with his rivals in trade. When steps were taken to bring has factory within the scope of the operation of the factories laws of Victoria, he went to the Victorian Chief Secretary and asked him not to do it. </para>

Is not trade unionism protection?&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Will</inline> Crooks answered, &#34;I will tell you what it is: Trade unionism protects the worker against the sweater, but protection protects the sweater against the worker.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- I like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Will</inline> Crooks, and I like his statement of the position. The gentleman who is the real author of this Bill appears to have himself been a member of a combine. It does not exist now, but he was a member of it when it did exist, and was associated in it with the Massey-Harris people, the International Harvester people, and the rest of them, in order, I suppose it will be said, to exploit the farmers of this country. He fell out with the others, or the combination broke up, and as soon as it was broken up, or he dropped out of it, he immediately set to work to agitate against his former associates and for the introduction and pressing forward of this Bill. That is the only origin I find for the measure. It does not originate in any fact, in any argument, or in the suggestion of any need for its introduction. It rests solely upon the efforts and agitation of this gentleman. 1 ask whether this Parliament is going to lend itself to pass legislation instigated in that way, and intended for the purpose of putting extra profits, converted into sovereigns, into the pockets of this gentleman?&#39; </para>

                            <para>- Very well, I shall not allude to what was said in another place. I desire to make a very important correction on behalf of South Australia. It has been stated that the harvester industry in South Australia has been crushed out by importations. It has been stated that it has been practically monopolized in that State by the American article. I say that these statements are without a shadow of foundation. </para>

                            <para>- That may be so. but it has been so stated and in most emphatic terms. I propose to submit to honorable senators the figures on the subject, and to show that if there has been an interference in South Australia, with the local manufacturers of harvesters, it has. been an interference by the harvester manufacturers of Victoria. I am not complaining of that at all. I do not think that anyone has a right to complain of it. So long as we are a Federation, and the barriers between the States have &#39;been removed, trade must flow freely, and the manufacturers of the various States must take their chance of fair competition. But I think it important that these figures which I have taken some trouble to ascertain should be given. This is a. statement approximately of the number of stripper harvesters sold in South Australia between 1000 and 1905. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, I shall give the whole of the particulars as furnished to me. In 1900,in South Australia, the International Harvester Company sold no harvesters; the Massey-Harris Company none; McKay, of Victoria, sold 20. He was the only person who sold harvesters in South Australia that year. In that year none were sold in that State by Nicholson and Morrow, of Victoria ; by Robinson and Company, of Victoria; by May Brothers and Company, of South Australia; by James Martin and Company, of South Australia; or Hawke and Company, of South; Australia. In 1901, the International Harvester Company sold none ; the Massey-Harris Company none. McKay, of Victoria, increased his sales to 70. Nicholson; and Morrow, of Victoria, sold 36 ; Robinson and Company of Victoria, 10; and the South Australian manufacturers sold none. In 1902, the International Harvester Company sold none; the Massey-Harris Company 52 ; McKay, of Victoria, 100; Nicholson and Morrow, of Victoria, 1 2 ; Robinson and Company, of Victoria, 25. In this year for the first time the South Australian manufacturers began to sell, and May Brothers and Company, of that State, sold 20. Martin and Company 5, and Hawke and Company 5; so that half the harvesters sold in South Australia in1902 were sold by McKay. In1903 the International Harvester Company sold none, the Massey-Harris Company 129.. McKay 175, Nicholson and Morrow none, </para>

In 1905 the International Harvester Company sold 100, the Massey-Harris Company 199, McKay, of Victoria, 250, Nicholson and Morrow 45, Robinson and Company 100, May Brothers and Company, of South Australia, 75, Martin and Company 35, and Hawke and Company 35. The total sales in South Australia from 1900 to 1905 were - International Harvester Company, 125; the Massey-Harris Company, 844; McKay, of Victoria, 975 ; Nicholson and Morrow, 328; Robinson and Company,360; May Brothers and Company, of South Australia, 350: Martin and Company, 100; and Hawke and Company, 90. This gives a total of 2,972 harvesters sold, and of that number those sold by Victorian manufacturers totalled 1,463. That is just about one-half the total number. The total number sold by the importers was 969. and by South Australian manufacturers 504. </para>

I am not saying whether the valuation of the imported harvesters for Customs purposes, was increased or reduced, but that it is wrong to make a statement of the kind to which I have referred in the absence of any facts to justify it. If that statement is the ground upon which a measure of this kind is introduced In the interests of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKays</inline> all I have to say is that, so far from proving it, the approximate figures, so far as I have been able to check them, disprove that statement. </para>

If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> desires absolute prohibition in respect of these machines, and is able to secure it, small blame to him; but the point is that he is the gentleman who has been supplying the great bulk of the harvesters sold in South Australia. They have not been supplied by the importers, but by Victorian manufacturers, whose enterprise and activity, and, if my honorable friends like, whose skill has succeeded to that extent in capturing the market. </para>

                            <para>- I should think that at the time no harvesters were made in South Australia, but that is immaterial. I am not quoting these figures with the view of suggesting sympathy or any thing of that kind. That is not the point on which we are engaged. The manufacturers of South Australia must take their chance, because, whilst we may seek to prohibit importations, which is undoubtedly the object of the second part of the Bill, that will not benefit them if the injury to their factories arises from the keener competition of a better article made in Victoria. </para>

                            <para>- I shall deal with the consumer in a moment. It has been brought under my notice lately - and I am convinced that the grievance which will arise under the Bill is just - that it will not merely strike the importation of harvesters, but will strike the importation and the use of machinery used largely in the boot trade, which cannot be otherwise acquired. That ought to make us pause before we pass a measure of this kind. It may be like a boomerang. It may hit one object, but it may come back, and do damage in another direction. I am no authority on the matter, but I have gone into a statement of the position, and, so far as I can judge. it is a true one. There are in existence now agreements with boot manufacturers, probably in Victoria, but certainly in South Australia, for the use, upon royalty or licence, of machinery made in America, which the owners will not sell, and which they will only let, so to speak, on licence. </para>

                            <para>- These machines belong, I shall assume, to a body of: persons, or company, who would constitute a combine &#39;or a commercial trust under this measure. But that is one of the trusts or combines as far as I am aware, which come within the definition that the Minister gave of what might be a good and beneficial trust. They acquire patents. It is their business to be on the look-out for improvements in bootmaking machinery, to examine whatever patents are offered to them, to reject those which are useless or not of much value, and to accept those which are of value. It is their business to encourage men to exercise their brains in the way of making improvements in machinery, and appliances in connexion with that particular department of trade and manufacture. And by reason of that their machinery is, I am told the very best in the world. </para>

                            <para>- My honorable friend will have an opportunity of dealing with that point if the Bill should get into Committee. I am putting now the view which I take of the effect of this clause and other provisions. In my opinion, they would, if passed, bring into peril those boot and shoe manufacturers who, under an existing agreement, have that machinery, or who hereafter introduce it into their factories. The result would be that we should have to follow up this legislation with a Bill which, when an - agreement became void, would confiscate the machinery, the honest property of somebody else, or else we should ruin the boot manufacturer who had the machinery on his premises. No one can deny, as the Minister of Defence said, that there are good combines and bad combines. Therefore, if the Bill does not discriminate so far as mere restraint of trade is concerned, it ought not to be placed upon the statute-book. </para>

                            <para>- I am coming to that point in a moment. I have referred honorable senators to specific matters which might have been alluded to. Is there any reason for the Bill because of any lessened prosperity of the Commonwealth? Is there one particle of evidence on which the Senate can be asked to pass the Bill because of injury detrimental to the public? According to statistics we have seen in Victoria, which is largely. honorably, and profitably associated with manufacture, perhaps, to a greater extent than any of the other States, the prosperity is absolutely unparalleled. So far as I am aware, there never has been anything like the prosperity indicated by the figures which the Government Statist of this State published in the Melbourne press yesterday. The earning power per head of the people of the State is the greatest in the world. In Canada it is&#163;16 5s., the United States&#163;14 14s., the United Kingdom&#163;7 18s. 6d., and Victoria . &#163;27 19s. 6d. </para>

He will admit that it is a remarkable fact that the prosperity of Victoria is absolutely unprecedented. The prosperity of the whole of Australia, we know, is unprecedented, but I am proud to think that the prosperity of Victoria is of the character which these figures indicate.

                            <para>- Let me now refer to the returns which were published the other day in the Victorian <inline font-style="italic">Gazette.</inline> It is a most remarkable fact that during the last three or four years, in almost every department of metal -work and machinery, there has been an increase. This Bill is directed to the supposed buttressing up of, or preventing destruction coming upon, the manufacturers of agricultural implements. It is a remarkable thing that contemporaneously with its introduction we find an increase-- ;a substantial increase from year to year - in the number pf hands employed, an expansion of that very business which, if we believe the heading of the Bill, is threatened with destruction. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator can give the figures for the Commonwealth. I prefer to deal with one thing at a time. In the agricultural implement-making business of Victoria the number of hands employed was 789 in 1902, 1,114 in 1903, 1,496 in 1904, and 1,624 in 1905 - a gradual increase to more than double the number of hands employed in the first-mentioned year. Surely that indicates expansion, prosperity, and not that diminution in this particular branch of manufacture that we have been led to believe had taken place. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know, but I will accept what my honorable friend says. That remark is, of course, applicable all round. A statement was made some time last year, when the agitation about harvesters began, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> had had to dismiss 150 employes. But he dismissed them because the harvesters were all sold for that season. And so it is with other elements that are applicable to the fluctuations of trade. I do not know whether mv honorable friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> &#39;s statement is right or not. But all such considerations affect the fluctuations of production. When production fluctuates we ought not to say immediately, &#34; Oh, that is owing to the importation of harvesters, ploughs, and harrows from America and England.&#34; Instead of there being any specific injury which is sought to be cured by this Bill, no instance of the kind has been given. On the contrary, there is general prosperity in all branches of trade and production, and there is a particular expansion in that very business of agricultural implement manufacturing which is said to be the immediate occasion for the introduction of this Bill. </para>

                            <para>- From the Victorian <inline font-style="italic">Government Gazette</inline> of Tuesday, July, 24. The figures are signed by the Government Statist. I have also an abstract which appeared in the press of a report bv <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harrison</inline> Ord, which shows a great increase in the registered factories in Victoria. He goes back as far as 1886, when there were 1,949 registered factories with 39,506 employes. Without troubling the Senate with the intermediate years, I come down to T905, when there were 4,623 registered factories, and 63.270 employes. There was a steady increase each year under Federation. The number of registered factories in 1901 was 4,238. The number had increased last year by 400 additional factories. The hands employed were 56,945 in 1901, and 63,270 in 1905. </para>

                            <para>- I think it is magnificent progress for Victoria, with her diminishing population - for Victoria had already reached the zenith of manufacturing enterprise before Federation. It is a magnificent result, especially when we find that New South Wales and the other States are also going ahead in manufacturing progress, and that Victoria has to face their competition. It is satisfactory and substantial progress, of which this State ought to be extremely proud. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so. Looking at the facts which have been brought before the Senate, I say that this Bill has been introduced absolutely without any cause. If that were all, it would not justify what my honorable friend the Minister argued that it is desired to lay in a stock of physic against the patient&#39;s getting ill. It would have been a sort of explanation of the position to say, &#34; Oh, the Commonwealth Parliament has not much to do that is of importance, and may as well occupy itself upon a Bill of this kind, as, perhaps, adjourn, or be engaged upon something more mischievous.&#34; But I complain that this Bill is not merely inoffensive and useless, but that it will have a tendency to throw trade and commerce into the law Courts. </para>

                            <para>- If I were looking at this matter from a lawyer&#39;s point of view only, I should say that it offers a splendid vista of prosperity for the legal profession. From the point of view of a citizen I look upon it with regret, though from the point of view of the profession it might be regarded with rejoicing. I deplore it. We .ought, in dealing with trade and commerce, to keep them as far as possible from the law, and as : fat as possible within the ambit of &#39;arrangements that are consistent with the methods of conducting them which have generally prevailed throughout the Commonwealth. We have no instance of combines and trusts here. They may or may not exist ; at any rate, there is none that is mischievious. Happy is the country of which that can be said ! If we desire to facilitate the admission of the free air of competition, which we are told has been interfered with, or can be interfered with, I say Jet us do it by some means&#39; by which we shall not run the risk of throwing every business of any magnitude into the law-courts. It reminds me of that old and well-known book, <inline font-style="italic">Gulliver&#39;s Travels.</inline> Honorable senators will recollect that when Gulliver got amongst the Lilliputians he found himself bound, or attempted to be bound, hand and- foot with pack thread and other like ligaments. It is a singular thing, but my recollection is that the land of Lilliput is described by Swift as lying north-west of the island of Van Diemens Land ! And so we have in this Bill the great trade and commerce of this vast continent attempted to be laid by the heels and bound hand and foot by a lot of puny ligaments. I put that argument, because, not merely does the Bill invoke the law courts in every line and every clause, but when you have done that your efforts will fail, because I predict that you will never be able to carry- it out. I do not wish to say anything about the Government being sincere or not sincere in bringing in this Bill. But if there is any sincerity in its purpose, I do say that there will be failure in its performance. </para>

                            <para>- It is because it will frighten them that I object to it. They need not go to their lawyers to learn how to avoid it. Even my honorable friend would have wisdom enough to advise them that they could easily get through a Bill of this kind. But if you put such a measure on the statute-book, you cause litigation, you cause difficulty and trouble, and you interfere with the operations of trade. My honorable friend appears to have very little appreciation of the sensitiveness of trade. This Bill professes to remove restraints, whereas it creates a great many more than it removes. Before referring to the clauses of the Bill, I should like to say that monopolies are not, of course, to be confused with a greatly extended or greatly expanded business. An individual with considerable capital, with capacity, power of production, and other advantages, may so manage his own business as to bring it to such a pitch of perfection and power that it may amount to a practical monopoly. </para>

                            <para>- I am glad to hear that, but I will point out how this Bill does interfere in that respect. Here I should like to pay my tribute to a speech recently delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harper.</inline> I will not say where it was delivered, in obedience to your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> but I will say that I read it, and read it with attention, and that it is in itself one of the most statesmanlike speeches delivered by a man of experience and knowledge of trade in this country, that it has ever been my lot to look through. The foundation of all legislation, of this kind rests upon the feeling that anything in the nature of restraint of trade is obnoxious. The Bill has no object whatever unless it professes to prevent that. The phrase &#34; restraint of trade&#34; is used in t&#39;he Bill. It is a term that is commonly understood. It occurs certainly in the earlier clauses, beginning with clause 4. But the real effect, as far as I can gather from the rest of the clauses, will be to restrain trade in Australia. We have had laid before us - and we are indebted to the Government for them - a number of papers giving information as to what has been clone in other countries. There is no legislation in any country that at all approaches this Bill. In the ordinary law of England there is the great doctrine that any contracts which are in restraint of trade are void as against public policy. It needs no Bill or measure of this character to establish that proposition; and that is the law in Australia, as well as in England. It is the same law which existed so long ago as the time of Queen Elizabeth, when monopolies - that is, true monopolies - were granted bv the Sovereign, giving the exclusive right to sell, and thus leading to the raising of prices. These monopolies were put a stop to, because the people of England were sp roused in consequence of the injustice caused by their exactions that they were on the brink of revolution. The Queen&#39;s Ministers were approached, with the result that a number of the monopolies were swept away. The same principle underlies the legislation in America ; and on this point I shall read not more than one or two passages, though I invite honorable senators&#39; attention to the principles which are laid down in the laws which have beam passed in that country. The law in the States of Arkansas, as shown in the &#39;circulated paper No. 14. is directed to combinations which tend to lessen free competition in the importation, production, or sale of goods. That is the cardinal idea which runs through the whole of the legislation in America. If those combinations lessen free competition, or result in regulating or fixing prices, they are deemed to be conspiracies, punishable by imprisonment or fine. At page 9 of the very interesting digest of cases which has been furnished to us. honorable senators will, find the law shortly stated to the same effect - the keynote is combinations tending to lessen free competition or importation. At page 7 in the digest of cases there is one headed <inline font-style="italic">The United States</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">the Chesapeake Ohio</inline></para>

                        <para>The important question is not whether the performance of the contract so far has resulted in actual injury to trade, but whether the contract confers power to regulate and restrain trade, upon those charges with its performance. . . It looks to individual competition, rather than to combinations, for the benefits which are to follow and flow from commerce between the States, and, in the exercise of its constitutional power, has prohibited all combinations which restrain trade. It is for Congress to determine whether the policy it has adopted shall be maintained as the one which will best promote the interests of the country, or whether it shall abandon that policy, and place the Inter-State commerce of the country_ in the hands of combinations. But until Congress takes that course, as long as this Act remains upon the statute-books, it is the duty of the Courts to condemn every contract which necessarily in its performance involves a restraint of trade, although it may not extend to the point of a monopoly of all that trade. </para>

                    <para class="block">What I desire to make clear to honorable senators is that the principle which ought to underlie this legislation, and which does underlie the legislation of other countries, is that there must not be anything that will operate in restraint of trade. Any restraint of trade is obnoxious to the law of England, and obnoxious to good sense and the interests of trade and commerce, as well as to the best interests of the people. If there is anything in the, nature of restraint of trade it ought to be wiped away. and free play of competition allowed. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister shunts the whole matter on to the Court. This is a Bill to open the doors of the Court.- so that the commerce and trade of the country shall become a matter of litigation. It may be right to have such legislation; but all I desire to call attention to at present is that the Bill goes altogether beyond legislation elsewhere. The sections of the Sherman Act are not given in full in the documents which have been circulated, but they are stated sufficiently, and I have taken an opportunity to look at the Act itself. The important fact is recognised that in America the means of transport, which are a great aid to combinations, are in the hands of private companies. Of course, that state of things does not exist in Australia ; and there is not here the opportunity for those abatements and differentiations of rates which are most facile means of creating monopolies and combines in the United States. After passing that by, the compiler of the digest says - </para>

                        <para>While the Inter-State Commerce Act has no relation to trusts or combinations engaged in the manufacture, production, and sale of merchandise (its provisions relating only to the rights, liabilities, and duties of common carriers), this later statute (Sherman Anti-trust law) is of universal application, its purpose being to prohibit every contract or combination in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States or with foreign nations, whether made by carriers, manufacturers, producers, or shippers. </para>

                    <para>That is all. We have only to look at our own Bill to see that it goes altogether beyond the American legislation, and introduces a number of complications, which, if the object had been the same as in the United States, would tend to defeat it. The digest goes on to say that every contract in the form of a trust or otherwise - it does not matter what it is called - or conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce, is illegal. That has nothing to do with the intent to interfere with other manufacturers, or anything of that kind, but deals simply with combinations in restraint of trade, or of commerce amongst the several States. Every combination which has that for its object is void, according to the law of England, and the American Statutes, going further than the ordinary common law, says that it shall be a misdemeanour. It makes that which, without this positive law, would be void and unenforceable by civil action, a criminal offence. That is the extent to&#39; which it goes, with various incidental provisions. </para>

The Sherman Act is simply directed against restraint of trade, and combinations in restraint of trade. What is the case in Canada and New Zealand? , In Canada, the Act, which is referred to in the digest, was passed in 1904, but in 1897 there was a general Tariff Act passed, containing a most excellent principle. If the Bill before us had proceeded on die same lines, I should have given it my unhesitating support. Section 18 of the Canadian Act of 1897 provides - - </para>

                            <para>- I do not remember it, but I will say that that is a perfectly legitimate thing to do. This law has regard for the interest of the consumer, and I venture to say that it is the interest of the consumer that should be paramount in matters of this kind. That, at any rate, is the Canadian law, but that provision is unfortunately not abstracted in the papers submitted to honorable senators. An amendment of the Canadian Tariff Act was passed in 1904, with the object of dealing with what, in this Bill, is called &#34;dumping.&#34; I should say that this term appears here for the first time in any Act of Parliament as far as I am aware. I certainly never saw it in an Act of Parliament before. The compilers of the digest submitted to honorable senators refer to the Canadian Act of 1904, as one dealing with &#34; dumping.&#34; The Canadian Act does not use that term, and the way in which it deals with it is totally different from that adopted here. The Canadian Act deals with the matter in a sensible way. What is it that we desire to prevent? Surely we do not desire to prevent the consumer getting the benefit of the importation of cheap goods? If a man secures a bargain in England by the purchase cheaply of articles of good1 quality, and imports them to Australia, surely the consumers are entitled to the advantage of that purchase .if it is offered them? Why should the importation of those goods be prohibited, I should like to know? The Canadian people have not said that such importations shall be prohibited. It is with them merely a question of Customs duties. What the Canadians have said is that if bargains are obtained in the mother country or in America, &#39;and are imported into Canada, the value of goods for the purpose of Customs duty must not be taken to be the bargain value, but must be taken to be the actual value in the place of export. That is perfectly legitimate for the purpose of duty. </para>

                            <para>- No, that is in the Canadian Act of 1904, which is cited in the digest as against dumping. What is our provision against dumping? It is to exclude the goods altogether. A more monstrous thing was never suggested, and there is, no precedent to be found for such a course in any of the Acts recommended for our consideration and guidance. Section 19 of the Canadian Act of 1904 provides that - </para>

                        <para>Whenever it appears to the satisfaction of the Minister of Customs, or of any officer of Customs authorized to collect Customs duty, that the export price or the actual selling price to the importer in Canada of any imported dutiable article of .1 class or kind made or produced in Canada is less than the fair market value thereof, as determined according to the basis of value for duty provided in the Customs Act in respect of imported goods subject to an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty, such article shall in addition to the duty otherwise established, be subject to a special duty for Customs equal to the difference between such fair market value and such selling price : Provided, however, that the special Customs duty on any article shall not exceed one half of the Customs duty, otherwise established in respect of the article -  except in regard to certain articles enumerated in a schedule attached to the Act. Honorable senators will see that in this Bill we are being asked to prohibit the importation of these cheap goods, which might be for the benefit of the consumer. Why should we penalize him? Why should he be punished simply because goods are being imported cheaply ? It seems to  me, and I think honorable senators will say the same, that in the Bill the Government are in this respect proceeding on an altogether fallacious basis. Then I come to the New Zealand Act, and what does it provide? It proceeds in this matter on the same basis as the Canadian Act. It does not prohibit the importation of any goods. Of course, honorable senators are aware that it is limited in its operation to agricultural implements and so on, but it does not prohibit their importation. It does not say that harvesters shall not be imported into New Zealand, but it says that if they are imported, and that by their importation substantial injury is done to the local industry, a bonus up to a limit of 33 per cent. may be allowed to the local manufacturer in order to compensate him for the injury. As honorable senators will see, the consumer is protected, under the New Zealand Act. I never knew, and I challenge any honorable senator to produce, a law from any civilized country which prohibits the importation of goods which, are bargains, so to speak, and which are sought to be sold cheaply in the country to which they are imported. Yet that is what we are asked to do in this lovely Bill ! </para>

                            <para>- It is not anything of the kind. But we are not dealing with the question of the Tariff, and I am objecting now to the introduction, under cover of promoting free competition and destroying monopoly, of a Bill intended to bring about prohibition, and prohibition, honorable senators must remember, which does not injure the exporters front the oversea country, but which injures and punishes the consumer, whether rich or poor, in this country. Human nature likes a bargain, and why should the consumers of this country be deprived of bargains in the shape of cheap goods simply because some local trader has a big stock of them, not necessarily locally manufactured at all, and chooses to send in a complaint to the Minister, and get this complicated law put into operation to keep them out ? </para>

                            <para>- I shall endeavour to satisfy my honorable friend on that point. At any rate, this Bill is aimed at the prevention of this free importation, and I say that that is the real object of the measure. In respect to the demolishing of restraints of trade the measure is a perfect sham. It pretends to remove restraints with one hand, and at the same time fastens them on to a greater extent with the other. It attempts to attain two diametrically opposite objects. It seeks, on one hand, to create a means of prohibiting the import of cheap foreign goods, and on the other hand to prevent any trust or individual unduly raising the price of necessary commodities against the people. In considering the clauses of this Bill it is well that we should&#39; remember that our power in this respect is limited. Honorable senators will recollect that we have no power to deal with trade which is confined in its operations to any one State. Our only power in this matter is to deal with trade and commerce between the States and with foreign countries. Clauses 5 and 8 are certainly couched in a form of words which makes it extremely doubtful if an attempt might not be made under this measure to interfere with trade which is absolutely confined within a particular State. Clause 5 provides that - </para>

But if we did, then, simply because it was a trust, the arrangement into which it entered, or its existence, would establish that the competition was unfair. Is that a just or a reasonable provision to put into a Bill of this description? Then clause 6 goes on to say - </para>

                    <para class="block">Of course that is what I call the pretence of protecting labour. What would have to be proved ? According to clause 3 - &#34; Inadequate remuneration for labour &#34; includes inadequate pay or excessive hours or any terms or conditions of labour or employment unduly disadvantageous to workers. </para>
                    <para class="block">Before we could reach the person whom it was desired to get at, it would be necessary to prove an intent to destroy, and that it was by means of unfair competition, and unfair competition would have to be proved - because it is not assumed - by usurping the functions of Arbitration Courts, Wages, and Factories Boards. It would also involve an intrusion into the State domain, and a determination by the Court at the instance of the person who said that his business was injured by unfair competition. An inquiry into all these things - as to whether or not the allegation was made out, that the employes would be likely to be subject to inadequate remuneration - opens up a vista of difficulties, which would render it impossible of effect, and the investigation would have to , take place in a Law Court. So whenever any provision in this part of the measure was sought to be brought into force, the operations of the importer or person who had entered into an agreement would be paralyzed, and. trade to that extent would be stopped, while the investigation was going on. And of course every manufacturer or trader who chose to say that a particular importation or arrangement or combine was likely to injure him, would endeavour to make out that the employes were inadequately remunerated within the large scope of the definition of &#34;inadequate remuneration&#34; in clause 3. </para>

At any rate, we shall have an opportunity of considering the point when we get into Committee. It is a singular thing that in the United States there seem to have been very few proceedings under the Acts to which attention has been called. If this is an abstract of all the cases which have taken place, as I presume it is, certainly, so far as the United States is concerned, we find that only one case occurred in 1891, 1895, 1897, 1898, 1900, 1903, and 1904. </para>

                            <para>- I hope that that is so. There is not the same opportunity for litigation in America as there would be under this measure, because&#39; it would be open to any one who wished to disturb trade to initiate a proceeding of this kind. Therefore, the probability is that there will be a greater crop of that kind than there is in America. To come briefly to the second part of the Bill, I point out that here, for the first time in our legislation, the term &#34;dumping&#34; is used. I can understand legislation to prevent the raising of prices, but I cannot understand legislation to prevent the lowering of prices. The person who benefits in the latter case is the consumer. The objection which this Bill is supposed to meet in Part III. is in regard to the importation of goods to bring down prices. </para>

We have no right, to prevent the importation of goods which cheapen prices to the consumer.

                            <para>- The information which has been circulated has been put before us to justify this Bill. My objection is that it does not justify the Bill at all. It merely throws Bust in the eyes of the Senate. Let us discard these other examples altogether if we are not to be guided by them. The New Zealand Act is founded upon the principle of regulating importations and encouraging free competition. So is the Canadian Act. There is also a provision in the New Zealand Act which, I think, we might well have followed. It exempts British manufacturers from the operation of the law. Surely, if we are going in for imperialism and preferential trade, it should not be mere lip service. Why should we not introduce a provision of that kind into this Bill ? </para>

                            <para>- My honorable friend is an. advocate of preferential trade, and he should agree with me that in legislating in this direction we have an opportunity to show our affection for the mother country, and our desire for reciprocal trade. I am an advocate of reciprocal trade, too, and shall make an effort in this direction in Committee. I wish to call the attention of honorable senators to the extraordinary way in which these anti-dumping provisions are to be enforced. In the first place there is to be a complaint in writing to the Comptroller-General. When he receives that complaint he is not to act unless he has reason to believe the following things: - In the first place, he must be satisfied that there is a person importing with intent to destroy or injure any Australian industry. In the second place, he has to be satisfied that it is an Australian industry that is being injured. It is not every Australian industry that is protected. He has to satisfy himself that the Australian industry affected is one which is advantageous to the Commonwealth, having due regard to the interests of producers, workers, and consumers. It has to be an industry in which, in the opinion of the Comptroller-General, the majority of the workers receive adequate remuneration for their labour, and are not subjected to unfair terms and conditions. He has judicially to inquire into all this. That is the preliminary investigation that has to take place. Before the matter passes through this labyrinth, the importer will probably be ruined. In addition to all that, the Comptroller-General has to be satisfied that the Australian industry is being, injured by unfair competition. If honorable senators look to what is unfair competition they find that* that also is covered by a very elaborate set of provisions. The conditions set out in sub-clause 2 of clause 18 have to be fulfilled. The competition is deemed to be unfair if it - would probably or does in fact result in an inadequate remuneration for labour in the Australian industry. </para>

It is a small satisfaction to the importer that he may give a bond, when he is refused the power to import, and placed in the position of a culprit. Then, this provision would prevent the circulation of the goods amongst the Australian people. </para>

                            <para>- But goods which it is desired to import may be held up on complaint being made by anybody who chooses, to the Comptroller-General., An importer, knowing that a rival was about to import a large stock of cheap goods, might in this way be able to put a &#34; spoke &#34; in his rival&#39;s &#34; wheel.&#34; The goods would then be held in bond, and, in the meantime, the trader who had made complaint would be getting rid of his goods, and the other man might be ruined. Anything more unjust or unfair never was proposed. The next step is that the Minister may refer the matter to a Justice; and the reference has to be notified in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette.</inline> The question to be decided by the Justice is the extraordinary one whether the goods are being imported with the intent alleged, and, if so, whether the importation should be prohibited - it is a matter of opinion - either absolutely or subject to any specific conditions, restrictions, or limitations. </para>

                            <para>- I. deeply regret that the duty of interfering with, or regulating, matters of trade should have been imposed upon a Justice of the High Court. These are not the sort of questions that ought, in my humble opinion, to be referred to a Justice. Under the Bill the Justice is asked to determine whether the industry is one which comes within the category I have mentioned, and whether a majority of the workers receive adequate remuneration. Such questions are proper, it may. be for a conciliation and arbitration tribunal, or a Wages Board, but are not such as, in the first instance, ought to be submitted to a Justice of the High Court. In matters relating to trade the tribunal ought to be one associated with trade. </para>

                            <para>- I think honorable, members, on looking at these clauses, will agree with me that, for many obvious reasons, the Justices of the High Court should not be brought into an atmosphere of this kind. This is not a proper subject for judicial investigation ; it is infinitely better that matters of trade should be dealt with as matters of trade. Such a question as whether or not goods should be imported would be far better settled by those conversant with the practical bearing of the principles of trade and commerce. It appears to me that the provisions relating to dumping are extremely complex, and have been very little considered. </para>

Then, in my opinion, it is scarcely the way to refer to the highest tribunal in this country to provide that the Justice shall proceed1 to &#34; expeditiously &#34; and &#34;carefully&#34; investigate and determine the matter.

                            <para>- I do not know what is the object, but, at any rate, it is not the sort of phraseology I like to see. I feel very strongly that the Bill, which purports to be conceived from the stand-point of freeing trade from restraints, and securing and enlarging free competition, will by no means have that effect, but will introduce restraints infinitely greater than those it professes to remove. I am of opinion that the Bill will do incalculable mischief, so far as regards the free flow of trade and commerce in this country. For those reasons I prefer to consider what further course I shall myself take. I should like the Government to withdraw or postpone the Bill for the purpose of reconsidering its provisions. It would be desirable,. I think, to have a postponement until we have had an opportunity to carefully consider the evidence taken and the reports by the Tariff Commission on the one subject which notoriously has brought about the introduction of the Bill. It has not, in my opinion, been considered as fully in its details as it might have been, and, while, in words, it recognises free competition, .it, in effect, hampers and defeats free competition. The Bill professes to secure freedom from all restraint of trade, while it involves trade in fresh meshes. No destruction of industries has been established, and nothing in the nature of predatory assault has, been suggested, which it is necessary to repel under the provisions of such a Bill. I am as anxious to encourage industries as anybody could possibly be in a legitimate and fair way but when I find the natural industries of Australia enjoying a period of unexampled prosperity - when I find the manufacturing industries of Victoria enjoying similar prosperity - I say, with all emphasis, that we ought to leave well alone. We may meddle only to mar. </para>

If sufficient progress be made I shall not take the step I have indicated, but it mav be necessary to have the extra sitting day if we are to close the session within a reasonable time. </para>
