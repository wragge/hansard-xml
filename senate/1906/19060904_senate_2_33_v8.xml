                        <para>- I wish, sir. to draw your attention to the following paragraph in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of Saturday last on the state of the atmosphere in the chamber, more particularly in the press gallery. </para>

                    <para class="block">Professor Osborne, of the Melbourne University, has verified completely the conjecture put forward in a paragraph published in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> on 30th August, in which complaint was made of the state of the atmosphere in the press gallery in the Senate chamber at Federal Parliament House. Professor Osborne visited the chamber on Thursday last, and, making his way unostentatiously to the press gallery, he obtained samples of the atmosphere. The visit was paid at about10.20 p.m., and on completing his scientific tests Professor Osborne found that the sample contained carbon dioxide in the proportion of27.7 per 10,000. This is the most vitiated sample yet obtained by Professor Osborne, who in a lecture which he delivered a few days ago declared that if the percentage of this gas rose above 10 per 10,000 life could not be maintained at its best. </para>
                    <para>I desire to ask you, sir, if some action cannot be taken to improve the atmosphere in the press gallery, and also in this portion of the chamber, to which, I may add, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> referred some time ago. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> drew my attention to the paragraph a few moments ago. It is perfectly easy to alter the state of affairs; but then, if we made an alteration, the probability is that at least one half, if not more than one half of the senators, would complain of draughts in the chamber. Suppose, for instance, that the curtains were removed and the side galleries opened, it. would give us an immense supply of air in the chamber. I understand that Professor Osborne made his test under very exceptional circumstances - when we were sitting until 3 o&#39;clock in the morning. </para>

                            <para>- Of course, it is perfectly easy to alter the state of affairs, but the question is whether if an alteration were made it might not lead to draughts, which would be very objectionable to a great many senators. If the Senate expresses a wish to have the curtains removed and the side galleries opened, that can be done. </para>

                        <para>- Under ordinary circumstances I should be very pleased to tell the honorable senator that I would obtain the information for him, but I am not in a position to say whether it can be readily obtained, or whether it would entail a large expenditure to comply with his request. I think that he ought not to press for a reply at once, but should give notice of a motion for a return. We should then be in a position to see whether the return could be readily obtained, whether it would entail a large expenditure, whether we could agree to all the terms of the return, or whether we might wish to vary them. </para>

The Deputy Postmaster-General for Queensland has furnished the following answers : - 1 and 2. Owing to awkward running of trains sorters leave Toowoomba once a fortnight, on Thursday for Roma and back, travel continually 20 hours, and once a fortnight leaving Toowoomba on Friday they travel continuously 211/2 hours. Efforts have been made to reduce these long hours, but present sorters are opposed to any change in their running while existing railway time-table is maintained, as they state return trip from Roma on each occasion referred to admits of a little rest being taken, and on conclusion of Thursday&#39;s trip they have four clear days off duty, while the intermediate trips always allow good rest at Roma and Toowoomba. </para>

The reply indicates that, in the opinion of the officers, who are experienced in these matters - necessarily much more experienced than the Minister - a by-election rather than a general election, such as is before us, would afford the best opportunity for making a test. Any information which the honorable senator may require with regard to the matter, I shall be pleased to supply to him either in answer to a question or on representations which he may make either to me or to the Minister of Home Affairs. I can assure him that the Department is fully alive to the necessity of making the method of recording votes thoroughly up-to-date. </para>

Had the Bill gone into Committee again, I should have been able to speak upon the two principal subjects as to which I desire to see amendments made. As it is, I shall have to discuss the two matters together.

                    expressed a desire that the Bill should be recommitted, in order that we might see how that sub-clause would read .as amended. As it stands now, I venture to say that it is not such a provision as ought to be passed by the Senate. Its grammatical construction is faulty; it is ambiguous ; and it is vague. Those are three defects which would be considerable in any Act of Parliament. Let honorable senators read it carefully.

When the subject was first discussed, several honorable senators were under the impression that young industries that were struggling, and which consequently had less efficient machinery than well-established industries might be expected to have, would have greater consideration shown to them than the more highly developed industries. That is to say, it was understood by some that the owner of a business which was struggling along under difficulties through want of capital would receive more consideration than would the proprietor of a highly-capitalized factory. But we now have it from the Government that what the provision means really is that an industry that is struggling through want of capital, and inefficient plant and machinery, is to be actually handicapped under this Bill. </para>

                        <para>- But what does it mean? We have been discussing the Bill up to the present time on the understanding that what it meant was that help was not extended to a factory unless its processes, plant, and machinery were efficient and up-to-date. If it does not mean that, let its meaning be clearly expressed. Let there be no doubt about it. The ambiguity that I complain about is that the sub-clause does not state whether the inefficient machinery is to be the only matter dealt with. </para>

                        <para>- I draw attention to this sub-clause, because it throws a flood of light upon clause 17. It is, I repeat, ambiguous in that it says that regard is to be had to certain things, whilst it does not say that having regard to those things is to secure more or less favorable consideration. It is terribly vague. The word &#34; reasonably &#34; has been inserted - a very comforting sort of word for weak consciences; because in its present form the clause satisfies some honorable senators, perhaps, that it cannot be pushed quite so far as it could have been pushed originally. But it is left entirely for the Court to determine what &#34; reasonably &#34; means; and there is not a more dangerous practice than to put words like that into Acts of Parliament, leaving it for the Court to construe them. In every case, the Court will have to construe the word &#34; reasonably &#34; with the probability that in no two cases will the same meaning be attached to it. There are, therefore, three faults which justify my action. The sub-clause is ambiguous; it is vague in regard to conveying exactly what is intended, and it is ungrammatical. As I said before, it is not a right thing that the efficiency pf the machinery, the plant, and the processes should be the sole test. We can .easily understand cases in which a young industry struggling with difficulties, if it complied with all the requirements of this Bill, and could show that it was being crushed by unfair competition on the part of importers, would afford a case in which it would be far more justifiable to exercise the pow&#39;ers contained in the Bill than it would be to use them for the benefit of an industry that was fully equipped and up-to-date. We can imagine such a case, at all events. I should be in favour of striking the sub clause out. It has got in, I feel perfectly sure, through a misapprehension. The Government has not before dealt with a Bill of this character prohibiting imports. It contains a principle that is very good when applied to protective duties which operate fairly all round, and give just as much benefit to the small as to the big producer. The correct principle with regard to import duties is that they shall operate to protect an industry as long as it is carried on by efficient methods, but that competition shall not be prevented if there is any slackness with regard to machinery, processes, or management. Such duties do not amount to prohibition. But this provision can only operate for the benefit of the big manufacturer, and not of the small man. Therefore. I urge that this test of efficiency and up-to-dateness in machinery, plant, and app.lia.nces should not be the test in this case. Clause 17 is closely connected with the provision which I have been discussing. It may be, perhaps, that in consequence of my action, the Senate did not ha.ve an opportunity to vote in favour of any modification of the clause. Perhaps I was over sanguine, when. I pointed out the objections to it, in thinking that honorable senators would be willing to reject the whole clause. Therefore. I devoted mv efforts to defeating it. The consequence was that, after a vote had been taken upon the clause as a whole, it was impossible to move any amendment. What I now desire is that the Senate shall recommit the clause, in order that an amendment mav be proposed in it. At present it reads: - </para>

                <para class="block">The amendment that I propose to move in Committee is to omit the words &#34;Comptroller-General or&#34; and the words &#34;as the case may be.&#34; The clause would then give power to a Justice of the High Court to say that an industry which made an application for assistance was not worth preserving, but it would take away that power from the Comptroller-General. This, I think, would be a very fair compromise. When we speak of the Comptroller-General we do not refer to ai particular person, but merely to the principal officer of the Customs Department ; and I say that it would be almost an unheard-of thing to give such a power to the Comptroller-General. According to clause 16, an industry is not an industry within the meaning of the Bill unless it pays adequate remuneration and complies with the provisions regarding fair terms and conditions. Honorable senators may remember the agitation started by a. certain newspaper in Melbourne on behalf of what were called &#34; strangled industries.&#34; That newspaper sent out its young men to ask manufacturers whether they did not require some more protection. Not only were the big manufacturers in Collins-street interviewed, but also the smaller men in the back streets and suburbs; and the latter certainly did not imagine, when they were supplying, the information, that they would be placed in the position in which this Bill places them. The smaller manufacturers did not imagine that if they went to the Comptroller-General with a&#34; complaint that they were being crushed out &#39;by foreign competition, they would be told that the Commonwealth law was not for such as they - that if they could not stand against foreign competition they must go down. It was never imagined that the Comptroller-General would have power to say, &#34; You go away and economize; cut down your wages and employ five apprentices for every man ; enter into combination and crush out your rivals ; and when you have established a big business, and, by means of up-to-date plant and machinery, have strangled your rivals, and have set up a palace in Collins-street, with plate-glass windows, and you are making ^20,000 a year, you may come to us, and we will help you to establish a monopoly.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- That is what will happen if we give this power to the Comptroller-General to act on what is necessarily incomplete evidence. I should have liked to strike out the clause; but the amendment which I now suggest would leave this enormous power with the Justice, while removing it from the Comptroller-General. In a Bill of this kind we should certainly not give the 1,0wei to an officer of the Customs to check any application from an industry which has been described as being &#34; strangled.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- It would have to be proved that the applicant represented an industry which was paying fair remuneration and observing proper terms and conditions, and that the industry was in danger of being destroyed bv unfair competition. According to clause 18, it would have to be shown that the industry was being crushed by unfair foreign competition. Why, then, should the representative of such an industry be prevented from going before a Justice of the High, Court? Why should all the powers to prohibit imports be reserved for cases of big businesses, which have been built up, perhaps, by the destruction of rivals, and have arrived at a stage when they are able, at all events, to make a bid for a monopoly? The peculiar thing about the Bill is that it is absolutely opposed, in substance, to what it pretends to be. The title of this Bill describes it as one to repress monopolies, whereas in reality it is a Bill to create and maintain monopolies. It is called a Bill for the Preservation of Australian Industries ; but we find that it is a Bil&#93; to preserve only certain industries which the Comptroller-General is prepared to certify are worth preserving. I trust that the Senate will allow the recommittal of the Bill, in, order that we may reconsider this clause. I should like to remind honorable senators that when the Watson Government went out of power, the great complaint was that the majority in another place would not allow the Arbitration and Conciliation Bill to be recommitted for the purpose of reconsidering a clause. But the case for recommittal on that occasion was not nearly so strong as the case we have before us to-dar. Clause 48 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Bill had been thoroughly discussed, and the majority were not prepared to state the exact alteration that they desired; the real object was to put the Bill into the melting pot, in order to see in what form it would emerge. I ask honorable senators to recommit this Bill, iri&#39; order to consider an amendment of a clause which was decided upon, on a division, before an amendment had been moved. I have been informed that if an amendment had been proposed, it would have obtained more support than I was able to get for the striking out of the clause. I ask honorable senators to recommit the Bill in the interests of those smaller industries, which, in consequence of want of capital, are in more urgent need of help. There is another ground for a recommittal that has occurred to me more recently - certainly since we finished the consideration of tine Bill in Committee. We have had laid on the table since then a preferential trade treaty with new Zealand, and also a statement of a new scale of duties with regard to our trade with Great Britain and the world. I know that I must not anticipate discussion on those proposals, and that I can only refer to them in order to show how closely they are connected with the measure before us. In the case of New Zealand, we have actually entered into a preferential trade treaty, and the duties are now being collected. Under that treaty, we agree to a certain scale of duties on goods as between the two places. I have no doubt that it has already struck the Government that one of the effects of a trade treaty is that we. to a certain extent, stereotype our duties. After we have made a treaty in regard to the duty on a certain article, Parliament is not free to alter that duty during the currency of the treaty. That is a good reason, perhaps, why, if more of our duties were fixed by treaty- </para>

It is clear that in passing this Bill, which gives power to the Executive to refuse to receive certain goods even when they pay the fixed rate of duty, we are making a Jaw with provisions in derogation of the treaty. We have made a bargain with New Zealand that on condition they receive certain of our goods at certain rates of duty, we shall receive certain of their goods at certain rates of duty. </para>

                        <para>- We could not alter the law without breaking the treaty. India is the country which produces opium, and, if we had a trade agreement with that country, under which we undertook to receive opium without charging a dutv, on condition that India freely admitted certain of our goods, we could not, during the currency of that treaty or agreement, impose a duty on opium. And&#39; if we could not impose a duty, we certainly could not prohibit the importation of opium without a breach of agreement. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> must know what is involved in a treaty. By a treaty we bind ourselves absolutely to do certain things; and, if under a treaty with New Zealand the dutv on a certain article were 3s., we could not. without breaking the agreement, impose a dutv of 3s. fd. If that be so, how much less would we be in a position to prohibit the importation of an article. I desire that honorable senators should see how flagrant a breach Of the treaty that would be. In the case of Great Britain we have not made a treaty, but an offer to grant certain preferences, and apparently we can withdraw our offer next week if we like. We are saying to the manufacturers and exporters of Great Britain, &#34; You send out certain goods, and we will admit them at a duty of 2s., whilst we will charge 3s. to manufacturers and exporters from all other countries of the world.&#34; Australian importers who may previously have been doing business with foreign countries may transfer their orders to Great Britain. An Australian importer, in anticipation of a big trade, may place a large order with a British manufacturer or exporter, and on getting the goods here he may sell them cheaply on the local market. A local manufacturer producing the same article may complain to the Comptroller-General that his industry is being crushed by this foreign competition, and if he makes out a good case the Government who have made the treaty with Great Britain will prohibit the landing of the goods. The subject of the nation with whom we have made the treaty may be perfectly innocent of what is intended to be done on this side, and yet because the goods he is sending out are being sold here cheaply contrary to the policy of this maker, he may get a telegram telling him not to proceed with the order because the importation of his goods is prohibited in Australia. In the meantime, another local importer importing the same goods from a foreign country, and selling them without any reduction in price, is permitted to continue his business, and the manufacturer or exporter in the foreign country with whom we have no treaty is allowed to continue his operations. </para>

We start by saying, &#34;We shall make a treat}&#39; this week, and if we please will break it next week.&#34; What reliance could be placed on a Government that would make a treaty with a reservation in the terms of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor&#39;s</inline> interjection, &#34; We can make a law to override the treaty to-morrow&#34;? It will be a very bad thing for us if it goes forth to the world that our Administrators are prepared to make treaties this week, and to pass laws to evade them next week. I said that I would come back to the point about an offence being committed here as the result of which the subject of a nation with whom we have made a treaty will lose the advantage of that treaty. </para>

                        <para>- People are differently constituted, and. to my mind, it is on exactly the same plane. The one is a treaty, and&#39; the other is an offer of preferential trade without&#39; any consideration. In respect of the latter, at all events, we have claimed, in the eyes of the world, as much credit for&#39; it as if it had been a treaty. Every lawyer is aware that an agreement is not binding if it is made without consideration, but a man who received the benefit of such an agreement and evaded it would consider himself a very mean creature if he set up the defence that it was made without consideration. </para>

                        <para>- When the honorable senator refers to &#34; improper conditions,&#34; I might quote from a magazine article just published with regard to the Sherman law to show that some of these trade agreements are quite right, whilst others may be wrong ; but, under this Bill, we bunch them all together, and assume that they are all criminal. That, however, is by the way. I moved an amendment in clause 19, which, I think. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> described as &#34; frivolous.&#34; The honorable senator might, I think, have attached to it almost any other epithet but that. If he intended to convey that the Government, having their majority, were not prepared to listen to reason, the honorable senator might have described the moving, of my amendment as a waste of time, but certainly not as frivolous. Under this Bill an offence may be committed by a single person, and probably by a person, operating in Australia. I desire to amend that to provide that no offence should be assumed to have been committed unless there was proof of a combination. Having regard to the apparent scope of the Bill I thought that it was meant to deal particularly with combinations, and amongst others, with a combination of a merchant or importer here and a merchant or manufacturer in another country with the object of flooding the local market. My amendment was rejected, and under the Bill as it stands an offence might be committed solely by some person in Australia. I commend that to the attention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith.</inline> We make an agreement with another nation that we will admit goods produced by the subjects of that nation at a certain rate of duty. We continue to do so for a time. Some one in Australia orders goods . from the favoured country, and the manufacturer or exporter there from whom the goods are ordered knows nothing whatever about what the local importer intends to do with the goods. When the goods are landed in Australia the local importer sells them cheaply, contrary to the policy of this Bill, and, as a consequence, their importation is prohibited. We refuse to take the goods exported by the subject of the favoured nation because of some offence against our law committed by a local importer. Could <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> justify that? </para>

                        <para>- The admission of the goods is prohibited here, and the man sending them gets a cable from Australia to say that his goods are prohibited. Some manufacturer in Australia, who may previously have been getting his goods from Germany or the United States, transfers his orders to Great Britain, because of the preferential duties offered to British exporters. He may place a large order with a British manufacturer for shipment after shipment of his goods covering a period of six or twelve months. The British manufacturer may be perfectly innocent of all knowledge as to what the local importer intends to do with the goods. When the local importer gets the goods here, he commences to sell them cheaply. A local manufacturer of similar goods complains to the Comptroller-General that the local importer is importing these goods from abroad and selling them too cheaply. </para>

                        <para>- I shall assume illegitimate trade if the honorable senator pleases. Because of these preferential proposals a local merchant previously doing business with the United States manufacturers sends a large order for goods to a British manufacturer, he accepts the British manufacturer&#39;s prices, and when he gets the goods here, sells them at a lower price. That is an offence against this Bill. </para>

                        <para>- There is nothing in the clause to which I refer about the cost of production. The manufacturer can sell his goods at any price he pleases. Surely it would not be an offence for 3 British manufacturer to sell his goods cheaply to a local importer? How can the price at which a manufacturer on the other side of the world sells his goods to a local importer injure the local industry for the production of those goods? How can the local industry be interfered with in any way other than by the price at which the goods are sold here. To continue my illustration, a local importer places an order with a British manufacturer for goods to be sent out month after month for a period of six or twelve months. He sells those goods in the local market at a certain price. A local manufacturer complains, and if his complaint is held to be good the importation of the goods is stooped at the Customs House. </para>

Because goods are sold cheaply by a local importer, a cablegram is sent home to the British manufacturer telling him to cease sending out his goods, as. their admission to Australia is prohibited.

                        <para>- If the proposed new scale of duties is not as good as. a treaty, I should like to know what justification the Government have for taking credit to themselves as though it were. They have tabled a new scale of duties giving a preference to British goods, and ostensibly intended to accord preferential treatment to British manufacturers, and at the same time they are prepared to pass this legislation which is in derogation of those preferential proposals - legislation which will deprive the people or the nation with whom we are making a treaty of all the benefits that might be expected to arise from them. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly. I should think that the Government would not knowingly agree to pass a Bill containing provisions in derogation of a treaty which they have already made, or in derogation of the preferential treatment which they have offered to accord to Great Britain. I anticipated that the Government would be pleased to embrace the opportunity to put in an amendment of this kind. I can hardly think it possible that, with their eyes open, they will pass a Bill of this kind without inserting an amendment which would make it perfectly clear that the treaty and the proposals it contains would not be injuriously affected thereby. I am not wedded to the exact wording of the new clause I propose to move, but I think that it should read in this way - </para>

                            Drake has referred to the preference which the Government propose to give to British goods over foreign goods, and also to the treaty which we have entered into with New Zealand. Of course, he fought shy of the treaty with New Zealand, because he could nor connect it in .any way with the Bill.

                        <para>- We are perfectly justified in taking that course. So far as I can see, we are not asking for or proposing a treaty with Great Britain. I anticipate that Great Britain will alter her policy so far as free-trade is concerned, and that if by-and-by she should, give us a first preference it would be a matter of treaty. At the present time, however, we are not asking her to give us any preference. We are giving a preference to her out of real good-will - out of what we&#39; might call our love and affection for the mother country. </para>

It is contended that if we entered into a treaty certain things would happen-.. I contend that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake&#39;s</inline> anticipations will not be realized unless there should come from the mother country goods with the intention of destroying an Australian industry in an, unfair way. Surely the Government with which we had a treaty would not deny to us the right to prevent an injury to our own manufactures attempted in an unfair way ! </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> has occupied a considerable space of time to-day, as he was entitled to do; but his statements reT garding the amendment which he desires to submit in Committee were of a very peculiar character. He said, first, that the clause was ambiguous, and then that it was had grammar. Would the omission of the words &#34; Comptroller-General &#34; make the clause less ambiguous, or mend the bad grammar? It is inconsistent on the part of the honorable senator to try to make the Senate believe that this, that, or the other is wrong - to propose to cure the wrong, and then to indicate an amendment which would not have the slightest effect in that direction. </para>

                        <para>- I was first of opinion that the honorable senator&#39;s contention was correct, and I was going to put this as a motion; but it was pointed out to me by the clerks that there was a motion already before the Senate. Standing order 205 contemplates that, before the motion to adopt the report is put, an honorable senator may move for a recommittal of the Bill, and then it becomes the question. It must be understood that this debate was adjourned from last Friday until to-day. It has been moved and seconded that the report be agreed to. That has been put by me from the Chair, and has become a substantive question. It has passed out of the application of standing order 205. When there is a question before the Senate, and an honorable senator wishes to alter the question, he must move an amendment, and I shall put the proposal of the honorable senator as an amendment. If the honorable senator, before I put the question, &#34; That the debate be adjourned,&#34; had moved &#34; That the Bill be recommitted,&#34; it would have been an original motion, and the motion that was proposed by the Minister of Defence would not have been a question, at all. That is the difference. I did not see the point myself at first, but my attention was called to it by the clerks, and I think that they are right. </para>

                        <para>- I say distinctly that there was no such motion. I wish to remind you of what happened. The moment <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> rose to move the adoption of the report a point of order was taken whether that motion could be moved under the circumstances. That point of order was debated by several honorable senators. You yourself suggested a way out of the difficulty we had got into, and the debate was adjourned. Perhaps it was adjourned without due regularity, but I am perfectly certain that no motion was made by the Minister. </para>

I submit for your consideration that the moment <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> rose, at the last sitting of the Senate, to move the adoption of the report upon this Bill, a point of order was taken. No one seconded the motion. It was never put to the Senate, for the reason that the point of order raised bv <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> led to the ruling that the business could not be gone on with. </para>

My own recollection as to what happened oil Friday is not very clear, but my belief is that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> moved that the report be adopted. I see from the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record that three honorable senators spoke after that. They could not have spoken unless there was a motion before the Senate. Subsequently <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> moved that the debate be adjourned. Now it comes before us as an adjourned debate. </para>

My honorable friend the Minister of Defence on Friday moved the adoption of the report, and I have no doubt that the motion was seconded.

I then drew attention to the fact that we had not printed copies of the Bill before us. </para>

                        <para>. - The point to be considered, in connexion with this Bill, is the convenience of electors., I do not think that the convenience of members or candidates would justify such an important action as the alteration of the Constitution. It seems to me that we ought to satisfy ourselves that the Bill is required in order to obtain better results in the electorates - that is, a larger number of voters at each election. Taking the results of the last two elections, we cannot feel satisfied that the percentage of voters will go to the polls at future elections that we should like to see. </para>

                            <para>-I do not know that compulsory voting would do much good. Even if we had compulsory voting, we ought to take into consideration whether the, elections are held at the most convenient time of the year for the great bulk of the electors. If we compel the electors to leave their work for the purpose of voting, it should be at a time when their doing so will result in the least inconvenience and loss to them, so that whether we believe in compulsory voting or not does not affect the issue. I have here a return given me by the electoral authorities, showing the percentage of voters on the rolls who voted at the first and second Federal elections. In 1901, taking the two Houses together, 54-35 per cent, of the electors on the rolls voted. </para>

                            <para>- At the last Federal elections, which, were held on 16th December, the percentage of voters on the roll who voted for the Senate was 46.86, or near 1 \- 47 per cent. ; and 50.20 per cent, for the House of Representatives. Taking the two Houses together, on that occasion the percentage was about 49 per cent., as against 54J per cent., or thereabouts, in 1 901. These figures indicate that March is certainly a more convenient time of the year for the large percentage of voters. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, and that accounts for the discrepancy between the rolls for the Senate and the House of Representatives. There is the significant feature that, at the first election, all the seats for the House of Representatives were contested, whereas at the second election a number were not contested ; and that might have some effect in lowering the average. </para>

                            <para>- The percentage for the Senate election is based on the whole State ; and, therefore, it is better and safer for the purposes of comparison to take the figures for the House of Representatives alone for the second election, and the figures for the two Houses together for the first election. </para>

                            <para>- I think that clear proof of the correctness of my view may be found in the case of Western Australia. In that State, at the last Federal election, there was a contest in every division but that of Swan, and there the percentage for the Senate was as low as. 2 7 per cent., whereas in the other electorates, where there were contests, the percentage was as high as 40 per cent. I think a fair comparison is to take the figures for the House of Representatives for the last election, and compare them with the figures for the two Chambers at the first election, when we have the result that at the last election for the House of Representatives, the percentage of voters was 50 per cent, as compared with 54 per cent, at the first election. It will be seen, therefore, that when the elections were held in March, 4 per cent, more voters polled than when the elections were held in December. </para>

                            <para>- In order to make it possible to have the elections for the two Houses at the one time. I think the figures I have quoted show that some month nearer the time suggested in the Bill would be preferable to the dates hitherto selected for the elections. Any one who knows the state of &#39;affairs in the southern States of Australia can have no possible doubt on the question. I have looked up the figures for what are largely the farming States - South Australia, Victoria, and New South Wales - and, especially in the two former, I find that, when the elections were held in December, there was a large percentage of votes cast in the metropolitan areas, and a small percentage in the rural districts. We know, of course, that the reason is supplied in the fact that December is the harvest time, when farmers are very busy, and an idle day may mean a considerable loss. That is a very good reason why the elections should be held either before or after the harvest. </para>

                            <para>- I have not said that the lower percentage in Western Australia was due to the elections being held in December, but that the percentage for the Senate was lowered owing to there being no contest in the Swan division. In that division the lowest percentage of votes recorded in the Commonwealth was polled, owing to the fact that there was no contest for the House of Representatives. But in those divisions in which there was a contest for the House of Representatives a very much larger percentage of votes was recorded for candidates for both the Senate and the House of Representatives. I may add that even in the division of </para>

                    <para class="block">Swan a more inconvenient month than December could not be suggested. There is a reason also why December is not convenient for electors even in our mining districts. Since the inception of mining in Western Australia, it has been the practice, except in the case of very rich mines on the Golden Mile, for mines to obtain exemptions a fortnight before Christmas for two or three weeks. There is practically a holiday of a month established, and miners during that period go down to the coast. A date late in December would not, therefore, suit even the mining districts of Western Australia. I understand that the reason for the introduction of the Bill is that it is thought that by the alteration proposed we shall be able to hold the elections in March or April, and it is manifestly undesirable that honorable senators who have been defeated at an election should continue to act in the Senate for nearly twelve months after their defeat. </para>

                            <para>- There is no doubt that we could alter the date of the meeting of the Parliament, but if we were to continue the present practice we might have a defeated senator, a man in whom the State had expressed a want of confidence, continuing to sit here and take part in Commonwealth legislation. I understand that the object of the Bill is to enable the Government to fix some more convenient date for the elections for the majority of the electors, and that to overcome the difficulty of a defeated senator continuing to take part in Commonwealth legislation they propose to put the date on for six months, and to hold the elections between March and June. My knowledge of Australian conditions convinces me that by adopting this course we should secure a larger percentage of the votes of electors, and would enable the majority of the electors to record their votes with less inconvenience than they can do under existing circumstances. Whether the date be fixed for December or June, the election of senators will, no doubt, be fixed as near to the end of the senatorial term as possible. That would be the invariable practice adopted. If we retained the provision under which the senatorial term ends on the 31st December, there can be no doubt that the Senate- elections will be held in November or December. I think that the balance of advantage is shown to be with the course proposed to be adopted, and I shall vote for the second reading of the Bill. </para>

                        (Tasmania) &#91;4.50}. - It is very singular that the first attempt made in the history of the Commonwealth to enter upon the important task of amending the Constitution should be made during the last month of an expiring Parliament. There are other circumstances connected with this Bill which are more than singular. It will not add to the dignity, good name, or reputation of the Senate if this measure is passed. Probably the most significant circumstance in connexion with it is that on the first occasion what an attempt is made to alter the Constitution a proposal is submitted to benefit sitting members of the Senate, and those who hope to be elected at the next election. I say that it is discreditable, if not disgraceful, that the first time we attempt to alter the Constitution we should do so with the object of adding six months to the term of office of sitting senators, and six months to the term of office of those who may be returned at the next election.

                            <para>- That such a consequence should be incidental to the passing of the measure, even though it should not be a reason for its introduction, should be sufficient to induce honorable senators to hesitate to support this Bill. I do not desire to repeat the arguments previously used against the Bill, but one of the first good grounds advanced for opposing the measure was that, under the Constitution, power is reserved to each of the States to fix the date of its own Senate elections. The passing of this Bill will not in any way abrogate that provision, because it is not here proposed that the Constitution shall be so amended as to take away that right from the States. That being so, this measure will be rendered entirely inoperative should any State, or the whole of the States, decide to determine the date of the Senate elections for themselves. Another good ground for refusing to pass the Bill is that the first penal dissolution will entirely destroy its value. We cannot legislate in the Senate on the assumption that there will not be a penal dissolution of the House of Representatives. So far as we can predicate the future, such a dissolution is bound to come sooner or later, and if it should arise within the next three years the whole of the advantage sought to be gained by this Bill will be destroyed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> raised an important question affecting the Constitution in connexion with the allowances to members of the Federal Parliament, which this Bill does not meet. I do not propose to repeat the honorable senator&#39;s observations ; but I remind honorable senators that the point raised is important in the discussion of this measure. </para>

                            <para>- I need not repeat <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford&#39;s</inline> observations in detail ; but, if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> will look the matter up, he will find that the provisions of this Bill are in direct conflict with the provisions of the Constitution in. respect to the allowances to members of the Federal Parliament. The reason assumed for the introduction of this Bill is that it is desired that the elections shall take place during some time of the year that will not be inconvenient to farmers. If honorable senators take into consideration the area of the continent of Australia and Tasmania, they will find that there is no month in the year which for . the purposes of the elections could be held to meet the convenience of all the farming electors in the Commonwealth. If we were to alter the date of the elections from December to March, whilst we might convenience farmers in one State, our action might be inconvenient to&#39; farmers in an other State. No one who knows the conditions of Australia will deny that, while March might be a convenient month in which to hold our elections in Victoria, it would be distinctly inconvenient for Queensland electors. Further, I say that the farmers, as a class, have no right to expect the Federal Parliament to seek to alter the Constitution merely in order to meet their convenience. We, as a Parliament, have no right to cajole the people into voting at elections by trying to discover for them a suitable time to go to the poll It is the duty of every elector in the Commonwealth to record his vote, and I do not think we are asking too much of the farmers of Victoria when we invite them to go to the poll in. November or in December once in three years. What idea of his duty as a citizen of the Commonwealth can any elector have if once in three years he will not sacrifice an hour to record his vote at a Senate election. </para>

                            <para>- Let it be so; and is the value of the franchise of so little account that a farmer is entitled to raise a personal grievance because once in three years he is asked to put himself to a little inconvenience in order to exercise it? In my opinion, it is absurd to say that we shall fix upon one month of the year rather than another in order to enable individual citizens to go to the poll. Seeing that they are asked to go to the poll only once in three years, it should not be too much to ask them to attend to their duties as citizens in this respect on any date, or in any month of the year. The Bill is introduced bv Ministers with the avowed object of altering the date of our elections ; but I am convinced that it is supported with the view of amending the Constitution. I do . not know what reason we have to assume that honorable senators opposite are so desperately anxious to secure the convenience of the farmers that they are prepared to go the length of proposing an alteration in the Constitution in order to give effect to such an object. I do not pretend to have so particular an interest in the farming community as to desire to alter the Constitution in order to give them facilities for voting. I believe there are many members of the Senate who desire that the Constitution shall be amended, and this reason for amending it is as good, as another, and, <inline font-style="italic">\n</inline> their opinion, is just good enough. I have little hesitation in saying that if the Bill be passed, it will be, not because it will convenience a few electors, but simply because it will afford an opportunity to alter the Constitution. If honorable senators who rely upon .the ostensible reason for the introduction of this Bill as a justification for voting for it would but listen to reason on the subject, they would change their minds as to the desirability of passing it. There can be no doubt that, if we alter the date of our elections by this means from December to March, we shall inconvenience a certain number of the citizens of the Commonwealth. No member of the Senate will deny that March will be an inconvenient month to many of the electors. </para>

                            <para>- That is just the point I am making. There is bound to be some body of electors in each of the States to whom any particular month would not be as convenient as some other month. When it is certain that the passing of the Bill will involve inconvenience to many electors, it is ludicrous to propose to alter the Constitution for such ai purpose. Honorable senators are aware that the machinery provided for the alteration of the Constitution is very cumbersome and complicated ; and is it worth while to put it in motion in order merely to consult the convenience of a number of electors when we know that what we propose to do will inconvenience other electors? I do not believe that honorable senators who support the measure do so for that reason. If it is not for that reason, then let them come out into the open and say what their reason is. I am firmly convinced that, in their opinion, it is thought desirable that the Constitution should be amended, not only in this direction, but in many others. If the Bill were passed, the opportunity would then be immediately seized to say, &#34; Seeing that all the machinery for altering the Constitution will have to be put in motion, we might as well submit to the people the question of amending it in half-a-dozen other directions.&#34; </para>

They would be told at once, &#34; The people will have to be consulted on the question of altering the date of holding the Senate elections. Seeing that a referendum of the people must be taken on that point, and that certain expenditure must be incurred why not submit to them at the same time other questions?&#34; </para>

                            <para>- I accept my honorable friend&#39;s assurance. But he must recognise that we could not give a stronger argument to those who wish to submit an alteration of the Constitution in other directions than the fact that we have already passed a Bill which provides for the holding of a referendum for that purpose. It would be asked at once, &#34; As you are going to consult the people, why object to ascertaining their will on other points at the same time, and so save expense?&#34; That is the very great danger I see in passing the Bill. In consideration of what is expected to be gained by its enactment, if anything is to be gained, are we going to run that risk? Are we going to ask the people, as well as the Parliament, to incur the risk of altering the Constitution in a dozen directions, under the pretext of getting something for the farmers, and not for every class -of electors ? </para>

                            <para>- I have stated my reasons for opposing the Bill. Even if it contained a provision that no referendum should be taken on any other subject for a period of ten- years, the Bill would stand self condemned in its essence. It is a Bill to give six months&#39; additional tenure to honorable senators. It is not worth a flip of the fingers, because it is over-ridden by certain provisions of the Constitution. It is a measure which a penal dissolution of the other House would convert into wastepaper. There are a dozen good reasons why on its mere merits it should be thrown out. Nevertheless, I am perfectly certain that, for various reasons, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> and others will vote for its second reading. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator will be on perfectly safe ground in so doing if he wishes to attain his object. If. as I believe, he wants the Constitution altered, not for this reason, but for other reasons, he will vote for the second reading of the Bill, in order to achieve those other objects, which from his point of view are vastly more important than the inconveniencing of a few farmers in Victoria. I do not imagine that, whatever any one else mav do, he will make the idle pretence that he wishes to .see the Bill passed in order to help Victorian farmers. I shall oppose the Bill at every possible stage, because on its merits its passing would be discreditable to the Senate. I wonder that honorable senators cannot realize that if it were passed, when the history of the Commonwealth came to &#34;be written the historian would have to record that the first time its great Constitution was ordered to be amended was on the occasion when it was thought desirable, amongst other things, to add six months&#39; tenure to the term of those senators who were then legislating, and to give a tenure of three years and six months to their successors. </para>

                            <para>- It may not, but is that a reason for altering, the Constitution ? Was the American Constitution ever altered under a pretext of that kind? Let us remember the great fight which took place before it was altered. Could any American nowadays read the history of his country with pride or pleasure if he had to recognise the fact that the first time its Constitution was altered was to increase the tenure of the senators under an idle pretext? Granted that honorable senators have a right to pass the Bill, what would be the result? The result would be simply to alter the date for the election of senators. </para>

It is asserted that it is very desirable to alter the date for holding the Senate elections, and that, therefore, the Constitution must be amended. That is not necessary. Under the Constitution as it stands; the elections for the Senate can be held in any month from August to December. Does not a choice of any one of the five months meet all requirements&#34;? Would not any one of those months answer just as well as the month of March? </para>

                            <para>- If we are going to consult the convenience of a class, or of members of Parliament, what reason is there for not meeting earlier in the year? I know of no reason why Parliament should not assemble in February instead of in May. If it met in February and sat until the end of August - which would represent the duration of a session - it would leave six months available to the Executive for choosing a date for holding the elections. </para>

                            <para>- Yes ; but so would this Bill, if passed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> pointed out the other day that one of the chief objections to its enactment as it stands is, that it is in conflict with the termination of the financial year, but that could be got over in any case. I submit that the scope which is offered to us at present for holding the elections is ample to meet the requirements of every class of citizens in every State. I go further, and say that in my opinion the Senate has no right to consider an V particular class of the community when it is fixing upon the date for holding the elections. It is absurd that we should attempt to practically bribey - because it is a species of bribe - electors to go to the poll. </para>

                            <para>- It is almost going that far. It is practically saying to the farmers. &#34; We recognise that, under existing arrangements, you have good and sufficient reasons for not voting.&#34; I do not hold that view. Seeing: that the elections occur only once in three years, a man, whether he be a farmer or not. has no excuse for not recording his vote. For this reason. I do not think that the Senate is justified in sanctioning a referendum, to the people in order to fix a better date for a particular class to vote. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not like the Bill for many of the reasons which have been mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons.</inline> Arn alteration of the Constitution is a most serious matter, and ought not to be attempted unless the occasion absolutely demands it. But, apart from that consideration, I do not think that the remedy proposed is as good as it might be for the purpose of overcoming the inconveniences attached to the present system. It appears to me that the Constitution in some respects needs to be made a little more elastic than it is. Undoubtedly the time when elections take place at present is exceedingly inconvenient to large numbers of people who are compelled at that period to devote attention to their own affairs. It is not merely that the duties which necessarily have to be performed by the farming population prevent their going to record their votes. The electors desire to do something more than that. They wish to have an opportunity to &#34;hear the views; of the various candidates, and to educate themselves in the affairs of their country. They cannot have that opportunity when the elections take place at harvest time. That seems to me to be a sufficient reason for the introduction of a measure to permit an alteration of the date to suit the convenience of the people. But under this Bill we are asked to proceed from one arbitrary date to another. It seems to me that it would be very much better to give an elastic power to the Governor-General to enable him to prolong the term of the Parliament for a limited number of months, if an election could not conveniently take place at the ordinary date. </para>

                            <para>- I do not see that there would be great harm in giving the Governor-General such a power. Another defect in the measure is that it assumes that the parliamentary term for the Senate will always expire at a time when an election for the House of Representatives is imminent. We have no right to make such an assumption. It ig possible, under our Constitution, to have a penal dissolution of both Houses. I do not say that it is probable that such a. thing will take place; I hope not. But in. any case, it is inevitable that sooner or later the time for the parliamentary elections for. the two Houses will not be concurrent. Is it justifiable for us to alter the Constitution in this way merely for the sake of the Senate?

                        <para>.- This debate has revealed an extraordinary phase that never for a moment struck me previously; namely, that there is supposed to be a base design on the part of the Government in the introduction of the Bill. . We are led to believe that </para>

                    <para class="block">Ave must not take the Bill on its own merits, but that it is brought in simply for the purpose of making it easier for a certain section to effect future amendments of the Constitution. Personally, I do not think for a moment that that is the intention of the Government. I am prepared to judge the Bill on its merits, recognising, as I do, that every innovation, so far as the Constitution is concerned - every departure from it or amendment of it - must be submitted by separate Bill, and be dealt with on, its merits. I am aware, and we must all be aware, that much as we prize our Constitution, and reluctant as we are to alter it unnecessarily - or to alter it at all, indeed - the fact remains that it must be altered to meet the convenience of the people, and for the purpose of bringing it more into line with the requirements. There is one direction in which an alteration of the Constitution may be necessary, perhaps, at an early date, namely, to enable proper facilities to be given for taking over the States debts. My honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons,</inline> who raised the objection to which I have referred, and regarded it as a serious reason why the Bill should be rejected, will realize that an alteration may become necessary to effect what was originally the design of the Constitution in that respect. I give that as one example only, and I reject the suggestion, so far as I personally am concerned, that the Bill will give any additional facility for the introduction of matters which do not meet with my approval. The most extraordinary suggestion I have heard was one made con.cerning the dignity of the Senate. It&#34; was regarded as most discreditable that we should be engaged in giving to ourselves an additional six months&#39; term. I look upon that merely as incidental to the carrying out of the objects of the Bill. What I specially dra.w attention to, however, is this : that, while it is regarded as necessary to carry out the aim of the Bill to do that, the measure does not come into operation when we alone pass it. It has to be passed bv am absolute majority of another place, which certainly has no selfish or discreditable motives for agreeing to it. In addition to that, the Bill has to be submitted to the electors themselves, and it will be for them to say whether they deem it wise that this &#34;extension of term should be made. |I point out, also, that those honorable senators who are returned at the next election will be elected by the people knowing that they are to be chosen for a term of six years and six months. I therefore think that my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons/</inline> rather overdraws the picture when he represents that the additional six months is to be given for the purposes suggested. My honorable friend went on to say that the Bill might be rendered nugatory bv one of two reasons. First of all. he&#39; said the States themselves might refuse to agree to any particular date that we as a Commonwealth might fix for the elections. But it is idle to suggest that the States are deliberately going to put the electors of Australia - who, whether they be electors for the Commonwealth or the States, are the same people, and have to bear all the burden of the expenditure - to additional expense, and that their anxiety for economy will not be insisted upon in the matter of choosing senators and representatives. I am inclined to think that there will be cooperation on the part of the Commonwealth, and the States for the purpose of securing economy, and that they will make every effort to achieve that object. My honorable friend made another objection to the Bill - that taken bv <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> last week. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> said that the most serious objection to the measure was that it would involve the expenditure of money without the sanction of Parliament. He pointed out that an election might take place in April or June, and that probably Parliament would not be able to meet till July That could take place only once in three years. But suppose that we did not meet till July. The financial year, ending, of course, on the 30th June, the Government would in July actually be incurring expenditure without the vote of Parliament. Certainly the Government could not go on doing so beyond the 1st August. Parliament would have to meet some time in July, in order to vote supplies. If, however, Parliament did not meet until towards the&#39; end of July, the Government would commit the Commonwealth to expenditure for the ordinary services of the year during that month. It is certainly a very wise and prudent principle that we should endeavour to secure that Parliament shall authorize the expenditure of money before it is incurred. But when we remember that the expenditure can only be for the ordinary services for less than a month, I do not think that any very serious consequence can be suffered by the Commonwealth in this connexion. Of course, there is one objection incidental to the present condition, of affairs. That is that a penal dissolution of the House of Representatives might result m different dates being fixed for the elections for the two Houses. That might, of course, occur under existing conditions; but my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons,</inline> went on to say that the full value of this Bill might be altogether lost if that occurred. It might; but as a matter of fact there will be a big effort on the part of the Government to fix upon as convenient a date as possible for the purpose of securing concurrent elections. That is best exemplified bv <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> action taken by the House of Representatives in agreeing even to forfeit part of its own term for the purpose of securing economy in having the elections for the two Houses on the same date. I support the Bill on its merits. Its design and object are good. I believe it has been proposed&#34; with the object of meeting the convenience of the greater number of- the people of the Commonwealth. I do not suggest that the month of March is the most convenient month for every State. &#39; I believe that my honorable friends from Queensland urge objections to it. </para>

It is a reason which justifies Parliament in making this alteration in the Constitution, in order that the fullest representation shall be secured at the elections. </para>

                    <para>The business at Broome at present is being carried on in premises leased from Messrs. Newman, Goldstein, and Co., at a rental of &#163;200 per annum. The present premises are under offer to the Commonwealth for a sum of &#163;1,200. The Collector of Customs, Western Australia, recommends the erection of suitable premises on the vacant land at the south end of the Government goods sheds, as he believes it is possible to erect a more suitable building for the same amount of money, viz.,&#163;1,200. He also points out that some of the blocks on which the present building is erected have sunk into the ground considerably, causing the floor to drop a lot in the centre. There is also a danger, when heavy rain falls, of the ground softening, and with a heavy stock in bond the weight will cause the blocks to sink lower, thus making the building unsafe, and liable to be infested with white ants if the floors drop too near the ground. It is considered that Broome will be the centre of the pearling operations for many years, as it has been ascertained that the grounds extend for 200 miles on either side of that port, also the shopkeepers and others who possess a great interest in the pearling fleet will not readily consent to transfer, seeing they have established their headquarters at Broome. </para>

                    <para>. - The Government have not yet decided on what particular part of the coast this trawler shall be used; but, in any case, the expenditure will be debited, on a population basis, to the whole of the Commonwealth. The trawler is really intended for the purposes of exploration, in order to ascertain whether, and if so where, there are good fishing grounds to be found. </para>

                        <para>- It is to be an aid to private enterprise. The Government do not expect to have a trawling fleet of their own ; but hope to do what has been done with some success in South Africa. At the Cape, the Government purchased a trawler, and as a result of the exploration made, good fishing grounds were found, and now, after the lapse of a few years, there are four or five trawlers at work with profit. </para>

However, apart altogether from whether the trawling will eventually be conducted by the State or by private enterprise, it is a wise step to explore the coast in order to ascertain whether or not there are good fishing grounds. </para>

                        <para>- This vote is a distinct departure. The Government propose to purchase a trawler, and to engage in trawling. If they do not intend to follow the industry, for what do they require the trawler? If by the operations of this trawler any fish are caught, do the Government propose to sell them, or will they throw them overboard again, because the Commonwealth has no power to engage in any industrial enterprise ? Some members of the present Ministry, and some members of the party behind them, are opposed to the State undertaking any industrial enterprise whatever, and yet they have not the slightest compunction in spending the money of the State on a partially socialistic enterprise, not for the benefit of the whole of the people who provide the money, but for the benefit of a few people. </para>

                        <para>- The Government propose to expend Commonwealth money in connexion with this industry, not in order to preserve it for the people of the Commonwealth, but to explore the fishing grounds, and then withdraw and leave them for the benefit of a few private individuals. There is neither reason nor logic in such a proposal. If it is permissible to spend public money in aid of private enterprise for the benefit of a few of the people, it is far more justifiable to spend public money for the benefit of the whole of the people. In fact, any other system is unjustifiable. This sort of mongrel Socialism is enough to make the so-called logic of anti-Socialists stink in the nostrils of intelligent men. I desire a great deal more information on the subject before I shall be prepared to support this vote. I wish to know what representations have been made to the Government, what reports they have had, and what was the motive force inducing them to take this action. </para>

Before I shall be willing to allow the vote to go, I shall have to be taken into the confidence of the Government, and shown what is behind the vote, and the reason whv it appears before us. When we are asked to vote entirely new expenditure of this sort we should be given some reason for the proposal. I am not willing to vote this money to establish an industry in which the whole of the people of the Commonwealth will not be at liberty to share. I shall vote against this particular item unless, Ministers can give some good reason for its appearance in the schedule to this Bill. </para>

                    <para>. - We have not received all the information which should be given before we are asked to vote this sum, of&#163;8,000. I understand from the Minister that the proposed trawler is to be engaged in exploration to discover new fishing grounds, and what fish we have along our coast-line. I should like to know if Ministers have some hope that the canning or preserving pf fish will be undertaken as the result of the operations of the trawler? </para>

                        <para>- I should like to know whether it has been decided where the vessel is to work, and whether the Government have had any reports as to the places along our coast-line most likely to give the best results from an exploration of this character ? Fishing is a very simple industry indeed. We are told that the only machinery required to carry it on is a line &#34; with a bait at one end and a fool at the other.&#34; I should think that the fishermen of Australia must have information as to where fish should be sought for along our coast-line, and I suppose that Ministers have had reports on this subject. I was glad to hear that trawlers have been worked successfully on the coasts of South Africa and ot Canada, and Ministers might be able to obtain information as to the working of the trawlers in those waters which would be applicable to Australian conditions. I think that the vote should be postponed until the Minister is armed with reports from persons able to express an opinion on the subject as to what is likely to be the result of the operations of the trawler in Australian waters. We have a coast-line of some 8,000 miles, and it would take a trawler a very long time to explore Australian waters. I understood that the trawler was to be leased, but we have been informed that it is to be purchased. I believe that &#163;8,000 is the estimate of the cost of a trawler, and its upkeep for a year. If the vessel is to belong to the Government, I suppose its operations will be continued year after year. </para>

I do not think that it is statesmanlike to give a bonus in aid of so simple an industry as that of fishing, which must require a very small amount of capital and labour. It is an industry which private enterprise should be well able to carry on without assistance. </para>

                    <para>. - In common with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> I do not favour the proposed vote of ^8,000 for the purchase of a trawler to aid private enterprise. The Government profess to have been influenced by the example of other countries in this connexion, but they might follow the example in a more concrete way by entering definitely into the business, and making it a Commonwealth concern in the interests of the whole of the citizens of Australia. I believe in the collective ownership of industries, and if the Commonwealth is to purchase a trawler at a cost of &#163;8,000, it should be utilized, not in the interests of private individuals, but in the. interests of the whole of the citizens of the Commonwealth. According to the Minister, the up-keep of the trawler will cost &#163;1,500 a year, but if Parliament refuses to vote the money, what will become of the trawler ? &#34; Do the Government propose to sell it? </para>

If we discover good fishing grounds by the operation of the trawler, the fish in those waters will belong to the people of. the Commonwealth, but, apparently, the moment we make the discovery, the intention is to announce the fact to the world, so that private enterprise may then come along and work the ground, and the Government trawler will move off to other waters. Until we are given full information on the subject, I am not prepared to support the vote. </para>

                    <para>. - We have always been informed that, under the provisions of the Constitution, the Commonwealth cannot undertake any industrial enterprise. This vote is submitted with the idea of exploration, and we are to assume that the men engaged in the fishing industry in Australia for years do not know where or how to catch fish, the best appliances to use, and the nets re- 1 quired to give them the biggest return for the labour they put into the industry. We are told that this proposal will operate in much the same way as a bonus. We are informed that the trawler will explore a portion of the coast, and thus induce people to put money into the industry, and will, in that way, confer a great benefit on the Commonwealth. A bonus is a different thing. The Bounties Bill which&#39; we shall be asked to consider by-and-by provides for the grant of a bounty to those persons who may be able to get a sufficient quantity of fish. I am inclined to vote against the item, because, in my opinion, the question has not been thoroughly considered. I do not believe that it is in consequence of a report from any part of Australia that the item appears on these Estimates. The experience of certain States is quite opposed to any such&#39; attempt being made. Years ago, for instance, New South Wales spent a good many thousand pounds in this direction, but the experiment was an absolute failure. I do not suppose that it yielded a return of is. to the State. </para>

                        <para>- Some years ago thousands of pounds were voted by the New South Wales Parliament to enable <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Frank</inline> F arnell, who was regarded as an expert, to prepare the way for developing a large industry in the waters of that State. I do not remember whether the vote amounted to &#163;8,000 or &#163;10,000, but it was passed to enable <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Farnell</inline> to conduct an experiment, not in seine or drift net fishing, but in trawling, and it was a miserable failure. Queensland has had a similar experience. A few years ago a number of enthusiasts, who believed that it was possible to create a large fishing industry in Moreton Bay and the adjacent waters, formed a company, and collected a sum of money ; nets were made, and the Government were asked for assistance. </para>

                        <para>- It was to be carried out by trawling. To the promoters the Government said, &#34; If you want to try the experiment we will lend you a Government steamer. &#34; Accordingly, the promoters had the loan of a Government steamer, and had the services of the men who possessed the best knowledge of that portion of the Queensland coast. The trawl beam got stuck on a rock, and pulled the vessel up. It had to be taken back, and the trawl turned over before it could be released. They made several attempts. On one or two occasions -they had their net torn to pieces, and the return to the company and the Government was absolutely nothing. According to a speech made by a member of the other House, Tasmania has had a similar experience of trawling. </para>

                        <para>- Whether the trawling is done by steamer or by sailing vessel, what is the difference? As a matter of fact it is only within the last few years that steamers! have been used for that purpose. In my time the hundreds of boats which used to trawl off the English coast were sailing vessels. </para>

                        <para>- That may be; but prior to that time the only use which was made of steam vessels was to collect the fish which the smacks had caught, and take them into market. Is it not reasonable to believe that the fishermen on the Australian coast have tested the grounds, and know the best methods of fishing to adopt ? Is it not reasonable to think that they know the habits of the varieties of fish which they are most likely to get? It is stated that a large quantity of fish go up the east coast of Australia every year. If we had fifty trawlers on the ground we should not catch one of these fish, because the largest proportion of them are mullet, which, of course, could not be caught with a net of that description. At the present time mullet are caught with the seine, and that is the only net I know of by which a man is able to catch such &#39;fish in a large quantity. So far as I can gather, that is the largest sort of migratory fish on the coast of Australia. The Government has supplied no information to the Committee, except that the Government of Cape Colony had bought a trawler, and carried out some experimental work. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford&#39;</inline> did not even state whether the Government had received any reports from persons who have been engaged in the fishing industry, and who are able to indicate that what we want is some assistance to develop the industry. He told us that in Canada the fishing industry yielded so many pounds of fish per head. I do not suppose he could tell us that one-half per cent, of the catch was obtained by trawling. The success achieved is nearly all due to the great cod fish industry, which has been carried on there for, I dare say, 150 years. Not one solitary fish of that description is caught by means of a trawler. If the honorable senator has ever been in that part of the world, he knows very well that the cod fishing is carried on from boats by line; and not by net, off the coast of Newfoundland, Labrador, and other places. If he went to the Mediterranean, which he quoted, would he find any trawling done? I do not believe that he would find a trawler in that ocean. When he was speaking of the fishing industry there he was really referring to the little fish which are caught in very small mesh nets. I know of no places where trawling has been so successful as it has been round the coast of England and Scotland in the different channels Those are the only places where, so far, it has been a success. The Government, I&#39; repeat, have come down without any information, except that Cape Colony has made an experiment in this direction. If they think it necessary ti make this proposal, and the persons who are engaged in the fishing industry are able to supply them with any information on the subject, it ought to be given to the Senate, especially in view of the ghastly failure of the experiments carried out at large expense in Queensland and New South Wales. Ministers must know very well that such experiments have taken place, and have not induced outside persons to put money into the business. The fishing industry is not carried on by trawlers in Victoria, nor, so far as I know, anywhere else in the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- It is not every fisherman who can find &#163;8,000 to get the necessary apparatus for deep-sea fishing. That is a very good reason for concluding that there are no steam trawlers operating on our coast. </para>

But at the same time, to find fault with the Government for going into this new industry because private individuals have not yet gone into and made a success of it&#62; is a very foolish way to look at the matter. So far as I am aware,&#39; the efforts made by the New South Wales Government have not been systematic or more than temporary. </para>

                        <para>- I have been through the reports prepared by the Fisheries Board, of which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Frank</inline> Farnell was president, and find that very little money has been spent, and very few efforts made in the direction of deep-sea fishing. We know all about the fishing in our rivers and lakes and close to our coasts, but nothing has been done to develop our deep-sea fisheries. I should be verv sorry, however, to see the Government go into this matter, and drop it if they find the industry to be successful. Why should the taxpayers of this country be asked to spend &#163;8,000 to experiment in order that private individuals may reap the benefit? Surely the Government has sufficient expensive Departments, without giving up the profitable results which may accrue from the money which we put into these experiments. It is time that the Government began to look out for new sources of revenue. It should not be continually spending money to find sources of income for capitalists. We have heard outcries against Socialism, and are often asked why it is that the Government cannot manage things as well as private individuals. The Government will never be able to understand what it can do so long as it merely paves the way for some one else to reap all the profit from the efforts it makes. It would be foolish for the Commonwealth Government to enter into this enterprise and to drop it as soon as it is likely to become a profitable investment. So far as I can understand, there is a good prospect of the deep-sea industry becoming profitable. I have travelled round a considerable portion of our 8,000 miles of coast line. During the last recess I had an opportunity to go to the north-west coast, the waters of which perhaps present the most favorable fishing opportunities to be found in Australia. I witnessed there a scene which probably could not be matched in any part of the world. I saw at Port Headland shoals of fish playing around the vessel. It was marvellous to think that such a splendid field for exploitation should be left without any one having gone into it in a serious way. </para>

                        <para>- I am satisfied that a great industry could be opened up on the western coasts of Australia if it were undertaken on a Large scale. Something more will need to be done than the mere catching of fish. We shall have to provide some means for preserving them. The fish will be of very little commercial value unless we go in for fish canning and preserving on a large scale, in order that we may put the commodity on the market at a considerable distance from the fishing ground. These are aspects of the case which the Government would be wise to consider. It was shown to me by men on the north-west coast, who are equally as reliable experts as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> in these matters, that the waters there are so favorable, and so full of feed, that there must be splendid deep-sea fishing. Apparently, the Government of Western Australia is of the same opinion, because a Commission is at present inquiring into the subject. The Federal Government will be able, in time, to make use of the results of its inquiries. There has been some amount of experiment by the Western Australian Government in this direction; but the subject has never been gone into systematically. Grounds have been located, but the proper means of catching the fish have not yet been devised. Consequently, we know very little as to whether the industry is worth developing. Personally, I believe that it has a great future before it, and would have the very best prospects possible if it were in the hands of the Government. A valuable illustration of the need for nationalizing the industry is afforded by the fact that individualism has practically ruined the pearl shell fisheries. </para>

                        <para>- I have given some, attention to pearl fishing, and know that it is due to keen competition amongst the fishers that the industry is in the bad way that we understand it to be in now. If the same state of affairs is to be brought about by private companies going into the deep-sea fishing industry, very little satisfaction will result from this proposed expenditure. A very great blunder indeed will be committed if the Commonwealth merely goes into the industry to prospect, and proceeds no further. We are entitled to know that, once Parliament assents to the expenditure of&#163;8, 000 to open up what is practically a new industry, if any profits accrue they will go into the purse from which this money is to be taken. Unless that is done, the results will be really mischievous. Private enterprise in respect of deep-sea fishing has been a miserable failure in Australia. Are we to understand that, after we have proved that there is profitable work to be done, the private enterpriser is to be allowed to pocket the profits? It is no part of the functions of the Government of this country to find means for the private enterpriser to promote his interests at the expense of the ordinary taxpayer. I am satisfied that nine-tenths of the people of Australia would object to anything of the kind, and I hope that the Government will make up its mind that, if the steam trawler isa success, it will make the most of it for the benefit of the country as a whole. On this understanding, I intend to support the proposal. </para>

                    <para>. - When this item was mentioned by the Minister of Defence in introducing this Bill, I felt that the Government were taking a step in the right direction. I have no fault whatever to find with the information presented to us by the Minister in support of the proposal to establish, if possible, a trawling business on the coast. That information may be regarded as being as complete as it was possible to make it. In the first place, the Minister told us of similar enterprises in South Africa, Canada, and England; and I think he told us that almost all Governments in the civilized world had, at one time or other, taken some such step. </para>

                        <para>- A long time before I was a boy. I am now simply repeating the information which was given by the Minister to the Committee ; and more could not be looked for, because, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie has pointed out, it is utterly impossible to get anything like reliable statements from the fishermen on the Australian coast. The disabilities under which those engaged in the fishing industry suffer are such as to render their information almost useless in connexion with a proposal of the kind before us. Under the circumstances, I think the Government have taken a very wise course. The Minister of Defence gave us to understand that the cost of fish in Australia at the present time is something like 66 per cent. higher than in any part of the United Kingdom. </para>

                        <para>- About a quarter of a pound in weight. Where I disagree with the Government is in their having decided to hand the industry over to private enterprise after they have purchased the trawler and prospected the coast line. Immediately the fact is established that trawling is possible and profitable, the Government propose to leave future developments to private enterprise. If the Government feel disposed to be socialistic, why should they not honestly admit the fact? </para>

                        <para>- Quite so. If would be just as well for the Government to honestly admit that they believe Socialism is a growing and a right principle, and that the people generally ought to share whatever benefits may result from the establishment of this industry. Why should the Government declare that they are socialistic until the possibilities and probabilities of, the industry have been ascertained, and then say that they are anti-socialistic? I do not agree with that &#39;attitude on the part pf the; Government, and would much prefer, if we do undertake this trawling business, to go ahead with it. I shall support the item, because I believe that once the industry is proved to be payable the same power that initiated it will be able to continue it - that once the business becomes prosperous it will take a great deal to persuade the people to permit the Government to hand it over to private enterprise. I know that in days gone by many industries have been coddled into success by the Government, and then given oven to private enterprise, which exploits both men and material. I hope that in the trawling business we shall have no such result, but that the industry will be conducted for the benefit of the general taxpayer. As I say I support the item in the belief that once the industry becomes a success the people of Australia will have too much good sense to allow the Government te relinquish it to private enterprise. </para>

We know that in Victoria efforts have been made to ascertain whether there are suitable trawling ground and the right kind of fish for trawling operations. So far as I know, al! these experiments, have been an absolute failure.

                        <para>- I am now speaking of the experiments conducted by the Government of Victoria. Great hopes were held out that profitable fishing grounds would be discovered, and that the result would be the establishment of curing factories, and the foundation of a prosperous industry. However, failure met those efforts, but whether that was due to the nature of the fishing grounds we cannot, of course, say. We know that unless the bottom of the sea is perfectly smooth, it is impossible to trawl, and it may happen, that the right kind of fish are not present. The <inline font-style="italic">Rip,</inline> a. former pilot vessel of Port Philip, was also used in experiments of the kind by the: Victorian Government; but no trawling ground was discovered. </para>

                    SMITH.I am so informed ; I do not know of my own personal knowledge. I believe that every State in Australia has engaged in trawling operations, with the exception of South Australia. When we are asked to vote a large sum of money for such a purpose we are at least entitled to know what efforts in a similar direction have previously been made, what the results of those efforts have been, and if unsuccessful, the reasons for their want of success. We have had no such information given us in the present instance. We are not told where the trawler is to be worked, or whether it is intended that it should work right round the coast of Australia.

It will be of no use to carry out such an experiment in one place, and we know that it would take years to properly explore the waters of Australia&#39;s 8,000 miles of coast line. The Government should certainly tell the Committee on what portion of our littoral they intend to commence trawling operations. </para>

                        <para>- I referred to subsidies already passed. The Eastern States are deriving the benefit of the &#163;400,000 a year spent on the Australian Squadron, and when we asked that the vessels should go round to Albany to become acquainted with the advantages of that strategic base the request was treated with derision. The squadron remains at Sydney during the greater part of the year, but during the Melbourne Cup week the vessels come to Melbourne, and in the fashionable season they go to Hobart. I believe that great wealth is to be derived from our waters, but I am not satisfied that we should endeavour to exploit it by trawling. If the Government could give any reason for believing that this proposal will be a success we could vote the money asked for with some assurance that it would not be absolutely wasted. If this vessel is purchased, and it is shortly afterwards decided not to continue the hobby, what is to become of the trawler ? Have the Government some idea of maintaining the trawler as a yacht for the use of members of the Federal Parliament in imitation of the practice adopted in New South Wales and Victoria? Why should we purchase a vessel df this kind at such a cost when we might charter such a vessel for a year or two at very small expense? It seems to me that other methods might be adopted for exploiting the wealth of our seas. When at Thursday Island, I found that a small silver fish about three inches in length is to be found in myriads swarming around the piles of the pier there, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Saville-Kent,</inline> the expert, has stated that these fish are the true sardine. If that be so, there should be no reason why a very valuable industry in the canning of sardines should not be established at Thursday Island. The Government might put money on the Estimates to encourage the establishment of such industries. It might be better to encourage industries connected with fishing in that way than to tie the Commonwealth down to the purchase of a vessel for trawling at a cost of &#163;8,000, when it is known that trawling operations conducted by the States have so far proved to be unsuccessful. I find that the sum of &#163;9,000 is proposed to be devoted under the Bounties Bill to the encouragement of the fish canning industry. Possibly this is a supplementary proposal. I point out that the provision proposed to be made under the Bounties Bill might be sufficient to induce private enterprise to start trawling to secure a fish supply that would enable the parties concerned to get the &#163;9,000 proposed to be given for the canning of fish. If that be so, it is possible that we might secure the same result with the one expenditure. An important consideration is the kind of fish that can profitably be canned. It seems to me that, with the exception of salmon, herrings, sardines, lobsters- </para>

                        <para>- I do not think there are many fish in Australian waters that will become marketable products if canned. The popular taste is such that certainly many of our fish would be quite unsaleable if canned. In the Canadian rivers salmon swarm in such enormous numbers that they are caught by the ton, and it is very unlikely that we shall be able to establish an industry in the canning of fish in Australia that will be in a position to compete with the canning of salmon in Canada. </para>

                        <para>- There should be great possibilities in that direction. The Government should have made full inquiries into these matters, and if they had done so they might have been in a position to propose the expenditure of money to encourage the establishment of such fishing industries as I have referred to. I do not desire to oppose a vote especially submitted to develop an Australian industry. The attitude I have adopted has been wherever possible to assist investigation, but I think that it is possible that, if the Government had obtained information as to the results of trawling experiments bv the various States, they would not have submitted this vote. If we study the charts of the Australian coast we shall find that on many portions of the coast of </para>

Trawling cannot be carried on over a rocky bottom, because in such a place the nets would be torn to pieces. We know also that trawling can be carried on only over a perfectly smooth bottom, and we have no information as to the portions of the Australian coast at which trawling could be successfully carried on. While I do not say that I shall vote against, the item, I think that the Committee is entitled to ask the Government for some information on these heads. We should be informed of the experience of trawling by every State except, I believe, South Australia. We should also be told whether the Government propose to trawl in various waters round Australia, what kind of vessel they intend to purchase, and how long the investigation is to last. If the Government can give reasons which, would justify us in voting in favour of trawling operations being carried on, I shall be quite prepared to vote for the item. </para>

One honorable senator wishes to know where the idea originated. Where would such a brilliant idea originate except in the brain of a member of the Cabinet? At any rate, the Cabinet has submitted the proposal, and it is for Parliament to express its opinion. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> is also in a very inquisitive frame of mind. He has put quite a number of questions, but I suppose that he &#34;could answer all of them much more to his satisfaction than the Government is likely to be able to do. Then other honorable senators art opposed to the item because the Government is not going the whole socialistic hog, is not going into the industry of trawling on its own, and giving a very wide berth to private enterprise. If the Government owned the lands of the Commonwealth and brought forward a proposal to spend &#163;100,000 in prospecting for minerals, what member of the Senate would oppose it? </para>

                        <para>- I do not believe that any collectivist, who knew exactly what he was doing, would do anything of the kind. We know that this is not a socialistic Parliament. A comparatively small, but I hope growing, section of Parliament is socialistic, but one cannot establish collectivism straight away. What is our best alternative ? To give private enterprise every encouragement we possibly can to develop the resources of this huge Continent. That should be our policy while we remain in a minority. Are we going to adopt a dog-in-the-manger attitude and say that, because we cannot have collectivism we shall have nothing else? Surely honorable senators do not seriously put forward such a proposition. Again, if we owned the lands of the Commonwealth, would we not be justified in sending out prospecting parties to see where good land existed, -to classify the land, to cut tracks, to prepare plans, and to make all arrangements for settlement? </para>

                        <para>- The Government has only control over the waters beyond territorial limits, and it has determined to explore the possibilities of those waters as a probable source of industry, and employment, and wealth for the purposes of the Commonwealth. I think that instead of being criticised adversely the idea is worthy of approbation. Some honorable senators have pointed out that attempts have already been made to establish the industry of trawling, and that every attempt has failed. Is that any argument? We know perfectly well that the food of the first persons who came to New South Wales had to be imported. Although they were surrounded by millions of acres of rich land, yet they could not grow a potato or a bushel of wheat. They could not keep themselves alive, except with imported foods. But because those men failed, therefore, according to the arguments of honorable senators no further attempt ought to have been made. If a thousand trawling experiments had failed I submit that another experiment ought to be made. It is perfectly well known that the coast of Australia is teeming with fish, and that no Australian industry is in such a backward condition as that of fishing. No attempt has ever been made to organize it. It is carried on in a most haphazard fashion. Instead of the people of Australia having fish for breakfast every morning, they get it only now and again as a rare delicacy, and even then at the good will of a fishing ring, composed of Greeks or other foreign people about whom I do not know very much. In these circumstances the Government come forward with a proposal to rescue the fishing industry, and honorable senators are so critical that one would think that it was the most extravagant proposal ever submitted by a Government. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable senator has not a very close connexion with the fishing business he has one of the habits which are usually associated with fishermen - that of exaggerating. In any case, I think that the item ought to be passed. I believe that if the Government is allowed to carry out the experiment some good will result to the fishing industry, and probably employment will be provided for large numbers of men who are now idle, and what is more, the people of Australia may get more fish to eat than they get now. Some honorable senators have threatened to vote against the item if the Government does not give them information. It is not very often that I am satisfied with anything the Government does, but I am quite prepared to take this proposal on trust. </para>

Quite recently <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> expressed a considerable amount of surprise that Ministers had not furnished some information in reply to many requests. Unless we were prepared to take the place of other honorable senators who had caught the Chairman&#39;s eye first, it was absolutely impossible for us to comply with the requests.

                        <para>- Honorable senators are well aware that in first asking the Parliament to exercise other legislative powers the Government necessarily had to ask for a vote before it could proceed to organize a Department. The same kind of argument was offered when we proposed to establish a statistical Department, and it will be offered in connexion with every other power that the Commonwealth proceeds to exercise other than those which it acquired by immediate transfer under the operation of the Constitution. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> has asked wonderingly why it should have occurred to the Cabinet to make provision in the Estimates for a trawling experiment, and he has suggested inferentially that it was prompted by some ulterior motive. Previous speakers suggested that the Cabinet had been moved in this direction by some outside impelling influence which they did not desire members of Parliament to know anything about. To disarm any such suspicions I would mention at the outset that one of the first things which the Cabinet did, when it got into recess, was to appoint a sub-committee to inquire and report upon the question of the practicability of assisting many of the natural industries of Australia. One of the results of the investigation appears in the Bounties Bill, in connexion with which I understand there was circulated amongst members of the other House the report of the sub-committee. No less than three or four pages of that report are devoted to the question of trawling, and the possibilities of furthering the fishing industry of the Commonwealth. Under paragraph xx. of section 51 of the Constitution Act the Parliament has power to legislate with respect to- </para>

                        <para>- We were perfectly well aware, when we came to consider the possibility of encouraging the fishing industry, that the States had taken steps in the same direction heretofore; but we recognised also that the States could only act in a limited way in that regard. Some honorable senators who have spoken on this matter have referred to the 8,000 miles of coast-line that Australia possesses ; and it is only a reasonable assumption that, outside the territorial limits of our 8,00 miles of littoral, there must be ample opportunity for successful trawling. So far as other countries of the world are concerned, the Cabinet made inquiries, and found that the principal countries of Europe, the United States, Canada, South Africa, and New Zealand have all been doing trawling work. So that, practically, Australia is the only country amongst the civilized countries of the world in the first rank that is doing nothing. Is not that a reasonable and impelling, cause for asking Parliament to make some provision to enable us to do something of the same character here? </para>

                    <para>In other words it embraces - he is speaking of the coast of Queensland - two-thirds of the entire marine and fresh water fish fauna of the Australian continent. Out of the foregoing total number, over 300 species may be classified as of more or less value for human food. They present almost unlimited possibilities of profitable employment. The waters abound with shoals of fish akin to the European mackerel, herring, anchovy, and pilchard, which up to the present date have been literally allowed to run to waste. And yet with these indigenous supplies swarming at their doors, Queensland and all the neighbouring Australian colonies import vast stores of canned, smoked, and sailed fish, from the lordly salmon to the lowly sprat, from Europe and America. </para>

                    <para>The barracouta, king fish, and rock cod appear periodically in such vast numbers that frequently the supply is greatly in excess of the local demand. Owing to the absence of proper fish-curing establishments, large quantities have at times been known to be wasted, or merely utilized as manure. It is known also that large shoals of sprats and anchovies appear upon our coasts at regular seasons, but for the reasons already mentioned, and because the fishermen lack the proper appliances in the shape of nets, no attempt hitherto has been made to open up an industry in this particular direction. </para>

In Canada a Cabinet Minister holds the portfolio of Marine and Fisheries, and in 1S92 the money voted for fishery purposes by the Dominion Government was &#163;108,000, while the Department has seven well equipped steamers and two sailing vessels at its disposal for the purpose of carrying on its operations. </para>

Anything that can be done in Australia to promote the fishing industry, and which may be succesful in that direction will also lead to the employment of a large sea-faring population - a circumstance which, I think, will be welcome fo the people of Australia generally. Since consideration was given to what has been done in other countries to which I have already made reference, the work done by New Zealand which is close to our shores, and by South Africa has been brought under the notice of the Government, and I may inform honorable senators of what has been done in South Africa in this regard. It is quite recently that South Africa has done anything in connexion with the matter. As recently as 1897 that country obtained a boat called the <inline font-style="italic">Pieter Faure,</inline> and it is stated in the document from which I quote - </para>

I do not think that the Cape Government was in any better position than the Commonwealth Government is at the present time. They hoped, as we do, that there were supplies of fish on their coasts. This particular boat has demonstrated that fact beyond doubt. Similar results were obtained from investi&#39;gations on various parts of the coast - </para>

                    <para>With regard to the value of the work done for the Colony bv this expedition, I maintain that the favorable conditions for successful trawling that we have proved to exist in Tasman, Golden, Pegasus, Riverton, and Tewaewae Bays is worth to the Colony ten times more than the whole amount expended on the cruise, while the knowledge gained of the nature of the ocean&#39;s bottom and fish life existing round other parts of the coast that were explored, is of considerable value and interest in dealing with our fisheries. The Government can assist the fisheries of the Colony ;n no better way than by carrying the experimental trawling round other parts of the Colony. I would therefore respectfully recommend that experimental trawling be continued round the coast of the North Island, and that a suitable vessel should be chartered sufficiently early to allow her to be fitted out, and the work commenced, by the beginning of January. And also that a scientific expert be appointed to accompany the expedition, so that a biological survey of the areas prospected may be carried out. </para>

Comparing the quality and class of fish that abound in these waters with those in the old country, and taking into consideration the great difference in their present value, I believe that a large and profitable export trade could be established in frozen fish. </para>

                <para>Honorable senators will remember that it was in 1900 the New Zealand Government embarked on this enterprise - and larger vessels, propelled by oil engines, are now coming into use with satisfactory results. Trawling by means of steam vessels is on the increase, and there are now ten such vessels at Napier, one at Gisborne, one at Lyttleton, two at Dunedin, and one at the Bluff. The new vessels brought to Napier during the last few years are larger and! better adapted for trawling than those formerly in use. </para>

We have no reason to believe that we cannot carry out experiments of a similar character with equal success in Australia; on the contrary, we must all be inclined to think that with our enormous coast line of 8,000 miles, we ought to meet with a still greater measure of success. When we remember the varied climates which different portions of Australia enjoy, we can readily understand that not only in quantity, but in variety, the fish outside the territorial limits should rival, if not excel, that found in other parts of the world. </para>

The Government do not think that anything done by the States was sufficient - we do not think that the experiments were of such magnitude as to warrant us in believing that because they were a failure, properly conducted experiments should also be a failure. The sum of &#163;8,000 is based on the consideration of the cost of similar vessels employed in other parts of the world; and the Government believe that with that amount they can conduct investigations similar to those to which I have referred at Cape Colony and in New Zealand. If honorable senators, like honorable members of another place, will grant this sum bv an overwhelming majority, the Cabinet feel hopeful that the application of the money will have results at least as beneficial as the results of similar operations elsewhere. </para>

                    <para>. - For about a couple of hours the Minister treated with silent contempt the requests made by one honorable member after another for information. At last the Honorary Minister has risen in his place, and, after making a considerable show of indignation at my action especially, has given information which is most interesting, and which, if given before the adjournment for dinner, might have put an- end to the discussion. The information which has now been supplied affords ample justification for anything I may have said. </para>

There is no doubt that he was perfectly within his rights in being even severe; but honorable senators, who have been criticised, have an equal right to show the fallacy and sophistry of his position. The honorable senator waxed facetious at other honorable senators because of their thirst for information, but I do not think there is one who has a greater thirst of the kind that he has himself. </para>

                        <para>- Because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> is satisfied to take the vote on trust, he thinks that every honorable senator ought to follow his example. The honorable senator became quite sarcastic because we had ventured to criticise the vote at all ; he evidently thinks that, inasmuch as it meets with his approval, it should meet with the approval of everybody else. On this occasion <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has departed from his usual logical attitude. For instance, the honorable senator contends that because we have control of the waters surrounding Australia we should proceed to act in exactly the same way as we should if we had control of the land. The honorable senator asserted that if we had control of the land we would think nothing of spending &#163;100,000 in exploration ; in fact, the honorable senator will soon rival <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, .and ask us, &#34; What is a million or two?&#34; The honorable senator said that we would be quite willing to expend large sums in prospecting for minerals. That may be ; but it would be exceedingly foolish for the Government to search for minerals, and, having found them, hand them over to private individuals. If I spend money in searching for gold and find it, I reckon that gold is mine; and so with the community as a whole. The members of the party to which I belong desire to initiate new and more equitable economic conditions ; and if we are to be guided bv what has been done bv our political enemies and opponents in the past, there is no justification for our existence in this or any other Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> said that if we owned the land we would have an army of surveyors exploring and classifying the ground. But let me point out that, under such circumstances, we would expect an enormous revenue from that expenditure, just as we should if we owned the mines. Neither instance cited by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> is on all-fours with the present proposition. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> pointed out the great evil, which I have not the slightest hesitation in admitting, that the fishing industry is in a totally disorganized state in </para>

                <para class="block">Australia. But, even if the proposed trawler were successful in opening up new fishing grounds, it would not have the slightest effect in placing the fishing industry on a better basis. It. is when fish are most plentiful that the disorganization is the greatest. It is currently said in Melbourne that when fish are plentiful, either in the Bay or outside the Heads, they are destroyed in order that the dealers may get their own price in the market. </para>

                        <para>- The proper way to develop an industry of this kind is by means of protection! or a subsidy, whichever may be deemed most desirable. Certainly I do not hold with our finding out new fishing grounds and developing the industry, and then allowing private individuals to take advantage of the discovery with their trawlers, while the Government vessel moves on to find other fishing grounds. I am in favour of the imposition of protective duties for the support of any industry which it can be shown has a reasonable prospect of success in Australia. I refer to protective duties that will really protect, and not to such duties as are imposed by the mongrel Tariff we have at the present time. I am in favour also of the granting of subsidies for the establishment of new industries. But I believe that it is entirely wrong for the Commonwealth to expend money to discover a source of wealth, and then hand it over to private enterprise. We have often been told that we should do nothing to interfere with States rights, and I should like to know if we have any assurance that the States will not regard this proposal as an infringement of their rights. I have a word or two to say in reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> who gave the Committee some very interesting information, and quoted authorities which in no way justify the Government proposal. The honorable and learned senator quoted <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. SavilleKent,</inline> one of the most eminent authorities on fisheries that we have ever had in Australia, as to the quantities of fish to be found along the Barrier Reef, on the north eastern coast of Australia. If the Minister knows anything of trawling, he must know that it would be absolutely impossible to trawl anywhere near the Barrier Reef, because the sharp coral of which the bottom is composed would cut the nets to pieces. To insure successful trawling, the operations must be carried on over a fairly even bottom, and preferably over a sandy bottom, such as exists on the Dogger Bank in the North Sea. It is quite impossible to trawl over a sharp rocky bottom, though other methods of fishing in such waters might be adopted successfully. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> also quoted <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Saville-Kent</inline> as to the shoals of fish to be found on the coast of Australia; but trawling would be useless for catching those fish. Trawling is carried on to catch fish that keep close to the bottom, and we know that fish that travel in shoals are usually found close to (he surface of the sea. My chief objection to the vote is that I object to the money of the people of the Commonwealth being spent to assist private enterprise, when I know that every available excuse is put forward to prevent the expenditure of the people&#39;s money for the benefit of the citizens of the Commonwealth as a whole. I know that the Government will scout the idea of engaging in Commonwealth enterprise for the benefit of the whole of the people. Whenever any such proposal has been made the whole force of the Government has been employed to defeat it. </para>

                    <para>- If I vote against this item, as I probably shall, I shall do so for reasons which differ from those expressed by a number of honorable senators. I have the greatest objection to any unnecessary expenditure at the present time, when I think that it is necessary that we should be very careful of the finances of the Commonwealth. I believe that this year the Government expenditure is within &#163;300,000 of our constitutional spending limit, and there are several works which they propose to undertake which will increase our expenditure. Unless some action is taken to restore the financial equilibrium, we shall soon be jammed up against the Braddon section, and will have to consider reductions in expenditure which will be found to be very unsatisfactory and very unwelcome. In the circumstances, I think that we should do what we can, in dealing with these and other Estimates which come before us, to reduce the expenditure proposed where that can be done without a sacrifice of efficiency. This item does not appear to be the outcome of any thought-out scheme. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has given the Committee a very interesting discourse on what has been done in other countries, and concerning what no doubt it would be desirable for us to do by-and-by. It seems to me that the enterprise involved in the particular vote under discussion is not one of urgent necessity at present. We have power over fisheries only outside the three-miles limit, and I assume that fishing outside that limit will not be essentially different from fishing within the limit. I believe that the same appliances as are required for exploring the bottom of the sea within the three-miles limit of the coast will be required to explore the bottom beyond that limit. At the present. time . the States have, and will continue to have, the exclusive right to deal with fisheries within the three-miles limit, and until the Commonwealth Parliament passes laws dealing with that subject, the States laws will apply to the waters outside the three-miles limit. The matter is therefore one which, I think, might very well be left to the States at the present time. If we vote this money for the purpose of an immediate experiment, we shall have power to carry out that experiment outside the three-miles limit, but we will not have power to explore the waters of the coast within the three-miles limit. </para>

                        <para>- That is to say, they might raise no objection to our doing so. But it is probable that the people of the Commonwealth as a whole might object to trawling operations being carried on within the three-miles limit of the coast of any one particular State. It seems to me that the scheme is very imperfect. The question involved is not like that of meteorology or quarantine, one which car.&#39; be very much better dealt with by a central authority than by a number of separate authorities, and when we take into consideration the fact that the States; have now the exclusive power to deal with fishing within the three-miles limit of their coasts, and with fishing outside that limit until the Federal Parliament takes action in the matter, we might very well leave the subject to be dealt with by the States Parliaments, and for the present save the proposed expenditure. Two sets of opinions are being submitted to the Committee, and, whilst I agree entirely with those who consider that it is justifiable for the States to spend money for the purpose of developing or exploring an industry in order that private enterprise may derive benefit from it, I disagree with those honorable senators who have taken up the position that if States money is to be expended at all it must be in the establishment of a Commonwealth industry, to be worked by profit by the Commonwealth Government. That, to my mind, would not be constitutional . I do not think that under the Constitution the Commonwealth Government are entitled to undertake the conduct of any industry except for the supply of Commonwealth wants. </para>

                        <para>- That is a very different matter. I see no reason for giving a vote in favour of the establishment , of a fishing industry to be carried on by the Commonwealth. I wish it to :be understood that in voting against this proposal I am not against the principle involved. I. think it is quite correct that pioneering work for the benefit of the whole community, and not for the benefit of any particular body or individual, should be carried on at the expense of the States. It is justifiable for the States to undertake whatever pioneering work may be necessary for the development of great industries, and I should look upon the proposed expenditure as being justifiable in other circumstances, and at some other time. I hold that at present we have no money to spare for this work, and that as the conduct of fisheries within the three-miles limit off the coast, and until we enact legislation dealing with the subject beyond that limit, ls at present the absolute right of the States, we had better leave the work for the present to the States. </para>

                    <para>. - It seems to me that the proposal is a very desirable one. I dissent from the attitude taken up by the last two speakers. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> pointed out that the proposal was incomplete - maimed,- I think he said - because of the inability to prospect within the three-miles limit, inasmuch as the States might object. When I interjected -that probably some of the States would be verv glad to permit the investigation to be made within their territory if the Commonwealth so desired, he looked upon my suggestion as objectionable, because he thought it would be unjust to other parts of the Commonwealth. But as each State has a considerable stretch of coast line, it is quite possible by mutual consent that an investigation might be made by a Commonwealth vessel of this kind, both within and without the three-miles limit round the entire coast. And if it led to the development of a vigorous fishing industry within Australian waters, it would be an immense advantage to the Australian people. Unfortunately, the Commonwealth is very limited in its power ..o attract persons to engage in industries, as it has no land. We all admit that it would be a great thing for the Commonwealth if its population were very much larger, and this appears to be a direction in which the Commonwealth has power to develop fields of industry which may attract and maintain population. I sympathize entirely with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> in his statement that if this be discovered to be a profitable business, it would be a good thing to have it prosecuted by the Commonwealth in its own interests. I do not agree that there is a constitutional bar to that. I believe it is quite competent for the Commonwealth to undertake fishing or other work in the way of commercial enterprise in its own interests. However, if there be a constitutional difficulty, that seems to be an insufficient reason for not doing what we can within the Constitution. I also agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> that the States have not pursued a wise policy in undertaking all the initial and unprofitable expense in connexion with mining, agriculture, and other industries, and leaving them when profit-making. But it is better to go that far than not to do anything in assisting to develop industries. &#39; This appears to me to be a step in a direction in which my honorable friend desires to go. I agree that it does not go the whole way, but it is a step which would facilitate matters, and which would have to be taken by the Commonwealth in carrying out&#39; the complete undertaking, which both he and I desire. Those who think that the Commonwealth Government should do whatever it can to develop sources of employment, should certainly vote for the item. It .is objected that we are approaching the limit of our spending power, but I think that we are still a long way off the point of danger. It should be remembered that the Commonwealth is undertaking, and I think properly undertaking, many public works out of revenue, and it is because of that policy that we are as near as we are to the limit of our spending power. This trawling experiment is in the nature of a public work, which even some States might carry out with loan money, but which we propose to carry out with revenue. There will be some expenditure for maintenance, which may recur ; but the initial expenditure will not recur, and we shall have &#163;8,000 to spare for some other useful work, I hope in the years that are to come. I strongly urge upon those who are members of a party which claims, and rightly claims, and always aims to secure the best possible means of profitable employment for those who toil to live, that this experiment, if successful, would open up another avenue of employment. </para>

                        <para>- Both ways are good, and this proposal is in a degree in the nature of a bounty. I agree with the honorable senator that if we discover a profitable fishing; ground, it may be necessary to take steps to keep our market absolutely to ourselves, that is to initiate a protectionist Tariff. What I look forward to, first of all, is a better system of fish supply for Australians. It has been very properly pointed out that in the case of each State, the fish supply is not well organized. This expenditure may, probably will, .initiate an organization by the Commonwealth of the fisheries over which it has control, and if there is evolved a fishing industry, I should hope to see regulations - a law, if need be - providing that when fish are plentiful, they shall not be permitted to be turned into manure, to the detriment of those who would be glad to pay a reasonable price for them. </para>

                    <para>. - I propose to divide the Committee on this item, and I trust that it will be struck out. I do not think that the experiment, if made, would be successful. The business of the Committee has been carried on in a very peculiar way. In his second-reading speech, the Minister of Defence gave very little information concerning this item. He merely said that an experiment had been tried in South Africa, and in Canada, and that the value of the fishing industry to certain countries was so and so. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> was right when he urged that we were entitled to get full information, if it was in possession of the Government, before we were asked to vote on the question. For nearly two hours senator after senator rose and asked if there was any information in the possession of the Government which could be given, and it was not until long after the resumption of the sitting that we were able to get certain information from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating.</inline></para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator could have got an opportunity quite easily if he had risen to speak. He started off by saying that there was always an objection to expenditure, and said that the expenditure proposed in the Census and Statistics Bill was criticised on much the same lines as this item. This proposal is essentially different. That Bill provided for the appointment of a Federal officer to do certain work which could be better done by the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth</inline> than it apparently could be done by the States acting separately. But this proposal deals with a subject which has engaged the consideration of a number of the States. Until <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> spoke, I was not aware that Victoria had made an experiment in this direction. Apparently all the States except one have spent a considerable sum, but each experiment has been a failure. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> quoted the evidence of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Saville</inline> Kent in regard to the Queensland coast, That gentleman was employed by the Queensland Government for a number of years in connexion with the pearl-shelling industry. I do not yet know whether the work for which he was paid has been of any particular value to the people of the State, or to those who are engaged in the pearl-shelling industry. </para>

He pointed out that, in all probability, the best way to develop the pearl-shelling industry would be by means of nurseries. I believe that some thousands of pounds have been spent in experimenting as he suggested, but, so f ari, no success has been met with. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> spoke of the fish that are to be found inside the Barrier. Does the honorable senator believe that fish similar to the English herring, pilchard, and mackerel are caught either in Australia or elsewhere by trawling? I have a little knowledge of the way in which those fish are caught, but I have not heard of that being done yet. They are caught by drift or seine net. </para>

                        <para>- The information is dribbling out. Previously, the Minister did not give us a solitary item of information. We have been told about the sums of money spent in Canada and other places, but that has been mostly in connexion with the protection of fisheries. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> pointed out that England has entered into an agreement with the countries on the Continent) and that they are going to spend a large sum. I venture to say that the English Government has never spent a penny in fitting out a ship to trawl, or do any other sort of fishing, but has merely kept its own ships on the coast - as has been done, I suppose for 200 or 300 years - with the object of protecting the fishing industry. There are prescribed limits within which certain nets are not allowed to be used on the English coast, and the British Government has to keep vessels going round the coast to see that the fishing boats do not poach within the limits marked out for them. That is the reason for the expenditure incurred around the coast of Great Britain, and not that the British Government goes in for fitting out ships for certain kinds of fishing work. Nothing of the sort takes place. </para>

                        <para>- They may be. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> when I interjected, said that these steam trawlers carry all sorts of nets. I asked, &#34; Where ?&#34; and he replied, &#34; In the North Sea.&#34; He added that he would give me some information in that regard. I am still waiting for that information. I know something about the work carried on by those vessels, and venture to say that they carry no nets, except for trawling purposes, and that they do not go in for herring fishing at all. Boats for herring fishing are fitted out in an entirely different manner, with different appliances of every description. They go out with the object of catching one kind of fish, and do not attempt the operation of trawling. Trawlers are vessels that go out from Hull, Lowestoft, and other places around the coast of England for perhaps seven or eight weeks at a time, attended upon bv other vessels that pick up the fish from them, and take it away to market. They do not use drift nets, or any other kind of nets. I do not believe in this proposal at all. In my opinion, the men engaged in the fishing industry in places like Melbourne are as well acquainted as any one can be with the habits of the fish that they go out to catch. They know the means by which they can obtain the best results from, the work that they do. It may be suggested that their operations are restricted, because they have not sufficient capital. But there is. a fairly large organization in Melbourne that would put money into this business for experimental purposes if there were a reasonable prospect of success; and if they believed that there were fish to be caught by trawling they would go in for it. A trawler does not catch fish on the top of the sea. The trawl beam is only about 4 feet from the bottom. It rests upon two trawl yards ; and it is only the fish that can go under that beam that the trawlers are able to get into the nets at all. If the people engaged in the fishing industry believed that it was possible to trawl profitably, or that the fish existed, or that the bottom was sufficiently smooth to enable the operation of trawling to be carried on, and that they would get a large return for their money and for the labour that they put into the work, they would undoubtedly go in for it. Many of them have made a life&#39;s study of fishing, and are naturally on the look-out to improve their opportunities. Men who have teen a lifetime in the industry will laugh at this idea of the Government. The experiment has already been tried in Queensland, in spite of the ridicule of those who knew that it would be a failure, but who were proved to be perfectly right. The whole scheme was torn to pieces before the trawlers had gone out more than a mile or two. The experiment will be extremely expensive. It is possible to get to know what the bottom of the sea is like without bringing a trawler into play. It is easy to find out if there is any obstruction in the w7ay by a much simpler method. It is not to be denied that there is a large quantity of fish around the coast of Australia. I have seen far more fish caught in Queensland at one. time than all the towns in the country would be able to consume. It has to be remembered that the up-country towns cannot afford to buy fish! in large quantities. The cost of transit, and of packing in ice to send fish to the back country is very great. As a matter of fact, therefore, a large quantity of fish is not consumed in the interior. It is urged that the fact that we import large quantities of fish shows that there is a necessity for developing the industry. It shows nothing of the kind. Great Britain imports large quantities of fish - in all probability more than we do, although millions of tons of fish are caught in the British seas. Yet </para>

                <para class="block">I have seen the time when fishermen would not attempt to put their boats out when fish were plentiful, because, even if they were successful, there was no market for their commodity. In Queensland, when sea mullet has been in, I have known occasions where there must have been thousands of tons of fish available. Quantities more than sufficient to supply any demand could easily have been caught. But there was not a sufficient market for it. The idea of going out to trawl for mullet, however, is all nonsense. I sincerely hope that the Committee will reject the item under discussion, because I believe that the money will be wasted. </para>

                    <para>. - Had it not been for the criticism of the action of the Government in regard to the purchase of the trawler I should not have spoken again. But I wish to point out that what has been done by the States Governments in this direction has not been anything like complete. That work, however, gives promise &#34;that much more satisfactory results would be achieved if a more thorough experiment were undertaken. That remark is borne out by an official report upon the trawling operations in Western Australia during 1904. I will quote 0111 v a short paragraph to show that there is fair promise of a future for this industry. The report says - </para>

                    <para>Operations were commenced in Geographe Bay in the early part of the year, and although the ocean floor proved suitable for trawling in many places, no fish of any value were captured, owing, I think, to the hungry nature of the bottom, coarse sand and shell, showing very little feed on it. Similar ground to this was met with as far north as Geraldton, when the nature of the ocean floor changed, and better prospects were obtained, and a large extent of splendid trawling ground was discovered between the Abrolhos and the mainland, and although fish were not caught in payable quantities, further prospecting at other seasons of the year might be successful. Being guided by the experiments of South Africa and New Zealand in their trawling experiments, I was anxious to try and find a muddy bottom, which seems conspicuous by its absence along our Southern coast : the nearest approach to it was found in the vicinity of Bernier Island, 40 miles west of Carnarvon. Here we discovered a very large extent of trawling ground with good feed upon it, and where ,1 large quantity of our principal food fishes were caught. </para>

                        <para>- When speaking this afternoon I referred to trawlers being used on the west coast of Scotland. At that time I was not quite sure as to the kind of fish they caught. But this I know perfectly - that the same steamers as are generally referred to as trawlers go in for herring fishing just as they go in for ordinary trawling. Although they go in for net fishing, for instance, they are always referred to as trawlers. In ordinary language these vessels are called steam trawlers; but, as a matter of fact, the trawler is merely the gear, and the steamer could be used for either net or trawl fishing. I might point out that the survey of a great portion of our coast is very incomplete, and the steamer might be made good use of in this connexion. In my opinion the Government are quite justified in making this experiment, and on that ground I support the item. </para>

                    <para>. - I suppose that honorable senators recognise, as I do, the meagre amount of money we are asked to vote in connexion with the Naval Forces. Almost the whole of the expenditure is in connexion with the military; but there is one item, small as it is, of &#163;260 for alterations and additions to existing works and buildings for the Naval Forces. If the Minister has brought himself to recommend such an expenditure on naval defences, I should like to know what is the meaning of the item. </para>

                    <para>. - The matter stands exactly as it did when I took office, and, I think, also when the two, preceding Ministers took office. However, this is no laughing, .matter; because there are great difficulties in the way of obtaining a suitable range for Brisbane and neighbourhood. Honorable senators know that at present a reserve is being used for the purpose, but practically on sufferance. We have been looking out for a range for a long time past, and certain of the military authorities chose a site at Sandgate. This land, however, is in connexion with a Roman Catholic orphanage, and the owners strongly object to any portion of it being used for a range. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; the Marine Board first gave permission, and then they objected to the land being used for the purpose, When I was in Brisbane I went over the site, and came to the conclusion that, if we could find a suitable range anywhere else, we ought not to deprive the Orphanage people of the land, on which they appear to set much value. At the present time a thorough examination, is being made of a site at Woolston, which is situated about half way between Ipswich and Brisbane ; and I have received a report from which it appears that the land is in every way suitable. The trouble, however, is that it is so far from Brisbane that it will cost the men is. 9d. or 2s. for a return ticket. </para>

At present I understand that the people of Brisbane are not willing to permit the extension of their cemetery to the portion of the cemetery reserve which is now being used as a rifle range at Toowong. If the Department can purchase the land they occupy there we shall be able to establish a very good range, which is almost in Brisbane, since it is connected with that city by a tram service. The members of the rifle clubs interested will be only too pleased if we can permanently secure that site for a. range. </para>

                        <para>- It can be made perfectly safe. That will involve only the alteration of a road now made to the top. of Mount Cootha. The Commonwealth Government would, of course, have to meet the expense necessary to alter that road. I have instructed the officers of the Department to make inquiries as to whether it is possible to get the cemetery reserve now occupied into the hands of the Commonwealth for the purposes of a rifle range. If that be found to be possible there will be no further trouble in connexion with th matter. If we cannot secure that land it appears to me that we shall have to establish the range at Woolston, where a large proportion of the land that would be required belongs to the State Government. Although the States Governments make as high a charge as they can for property transferred to the Commonwealth, I think we should get the land at Woolston for something like a reasonable price. </para>

                    <para>. - I am .glad to have heard the Minister&#39;s explanation of this vote, because the matter dealt with has hung fire for two or three years. I am very pleased to know that it is not the intention of the Government to interfere with the land granted many years ago to the Nudgee Orphanage. There are some 800 or 900 children provided for in that institution, some cattle are kept, a little gardening is done, and a considerable area of land is required for the work which is being carried out there. I know that some objection was taken by the military authorities to the Woolston site, but I am inclined to think that the Commonwealth would save money bv securing the land at Woolston. </para>

                        <para>- That is so, but whilst the land at Toowong would probably cost from &#163;10 to <inline font-style="italic">&#163;12</inline> per acre to resume, it should be possible to secure the Woolston land for about &#163;1 per acre. In connexion with the proposal to establish the range at Nudgee, the opinion seems to be that the riflemen desired to combine rifle practice with a visit to the seaside. I am glad that the Minister has decided that, if possible, the Toowong range shall be retained, and in the event of the Department being unable to secure that site, that the Woolston site shall be secured. I think that there is only about a mile in the difference between- the distance from Brisbane to Woolston and from Brisbane to Sandgate. </para>

                        <para>- It would, and it would be more convenient for men travelling from Toowoomba than would a range at, Nudgee. The bulk of the men who comprised the Queensland contingents who went to South Africa were recruited from the farming districts between Brisbane and the foot of the range, and a rifle range established at Woolston would be conveniently situated for men residing in those districts. I believe that the States Governments should be interested in defence matters as well as the Federal authorities, and they should be prepared to stretch a point, if necessary, to give facilities to men. desiring to attend rifle ranges to render them a.s efficient as possible. I repeat that I am very glad that it is not the intention of the Department to take any land from the institution established at Nudgee. </para>

I know that if the range was so much in need of attention as Major-General Finn reports, and if .the matter had not already been dealt with, I should have been asked by the Commandant of the State to put a sum on the Estimates for the purpose. I think that all necessary improvements to the range in question must have been attended to. </para>

Will he instruct the local military authorities to inquire whether, by shifting the butts a little more to the south, it would not be safe for us to continue the road to Mount Nelson? The road, if finished, would be one of the most magnificent roads in the world, I believe, but the work cannot be proceeded with because the bullets from the soldiers&#39; rifles would whistle about the heads of the workmen. My idea is to move the butts a little more to the left, in order to make it safe to continue the road. </para>

                    <para>. - No doubt the Minister was impressed by some recent remarks of the Inspector-General with reference to the desirability of having moving targets. Perhaps the Minister has that in contemplation; but throughout the Bill I cannot find any appropriation for that purpose, whether for Tasmania or any other State. I therefore ask him if he intends to pay serious attention to the very strong recommendation which was made by Major-General Finn, or if an appropriation for that purpose will be made in another Bill? </para>

                        <para>- Again, in the case of Victoria, a sum of &#163;13,197 was not spent, and we are asked to pass new votes to the extent of &#163;11,059. My experience of estimates for public works has been that the officers, whether road inspectors or otherwise, put down a number of items which they are informed are wanted ; the Minister goes through the items, and cuts them down, knowing that economy is essential, and then in Cabinet they are cut down again. It appears to me that in the case of the Federal estimates for public works everything&#34; which has been mentioned or suggestion is put down, and that every year we vote thousands of pounds which cannot possibly be expended within the year. In my opinion that system is likely to lead to carelessness and extravagance, and to create in the minds of our citizens the impression that they have only to ask the Government for a post-office or a rifle range when it will be granted. We ought not to vote a large sum if only about one-half of it can be spent within the year. </para>

                    <para>. - It is not a question of voting a large sum, and of being able to spend only one-half of it within the year. We do not know whether we shall be able to expend the whole of the vote; we do not know what trouble may arise in connexion with contracts. I have an explanation of all the items to which the honorable senator has referred as representing re-votes. I find that all the works on the 30th June last were unfinished, and are in progress at the present time. There is still a large sum to be paid in respect of them. This position of affairs arises wherever responsible Government prevails and Estimates have to be passed. A Minister has to provide for certain works, but cannot say when preparing his Estimates whether he will be able to expend within the financial year the whole amount for which he asks. In many instances he cannot do so. The whole thing, however, balances itself. On the one side of the ledger the Minister has a statement of the works authorized, but not completed, and on the other side he has some excesses of votes set out. In South Australia the excesses of votes were generally equal to the unexpended balances. We used to bring them forward, and the unexpended balances required to be re-voted. That is the position here. I am advised, for instance, that the post office at Bangalow has been authorized and a contract will be let shortly, that the work of constructing the Kurri Kurri post office - a brick building - has also been authorized, and the contract is in progress, whilst the Mosman post office is almost completed. </para>

The position is one that is gradually assuming a business importance, being a few steps west of Chapel-street, and nearly opposite the Melbourne entrance to the Windsor railway station. The question of effecting alterations and additions to the present premises was considered, and it was decided that there would not be sufficient accommodation to provide for the extension of the switch board. Another phase of the question was the terms with the Railway Department, and the land required would need to be leased for thirty years, after which the buildings would revert to the Railway Department : notice to quit might be served at any time after the expiry of the before-mentioned period. It was considered undesirable to provide for the switch board extension in the present building, as it was deemed necessary to provide sufficient accommodation to meet future expansion, in addition to present need. </para>

We now find that &#163;3,609 is to be expended in constructing a post office at Cairns.* </para>

                        <para>- I have been (o Cairns, and unless its population has increased at a most remarkable rate since I visited it some time ago it will have in proportion to its size the most palatial post office in the Commonwealth. I ask the Minister to explain, if he can, why such an enormous sum - a sum which, he will agree is quite out of proportion to the amounts usually voted for postal buildings - is to be spent upon this structure. Apparently the original vote was &#163;2,499. </para>

                    <para>. - If the honorable senator turns to last year&#39;s Estimates he will find a footnote showing that the &#163;2,499 to which he refers represented only a portion of the amount required. I do not agree with his view as to the postal requirements of Cairns. I visited the town not long ago. I then looked at the proposed site, saw the work being done at the post office, noticed the overcrowded condition of the present building, and, having examined the plans, arrived at the conclusion that the increased accommodation proposed would only be slightly in excess of actual requirements. I considered that we ought to spend a larger sum, and suggested that the vote should be &#163;5,000. The honorable senator has not even a remote idea of the great increase of the work at the post office in Cairns. It is a station from which mails are distributed to various parts of the State, and, having carefully considered the whole question, I wrote a minute recommending my colleague, the Minister of Home Affairs, to so increase the proposed vote as to enable accommodation to be provided in excess of that shown in the plans then prepared. I strongly urged upon him the necessity of doing this if the requirements of the future were to be considered. He pointed out that the building was so constructed that additions could be made to it. without considerable expense, and that before enlarging it further it would be better to wait until the demand for space again overtook the accommodation. Cairns is a growing township, and the amount of work done at the post-office there is exceedingly large. Personally, I should like to see &#163;5,000 spent on the new post-office. </para>

                    <para>. - What <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> does not know about Cairns and its requirements would fill a large library, and the task of supplying his deficiencies would be so colossal that I do not propose to undertake it at this hour of the evening. In my opinion, the proposed new post-office will not be adequate for the work to be transacted there. The plans have already had to be altered in order to provide for a larger number of private letter-boxes, there being now over 200 of these rented. The Cairns post-office is one of the most important distributing offices in Queensland, mail matter being made up there for a large area of country inland and as far as the Gulf and Burketown. There is a fair-sized mail room, but it is totally inadequate for the work which has to be done there. </para>

                        <para>- It was built twenty-two or twenty-three years ago, since which time a number of gunyahs and lean-to&#39;s have been added, making it a conglomerate structure, without any definite character. The Department propose to replace it with a one-storied building, shifting to the rear a structure which was erected twenty-three years ago, to be used there as the residence of the postmaster. That, in my opinion, is a mistake. A new two-storied building should have been erected, to provide quarters for the postmaster in the upper story. There is not a village or township in Tasmania with half the population of Cairns which does not possess a better and more expensive post-office, and there are places in Queensland with a population one-half or one-third that of Cairns which are better off. Stanthorpe, for instance, has a post-office which cost the State Government &#163;7 ,500, and its population is only one-third that of Cairns. Then in Victoria there are places with a population only one-fourth that of Cairns, possessing post-offices on which more money has been spent. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> has not objected to other post-offices. </para>

                        <para>- The white population of Cairns is about 5,000, and there are over 20,000 white persons in the district When the coloured labour there now has been deported, the white population will increase rapidly. The mining districts at the back of Cairns which are served by this post-office are increasing in population enormously, and within the next ten years the accommodation will have to be doubled to make it adequate. </para>

At Princess Royal there has been trouble in connexion with the site, and &#163;267 is a revote to pay for sites the purchase of which has already been authorized. </para>
