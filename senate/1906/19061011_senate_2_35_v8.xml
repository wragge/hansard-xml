            <para>- I desire to ask the Minister of Defence, without notice, whether he is prepared to offer, not to me, but to the Senate, an explanation relative to the publication of certain correspondence? On Tuesday, with his consent and unanimously, a motion was carried to the effect that the correspondence relative to appointments to the High Court Bench -should be laid upon the table of the Senate. No such return has been tabled here ; but this morning we find that the correspondence is given, apparently in full, in the daily newspapers, and also that yesterday it was laid upon the table in another place without any motion having been moved. I ask the Minister to explain why he is treating the Senate in what I venture to say is a contemptuous way. </para>

                        <para>- I have some information on the point. A return was moved for by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> and at the request of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator' Millen</inline> it was agreed that we should obtain further information if we possibly could. It could only be obtained from the States with whom the Prime Minister communicated. The Premier of Victoria replied that there was no return available from which the information asked for could be compiled ; that the valuation of land under the Land Tax Act was based upon its sheep-carrying capacity, and that neither the capital value nor the unimproved value was taken into consideration. The Premier of South Australia, replied that the cost of compiling the particulars would be from <inline font-style="italic">£500</inline> to £600, but that if particulars respecting the areas of separate holdings should not be wanted, the cost could be reduced to about ^200, and he inquired whether the Commonwealth would incur the expenditure. The Premier of Tasmania said he regretted that the information desired could not at present be obtained. The Premier of New South Wales replied that the staff of the Commissioners of Taxation would be unable to commence the preparation of the return until after the 17th </para>

                    <para class="block">October. The Premier of Western Australia asked to be advised of the meaning, of the term "private-owned lands." He desired to know whether it was intended to refer to land held in fee simple only, or to include land held under the "conditional purchase " provisions of the State. He pointed out that should the information be required, special expenditure would have to be incurred, and inquired whether the Commonwealth would reimburse the State for the outlay. The Premier of Queensland merely acknowledged the Prime Minister's circular of the 26th July. The Commonwealth Statistician was also asked whether he could furnish any additional information on this matter, but he was unable to do so. It will be seen, from the replies, that in some cases the Commonwealth may get the additional information if it is prepared to incur such expenditure, but that in other cases it is not available. </para>

                            <para>- Judging from the answers which the Minister of Defence has read, the difficulty appears to be in regard to the unimproved value of the land. I desire to ask whether he will consult the officers whose duty it would be to prepare the return, and see if he can get any portion of the information sought. Particulars as to the number and size of the holdings, irrespective of their value, would be of advantage. The honorable senator might be able to get some portion of the information sought without incurring any expense. </para>

                        <para>- I desire to ask the Minister of Defence, without notice, another question with regard to information which honorable senators have sought to obtain from the Ministry. Yesterday he agreed that the report of the Public Service Commissioner should be circulated amongst the members of the Senate. It is hoped by him, I suppose, and certainly by us, that this will practically be the last day of the session, and that it will mostly be devoted to the consideration of the Appropriation Bill in Committee. I again ask the Minister why it is that, up to this hour, no member of the Senate has received a copy of this report, and whether he can explain why it has not been circulated ? </para>

                <para class="block">On previous occasions I have explained the reason why I have sought to make this reduction. It is not on account of any personal feeling towards the senator who has occupied the Chair very efficiently during the last five or six years, but because I believe that the salary is too high. I find that while the salary of a senator in the United States is $5,000, equivalent to £1,000, the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives each receives a salary of $8,000, equivalent to £1,600, or about £100 more than is paid to the President of our Senate. If our President were paid in the same proportion as the President of the American Senate, instead of getting , £1,100 as President, and £400 as senator, he would be paid about £650 in all. In Canada the payments are very much smaller than is the case here. The Speaker of the Senate gets a salary of about £300 a year, together with an allowance of £300 a year as senator, and it is the same with the Speaker of the House of Commons. If my proposal were adopted, the total payment to the President of our Senate would be £1,000. That </para>

                    <para>. - I am one of those who think that the President of the Senate should, at any rate, be paid as high a salary as is paid to the Speaker of the House of Representatives. I should have to enter my objection to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart's</inline> motion on that ground, if there were no other. Throughout Australia the Presidents of the Legislative Councils are looked upon as gentlemen holding such high positions that they should be able to maintain them properly out of their official incomes. We have nothing to do with the President's private means. It would be very' invidious if the  President  of the Senate were not paid as liberal a salary as is received by the  President  of any other House of Legislature in Australia. We can very well afford to pay such a salary as will enable our  President  to maintain his official dignity in comparison with the occupant of any other position with which his can be compared. It must be remembered that in Great Britain the occupant of a corresponding office receives a salary of £5,000 a year. </para>

                    <para>. - I quite recognise that the matter raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> is one about which there can be considerable difference of opinion ; but we must all recognise that the honorable senator has raised the point at an opportune moment. He has' raised it under circumstances that are within our knowledge. We have had a public intimation from the present occupant of the office of President that be does not intend to seek re-election to this Parliament. We are therefore in the fortunate position that we can debate the matter without the slightest reference to personal circumstances. I am glad that we all recognise that. The personal note need not be introduced into the debate. The argument has been used that in order to main tain the dignity of the Chair it is necessary to attach a high salary to it. I venture to say that that is not entirely true. I do not accept the statement that we enhance the dignity of the Chair merely by attaching a large monetary consideration to the occupant of it. It may also be argued that the position of President of the Senate is one of very great importance, and that it is open to the whole of Australia as a high and important post. I venture to say that that argument is very fallacious. The range of choice is, as we all know, limited to the thirty-six senators who will be in this chamber when Parliament meets at the commencement of next session. I do not believe that it is necessary, in order to choose a fit and proper occupant of the Chair out of those thirty-six senators, to regard the selection as being made from all Australia. Nor do I regard the occupant of the Chair as having to discharge any particularly onerous duties apart from those discharged by any other senator. I do not wish to enter into particulars as to what the duties of the President of the Senate are, but I venture to say that he has to discharge no more onerous duties than those discharged by the occupant of the chair in which you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> are now sitting. Indeed, if we had to determine which of the two presiding officers had the harder work to do, I fancy that most of us would say the  Chairman  of Committees - that is to say, if the question were one of personal hardship. With regard to another question that has been raised, I venture to submit that the Senate will be setting a salutary example to Australian Parliaments generally if it agrees to make a reduction in the salary of its  President.  A salary of <inline font-style="italic">£1,000</inline> a year is, in my opinion, quite sufficient. I venture to hope that the Senate will give the motion very serious consideration, and that, remembering the circumstance that the present opportunity is one when the question can be determined apart from personal considerations, it will not be influenced by the erroneous impression that the dignity of the office will be enhanced simply by attaching a high salary to it. If the Senate were meeting for the first time, composed of thirty-six senators, who had by some means acquired a full knowledge of what the duties of the President were, does it seem likely that we should decide to allot to the occupant of the chair a larger total salary than ^1,000 a year? I venture to say that if the question were put before the Senate in that form, not surrounded by personal considerations, there would be no doubt as to what the decision would be. I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart's</inline> motion will not only be pressed, but will be carried. </para>

                    <para>. - Honorable senators always recognise when a matter of this kind comes before us that it is an extremely delicate one to discuss. Whether we like it or not, there is always the feeling that the personal element is mixed up with the question. But it is fortunate that at the present time, owing to the fact that the gentleman who at present holds the office of President does not intend" to seek reelection, we can discuss the matter with the greatest freedom. I do not think that it is the duty of this Parliament to continue setting the example of paying high salaries to its officers. The amount to which it is proposed to reduce the present salary is a reasonable one. It will still leave it at a. very handsome figure. It is time we began to set an example to the States Parliaments in this direction. It must have been realized bv many senators on many occasions that not only in connexion with Parliaments, but in other departments of government, there is in Australia too much dignity to maintain. When we desire that any State Parliament or public department shall do any little bit of business for us that we believe it is well qualified to do, we are met with questions of dignity at every turn. It is time that we set an example; and if we, as the highest House of Legislature i'n Australia, determined to do what is proposed, we shall virtually compel the States Legislatures to be more economical in regard to equivalent offices. If we can achieve that purpose we shall have done very good work. It must be admitted, if we compare the allowances paid to some Speakers and Presidents connected with Legislatures in Australia with the payments made in this Parliament, our salaries are not extravagant; but, at the same time, I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> that the amount of money that we pay in connexion with a certain office does not add anything to its dignity. If we were to consider that view of the matter, what would have to be said of the  President  of the United States? </para>

                        <para>- I admit that the comparison is not perfect, but I quote that instance to show that the amount of money attached to an office certainly does not add to its dignity. I am quite sure that no amount of money that might be paid to the President qf the United States would add greater dignity and honour to the office. Perhaps there is no man in the world whose words carry more weight than do those of the President of the United States. Nevertheless, he is paid the comparatively modest sum of £10,000 per annum. Looked at in that light, we should all realize that we shall not deprive the office of President of the Senate of any dignity by reducing the salary as proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart.</inline></para>

                    <para>.- It may sound very well to move a reduction of £500 in a salary of this kind, and probably another place would agree to the proposal. I feel certain, however, that if the Senate were to request that a reduction be made in the Speaker's salary, our interference would be resented. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> is taking a wrong view of the situation. If the President were a senator from Western Australia, South Australia, or a remote part of Queensland, he would have to separate himself from his family, and undertake an immense amount of travelling. </para>

I am not in favour of high salaries ; but surely we ought to recognise the demands of a position of this kind ; and I hope the Senate will not make the reduction proposed. The salary of the President is fairly well on a par with the salaries paid to Presidents of Legislative Councils, and, of course, the President of the Senate, living as he does away from his own State, has greater demands made upon him. </para>

                        <para>- We can on.lv make requests; and if we sent down a proposal that the salaries of the two officers should be reduced, the House of Representatives might acquiesce in regard to the President, but refuse in the case of the Speaker. The President would then be placed in a position of inferiority, not only in this Parliament but in the Parliaments of Australia. The position of President is not overpaid; and it is one of great honour to which honorable senators may aspire as time goes on. An immense amount of personal sacrifice is involved, as honorable senators recognise when we have been sitting all night, and the President has to remain within the precincts of the chamber. At such times the temper of senators is perhaps ruffled ; and the President or Speaker may be called upon at any moment to interpret the Standing Orders. The position is one of great dignity and honour ; and I hope the Committee will not support the request. </para>

                    <para>. - As £ have already said, the allowance has nothing to do with the enhancing of the dignity of the position of the President. But comparisons have been made; and I venture to suggest a further comparison between the amount allotted to the President and the amount which, rightly or wrongly, is allotted to each Minister. It has been alleged that the President has a great deal to do; but it must be admitted that when Parliament is out of session there is no call whatever upon him. On the other hand, a Minister, if he discharges his duties fairly, is never idle from January to December; and when Parliament is in session he has not only to attend to his administrative work, but also to discharge his duties in the House. Let us compare the position occupied bv <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> with the position of <inline font-weight="bold">President. Senator Playford</inline> is in charge of a large Department, the administration of which 5s intricate and difficult ; and during the last month or so he has had to devote almost every moment of his waking time to affairs in the Senate, in addition to attending to the duties of his Department. If a comparison of the work be asked for, I need go no further. I venture to say that for every hour's work done by the President during the last month or six weeks, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> has had to do ten hours, and he has had, in addition, all the care and responsibility of the Department on his shoulders. Indeed, there is no comparison between the work of the  President  and the work of any Minister administering a Department ; whereas the difference in the remuneration given to the two officers is very little. The salary of the  President  is almost as much as that given to a portfolioed Minister : and I dare say that by the time a Minister has met all charges there is very little difference between the allowances. The idea should not be entertained for a moment that a large salary adds dignity to the occupant of any particular office. </para>

My- complaint has never been thai the President is too highly paid. My experience during the present session satisfies me that the President is not paid one penn\ more than he honestly deserves. I may further say that ever since I became a member of this Chamber my complaint has been that honorable senators are paid a salary which is altogether too small. I should like to see the salary of honorable senators raised to at least ^600 a year. I am very anxious that that increase should take place; and I am not going to be a party to a reduction of any of the salaries in this Appropriation Bill. I did vote for the reduction of a salary twelve months ago, but that only meant a reduction to ^750, which I considered a very ample allowance. </para>

                        <para>-Col. GOULD (New South Wales) [11.47]. - There is nothing new in the suggestion that the salary of the President should be less than that which he has hitherto received. Honorable senators will recollect that, when the first Estimates submitted to the Federal Parliament came before us, we found that provision had been made for the salaries of the President and other officers of the Senate on a lower scale than those voted for officers holding corresponding positions in the House of Representatives. It was recognised that the intention was to place the Senate in a subordinate position, since if our officers were paid lower salaries than those of the House of Representatives their status would be reduced. At that time the matter was fully debated, and the Senate determined that the salaries of its officers should be the same as those paid to corresponding officers of the House of Representatives. If we were now to reduce the salary of the President, honorable members in another place would be quite willing to give their assent, because they would naturally say that we had a right to control our own officers, and to say what salaries they should be paid. But if, having reduced the salary of the President bv £500 a year, we were also to reduce the salary of the Speaker by the same amount, our action would be received with a storm of indignation in another place, and we should be told that the House of Representatives could not allow us to interfere with the salaries of their officers. The Clerk of the House of Representatives receives a salary of £900 a year, and the Clerk of Parliaments, the Senate's officer, receives a similar salary. It might be said that the President has not as much work to do as the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and that a man of equal knowledge, experience, and ability is not required for the work. In the same way it might be contended that it is not necessary that the Clerk of Parliaments should be a man of the same standing and parliamentary experience as the Clerk of the House of Representatives. We know, however, that that is not the case,_ and I should be inclined to oppose any reduction of the salaries of the officers of the Senate unless an equivalent reduction were made in the salaries of the officers of the House of Representatives. </para>

                        <para>.- If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> could give an assurance that, if we made the reduction he has moved, the House of Representatives would follow suit in dealing with its officers his case would be half won. Difficult questions of interpretation and parliamentary procedure are as likely to arise in the Senate as in the House of Representatives. It is necessary that we should have in the position of President a man who will devote his time and attention to making himself fully acquainted with the various questions of order and procedure which are likely to arise from time to time. He must do so if he is to give such rulings as will guide us in the conduct of our business and protect our rights and privileges. We should pay such an officer a salary commensurate with his work. It would be a very great mistake to belittle our officers by reducing their salaries. A comparison has been made of the salaries paid to a Minister of the Crown and to the President, but whilst I admit that a Minister of the Crown has to incur many expenses which reduce his salary, the President of the Senate has also to meet certain expenses. The gentleman appointed to the position of President of the Senate must possess parliamentary experience and aptitude for the work, and as he is obliged to give up his business or profession, he should be remunerated in a reasonable way. I am strongly of the opinion that, in the salaries paid to our officers, we should see that a position is maintained for them equal in every way to that of corresponding officers of the House of Representatives. </para>

I have travelled Australia from one end to the other, and I have never heard any grumbling or discontent with respect to the allowances paid to the officers of the Senate or of the House of Representatives. It will be time enough for us to do what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> proposes when there is an outcry on the part of the people for such reductions. The officers of the Senate have carried out their duties faithfully and efficiently, and have given every satisfaction, and, so far as I know, no one has ever grumbled at the remuneration they have hitherto received. These chronic requests for interference with their allowances ought to come to an end some, day, because they raise such uncertainties in the minds of men eligible for these positions that they are unable to decide whether it is advisable to accept them or not. </para>

                    <para>.- There is only one way in which we can maintain the dignity of the Senate, and that is by seeing that our work is efficiently done; and our business is conducted with decorum. I have preached economy for some time, and am determined to continue to do so. I shall not shrink from the application of my principles, and I shall therefore vote for the request. I do not agree with the argument that we should consider what honorable members in another place are likely to do. If we carry the proposed request, I presume that we shall also reduce the salary of the Speaker in the same way. I decline to agree with the contention that one House has nothing to do with the salaries paid in the other. It is not our money, but the money of the taxpayers, that we are voting, and we have no business to wink at extravagant salaries in either House. </para>

                        <para>- I wonder what will happen to a gentleman who gets £1,500 a year when Socialism has arrived. He will probably be obliged to put half of it into the socialistic pool. When I entered politics first I was astonished at the high salaries paid to legislators, and never could see any reason for it. Thirty-six of us meet here during the session; we have to give up our homes and our business to a great extent, and we are content with the dignity of the office and a salary of £400 a year. We appoint one of out number to preside over us, because we consider him a man of considerable parliamentary experience and ability, and if we give him 50 per cent. more than double the salary we receive he will be well paid. If the President receives £1,000 a year for five or six months work he will be sufficiently paid. We are told that the gentleman occupying the position is expected to give dinners, suppers, and lunches, but we should not expect that of the occupant of this office, and we should not pay him a salary out of the taxpayers' money for the express purpose of enabling him to do that kind of thing. I shall vote for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart's</inline> request, and if that be not carried, I should be prepared to vote for a reduction in the salary of  £300.  If we carry the requested amendment the House of Representatives may be willing to agree that the salary of the  Speaker  be reduced in the sameway. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> asks whether the President must not give money away in charity. It is probable that he does, but are we going to vote him a sum. of money every year so that he may spend a portion of it in charity ? If that is the case we ought to state definitely in the vote that so much is intended for charity, and so much for services. </para>

                        <para>- Every senator must leave his own State unless he happens to live in Victoria, and neglect either his own business or that of the Senate. The President, therefore, is in exactly the same position as any other member of the Senate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> has said that other senators can get a pair. The  President  must attend more regularly than other senators. He cannot leave the chair to avoid listening to a drone. He must sit there all the time, but he gets a salary of £1,100 for doing that. I do not propose to ask him to do additional work for nothing. I propose that he shall 'be paid a salary of £600, in addition to his allowance of £400 as a senator, because he cannot come and go as he pleases. As he must occupy the chair during the greater part of the sitting, his freedom is to a certain extent limited ; but an additional payment of £600 ought to be quite sufficient for any extra services which he may render in that way. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> has pointed out that if we reduced the salary of the President we must also reduce the salary of the Speaker of the House of Representatives, </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; I think that there is a large number of cases in which a reduction of the salary is absolutely necessary and quite justifiable. While we pay those salaries we may fairly be accused of extravagance by the people. Some senators say that if we reduce the salary of the President we must also attack the salary of the Speaker, and that, if we do, the other House will resent our attack, and say that we have no business to make a request with regard to its presiding officer. The whole position resolves itself into this, that, because we cannot get the Houses to act unitedly or at once, then neither House will make a move, and we shall be continually saddled with huge and unjustifiable salaries. </para>

                        <para>- The Commonwealth is in that blessed position that it will always have a surplus. It is only a State which may have a deficit. In many cases a private senator has to do more work than the President. For instance, the latter does not take any part in the general business of the Senate. He does not keep himself abreast of the business which is brought forward, but simply sits in the chair and maintains order, and takes no part in the debate. </para>

In any case, we are not proposing to ask any senator to fill the position for nothing, but are offering a salary of £600, in addition to the senatorial allowance of £400. I ask honorable senators seriously to consider whether£1,500 a year is not an unjustifiable payment for a position such as the President occupies? In any case, I trust that they will support my request, and thereby show the States a good example in economy. </para>

                        <para>- I shall deal with the question of this officer acting as Secretary of the Joint House Committee. I desire to make no reflection on the officer, but I hold that the Parliament made a great mistake - and I believe that every member of the House Committee will indorse my statement - when it asked him to look after the catering here, and made him an allowance of £50. It is a ridiculous thing to expect a man who discharges the duties of Usher of the Black Rod and Clerk of Select Committees to be thoroughly up in the business of catering. I am not going to blame him because matters in connexion' with the refreshment rooms are not carried on satisfactorily. I blame the Parliament for asking such a man to do the work. As we all know, or ought to know, the conditions with regard to the refreshment rooms are not satisfactory, and I venture to suggest that we ought to intrust the steward with the catering and the management of the refreshment rooms, and ought no longer to ask the Usher of the Black Rod to do work which obviously he cannot do, and which we ought not to expect him to do. We ought . to promote the steward -I do not. know him personally to a better position. </para>

                        <para>- It is worth while With regard to the Appropriation Bill, I have always been told that it is not worth our while to attempt to effect any improvements. Some senators immediately says " Leave it alone, let. it go." It is that attitude towards Appropriation Bills which I resent. I am perfectly certain that, if there be any member of the Senate who has given the subject consideration, or has read the' reports of the House Committee, he will agree with me that, if we want to put the refreshment rooms on. a better footing, we ought to intrust the duty of managing them to some one else ; not that. I wish to make any reflection upon the officer who is at present in control, but that he is asked to do work which it is perfectly absurd to expect him to do.

The salary of the officer in question is£550, in addition to which he ispaid£50 as controller of the refreshmentrooms.If the salary be reduced by £50, and the allowance made as controller of the refreshment rooms be transferred to another officer, the result will be that the total payment to the Usher of the 'Black Rod will be reduced by £100, making his salary £500. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir RICHARD</inline>BAKER (South Australia) [12.20]. - As chairman of the Joint House Committee, I should like to call the attention of honorable senators to some facts. The officer who manages the refreshment department has control of a good deal of money. We ought to have a responsible person in that position. In the next place, he has not only managed our refreshment department during the five and a-half or six years that this Parliament has been in existence, but he managed the refreshment department of the Parliament of .Victoria for a. considerable time before the Common wealth was inaugurated. Therefore he has had a good deal of experience. I am not prepared to deny that the department does not work satisfactorily. Indeed. I know of no refreshment department of any Parliament that does work satisfactorily. In connexion with all the Parliaments in Australia there is a considerable expenditure above the income of the refreshment department. In some States the difference between the expenditure and the income is far greater than is the case in this Parliament. In New South, Wales. I believe - speaking without book - the expenditure comes to something like £2,000. </para>

                        <para>. - I suggested in an interjection that it would probably be better to deal with the control of the refreshment-rooms when discussing the vote for that branch. I am still of that opinion. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> that we should pay an officer something for undertaking the responsibility of looking after the moneys and the books connected with the management of the refreshment department. But I also think that the steward who is responsible for the choice and purchase of foods, the breaking down of spirits, and the general attention necessary for the discharge of his duties, should be paid more than £182 per annum. I am not prepared to say that the Usher of the Black Rod or any other officer of this Parliament is receiving too high a salary. The position that I have always taken up in regard to salaries is that which I have maintained regarding the wages of working men. In my opinion salaries and wages alike are insufficient. Of course, if a man is not suitable for the position he occupies, he should be discharged, and a better officer should be appointed. But I would take no step to reduce salaries, because I repeat that, in my opinion, under the competitive system under which we live, both salaries and wages are not high enough. The salary of the Usher might be allowed to stand, and when, we reach the vote for the refreshment-rooms something more may be said in reference to it. </para>

He is responsible to the Treasury for the accounts that he keeps. He supervises the expenditure in connexion with the Senate's part of the building in which we meet. He has control of the operations of officers who are employed in connexion with this Chamber to the tune of many thousands of pounds per annum. His functions relate not only to the management of the refreshment-rooms, but to the whole expense of lighting, water, fire insurance, and in fact the books connected with every salary in relation to those works. He occupies a highly responsible position. His duties in this Chamber as Usher of the Black Rod are merely a bagatelle compared with the total work that he is continually doing in his office in relation to the books which he has to keep under the supervision of the Treasury. </para>

                        <para>- The whole scope of the department is under his charge. I do not mean to say. that the salaries of the clerical staff go through his hands. But he has to do with the fittings and furnishings of the chamber, and all such works on this side of the building. As to what the President has said, I can state, as a member of the special committee appointed to inquire into matters relating to the refreshment-rooms, that in the New South Wales Parliament £2,900 a year is paid for salaries and wages alone in connexion with the refreshment-rooms. I have been through the records myself recently. The steward in New South Wales receives £700 a year with quarters. I may also point out that with the exception . of the one line of fish on the menu, the prices in our refreshment-rooms are from 33 to 100 per cent. higher than are the prices in the New South Wales parliamentary refreshment-rooms. I have spent days and days looking over the accounts and balance-sheets of the House Committee, and I say. as the result of a more complete investigation than I suppose has been made by any other member of the Senate - because no one has been charged with the same responsible task - that affairs are conducted herewith economy, with probity and with as much satisfaction as the low prices charged permit. For these reasons I do not think that there is any justification for making a reduction in the salary under discussion, whatever reason there may be for making an increase in the salary of another officer. As to that, however though I have not looked up the Constitution, I think that what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> desires to do is not within our province. I doubt whether we can make a request to increase a salary. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know that we can. I am very doubtful about it. However, that is a matter which we cannot settle here. For the reasons I have given, I do not think there is any justification for the reduction of this salary, or for transferring the duties of the position to the steward. However effective the steward might be, I do not see how he could undertake all the bookkeeping and other duties which really amount to those of a public accountant in connexion with the Treasury. </para>

                <para>That the House of Representatives be requested to increase the item " Repatriation of Pacific Islanders, £12,500," by£10,000. </para>
                <para class="block">I intimated, when we were discussing the Pacific Island Labourers Bill, that when we reached this part of the Estimates, I should ask the Senate to request the House of Representatives to restore the amount, of £25,000 which was originally proposed for the repatriation of the Pacific Islanders. When the Bill passed through the House of Representatives, the amount was reduced to ,£12,500 ; and since then the measure has been somewhat altered in the way of exemptions, so as to increase, if anything, the number of islanders who will have to be returned. Under the circumstances I think it is only fair that the House of Representatives should have an opportunity to reconsider the matter. I have a very strong opinion that it is our duty to do something in the way of providing' for the islanders who are being returned ; at all evenTs, in the way of providing for their immediate necessities. For a great number of years past the Queensland Government have been acting as the guardian of those islanders in Australia. It has been recognised that as these islanders' had no settled government of their own, the Queensland Government could assume to make laws and regulations in regard to their conduct, without asking their consent or the consent of any other persons. 'We are now returning these islanders to their homes; and I contend that we cannot all at once disclaim responsibility in reference to them. We should have some regard to their future welfare, and should not hesitate to spend a little money in order to give 'them a start when they reach their own islands. Reference has been made more than once to the little group of islanders who have huts on the banks of the Fitzroy River. At the end of the first session of the Federal Parliament, in 1902, I saw these islanders, and found them very much disturbed in their minds. They were under the impression that at the end of this year, the Government would forcibly take them out of Australia and put them down, it might be, in some strange islands where their lives would be in danger. I was a member of the Government at the time; and, although I .was not authorized to do so, I assured these kanakas that the Commonwealth Government would, at all events, treat them as kindly as they had been treated by the Queensland Government. I told them that if they had to leave Australia they would receive compensation for any little property they had to leave behind, and that if they did not desire to go to their own islands, they would be sent to some other, where their lives and property would be just as safe as in Queensland. The kanakas seemed to be perfectly satisfied; and, as the present Premier was a colleague of mine at that time, I hope the Government will be ' disposed to honour the assurances I gave. I told the kanakas at the same time that I could hold out no hope that they would be allowed to remain in Australia. I think the sum of money which I suggest should be voted in order that the Government may do three things ; in the first place, compensation should be given where kanakas who are deported are compelled to leave any of their property behind. The humpies at Rockhampton, for instance, represent a value that is scarcely worth speaking of, but it is better that these men should be given a few pounds in compensation for the buildings they have put up than that they should have the shadow of an excuse for saying that they have been unjustly treated by the Government of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- It should be done by somebody. I hope that the matter will not be passed backwards and forwards between the Commonwealth and. States Governments, with the result that nothing will be done in the end. It is a matter of indifference to me whether it is done by the State or by the Commonwealth Government; the important consideration is that it should be done in the interests of Australia. Then I think that some provision should be made for the comfort of the islanders on their way back to the islands. Many of them have been for a considerable time in Australia, they have acquired our customs, and their children have been going to our schools. As I have already said, I think that a settlement should be established on some neutral island, with a Government officer in charge, for all those who do not desire to return to their own islands. I think that a school should be erected there, and provision made for teachers. If European teachers are not easily available very excellent native teachers can be obtained from Samoa. Many of them are employed in the islands of the Torres Straits and the New Guinea islands, and I was informed by one of the missioners that they give very great satisfaction. There should also, I think, be erected what is called a mission house - a building which the kanakas might use for religious services, or for purposes of general assembly. I have already said that when sending them back we should send with them a few head of cattle, sheep, and poultry, and they should also be supplied with seeds and agricultural implements. Those of them who have been for many years in Australia know something of agriculture, and we should take advantage of the opportunity to give them a start in their own islands, and a chance to rise In the scale of civilization. Since the Commonwealth has been established we have been talking about the extension of British influence in the .New Hebrides, and in the South Sea Islands generally. Here is. an opportunity to do something to increase British influence in the South Seas. The Pacific Islanders are a docile and affectionate people, and we have now an opportunity to obtain a hold on their gratitude, and so do more towards establishing British influence in the South Sea Islands than we could do by almost any other step which we could take. I hope the Committee will agree to make the request. </para>

                        <para>- I understand that the cost of a return passage of a kanaka to his native island is estimated at about £5, and it was stated in another place that, owing to the necessity of sending a very large number away at one time, a larger sum per head is demanded. When the kanakas were recruited, it was a part of the agreement entered into with them that a sufficient sum should be provided to send them back to their own islands at the termination of their engagements, and £5 per head had to be deposited for this purpose. I am given to understand now that, notwithstanding the fact that a large number of these men have died -in Queensland t there is not a penny left in the fund which" was intended to provide for their return. </para>

                        <para>- That is a question which ought to be answered before we can give an intelligent vote on this item. The death-rate amongst these people in Queensland has been very high, and nearly 1,000 of them have died during the few short years within which we have been dealing with the question. The money deposited should now be available for the purposes of deportation. I am quite prepared to vote money if I am assured that the kanakas will get the benefit of it ; but I object to one. farthing being voted to save the pockets of the Queensland Government, or of the rich planters who brought these men into the country. We should have a clear understanding as to the purpose for which this money is voted. While I am sure that no member of the Committee would have the slightest objection to do what might be necessary to give the deported kanakas a fresh start in life in their own islands. I believe that the vote now before the Committee will not be used for the benefit of the kanakas in any way. </para>

There should be sufficient money in the Queensland Pacific Islanders-' Fund to meet that expense. </para>

                    <para>. - The Government, in the first instance, submitted a vote of £25,000 for the repatriation of the kanakas. It was thought at the time that we should have to pay the whole of the cost of deporting these men, but subsequently an arrangement was made with the Queensland Government, by which they agreed to provide £5 per head in respect of those deported. We thought that they should have been prepared to give £5 per head for every kanaka brought into the State, as that money had been deposited in a fund for the purpose of returning the kanakas to their islands. It has been explained, however, that a great deal of the money has been spent in providing hospitals, rations for destitute islanders, and assisting them in other ways, and the fund has become depleted to such, an extent that, in paying £5 per head on the number deported, the Queensland Government must put their hands into the State Treasury to the tune of some £7,000. We thought that we should have to pay £25,000 for the deportation of these men, but we find now that £12,500 will be ample, not only to provide for return passages, but also for everything necessary to enable the deportations to be carried out as humanely as possible. I can say this on behalf of the Prime Minister that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> will show him how these people can be assisted after their deportation he will be only too glad to hear what the honorable senator says, and, if he thinks fit, to incur the expense necessary, trusting to Parliament to relieve him of any responsibility afterwards. I do not think that what the honorable senator suggests can be done. It would not be right for us to start in the New Hebrides, for instance, a special colony of our own with magistrates, policemen, and other officers under the control of the Commonwealth. These kanakas will be distributed amongst a great many of the islands. Large numbers will no doubt be returned to the Solomons and the New Hebrides, but a very great many will be deported in twos and threes to other islands. As we are assured that the vote of £12,500 will be ample for the purpose intended, I hope theCommittee will not agree to the request. </para>

                    <para>- Yes. This is a Bill in respect of which we made a request. According, to the practice, and according to the opinion of the Senate, we pass all those clauses of a Bill in respect of which we do not make a request. In this case we made a request which the House of Representatives has complied with. Therefore the Bill seems to me to have been finally dealt with. </para>

                    <para>. - Of course it is competent for every honorable senator to debate the motion no matter what circumstances may have conduced to the question for its third reading being submitted. I have merely risen to suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> that the third reading should be postponed until a later hour. I have no particular wish to debate the matter now. I understand that there is no great hurry to rush the third reading of the Bill through, especially until we have had time to consider the other question. Does the honorable senator wish to take the third reading now ? </para>

                        <para>- I am not saying whether that can be done or not ; I am dealing merely with the action of the Government. This is another case where the Government has not told us fully and frankly what it proposes to do. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> knows as well as I do, although the Senate has no official knowledge of the fact, 'that as soon as this motion has been agreed to he intends to ask us to pass a Bill to undo the very thing which he. is now asking us to do." The Senate may arrive at the conclusion that it is a wise and proper thing to do. I hold that a Minister, when he is asking the Senate to. assent 'to', a certain course of action, ought to tell us immediately what is behind his proposal. We should have been told fully what the Government has in hand. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Col. NEILD</inline>(New South Wales) [2.42]. - It appears to me that we are simply duplicating, and from an opposite stand-point, that which was done last night. A majority of my honorable friends on this side were then most anxious to insist upon a request made to the other House. But since they have got their way, they are prepared to prevent a formal acceptance and fulfilment of their desire. That, I think, is an absolute waste of time. It is reducing the proceedings of the Senate to little better than a farce to insist upon an amendment being made one day and to refuse to accept it the next day. </para>

The amendment requested by the Senate has been made, and I do not see how we can fairly refuse to agree to the third reading of the Bill. Whether it is assented to or reserved is another matter. I would counsel the Government to get the Bill passed as quickly as possible. </para>

Those who devote themselves to particular forms of agriculture - to the improving of our wool clips, and assisting in the development of new fruits and other products - are well known to be usually financial failures. In my opinion, we are going altogether outside our province in proposing to start a fund of this kind. Then there is the very forcible objection raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline> I am afraid that the money would be divided, not in accordance with the merits or demerits of the parties concerned, but just in proportion as they could ear-wig Members of Parliment. </para>

                <para class="block">Only a few days ago it was pointed out that one of the dangers attending the repatriation of the Pacific islanders was that there might be a scarcity of food in the islands. If it were only to avoid any risk of that, it would be worth our while to vote the small amount that I suggest should be provided. When I moved a request that the vote on the Estimates for the repatriation of the kanakas should be increased, it was contended that the money might be used solely for the payment of the return passages. These are provided for in the vote which appears on the Estimates, and there should, therefore, be no fear that the new vote which I suggest would be used for that purpose. As we have decided to send these people back to their islands, it will be a graceful thing for us to make at least temporary provision for them until they become accustomed to the new way of living. </para>

                        <para>- There will be no objection taken to the Government treating these people generously, but we should be assured that they will get the benefit of any .money we vote. I strongly object to vote any money to .meet the cost of returning them to their islands. I believe that, on their return, they should be supplied with agricultural implements, seed, and stock, but I contend that the cost of returning them should be paid out of the Queensland Pacific Islanders Fund, which was established for that purpose. We ought to leave out the item which appears in the schedule, and the Government could then bring clown a. measure embodying a complete scheme covering what they think ought to be done for the kanakas on their return to their islands. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; even now that could be done. The Committee will make a great mistake if they allow the item to be passed, because the Commonwealth ought not to be asked to pay a penny of the cost of the return passages. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake,</inline> in introducing the Pacific Island Labourers Bill in the first session of the first Parliament, crave us to understand that every kanaka was brought to Australia under an agreement, which provided for the deposit of £5 in a trust fund to meet the cost of returning him to his island at the close of his engagement. We were told that, as that money was held in trust, it would not cost, the Commonwealth anything to deport the kanakas. A large number of those who were brought to Australia have since died, and there should, therefore, be more money available to deport those who remain. The Minister of Defence has told us that the Queensland Government have spent the .moneys of the fund on hospitals, and I ask why the taxpayers of the other States should be asked to supplement a Queensland hospital fund ? We have no right to vote money to supplement a fund which has been wrongly spent on the hospitals of Queensland. </para>

I strongly object to spend thetaxpayers' money to save the pockets of rich planters in Queensland, who are legally and morally bound to carry out their contract, and at their own cost to return the kanakas to the islands from which they were recruited. We should not allow them to break their agreement, and shift their responsibility to the taxpayers of Australia. I intend to move the omission of the item which appears in the schedule. </para>

                        <para>. - I direct attention to the fact that during the last few years there has been a determined attempt on the part of some persons to prevent the deportation of the kanakas. When they have come to the ports from which they expected to be able to embark, they have been kept hanging about until what little money they have, had was spent, and they were then obliged to renew their agreements, and go to work again. That has led to very few of the islanders being returned. We certainly have no right to do anything which would assist those who have tried to defeat the object of the legislation we have passed.

I hope that when a question of humanity is at stake, the Committee will not be divided as to whether the expense should be met by Tasmania or Western Australia, or by the Queensland planters, or the Queensland Government.

                <para class="block">That is a stronger reason why we should have an explicit statement as to how it is to be expended. It is quite evident to me that the Government is not ready yet to deport the kanakas, although it knew that, according to Federal law, they would have to leave bv a certain date. Apparently Ministers have not the slightest conception as to how they are going to carry out the law, otherwise they would have been able to clearly indicate the course which they intend to pursue. This is not a matter of a few hundred pounds, but a matter of £12,500. If, as has been suggested, trust money has been devoted to another purpose by the Queensland Government, it is a gross injustice that the Commonwealth should be asked to replace that money.

The White Australia policy is a national one, and, extremely anxious as I am to see as many kanakas as possible deported. I do not desire to see an injustice done to them when they are deported. I prefer to take a humanitarian view, like Senator Drake, and a national view like Senator Clemons. We should be very paltry indeed if we did not unanimously agree to an expenditure of £5,000 for such a purpose. I understand that the Queensland Government, because it drew upon the planters' fund for the purposes I have indicated, will have to provide £7,000. When a sum of £5,000 is spread over all the States it will not be felt, and at the same time it will establish a principle that, while every one favours the White Australia policy, he is not prepared, under any circumstances, to do an injustice to the kanakas.</inline></para>

                    <para>.' - I cannot understand why any honorable' senators should desire the item to be struck out, unless it is that they have not sufficient information. When each kanaka was brought in and engaged, £5 was paid on his behalf by the planter to a special fund. Upon the completion of their engagements, some kanakas got tickets of exemption, and with them we cannot deal. The planter was only responsible for the maintenance of the kanaka during the term of the engagement. Upon its completion the kanaka came under the supervision of the Pacific Island inspector. When an inspector found any darkies in sickness and need, the necessary assistance had to be; given. The fund was provided, not only by the planter's contribution of £5 for each kanaka, but bv the addition of deceased islanders' estates. The Government said, " As all "the money in connexion with the Pacific islanders has gone into this fund, we are entitled to draw therefrom money for the purpose of assisting kanakas in distress, and not ask the taxpayers to bear the cost." The fund has also been drawn upon to provide small hospitals, school houses, and teachers. </para>

                        <para>- No. The Queensland Government has undertaken to pay the total amount which has been paid by the planters into the fund, and that is the full extent of its liability. When inlanders were going to and fro, the passage money was less per head than it is to-day. The Queensland Government is prepared to take from its consolidated revenue, if necessary, a sufficient sum to fulfil all its engagements in connexion with the deportation of the kanakas. Why should we ask the people of Queensland to foot the whole of the bill ? Surely the Federal Parliament passed the Pacific Island Labourers Act with a full understanding that any expenditure over and above the liability of Queensland would be borne by the Commonwealth? I do' not see how the Parliament can for a moment think of shirking its liability in the matter. </para>

                        <para>- About 3,000. Queensland has to find £15,000 for the purpose. The balance to the credit of the planters' fund is £8,000, and, therefore, the State has to make up a deficiency of £7,000. The Commonwealth wants a vote of £12,500 to make up the sum of £27,000 which is required. We think that that vote will be ample to provide the balance of the passage money, after Queensland has discharged its liability, and to leave in hand a few thousands to be used, if desirable, in providing comforts and so on for the kanakas. </para>

                        <para>- No. It was because the Minister would not say how much money was in hand, or how many kanakas were to be deported, th'at I renewed my request for information. But, even now, he is inconsistent, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> is too. The statement of the Minister is that, instead of there being in. hand £5 for each kanaka to be deported, only half that sum is available. The Queensland Government had no more right to take that money to provide hospitals and schools for the kanakas than it had to hand it to me for mv own use. I have clearly defined mv attitude on this question. If it were a matter of giving the kanakas a fresh start on their islands, </para>

                <para class="block">I should be quite prepared to vote double the amount we are asked for. But I certainly object to one penny piece being paid for the benefit of the Queensland Government or the rich planters. The statement was made by the Prime Minister in another place that the amount of passage money would be only 10s. more per head than that originally estimated. That is to say, instead of the amount being £5 per head, it would be £5 10s. That amount of money ought to be available, and in the hands of the Queensland Government. Where is the money that ought to bc in hand on account of those kanakas who have died? We understand that 1,000 of them have died. Apparently not a penny of that money is in existence. We have a right to know where it has gone to. I am as ready as any one can be to give the kanakas a fresh start on their islands, but I object to a penny being spent for what I consider to be a wrong purpose in every sense of the word. This is the most shameful business ever proposed, lt is all very well to take shelter behind a sentiment of generosity towards the kanakas, but that is not the question now. We want to know why we should be generous to the Queensland Government and. the sugar-planters, who are responsible for the money deposited for the return of the kanakas to their islands. We have been paying ".through the nose" on account of this kanaka business all along. We have paid too much in several directions. I trust that the Senate will express its disapproval of what is proposed. </para>

                    <para>.- I should like to have a little more information from the Minister. He tells us that the Queensland Government has £8,000 at its disposal for the purpose of deporting kanakas. It has made itself responsible to the extent of £5 per head for their deportation. There are 3,000 kanakas to be deported. At £5 per head the sum to be paid by the Queensland Government would be £15,000. I believe if is true that the cost of deporting the men is now found to be, not £5, but £5 10s. per head. 'The Queensland Government being responsible for £15,000, that would leave £1,500 to be paid by the Commonwealth Government. But' supposing that it cost .£5 per head to deport the kanakas, it would only mean an additional expenditure of ,£3,000. Why, then, should there be a demand for £12,500? Yet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> proposes "that an additional £5,000 shall be placed on the Estimates to provide comforts for the men. </para>

                    <para>. - The Minister has told us that the kanakas are to be deported by means of the regular boats running to the islands. It must be understood that those vessels cannot call in at a number of places along the coast where the kanakas are. It therefore follows that they will have to be brought to some central place, where they can be put on board. </para>

The figures given by the Minister show that we shall have to pay at least one-half the cost of £5 1 os. per head. I object to our incurring such a liability, but apparently the Committee is prepared to vote any sum for this purpose. </para>

                    <para>. - The longer we discuss this question, the greater is the light thrown upon it. We may accept the statement made in another place by the Prime Minister that £5 10s. per head is the contract price for deporting the kanakas. To that amount the Minister has added 15s., which I feel satisfied is designed to make provision for meeting the difficulties to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> has referred. It will make good the expenses incurred in connexion with the work of collecting ' ;he kanakas and conveying them to the ports of shipment. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> unquestionably gave away his case when he proceeded to draw a graphic picture of the work of collecting the kanakas, and pointed out that the cost of this would fall upon the Commonwealth. The Queensland Government should bear the expense so incurred. Prior to the passing of the Pacific Island Labourers Act, they were responsible for the deportation of the kanakas, and I presume that at that time the difficulty of gathering them at the ports of shipment was as great as it is to-day. </para>

                        <para>- That is the point. If the Queensland Government is to pay £15,000 towards the cost of deportation, then unquestionably the Federal Government are making ample provision to render a great service to the kanakas. If, on the other hand, this sum of £12,500 is to be provided merely to relieve the Government of Queensland of the liability to pay £7,000 towards the cost of deportation a great injustice will be done to the people of the Commonwealth. If Queensland is to pay £15,000 for this purpose, £10,000, as the Minister has said, should be an ample expenditure on the part of the Commonwealth. The discussion, if it has done nothing else, has clearly shown that the proposal made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> that the item should be increased by £5,000 is a monstrous one. </para>

                        <para>- I do not desire that they should be so treated ; but I would point out that very few of them are at any distance from a port. They can be conveyed at trifling cost to the ports of shipment. If they had to be maintained pending shipment for any length of time I could understand special provision being made for the cost of food supplies and so forth, but I fail to see why we should have to provide for travelling expenses on land. Notwithstanding SenatorTurley's denial, I am quite satisfied that it will be urged hereafter that a large expenditure had to be incurred in conveying the kanakas from various parts of Queensland to the ports of shipment. We have been given to understand that the Queensland Government have placed at our disposal the services of immigration agents who will collect the kanakas, so that no expense should be incurred in that direction. I object to one farthing being voted to save the pockets of those who have a legal as well as a moral right to bear the full cost of deporting the kanakas. I have from the first taken up that attitude, but if the Government wish to place on the Estimates a vote to be expended for the benefit of the kanakas, I shall not object. I hope that they will see that this money is spent solely for the benefit of the kanakas. </para>

                <para class="block">I submit this motion in order that it may be perfectly clear that the Government have the authority of Parliament to expend money for compensation to islanders who may have to leave property behind, and in providing for the wants of the islanders, and,_ if necessary, giving them a start in their new homes. In regard to the vote just passed, there may be a considerable amount of doubt. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, when I proposed that the vote of £12,500 should be increased to £25,000, objected solely on the ground that the money might be spent on the expenses of deportation ; he, apparently, would have had no objection if the money were to be spent for the benefit of the islanders. ' The motion I now submit is in the direction favoured by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Col. NEILD</inline>(New South Wales) [4.23]. - The other day I threw a jocular jibe at <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> in regard to kanaka matters; but I cannot allow this motion to go to a division without saying that I intend to vote with the honorable senator. I am very glad that there is now offered to the white people of Australia some small evidence that we are not quite so brutalized as some people would have us regarded, but that we have some feeling of human kindness towards those who have been strangers within our gates, and who have now to re-start life afresh in the islands. This vote, if passed, will afford evidence that we desire to assist those unfortunates in a reasonable manner if the necessity arises. </para>
                <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGREGOR</inline>(South Australia) £4.24]. - I oppose the motion. In another place, where a sum of £25,000 was at first proposed for the repatriation of the kanakas, it was pointed out that £12,500 would be quite sufficient. In any case, if the latter amount is proved inadequate, whatever Government is in power will find some means to render further assistance. There are thousands of white men, women, and children in Australia who are just as needy as are the kanakas, and I do not think it right to give away money recklessly without consideration. The charitable expressions of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> were very nice to listen to; but he is quite at liberty to contribute his share to the missionary associations who look after the kanakas, without calling on rich and poor alike to contribute to this vote. I should not care, by adopting this proposal, to deprive a kind-hearted man like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> of an opportunity to show his charitable inclinations. </para>

                    <para>.- I am disposed to support the proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake. Senator McGregor,</inline> in my opinion, put the case unfairly when he said * it was proposed to vote this money recklessly without consideration. The idea of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> is that, in the event of any pressing case arising, there may be funds available to afford relief. I am an out-and-out White Australian, but I do not believe in White Australia at any price. If there is anything that' would tell against the Labour Party, or those who favour the White Australia policy, it would be a charge that we have no consideration for the lives, comforts, and future happiness ofl the kanakas. We are not now discussing the case of the white people who may be in need, and who deserve consideration ; and we ought not to confuse the issues. The sum proposed is only £5,000, spread over the whole of the Commonwealth, and, according to the Minister, it may never be required. The money is intended for another purpose altogether from that to which the £12', 500 has to be devoted. </para>

But because the milk of human kindness on which he has expatiated flows as warmly in me as in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake,</inline> I am not, therefore, prepared to hoard up a few thousand pounds for a purpose of which we know absolutely nothing. No definite scheme has been put before us, and it might take £50,000 to accomplish all that should be done. If it is subsequently found necessary, in order to do justice, and to act towards these people in a Christian and humane manner, that we should vote additional sums, I shall be most willing to support such expenditure, but I do not propose to hand over to the Government £5,000 more than they think is necessary merely to enable them to say that the money is there. </para>

                    <para>. - It is very difficult to account for the sudden spasm of generosity which has taken hold of certain honorable senators who only a few minutes ago opposed a paltry vote of £500 for the benefit of men of letters of our own race, who might be in need. They are now so generous that they are prepared to give the Government more money than they require. Ministers have said that they will be able to carry out what is suggested for the sum placed on the Estimates, and they should certainly be the best judges of the amount that will actually be required. If a larger sum should be necessary I shall be prepared to consider the matter when it is brought before us in next year's Estimates. Seeing that no scheme has been submitted, and we have no information as to what will be done with the money, I am not disposed to vote a further sum of £5,000 to provide " assistance to repatriated kanakas." In view of the fact that the amount for which they originally asked was so large. I think the Government might very well have submitted a scheme to Parliament indicating what they proposed to do to give the kanakas a fresh start in their islands. We should then have been able to decide whether the amount asked for would be ample for the purpose. In the absence of information as to the way in which the money will be spent, I refuse to add to the vote to which the Committee has already agreed. </para>

                <para class="block">Honorable senators will recollect that some time ago the Prime Minister suggested a scheme under which the Commonwealth might help the cause of immigration. I propose to refer briefly to the correspondence which took place between the Prime Minister and the various States Premiers, and I think that I shall be able to adduce from it arguments in support of the omission of this item. If there is one thing more than another that Australia wants it is increased population. It is only a question of the best way of getting it. History has repeated itself, and Ministers in this vote are trying to do what they sought to do in connexion with the Bounties Bill. They are proposing that the Commonwealth shall undertake work which the States can do very much better for themselves. In my opinion the correspondence to which I refer constitutes an absolute snub to the Prime Minister, as the States Premiers, with unanimous voice, replied, " Leave us alone." It is true that we have now the sole right to make laws with regard to immigration, but the States have control over their lands, and are now obtaining, and will continue to obtain, such immigrants as they desire. In his letter on the subject the Prime Minister said - </para>

                    <para>I' have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th inst. (No. 2977), on the subject of immigration, and in reply beg to state that immigrants are arriving in this State at the rate of seven hundred and fifty (750) per annum. There is every likelihood, however, that this number will be considerably increased at an early date, in view of the further promising developments in connexion with our agricultural industry and new sold discoveries. </para>

                <para>What could the Commonwealth do by establishing in London a central s,taff, and spending £5,000 a year to advertise its resources, when Western Australia is getting immigrants at the rate of 750 a year, and hopes to increase the number? I should have thought that Western Australia and. New South Wales were managing their immigration business splendidly. We know that every office at Home is thoroughly up-to-date. I know that, month after month, the Agent-General of Tasmania asks for. further information, for leaflets, handbooks, and lantern slides. </para>

                        <para>- No; but we have a good deal of fruit-growing land. We send to our Agent-General all the information we can. We have sent him about 500 slides of photographs of our best scenery, and lectures are being given under his auspices in order to attract immigrants and tourists. In these circumstances, how is it possible for the Commonwealth to intervene and help the States? Of course, we could vote money to the States, but I do not think that it is needed. Having written to the States Premiers, on the 2nd May, we find the Prime Minister writing, on the 29th August, to the Premier of Queensland and1 the Premier of Tasmania, asking for information. Is, it not plain from the correspondence that the States wish to be left alone, but that if the Commonwealth is willing to put £5,000 in their way, they are ready to take it? I hope that the Minister of Defence will concur in a request for the omission of the item. TJ is of no use for the Commonwealth to attempt to undertake duties which belong to the States, when we have quite enough to do to discharge our responsibilities under the Constitution. I believe that if this money were voted, it would be wasted. </para>

When interrogated as to the prospect in some other part of Australia with which he has no relation, he is not disposed to represent it as favorably as those of his own section. The competition between rival agents may have stimulating uses, but it has greater disadvantages. The people who seek information do not obtain that which they desire. What they wish to know first of all is information about Australia as a whole. That we propose to supply. If the States consent to work with us, we intend to have a central office, which will undertake the work of making known throughout the length and breadth of the United Kingdom all the opportunities for settlement offering in Australia. </para>

I quite agree with him. But there are already in Australia hundreds of people who cannot fmd work to do. People are leaving this country for New Zealand and South Africa, owing to the lack of employment or of land upon which to settle. The Prime Minister has written to the various Premiers, asking them what are the possibilities as to settling people on _ the land in their States. Some of the States are not disposed to settle people on the land at all. Indeed, they follow a policy that is rather calculated to cause people to be settled under the land. Tasmania is a State of that kind. She is making no progress, and is always in a bad way. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> approaches every question with the words, "This is a very grave question." -His State has been in a grave way for a considerable time, having always followed a backward policy.

                        <para>- It will be far better for the Commonwealth to spend £5,000 in establishing a bureau in this country, to furnish information to. people regarding labour conditions and land settlement, than to spend such a sum in establishing an office in London. I am not opposed to an . immigration policy, but it is cruel to lure people from England to the Commonwealth when there are thousands of men and women here who want work and land, and are unable to get either. When I was in Sydney recently I read a short article in one of the morning newspapers, to the effect that six young English countrymen, farm hands, had been informed by officers representing New South Wales in London that if they came out to that State they would find no difficulty whatever in obtaining employment. They were led to believe that they would very soon obtain suitable employment at high wages, and under conditions far preferable to those under which they worked in England. But when they landed in Sydney, to their amazement they could find no work for a considerable period, and ultimately the only employment they could get was as farm hands at 10s. a week and their keep. They had left- a part of England where they were earning from 12s. to 14s. a week, in addition to which their employers enabled them to cultivate a piece of land for their own benefit. Under these circumstances I am disposed to follow <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> in objecting to the item, though not for the reasons which he has given. It is our duty to look after our own people first. We ought not to induce others to come here while we have workmen walking about unemployed. It would be advantageous for us to copy the policy of the New Zealand Government. That Colony has a Labour Department, and a labour journal, together with a. Labour Bureau, which is worked, according to all accounts, on a very much better system than obtains in connexion with any organization of the kind in Australia. The New Zealand labour journal" is full of information regarding industrial conditions and the possibilities of employment in every part of the country. If the Commonwealth Government would follow in the footsteps of the New Zealand Government in establishing a Department such as that, with a labour journal attached to it. and if it would, in addition, take steps to ascertain from the States the possibilities of land settlement and employment, it would do valuable practical work. put the present proposal appears to me to conduce to a complete waste of money. I shall vote against it. </para>

Is it intended to advertise our production of wheat and wool? Is it intended to point out to the people of Great Britain that we have large mineral resources ? I am unable at present to see the possibility of the Government doing any more than spend this money without deriving any advantage from it. A great deal is said with reference to the advantage of lantern lectures. I received quite recently from a friend in England a letter in which he pointed out that he himself attended one of these lectures, and found that the people who went to them were town people and children who highly appreciated a gratuitous entertainment, but that it was evident that efforts in that direction were misdirected, because they failed to reach the very class whom we desired to attract. </para>

                        <para>- There is a general agreement in the States that something should be done to attract population, and chiefly small farmers with a little capital of their own. Probably if there is room for any additional population in Australia at all it is people of that kind. But, as has been pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> and in a very forceful manner bv <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ashton,</inline> the present Minister of Lands in New South' Wales, Australia is not at present in a position to offer any inducements to small farmers to come here. I take it that it is not competent for the Federal authorities to offer land to such immigrants. That being so. the first dutv of the Federal Government is to try to arrive at some arrangement with the States bv which land can be made available. Failing that, it is of little use to enter upon such a project as this, which merely amounts to a wasteful expenditure of £5,000 in the creation of more or less permanent employment for a limited number of people. What are we going to advertise with this £5,000? Shall we advertise that land is available for people who desire to immigrate to Australia? Or is it proposed to advertise that every time a block of Government land is offered it is rushed at the ballot? Is it intended to advertise that in every State of Australia to-day the Governments are busily engaged in trying to solve the problem of land settlement, or is it intended to tell the people of Great Britain that we are unable to find land for those who are in this country ? I am whole hearted in my desire for a sensible businesslike scheme to induce people of the right class to come to Australia, but I hold that the Government are commencing at the wrong end. Unless the Minister can give us a more satisfactory guarantee than he has already done that this money will be expended in a proper way, I hope that the item will not be agreed to. I venture to predict that after the amount has been expended neither the Government nor Australia will have anything more to show for it than the vouchers which, I presume, will be submitted by the officers favoured with the duty of drawing on it. Apart from the merits of the proposal, I thin.k that we are entitled before agreeing to this vote to have more details. I recognise that the Minister cannot be expected to be familiar with the details of every item ; but since this is a new proposal - a proposal for the creation of a new branch of the service - he should be able to give us full particulars of the Government scheme. In neither House of the Legislature has any statement been made of how it is proposed to advertise Australia. Are the Government going to advertise its political history, its natural resources, or what? The people of England would be interested in reading of our natural resources, but they already ha.ve a fairly extensive knowledge on the subject. What we need to do is to offer some inducements to a desirable class in the old world to come to Australia. But what inducements can we offer until the land problem has been fettled, either by the States individually, or acting in conjunction, so that a reasonable guarantee may be offered to people in the old country, that on coming here they will be able to obtain on easy terms and without vexatious delay land on which to settle? Until we can give that guarantee, we shall not only throw away money by advertising as proposed, but do a great injustice to those who may be induced to come out under existing circumstances. </para>

                        <para>- But their removal will have a great effect upon Australian progress. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> quoted the replies of the Premiers to the communication addressed to them by the Prime Minister, and I was much struck by the straight-forward opinion expressed by the Premier of South Australia, who stated that the land available in that State is not equal to the local demand. That is an absolute fact. We carry on a very large business with Great Britain, and a knowledge on the part of her people of the resources of Australia would be a great benefit, not only to business men there, but to the producers of Australia. As there is no land available for settlement, why encourage immigration unless we propose to assist industrial pursuits, and thus open up new avenues of employment? I have been informed from an authentic source that only one immigrant has landed in Tasmania during the last few years. </para>

                        <para>- No; as a matter of fact, he was left by mistake in Tasmania. There is no land available for settlement there, or in. other States, and until land is available it is idle to talk about immigration. I am quite willing, however, that this item should be passed to enlighten the people of Great Britain in the truest sense of the word with respect to our vast resources. </para>

                    <para>. - When I first saw this item in the Estimates, I was certainly under the impression that it was intended to encourage immigration, and, having regard to the small ness of the amount, and the fact that there is no land available for settlement, I regarded it as a somewhat farcical proposal. It is absurd to offer inducements to people to come to Australia to settle on the land until land is available for settlement. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so. I am informed by Ministers that the chief object which the Government have in view in asking Parliament to vote this item, is the establishment of a bureau of information in Great Britain. We are sadly in. need of such a bureau to furnish reliable information as to the resources of Australia, the geographical situation of the States, and other matters, and as the item is a small one, I feel disposed to vote for it. There is a lamentable lack of knowledge on the part of many people in Great Britain as to what Australia is, and as to the relative geography of the several States. I heard only a few days ago of a lady tourist from the old world, who, when proposing to visit Australia, was told by some friends that she would land at Fremantle, and would probably be able to take a cab thence to Sydney, where she desired to go. That is an illustration of the knowledge possessed by many educated people in Great Britain as to the geographical position of the States. We frequently hear of letters being addressed say, to " <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jones,</inline> Sydney, Victoria, New South Wales," or " <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. So-and-so,</inline> Launceston, Tasmania, Victoria." The establishment in London of a central bureau of information would do much to remove wrong impressions, and would be an improvement upon the several offices now maintained by the Agents-General. As to the encouragement of immigration, I can thoroughly indorse what other honorable senators have said on the subject. In Tasmania and other States the demand on the part of Australian applicants for suitable land is greater than the supply. </para>

                        <para>- They always refuse to take the steps which almost certainly would be effective in providing land for immigrants. I certainly hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> will, in the next Parliament, join a party which will stop talking, and do something towards encouraging a good class of farmers to come to Australia, and providing land for them on fairly easy terms. Believing that this sum of £5,000 is not intended to hold out inducements to immigrants, but is to be spent in disseminating true information regarding the country, I shall vote for it. </para>

                    <para>. - If ever there was an object on which the spending of money was amply justified, it is that now under discussion. I have recently been brought face to face with some of the absurd mistakes referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe;</inline> and a friend of mine who arrived by the last mail boat has shown me the necessity for a better knowledge in England of Australian affairs. I am told that it is almost impossible for an ordinary individual to get an Australian newspaper, and that information regarding the country is practically unavailable. My friend tells me that there is endless literature about New Zealand; and the result is that people have an idea that that Colony is a very large place, and that Australia, relatively, is about the size of Tasmania. So much better known is New Zealand, that the necessity is obvious to do something to remove the false impressions regarding Australia and Australian affairs. There are certain political false impressions, which it certainly would be worth our while to counteract ; and if the resources and conditions which obtain here are truthfully placed before the people of the old country, there can be no possibility of injustice to any one. Any man who wishes, to emigrate from the old country to Australia ought to be placed in possession of full information, not only as to the resources of the country, but as to the state of the labour market. If any one, after receiving that information, undertook tj come to Australia., he could not say that he had been misled. </para>

                    <para>. - It is amusing to listen to speaker after speaker giving reasons why they should not vote for the expenditure of this sum, and then telling the Committee that they will support it. For whom is this knowledge intended? The rich man or the investor can easily get all the information that he requires; and the people we desire to reach are small farmers and others, who have little or no capital except their labour. We can tell the people in Great Britain that there are millions of acres of fertile land unoccupied in Australia, but that those acres are in the hands of monopolists, and cannot be obtained unless at a rack rent, or at a price " which places them altogether beyond the reach of the average immigrant. What is the use of spending money in order to give people information of that kind ? Instead of promoting immigration, such information would have the opposite effect, of deterring people from coming here. Could the representatives, of Australia in Great Britain tell any tradesman or ordinary artisan that he would be sure of employment in any one of the Australian capitals ? As a matter of fact, the're is a large number of unemployed in each of the capitals. </para>

                        <para>- It is advertising the resources of Australia, with a vengeance ! I know that in this proposal the Government desire to follow the example of New Zealand and Canada. But in Canada an immigrant can get about 160 acres for a few dollars within easy distance of a railway line - there is a section for every immigrant. Before New Zealand started advertising, herculean efforts were made to break up the land monopoly', so as to provide employment for immigrants. The result to-day is that New Zealand is crowded with newcomers - there is land and work. </para>

                        <para>- I have been trying; I am trying; and I shall continue to try to break up the land monopoly in Australia. I think that that is where the Commonwealth Government and Parliament ought to begin. Let us deal a deadly blow at this monopoly to start with ; and then let us advertise the resources of Australia; because then those resources will be available for hundreds and thousands of immigrants. In the meantime, however, the land is locked up, and it is of no earthly use telling, the people of Great Britain that there are thousands of acres of beautiful soil on the Darling Downs with a better climate than can be found at Home, and every prospect of making a good living. That land is unoccupied, and there is a railway and a market, but the land is in the hands of the monopolist ; and until his iron grasp is taken off. we need not waste our, substance in advertising or attempting to advertise the resources of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- It is; but I am referring now more particularly to New South Wales. I remember reading recently that for about a dozen blocks in the Glen Innes district there were no fewer than 700 applicants - all local men and mostly born and bred in the district. We ought first to break up the land monopoly, and, secondly, try to establish local industries by means of high protective duties. When all that has been done I shall be quite willing to spend, not £5,000, but £25,000, in advertising the resources of Australia. In the meantime, however, I consider that the expenditure would be a pure waste of money. </para>

                    <para>.- The Minister's explanation is certainly not satisfactory. I have no doubt that the printing covered by these items is required, and I suppose it is all done in the Government Printing Office. But printing is printing, and, knowing something of the business, I wish to understand why there should be two separate items for printing in connexion with the one Department. Similar items will be found under the head of nearly every Department of the Commonwealth service, and I think some better explanation should have been given. </para>

                    <para>. - It would be worth honorable senators' while to compare the schedule with a copy of the Estimates, which give an indication of the extent to which the expenditure of the different Departments is growing. This Department is no exception to the rule, nor was the last. The vote we have just dealt with shows a considerable increase on the vote for the External Affairs Department for last year. Dealing with the Attorney-General 'sDepartment. I find amongst other things that, whereas the appropriation for the year 1905-6 for the High Court was £4,250, which was the amount set down in the Estimates by the preceding Government, the actual expenditure amounted to £5,681 - a considerable increase, for which no explanation has been offered. I might summarize the matter in this way : The appropriation for 1905-6 in connexion with the Secretary's office, Crown Solicitor's office. High Court, and Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, was £8,969, and the proposed appropriation for this year is £11,301. Thus the increase in the expenditure on each Department goes on from year to year until one is forced to wonder if the time will ever come when it will stop, and we shall consider the possibility of decreasing it. </para>

In common with other States officers, he performs certain work for the Commonwealth. I am informed on reliable authority that he has done very valuable work, and that the Commonwealth Government have recognised his services by voting him the sum of £40 each year over a period of three years, or ^120 in all. I find that the State Government has taken possession of that money, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O'Halloran,</inline> although some of the work for which the money was voted to him was done after he had finished his work for the State, has not been able to obtain the consideration which the Commonwealth desires that he should be given. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. I understand that he did so in connexion with the disputed election case of <inline font-style="italic">Chanter</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Blackwood.</inline> I believe I am correct in saying that nearly the whole of the work in that case was intrusted to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O'Halloran.</inline> It is somewhat strange that the Victorian Government should not permit their officers to receive payment from the Commonwealth for services rendered when the other States Governments allow their officers to receive gratuities voted by the Commonwealth Parliament. I direct the attention of the Minister to the matter, and I hope that if possible he will see that the amount to which this gentleman is justly entitled shall get into the right hands. Another point to which I might direct the attention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> is that while the bulk of the work in connexion with the High Court is done in Melbourne more money is voted for the payment of officers employed in the Sydney office, which is a subsidiary office, than is paid to those employed in Melbourne. </para>

                    <para>. - I am not familiar with the case which has been referred to, but we know that the , States undertake a considerable amount of work for the Commonwealth, and in some instances the Commonwealth does work for the States, and arrangements have been made for payment for such work. It is quite possible, if not probable, that in most instances, while a State officer is engaged in doing work for the Commonwealth some other person must be employed to do work which he would otherwise have had to do. In such cases the persons doing such work for the State have to be paid, and the State should be reimbursed the expense. If 'this work is overtime work some one should certainly pay the officer for it, but it would be a dangerous thing for us, without very great justification, to interfere between States servants and States Executives. All that we are responsible for is that we pay for the work that is done for us. If subsequently, .any act of injustice is done, it seems to me that the remedy must be sought in some other Parliament. </para>

                    <para>. - I direct the attention of the Committee to the item " Travelling expenses, £2,950" under the High Court division. Last year after considerable expressions of dissent, we agreed to appropriate the sum of £2,000 for this purpose. We considered that a generous allowance, but- 1 find from the Estimates that the actual amount expended was £2,692. As if that were not enough, we are asked now to increase the vote to £2,950. The Government might just as well have asked for a vote of £5&gt;95° at once, because it will soon climb up to that amount. I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> will be able to give the Senate some information as to why the liberal travelling allowance of  £27000  voted last year was increased to £2,690, and why it is now proposed to increase the vote still further to £2,950. In giving the information, I hope the honorable and learned senator will supply the Committee with such particulars as will enable honorable senators to trace the expenditure.- and form some opinion as to whether it is justified. I assume that the whole of the travelling expenses are not to be credited to the three Judges of the High Court, and from my point of view the amount expended includes a totally unnecessary allowance to the associates, tipstaffs, and the other persons who for some reason or another surround them. </para>

                    <para>- With regard to the matter which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> has brought under notice, the work done in connexion with the High Court by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. 0</inline> 'Halloran, I agree with the honorable senator that in that gentleman we found a very able and efficient officer. The question whether the money paid by the Commonwealth for his services should go into the pocket of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O</inline> 'Halloran or into the Treasury of Victoria has been under consideration. The Attorney-General in another place quite recently intimated that he would use his best efforts to persuade the Government of Victoria to give consideration to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O'Halloran's</inline> personal claims in connexion with any money payment which might be made by the Commonwealth for his services. I do not think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> was quite correct in saving that Victoria is singular in this respect, for I believe that some of the other States follow a similar practice. At any rate, he is correct to this extent, that there is a divergence of practice with regard to the appropriation of moneys that are paid by the Commonwealth for services rendered by State officers. If my memory serves me correctly, this matter was dealt with, but not finally disposed of, at the Premiers' Conference in Hobart. The Attorney-General has had under consideration the desirableness of establishing a uniform practice in dealing with the States, so that the Commonwealth may know exactly whether it is paying money into the Treasuries of the States or into the pockets of particular individuals. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> has also drawn attention to an apparent discrepancy between the treatment of Melbourne and Sydney with regard to expenditure of this kind. We recognise that the great volume of the work comes through the Melbourne office, of which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O'Halloran</inline> is the chief ; but we do not seek to differentiate between one registry and another, except in so far as the necessities of the case arising from the - volume of work may compel. So far as Melbourne is concerned, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O'Halloran</inline> has a clerk, who appears in sub-division 1 as " Clerk in Principal Registry, £235," and who is a very efficient officer. In Sydney we have not a corresponding officer, consequently, there may be an increase in the payment Ave have to make for the use of States officers in New South Wales. In reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons,</inline> I would point out that the Estimates show that the vote for travelling expenses for the High Court for 1905-6 was £2,000. The actual expenditure last year was £2,692, and the amount required for the current year is £2,950. The vote for travelling expenses includes railway fares, steamer tares, and the allowance that is made to the Judges under the Order in Council. </para>

                <para>It will be seen that the Order in Council fixes a maximum beyond which a Justice cannot certify, and whatever amount has been paid must be actually certified by the Justice under , his hand. When we submitted the Estimates for 1905-6, we naturally based the vote on -our experience of the previous year; but, as a matter of fact, the work of the High Court has considerably expanded, and, of course, the travelling has increased. The work has expanded to such an extent that Parliament has seen fit to strengthen the Bench numerically. In 1904-5 the travelling, days for each Justice averaged 120, and the average cost per day for each Justice was £3 9s. 9'd. In 1905-6 the travelling days for each </para>

The total expenditure under this head last year was £2,692. We must assume that the business of the High Court will continue to increase, and that the travelling expenses will also increase. We know as a fact that the strength of the Bench has been increased. </para>

                        <para>- Perhaps they specially chose that time to come here. I venture to say that the expenses in connexion with the High Court are a scandal. I shall now take the lower scale which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> quoted. He read a statement with a certain amount of satisfaction, apparently to show that one Judge and one associate have incurred costs amounting ro £3 9s- 9^- a day for bare living. I do not wish to interfere in any way with the dignity of the High Court, or to diminish the respect that ought to be paid to the Justices. But I do submit that to a man with frugal notions a daily expenditure of £3 9s. 9d. for each Judge and his associate - whose daily allowance is 15s. - is far too much. </para>

I think that the Committee is entitled to be furnished with that information in order that it may, if it thinks fit, attach blame to the right person. It may be that the three Judges have not been extravagant, but that the associates have been. It may be that to a large extent the expenditure has been incurred in connexion with the attendants. Can the Minister tell us how many days' travelling this expenditure represents for the Justices, and how many days for their associates, and how many for their attendants? </para>

                        <para>- Of course, the Judges stay at first-class hotels, and they each require to have more than a bedroom. They have a tremendous amount of work to do singly and collectively after they rise from the Bench. They also have to carry with them a considerable quantity of law books. It will be easily understood that a judgment delivered early in the morning has probably had a great deal of midnight oil spent upon it, and the Justices, when travelling, have to meet and work in rooms in their hotel to consider their judgments. They require more than ordinary privacy. Honorable senators know, as a matter of practical experience, that hotelkeepers are not expected to be philanthropic persons, and would not be likely to av to a Judge of the High Court : " We are so pleased to see you that we will give you accommodation on especially low terms." Let ray honorable friend ascertain what would be the cost of such accommodation as a Judge would require at a first-class Melbourne hotel. </para>

Board of Trade point out that while rights of giving preference in respect British goods is beyond question, preference to such goods by reason of British nationality of vessel carrying them would seem to be violation of number of treaties binding some or all of the Australian Colonies, namely, treaties with Austria-Hungary, Honduras', and Peru, which contain clauses providing that vessels of the foreign country and their cargoes shall be treated in every respect as national ships and their cargoes. Treaties with Colombia, Egypt, Greece, Italy, Japan, Liberia, Morocco, Peru, Russia, and Salvador, which contain certain clauses specifically providing that no other or higher duties shall be imposed on goods imported in vessels of the foreign country than if imported in British or in some cases national ships, and treaties with certain other countries which were entitled to most favoured nation treatment in the matter referred to. </para>

                <para>Thereupon the House of Representatives determined not to make the amendment requested by us, and struck out all the words after "kingdom" in the headings to the third and fourth columns of the schedule. They then asked us to agree to what they held to be a modification of our request, but when their message was received, the point was taken that they, under the Standing Orders, had no power to make such a modification, and we sent back a rider expressing that view. There, were then three courses open to the Government : to drop the Bill, to send up a special amending Bill, or to' obtain a message from the Governor-General recommending the amendments. The second course was taken early this afternoon, and the amending Bill sent up was negatived here on its first reading. Thereupon the Government obtained a message from the Governor-General recommending the amendments, to which we have hitherto refused to agree. Those amendments have been made by the House of Representatives, and they now ask us to concur in them. The position is a clean cut one. Those who vote against the motion will practically defeat the Customs Tariff (British Preference) Bill. </para>

                        <para>- It is questionable whether, in view of the treaties to which reference is made in the telegram which I have read, the consent of the King would be given to the Bill as it stands. At any rate, I think it is not worth while to take the risk of losing the measure, and, therefore, I ask the Committee to reconsider the position, and to support the Government. The treaties which have been mentioned prevent us from discriminating against certain foreign vessels. That being so, I cannot say what the result will be if the Committee negatives the motion, but the chances are that it will defeat the object of the framers of the Bill. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope that those who think that we should give a preference to British goods will vote for the motion. I supported the amendment to give preference to British ships and to white seamen, and am still of opinion that it would be desirable' to do so. But as practical men we have to consider what it is possible for us to do. I think that it will be better for us to take what we can get rather than to lose everything in an effort to achieve the unobtainable. If the Bill becomes operative, it will accomplish two objects. In the first place, it will protect British goods in our markets. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know how the Senate can be bulldozed. Of course, the position would be different if any one had the power to take the Senate by the neck and make it do something that it had no wish to do. We have expressed our approval of the main principle contained in the Bill, and it is now discovered that the whole of the provisions of the measure cannot be carried into effect. If the amendments recommended are agreed to', protection will be given to British goods in our markets. We must all deplore the fact that it is impracticable for us to retain the provision which would afford protection to British shipping and British seamen, bud it is useless for us to refuse to give any preference unless our views are carried out in their entirety. "Unless we remove from the Bill the provision which would conflict with the treaty obligations of the motherland, the other portions of the measure which we specially desire to see brought into operation can have no effect. We are hampered in so far as British shipping is concerned by the operation of treaties in the making of which we had no hand. Some honorable senators may urge that we should not be. bound by treaties in the making of which we were not consulted, but we cannot take up any such position. We form a portion of the British Empire, and we hold our powers of legislation subject to the will of the Imperial Parliament. " We are incapable of dealing legislatively with the treaties that have been referred to. </para>

                        <para>- Irrespective of the danger that may attach to these treaties, the Imperial authorities and ourselves are bound by them. The provision which it is now sought to eliminate from the Bill is declared to be in derogation of some of these treaties. Upon this point, we have the word of the British Board of Trade, which can speak authoritatively upon all matters within its domain. I think that we should be content for the present to pass the Bill in a form which will enable us to afford substantial protection to British goods in our own markets, and to incidentally increase the protection enjoyed by our own manufacturers. I strongly urge honorable senators to withdraw from the position they have previously taken up, and agree to the amendment necessary to render the Bill effective. </para>

                    <para>. -I am a strong believer in preferential trade with the old country, and I gave every credit to the Government for being actuated by a desire to confer some commercial advantage upon British, manufacturers, although I did not think that their proposals were sufficiently generous. In connexion with this matter, I feel that it is necessary for the Senate to uphold its status and to maintain its rights and privileges. The Bill which was sent forward for our acceptance was not in the form in which it was originally introduced bv the Government. It was amended in an important particular, contrary to the wishes of Ministers. Steps might have been taken to secure the recommittal of the measure in another place, in order to excise the objectionable provision, but the Government, although they believed that the advantage conferred bv the measure would be largely reduced, made no effort in that direction.' They preferred to send the Bill to this Chamber, in the hope that it would be emasculated in a certain manner, and when they found that their object could nor be attained in that War. they made an unconstitutional effort to bring the Senate into accord with the views entertained by members in another place. They even went to the length of endeavouring to pass a Bill to amend a measure that had not yet become law. If we, by our action tonight, prevent the Bill from becoming effective, practical legislation in the direction of extending preferential treatment to British goods will be delayed only for a few months. The next Parliament will be afforded an opportunity to deal with the matter upon a broader basis, in connexion with the general Tariff revision, which will soon have to be undertaken. Therefore, although I am strongly in favour of giving preference to the old country, I do not think that much harm can be done if the Senate expresses its resentment at the action of the Government in dragging the Governor-General into the arena of party politics. I shall vote in the direction of preventing the Bill from becoming law. </para>

                    <para>. - I think that we ought to discuss this matter fully before we take a step which we may regret. We know perfectly well that the Bill which it is now sought to amend embodied the principle of preference to Great Britain, and also contained a provision relating to the employment of white seamen upon British shins conveying preference goods to the Commonwealth. I voted for the latter provision-. Now it has been discovered that, owing to the obligations imposed by the treaties entered into by Great Britain without in any way consulting us, the conditions relating to the employment of white seamen cannot be carried into effect. In order to remove the condition in the measure which conflicts with the treaty obligations of the motherland, which also extend to us, the Government have adopted the course open to them under the Constitution, in order to afford' the Senate another opportunity to deal with the question. We know that there are three parties in this Chamber, one which is opposed to anything in the way of preferential trade with Great Britain, another which is in favour of preferential trade, and a third party which, besides favouring preferential trade, is also anxious to secure additional protection for Australian manufacturers. I would urge those who believe in preferential trade and in giving added protection to Australian industries, to surrender the condition as to British ships, in order that the remaining provisions may become operative. We may enlarge the scope of the measure at some future time. I do not think that there is any force in the observation that the Governor-General has been dragged into the mire of party politics. Ministers have power under the Constitution to adopt the course that they have followed in this case, and His Excellency has taken no more personal interest in this matter than in any other in regard to which he may forward a message to Parliament. There is nothing in the suggestion that an attempt is being made to bulldoze the Senate. What is being done now is this : it has been pointed out to us that we cannot get all our own way, but the Government is giving us an opportunity to obtain part of that which we desire. Are we going to refuse the whole simply because we cannot secure everything that we desire? That would be a foolish policy. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable senator is referring to the Immigration Restriction Bill, I would point out that we compromised with our consciences even on that measure. Every member of the party was in favour of the direct exclusion of all coloured races, and yet we agreed to the language test, as the only possible compromise. We are asked now to take a similar action in this connexion. Britain has entered into engagements which she cannot abrogate, even if she would, without notice. Her commerce being world-wide, her engagements must be kept. That being the case, apparently we cannot get all that we want. I wish that we could. I voted for the provision that is now under discussion. </para>

                    <para>.- I hope the Minister of Defence will remember his promise to remind the Prime Minister about obtaining one or more of the obsolete British war vessels as training ships for Australia. It is important that one or more of the States should have vessels, such as the <inline font-style="italic">Sobraon,</inline> in order to train our boys and youths, and excite their interest in our naval defence. With such ships we could train our youths to be sailors, and the vessels would afford a satisfactory method of dealing with boys whom we do not desire to send to gaol, but who would be improved by reformatory methods. </para>

                    <para>. - If honorable senators turn to the second report of the Commonwealth Public Service Commissioner, which has been placed in our hands to-day, they will find that he deals very exhaustively with two Queensland matters which came before the Supreme Court recently. I am sorry that this report was not placed at our disposal at an earlier period, because it contains a great deal of controversial matter, and enters exhaustively into details relating to the management and conduct of the service. At any rate, he deals at much length with the case of <inline font-style="italic">Gavegan</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth,</inline> and also the case of <inline font-style="italic">Hart</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth.</inline> I think that honorable senators who recently assisted the Government in refusing me access to the documents in connexion with those cases mav very well regret the action that they then took. I was only interested in discovering, if possible, where lay the fault for the gross mismanagement which resulted, not only in the Commonwealth losing several thousands of pounds, but in two public servants being hunted out of the service, and practically ruined. Had these papers been placed before the Senate we should have had some opportunity to discover whether all the fault and blame lay on the side of the officials. On page 33 of his report the Public Service Commissioner says - </para>

The Commissioner goes on to say - the departmental files, disclosing that, instead of devoting himself to his own duties, he was continually writing to the head of his Department, in a tone quite unbecoming a junior official, proffering advice as to how that officer should administer his Department. </para>

It appears to me that the Commissioner, in his desire to make out a strong case against Hart, lays himself open to the most severe criticism. The Commissioner's statement is either correct or incorrect; and, if correct, then, according to the Commissioner, it was all right for Hart to devote himself to other than his own work during business hours.

If a member of the Public Service thinks he deserves more salary than he is receiving, he has every right to apply for an increase ; but, apparently, the Public Service Commissioner regards such a step as a sin, for which the erring employe is deserving of the most severe punishment. </para>

The trouble towards the end arose from a very trifling cause. It appears that, like a great many people filling much higher positions in life, Hart was troubled with a stomach that did not do its work properly, and, on the advice of his doctor, he found it necessary for his health that he should have a hot lunch every day. It appears that this, offended the susceptibilities of the high and mighty heads: of the Department in which he worked. The other employes had bowed the knee to Baal, and had accommodated themselves to the order that no man was to leave the building for lunch without permission. Hart did not, or would not </para>

                        <para>- That is a very easy way out of it, but there is, another assumption which I prefer to adopt. If this man offended in the way alleged, his superior officer was grossly at fault for not having reported him, and ought to be dismissed. It was, only when Hart began to tread upon the corns: of these people in a real fashion that they started a persecution which ultimately resulted in his being turned out of the service and practically ruined. The Public Service Act allows, every assistant officer three-quarters of an hour in which to take his lunch, and says nothing which would prevent his going out to get it. I undertake to say that the heads of Departments do not take a cold lunch inside the building, with tea heated up a second time. I am sure the Public Service Commissioner treats his stomach much more gallantly than apparently he is prepared to ask his subordinates to do. If he does not, he is a bigger fool than I take him to be. In his, report, he has quoted the following remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Chubb . made to Hart during the hearing of the case : - </para>

It is said that Hart fixed his own luncheon and breakfast hours, irrespective of departmental or public convenience. But if that is true, why was he retained in the service? My own impression is that this statement is a direct falsehood, got up for the purpose of shielding the officers of the Department. </para>

                        <para>- We have the Public Service Commissioner's statement that Hart performed his duties satisfactorily, and apparently the Commissioner's idea of satisfactory performance of duty is for an officer to come in late and go out early, do nothing in the meantime, and to fix his own meal hours. Does not the whole thing bear on the face of it the stamp of deliberate falsehood? If the statements made are true, the men in charge of Hart should have been dismissed years ago.. It is probable that, like many others, Hart had his peculiarities and-he has had to suffer for them. But I do contend that there is something rotten in the Postal Department when such things can happen. Honorable senators may recollect that last year I referred to what was a scandalous affair - a case in which a man had actually been paid over £80 in salary during the time he ought to have been in gaol. The Public Service Commissioner in Hart's case studiously conceals the fact that the Department paid him over £200 while he was kicking his heels about in Brisbane, doing nothing, and did not even enter the office. He was paid this money under the nose of the Public Service Commissioner, and with 'his consent. That again proves abundantly that there is something very far wrong in the Postal Department. I know that Hart's case is now beyond remedy, and I wish to say a few words with regard to the Gavegan  case. The Public Service Commissioner goes verv minutely info this case also. He states everything carefully which might be made to tell against Gavegan , but studiously conceals a vital point in connexion with the case. Sneaking of Gavegan, he writes - </para>

                </quote>
                <para class="block">When I tell honorable senators that Gavegan  was a married man, with a family of nine or ten young children, and the only accommodation provided for himself and family at Bauhinia Downs was the operating room and one other room, they will not wonder that this particular station was not altogether to Gavegan 's liking. I know some members of the Committee who, if they were subjected to an indignity of this character, would make the very elements ring with their complaints. I claim that the transfer of Gavegan  to this position at Bauhinia Downs was merely an incident in a continued persecution which had been carried out against him by his superior officers for years, and which culminated in that particular act of maladministration. I need not say any more about Gavegan . He is out of the service. Probably he did not behave in every particular as he ought to have done. How many members of any service have done so? The question is whether he deserved to be sent away with his family to a place where there was no accommodation for them, where there was no school, and far removed from civilization. If he really deserved punishment of that kind, it would have been more humane to have turned him out of the service at once. My information is that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gavegan</inline> was a good officer, and his only fault was that he stuck up like a man for his rights, and would not allow himself to be trampled upon by his superiors. He was, in fact, a bit of an agitator, like some of my friends on the other side, who have very little sympathy with Gavegan , or with the man who is talking about him. That is the reason why Gavegan , and Hart also, fell into disfavour with the superior officers of the Department. He was a man, not a thing like a great number of them. He would not crawl to his superiors ; he stood upright, as any other man would, and that is the reason why he was submitted to all this persecution, and ultimately hunted out of the service. There is only one other thing I wish to say in regard to Hart. It is a most peculiar thing that, in his report, the Public Service Commissioner says that inducements ought to he held out to enterprising and energetic men who recommend improved methods of carrying on the business of the Post Office. I think that every encouragement should be given to members of the Post Office staff to think out and suggest methods by which the business of the Department may be more effectively carried on. On several occasions Hart had recommended improvements which were adopted by the Department; but in doing so it is evident that he earned the resentment of his superior officer. He was too clever, and had to be got rid of, hence the systematic prosecution was initiated, which resulted in his being turned at last out of the service and completely ruined. If the session were not nearing its end, I would again ask the Government to allow me access to the papers in connexion with these cases. I do not know whether it would be in order next session, if I live, to make a motion in that direction, but if it is, I trust that honorable senators, instead of supporting this star-chamber business in connexion with the Department, will assist me in letting in the light of day. Mv concluding remark is that, whatever the faults of Gavegan and Hart may have been - arid I do not claim that they were without faults - the faults of the men in charge, who are still in receipt of their high salaries, and who are still, it may be presumed, mismanaging their branches of the Department, as ' they were then, have not been discovered and laid bare, as they ought to be. </para>

                    <para>.- I desire to emphasize what I said yesterday on the very much discussed question of overtime work bv telegraphists in the larger cities. I have looked up a regulation, dated May, 1:902, which says in effect that whenever telegraphists are asked by the postmaster to come back and work on Sunday, they shall be paid at the rate of time and a half for Sunday work. It is a strange thing that, on the 31st January, 1906, another regulation was issued, the effect of which was to annul the other. It em-' powers the Department to pay at the rate of time and a half - </para>

After that Act was passed, a regulation was issued to carry out the provision, and for some time I suppose it was observed. The intention of the Parliament was to discourage Sunday work as far as possible.

                        <para>- Probably the information of the Honorary Minister is later than mine. At any rate, the effect of the later regulation is that Sunday work is, if anything, encouraged, not discouraged. We ail want to discourage Sunday work as far as possible. I hold that if any officer is required by the Department to work on a Sunday he should be paid at the Sunday rate. Private employes set an example to the Department in that regard. In a large number of occupations if a private employer wants his hands to work on Sun day he pays them at the rate of time and a half or time and a quarter. In the mining industry, for instance, when a man is asked to do Sunday work, no matter how necessary it may be, the general rule is to pay him at the rate of time and a half. Surely the Post and Telegraph Department should not treat its servants with less consideration than private employers treat their hands ! In my opinion telegraphists labour under a grievance when they are not paid overtime for Sunday work. In every walk of life a man likes to have his Sunday to himself. A large number of the telegraphists are married, and it is only natura] that they should wish to spend' Sunday at home. Some men may have religious scruples, and would rather not work unless it were absolutely necessary. Of course where Sunday, work is necessary, every officer should be sufficiently loyal to go back on that day and serve his Department. But the point is that Parliament has enacted a provision that if Sunday work is required of an officer it shall be paid for at the rate of time and a half. The regulation is, I submit, a dishonest means of evading the spirit of the Act, and the wish of Parliament, and the dishonesty must be on the part of the Commissioner. He should be asked at once to give reasons for his action, and unless he can furnish very good reasons indeed the improper practice should be discontinued. I am not always in sympathy with very many complaints which we hear from public officers, because I know that very many of them are better off than they would be if employed outside. But this is a case where the manifest intention of the Parliament is being evaded, and, I hold, dishonorably evaded, by the action of the Commissioner. The very wording of the second regulation shows that it is being intentionally done, because the words " having already worked six days in the week" were not contained in the first regulation. I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> will ask the Postmaster-General to remedy the grievance of the telegraphists. The Public Service Act says that by regulation a climatic allowance may be' made to public officers who are employed in remote parts of the Commonwealth or in places where the severity of the climate or other extraordinary cause makes living dearer than elsewhere.

                        <para>- I am very glad to hear that statement. I asked the other day whether a climatic allowance was made to public officers on the West Coast of Tasmania, where it rains on 260 days in the year - practically on two days out of every three - and living is much more expensive than in other parts. In every avocation there private employers have to pay more there than is paid elsewhere. Let me give one instance. In other parts of Tasmania the average wage of an underground miner is 7s. 6d. per shift, or £2 5s. per week, while on the West Coast the lowest wage paid is 8s. 4d. per shift, or £2 10s. per week. All grades of employment connected with mining are remunerated on an increased scale there in comparison with other parts of the country. </para>

                        <para>- An ordinary miner on the West Coast, working in a dry mine, gets the same rate of wage as a miner employed in a wet-working mine in other parts of the country. Living on the West Coast is also dearer by 5s. a week than in other parts of the State. This is a very fair instance for the Minister to bear in mind when the case is being reviewed. It was always understood that the climatic allowance would be extended to the West Coast of Tasmania, which practically comprises only mining fields. I trust that the Minister will see that justice is done to the officers in that part of the country. </para>

The effect of the second amendment made by the House of Representatives is to enable the Commonwealth to take over any part of the debt of a State without taking over a corresponding part of the debts of the other States. I believe that that amendment will effect a great improvement. But at present we are dealing only with the first amendment which is to omit " since " and insert "at any time after." </para>

                    <para>- The adoption of this report, it seems to me, will have to be carried by an absolute majority. The Constitution says that a Bill of this nature must be passed by. both Houses by absolute majorities; and the passing seems to be the final act before it leaves this Chamber. Although there has been only a very small amendment made, so far as the wording is concerned, since the Bill was passed in this Chamber by an absolute majority of the Senate, I cannot say whether or not that amendment may have an important effect. The view I have now suggested was that taken in another place. There must be a division. </para>
