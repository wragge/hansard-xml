The routine for carrying on the business of the Senate is as follows :  - First, reading of prayers ; second, presentation of petitions; third, giving notices and questions without notice; fourth, questions on notice; fifth, formal motions ; and then the rearrangement of business. </para>

              <para>- I have no complaint against honorablesenators on the other side for not rising. I only asked certain senators to rise, and they  did.  As the Royal Commission on Tobacco Monopoly has Handed in its report to the GovernorGeneral, it has ceased to exist, and, therefore, cannot deal with this case. I merely intend to quote the facts for the information of the Senate, and the Government,  and  to ask thelatter to look into the case, and see if it is not possible to take such action as will protect this witness against the alleged attempted intimidation. The first paper I propose to read is a statutory declaration by an employe of this company, who has been discharged - </para>

          <para class="block">Passing over that portion of the evidence whichrefers to other questions, I come to the first mention of the matter in respect of which he was afterwards called upon for an apology. It reads as follows: - </para>
          <para>The only deputations from the union that have waited on the firm have been since the females were brought in. One thing always thrown at the men is that the women are more economical. We have good reason to dispute that. When I met <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shaw,</inline> on 29th August, 1904, he quoted to me that the girls were beating us by&#163;3 in the hundred. I told him, if he wished it, he could&#39; put two females alongside of me, and I would guarantee to give him a better output in the number of blocks and in the average of leaf, but he said they looked on me as an expert. I then told him that any man in the room could do it. He wrote back telling us he would run out the month of September, and that he found the females were making further advance on us, and that it was not advantageous to his company. During that month we were all supposed to be on a test, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shaw</inline> threw out a challenge. The union accepted it, on the condition that they be allowed an arbitrator, because we knew the leaf was tampered with. The boys at the bin said that when the men knocked off at half-past 3 it was disgraceful to see what was done with the leaf. After that members of the union used to stay behind, and they caught the foreman bringing the females&#39; returns and mixing them in with the leaf, so that when they came next morning to start it would be taken as an average. No test was made. Everything went on the same till November last year, when we had occasion to approach <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Weeks,</inline> and I consider it unjust on his part to make such a demand on account of the leaf they had to work. They commenced to weigh out the leaf not up to the standard. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Laurence,</inline> assistant manager, told the men if they did not average 10 lbs. work out of every pound of leaf he would discharge them. Against that the union protested, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Laurence</inline> called the men up and cautioned them. They showed the foreman the class of leaf they had to work, and that it would be impossible to get the required number from it. The union met the manager, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Weeks,</inline> in November, and explained the stand taken up. He said the females were averaging 10 lbs. out of every pound of leaf, which we disputed, as we received the same as they did. He said it came out of the same hogshead, but we told him that every hogshead did not run alike. We also had to speak about the making of the flake. I am sorry to have to say so, but the work has to be taken to the foreman to be passed, and if it is returned the employe has to forego his day&#39;s work. The flake was that bad that I could not make a decent job of it. We wrote to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shaw,</inline> asking him to receive a deputation on the subject, and although he replied that we had made certain charges against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Weeks</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Laurence</inline> - the union wrote telling him they could prove them and could produce documents - but he would not listen to us unless there was a report posted up in the factory. We told him it could not be done till the deputation took their report back to the union. </para>
          <para>That is the whole of the evidence given by that witness as regards this particular part of the work. I propose now to read a letter which was sent to the witness by the company - </para>

          <para>Dear <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, -</inline> You are aware that the opportunity offered you of proving the charge of dishonest practices, made in your statement before the Royal Commission, was brought to a standstill by your solicitors, Messrs. Brown and Beeby, stating in their letter of 27th February that the Union, on further reflection, declined to be parties to any inquiry into the truth or otherwise of the statements made, and suggesting that the company had recourse by instituting a prosecution against you for perjury. </para>
          <para>The matter was allowed to stand in abeyance pending the arbitration case, when we fully expected that this charge would have been again brought up, seeing how important a bearing it had on the question of the economy in wrappers as between men and women. </para>
          <para>You did, at the Arbitration Court, repeat the charge originally made before the Royal Commission, and this time went so far as to mention names in support of your evidence, but beyond your own bald statement no witness was called, nor evidence whatever produced. </para>
          <para>Seeing the enormous advantage such evidence would have been to your party during the recent proceedings, it is not to be conceived that your legal advisers  would  have failed in producing it, and so we are forced into the belief that they also gave no credence to your statement. </para>
          <para>Our duty, therefore, first to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lawrence,</inline> the foreman, whom we consider you have so grossly wronged, is that you shall make reparation to him in the form of an approved apology ; for had your charge been proven he would have lost his situation; and secondly, an equalapology to ourselves, whom you have endeavoured to hold up to public discredit. </para>
          <para>At the close of the Arbitration Court proceedings we expected that you would probably tender an apology, and we have delayed writing in consequence. (Signed) W. G. Shaw, </para>

          <para class="block">That letter has upon it the stamp of the British- Australasian Tobacco Company, and the signature of the managing director. It will be noticed that in the course of this statement <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stone</inline> refers to the Royal Commission, and he says that he declined to go any further with the statement, acting on the advice of the members of the Commission. The only thing of which I have any cognizance in regard to the matter is that some time after <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stone</inline> had given evidence before the Commission in Sydney, he came to me in the precincts of this building, and told me that the British-Australasian Tobacco Company wanted him to make a statement in a public manner, and that they would have an inquiry made, and would- abide by the re.-ult. Hp told me, also, that his solicitor had advised bini that the company could proceed against him for perjury, if they thought he had committed perjury, and could prove it; or could proceed against the two persons who had made the statutory declarations. He asked me what I thought he ought to do under the circumstances. I told him that of course my advice was simply that of a layman, and that he had! to decide for himself ; but that, so far as I could see, if the company wanted redress, it could get it by proceeding against him for perjury, or by proceeding against the persons who made the declarations upon which he based his statement. I added that if I were in his place I should leave the company to take the course open to it. </para>

              <para>- A Royal Commission is not conducted with the same strict legality as a court of law. In fact, the Commission regarded the statements as a mere side issue. I did not think it necessary to pursue the subject even to the extent of asking for the authority for the statements. We had before us in the following week in Melbourne the general manager of all the factories, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilkins</inline> ; and although <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilkins</inline> took exception to statements which had been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stanley</inline> in Melbourne, and also to  statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stone,</inline> he did not take exception to this particular statement. So that whatever importance may be attached to the statement by others, the Commission did not attach much importance to it, and did not follow up the question. I do not pretend to be in a position to say whether the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stone</inline> could be corroborated or not, but it was made in evidence, and there is a remedy if false statements are made in evidence. </para>

The powers, privileges, and immunities of this Parliament in reference to matters of this sort are declared in section 49 of the Constitution to be the powers, privileges, and immunities of the House of Commons, until we declare them. We have not yet declared our powers, privileges, and immunities, and therefore we have to fall back on those of the House of Commons. I find, on re ference to <inline font-style="italic">May,</inline> that there is full power to take action for the protection of witnesses.

            <para>On the 7th April, 1S9.2, a member of the House, who was a director of the Cambrian Railway Company, attended the House in his place, and two other directors and the manager of the company, at the Bar, under an order of the House, made in consequence of a special report from the Select Committee on Railway Servants (hours of labour). The Committee reported that, in the course of their inquiry, it came to their knowledge that allegations were made that certain persons had been reduced or dismissed from the service of the company, in consequence of the evidence, they had given before the Committee, and that in the case of one person, John Hood, he was dismissed by the company mainly in consequence of charges arising out of the evidence given by him before the Committee. </para>

            <para>. - All that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> hag asked is that the Government shall make an inquiry. Personally, I promise that all the necessary inquiries shall be made, and a report submitted to the Senate. It is a wellunderstood principle that a man giving evidence before* a Select Committee of the House must give it in absolute good faith. We do not protect a witness who casts unfair aspersions on others or tells untruths; but if a witness has given his evidence honestly, and in good faith, I think it is the duty of the Parliament to protect him. It is our duty to project to the greatest possible extent those who appear before Select Committees and Royal Commissions. It frequently happens that men will not give evidence before Select Committees or Royal Commissions lest it may lead to their dismissal from really good employment. One of the difficulties which Select Committees and Royal Commissions experience in investigating any matter submitted to them is the dread of employes to give evidence which may result ultimately in the loss of their employment. That being so, it is our duty to protect witnesses appearing before such bodies. The case brought forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> seems to be a complex one. I followed his statements closely, and J&#34; have no doubt that the Attorney-General will look into the matter, and appoint some one who has a knowledge of the law relating to the subject, and&#39; who has some training in the sifting of evidence to make inquiries. Tha!; having, been done, a report will be made to the Senate, and if we think it necessary, doubtless such action will be tak-?n as the law permits </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lt.-Col.</inline>GOULD (New South Wales) &#91;3.7&#93;. - I am sure that no honorable senator would defend any one who attempted to deal unfairly with a witness who had given evidence honestly and in good faith before a Royal Commission, butit is just as well that we should make the position perfectly clear. If a witness gives his evidence honestly and straightforwardly, he ought not to be punished for doing that which the law really requires him to do. But before bringing a matter of this kind before the Senate, we ought to be satisfied that such a step is justifiable. It would be competent for a man to give evidence before a Royal Commission that he had been told of various matters detrimental to the interests of some individual or firm. </para>

              <para>.- Or derogatory of an individual&#39;s character, and to say subsequently, &#34; I was told by an individual whose name I will not disclose, that the facts were as stated.&#34; In this way, a witness might, with the object of injuring a firm, give evidence that was absolutely false, and we should not be able to touch him, since we could not prove its falsity. Who could prove that the information he gave to the Commission had not been, as he alleged/ communicated to him? If he were prosecuted1 for perjury, it would be for the Crown to prove his guilt ; it would not be for him ro prove his innocence. In these circumstances, we need to be careful as to what action we take. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has said that this witness made the statement in question honestly believing it to be true, because he had been supplied with declarations by two employes who alleged that it was. What has been done by the company? They have said to this man, &#34; We want an inquiry into this matter; if you can prove your charge, this employe* will be at once dismissed.&#34; And if the manager chose to do such an unjust thing as has been alleged bv <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> dismissal would be by no means a severe punishment. On the other hand, it is unjust to allow such a charge to be preferred against a man without any attempt being made to prove it. If this employe^ who says&#39; he has lost his position, had told the company that he made the statement upon mere hear-say, and had produced the declarations upon which he based it, he would have cleared himself. </para>

              <para>.- I cannot say. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> one of these declarations is dated December, 1904, or some time anterior to the evidence given before the Commission. _ When his employers wished to make an inquiry Stone ought to have handed his declarations to them, leaving them to deal with the matter as thev thought fit. Another point is that since the evidence was given an inquiry has taken place before the Arbitration Court of New South Wales. These men might well have given evidence before that Court. If thev had done so, the law of New South Wales would have prevented their dismissal. The New South Wales Arbitration Act provides that an employe* shall not be dismissed for giving evidence before that Court, the reason for  this being that the Court requires at times to secure clear evidence on certain matters, even though it may be to the disadvantage of an employer. If this man has unwisely neglected the opportunity offered him to vindicate himself, and to declare his own position, is it reasonable that we should- </para>

              <para>.- Why did he not bring forward these declarations earlier? If the production of these declarations would have led to the dismissal of the men who made them, will not their production at the present time have the same result? One is inclined to believe that it was felt that their evidence would not stand the test of cross-examination. Had it been submitted to the Arbitration Court those whose honour is impugned would have had an opportunity to test it by cross-examination. Whilst I give <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> credit for doing what he believes to be just, I think he has made a serious mistake in bringing this matter before Parliament. Such an action tends to drag down individuals when there is really no evidence to substantiate the charge made against them. The declarations referred to are perfectly good until an inquiry has shown them to be false. The honorable senator is unwittingly doing a great injustice to the employers who have been charged upon such evidence as that to which he has referred this afternoon. </para>

              <para>- That is a pertinent inquiry. As I pointed out by interjection just now, a Judge of the Supreme Court is appointed by the Governor in Council. Suppose this man had given evidence before a Judge of the Supreme Court, and he had been dismissed in consequence, could that have been said to be a breach, of the privileges of the Senate? </para>

              <para>- I am not claiming that the Act is in force here, although it seems to me that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has good grounds for assuming that it is. At any rate, if it is in force, this is a matter with which the Government ought to deal. If the Act is not in force here, and as we have not yet declared our powers byStatute, I think the Government may act, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> ought to be satisfied with the promise given; certainly, I am. I confess at once that I do not know sufficient of the. question to form an opinion. The whole of the correspondence, voluminous as it appears to be, ought to be before us before we arrive at any decision ; and the promise of the Government is adequate for present purposes. But it is an unnecessary and gratuitous abnegation of our functions to say that the alleged action is not an infringement of either the powers or privileges of Parliament. Whether declared by Statute or not, undoubtedly we must protect, by the strongest possible means at our disposal, the complete independence of witnesses before tribunals appointed at our instance, as certainly this tribunal was. Whether there has been unjust intimidation or not, is a question on which I shall not express an opinion, because I regard the matter as too serious; an opinion ought to be declared only after such careful inquiry as the Government have undertaken to make. The Senate passed very strong Standing Orders, and, if I remember rightly, embodied them in a Statute in order to protect witnesses who-- * </para>

              <para>- If the honorable senator will allow me to proceed, I shall tell him. These charges were made by a man named Stone at a meeting of a Royal Commission, appointed nominally by the Crown, but really by this Parliament. The language that the charges were clothed in was respectful enough, and to it no exception was taken ; the objection was to the statements themselves. From the evidence before us, I think that those statements were made <inline font-style="italic">bond fide,-</inline> and the proof of that is in the fact that two men employed in this factory have voluntarily signed statutory declarations that they are true. </para>

              <para>- I cannot say, but by making the statutory declarations they have brought themselves within the law if their statements are false. Stone, in his evidence, said that he had been informed as to the alleged facts, and  1  believe he said that <inline font-style="italic">bona fide.</inline> Of course, I know of no Court which would take evidence on hear-say ; and I do not think this evidence was admissible, or of any value; in fact, in my opinion, the subject was not one for the Royal Commission. The fact remains, however, that this employe* gave evidence, which, in my opinion, he thought was absolutely correct. The evidence was not clothed in offensive language; but, for giving it, this man was discharged after twenty years&#39; service. </para>

              <para>- If this sort of thing is permitted without any inquiry or protest from Parliament, any employe will be liable to dismissal if he dares to give evidence against the interests of his employer, and the result will be a reign of terror. What did the House of Commons do in a very analogous case ? When some men were dismissed for giving evidence before a Royal Commission, the directors of the company concerned were brought to the Bar of the Houseand made to apologise for their action, severe strictures being passed on them for daring to discharge a man under the circumstances. Have we no right to make inquiry when we find the House of Commons adopting such an attitude ? To hear some honorable senators talk it might be thought that to dismiss an employe in such a way, without inquiry, is perfectly right. I repeat that this man was dismissed because he said what he believed to foe perfectly true. I hope that the Government will institute a very searching inquiry. </para>

For instance, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> said that it is a mere farce to bring the case before the Senate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> may look upon the matter as a far:e, but to this man, who has to seek employment in an industry which is in the hands of a monopoly, it contains very little of the farcical element. It is rather a tragedy than a farce to him. </para>

We know how difficult it was to get witnesses. The retailers in this trade were actually afraid to come forward. Why ? &#39;Because they realized that they could be shut down upon. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stone</inline> was put forward by his Union to give evidence, and for that act he was afterwards boycotted. He has not an opportunity of going to another firm, because the whole of this tobacco business is practically in the hands of a monopoly. Is that a farce to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stone?</inline> It is a very serious matter,  and the Senate is quite  justified  in getting a review of his treatment. </para>

              <para>- Would not <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stone</inline> have acted very foolishly if he had made statements outside which were likely to lead to the initiation of legal proceedings against himself? On two occasions he made the statements in places where his employers could have refuted them if &#39; false, or taken whatever action they thought fit, but they did&#39; not do so. The man is now boycotted, and we have a just right to ask that his case should be investigated by the Government. I do not wish to say who is right or who is wrong, but I think that the Government would be failing in their&#39; duty if they did. not come to the rescue of a witness in this position. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir JOSIAH</inline>SYMON (South Australia) &#91;3.40&#93;. - Although I agree with a good deal of what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> said, the substance of this motion involves a good deal more than the immediate question in connexion with Stone. Every one of us is so imbued with the sentiment and determination that a witness, honestly giving his evidence, shall be protected in all circumstances, as he is in our Courts, and as he is in bodies which institute inquiries analogous to those heard in our Courts, that the temptation to bring forward matters which may concern the Chamber in relation to an infringement of that good sound rule is very great. Although, having heard the facts, I think it would, perhaps, have been wiser if the  matter had not been brought before the Senate, still, as I have said, the temptation to take that course is very great, and the necessity of calling attention to any infringement of that old .rule is an excuse for any one doing it. No one can complain of the moderation of tone and statement which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> displayed. It is what we expected from him : in this instance, the expectation has been fully realized. He stated the facts, read the letters, and mentioned what his desire was. I should have said nothing on the subject, probably, but for the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith.</inline> He did not exhibit that judicial mind, and quite that fairness in apprehending the facts, which we should have expected of him. When he stated emphatically that Stone was dismissed simply because he had given before the Royal Commission evidence which he believed to be true, he stated a point which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> did not put forward and one which the facts submitted by that honorable senator do not support. Again <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> was mistaken when he said that <inline font-style="italic">de facto</inline> it was a Royal Commission of the Senate. It may be <inline font-style="italic">de jure</inline> a Royal Commission of the Senate, but certainly it did not owe its power or authority to the Senate. </para>

              <para>- No; it is the exception for a Royal Commission to be initiated by Parliament. It owes no allegiance to Parliament in any shape. Its reports are not presented to Parliament except after they have gone to the GovernorGeneral, and then no doubt they are presented with a view to acquainting Parliament with the contents of the reports and the nature of the evidence. The Executive may bring down the reports to Parliament if they choose. A Royal Commission has in its essence and in its proceedings no relation to or connexion with Parliament, and no doctrine as to the privileges which concern a Select Committee has anything to do with a Royal- Commission. </para>

              <para>- That Parliament may request that a Royal Commission be appointed no one doubts, but the Governor-General or the Executive Government may 1 or may not make the appointment. In England the Government appoint Royal Commissions by the thousand without reference to Parliament. Therefore the Imperial Statute to which reference has been made has no bearing on this subject, and1 the sooner we disabuse our minds of any idea of that kind the better. If we want 10 legislate on the subject so as to have a specific law we can do so, though I really cannot see what the Government mean by saying that they are going to have an inquiry. Of course that is a very easy way of getting over a motion of this kind. I cannot understand what inquiry there can lie unless they appoint a Royal Commission or get a Select Committee of the Senate to investigate - what? Whether an employe of a tobacco company has been dismissed for just cause or not. Surely nothing of the kind will be done ! My honorable friend said that the Attorney-General would be consulted. What can the latter do? He can do nothing apart from a specific violation of a law. If an employer discharges an employe the latter has his remedy, but it is not a matter for Parliament to interfere with. Parliament may legislate and the Arbitration Court may inquire, but short of the tribunals which Parliament has appointed it does not seem to me that any inquiry can be more than a mere caprice. No result can possibly follow from it in this or any similar case. Let me recall the simple facts of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce&#39;s</inline> statements. I feel strongly that a witness before a- Royal Commission should be protected absolutely. </para>

              <para>- There is plenty of power in another way. The particular portion of Stone&#39;s evidence which was referred to was entirely gratuitous. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has said it was quite irrelevant to the subject-matter of the inquiry. Probably it was so regarded and Iras not further pursued. It certainly had no bearing on the question of the tobacco monopoly. Whether it was an honest statement made in good faith or not, it was a gratuitous and wanton statement, irrelevant to the subject-matter of the inquiry. </para>

              <para>- It did a wrong to a fellow workman, and if it had been proved, the employers would not only have been justified but bound to dismiss their foreman. It was not merely an allegation of a dishonest practice, so far as the firm was concerned, but of a gross fraud ; a fraud committed for a purpose. That was the kind of charge that was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stone</inline> - made, it is admitted from hear -say. If that evidence had been tendered before a court of law, it would not have been admitted, but before a Royal Commission there is, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> very properly said, greater latitude, and sometimes we might say, perhaps, a little less regularity. And necessarily so. No one can complain of it. Making these statements on hear-say evidence, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stone</inline> did not give the name of his informants. The next step was that the employers did a right and proper thing. I am bound to say that they did what they ought to do. They wrote, saying, &#34; You must substantiate these statements. If you substantiate them, the foreman must go, but if you do not substantiate them you must go.&#34; They had a perfect right to do that; and, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> there is not a fair-minded and just man in Australia who would not say that the employers were perfectly justified in tasking that course. If an employe gives evidence, in the course of which he imputes dishonest practices to a fellow-workman, he must either substantiate them or he must go. How could business be carried on otherwise? How could an employer keep a perjurer in his employment? He could not possibly do such a thing. </para>

              <para>- I am afraid that my honorable friend&#39;s mind is not as judicial as it ought to be. This <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stone</inline> was asked to make a statement publicly, not sheltered under the cloak of privilege, as a witness before a Royal Commission, but so that an action might be brought against him for slander. If he had taken that course it would have been possible for him to call his informants, and to&#39; substantiate what he had said. That was the only way in which it could be done. My honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline></para>

          <para class="block">Pearce very properly suggests that there was another way. If he will forgive my saying so, there was no other way. A prosecution for perjury would have been perfectly hopeless. A prosecution for making a statutory declaration in violation of an Act of Parliament would have been hopeless. The statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stone</inline> was made on information. The question whether the statement thus made was true or not could not have been investigated in the manner suggested. Therefore, with great respect to the view which my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> hasput, I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stone</inline> ought to have accepted the offer made to him. He ought to have said to his employers, &#34; Certainly; I will make the statement to Tom Smith..&#34; It need not have been made publicly. Such a statement, so made, would have enabled an action to have been brought against him for libel, and he would then have had an opportunity to substantiate his statement. That was a perfectly fair and just offer, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stone</inline> would have been well advised to accept it. &#34;Unhappily, he appears to have been advised to reject it. He refused to substantiate his statement. That is what it comes to. He was ill-advised also in respect of the letter from the union, in which, I think - I do not want to use any harsh term, because we are not here to sit in judgment - he evaded the responsibility which rested upon him of either Substantiating the charge of dishonest practice or withdrawing it. He was given the alternative, and I think it was his duty - if I may say so with all respect - either to withdraw the statement, and comply with the reasonable request of his employers, or to take steps to substantiate it. The company wrote him a letter. He did not reply. He took no notice of it. He literally defied them. He said, &#34;I will not withdraw the statement, and I will not substantiate it.&#34; In those circumstances, I cannot, for the life of me, see what other course they could have taken to protect their employes. We are not dealing with the question of trusts or no trusts, or with combinations or anything of that kind. We may ask ourselves, &#34; What could an individual employer do under the circumstances, if he was satisfied that one of his employes had committed perjury against another?&#34; Every one of us in this Senate would, I am sure, if a witness had been discharged for giving evidence before a </para>
          <para class="block">Commission, denounce such conduct, and would stand by any action taken for the condemnation of the employers who had dismissed the witness. But when, as in this case, a man refuses either to withdraw or substantiate a statement defamatory of another employe, it seems to me that no other course could have been expected to be taken. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGREGOR</inline>(South Australia) &#163;3.52&#93;. - One is inclined to agree with such a great legal authority as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> upon a matter of this kind ; but his opinion only proves the difficult position in which an unfortunate employe&#39; stands under such circumstances as have been related. With respect to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon&#39;s</inline> statement that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stone&#39;s</inline> evidence was gratuitous, and had no connexion with the inquiry, I reply that it certainly had a connexion with it. Insinuations were made that women were doing the work of this monopolistic company, as it has&#39; been called, cheaper than men, and it was attempted &#39;to prove that women were more efficient than men. A trial was made. Whether it was a fair trial 011 not we cannot say. It was stated by this witness before the Royal Commission that the women were given an unfair advantage over the men. The man has been dismissed on account of that statement. It is idle to argue that he was dismissed because he would not substantiate the statement. If he had never given that evidence he certainly would not have been dismissed. No one questions the fact that he gave it In good faith. Now, it is said that he was dismissed because he did not reply to the letters of the company, and prove the statement he made before the Royal Commission. I want to know what right the company had to expect him to prove it. The evidence was given before a Royal Commission appointed by the GovernorGeneral. If the witness gave it in good faith, it was the duty of the company ;o go before the Commission and rebut the evidence, not to ask the witness to make his statement outside with the threat that they would prosecute him if he did. How can witnesses be expected to go before Royal Commissions and give evidence on nath, swearing to speak the truth, if they know they are liable to be challenged by some powerful company, with a threat that it will prosecute them, and take them to the High Court, and possibly to the Privy Council afterwards? As far as I can see, the justice of the case would have been met if a representative of the company had attended1 before the Royal Commission and rebutted <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stone&#39;s</inline> evidence. If he had given false evidence, it would have been shown that he had done what was wrong. I have not the least doubt that the Government will make inquiries into the case, and do all that is possible to see that justice is done. Yet, I ilo not see how they can do justice to this man. The only obvious remedy is that which has been incidentally suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> - for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stone</inline> to prosecute the tobacco monopoly for unlawful dismissal. But what possible chance would he have against so powerful a company ? The expenses would be piled up. It would be a glorious thing for the legal profession, before the unfortunate man got any justice. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> in his usual brilliant manner, took <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> to task for declaring that the Senate was in any way responsible. But it must be remembered that a resolution was passed by the Senate dealing, with the tobacco monopoly. There was much discussion on the subject all over Australia. Why was the Royal Commission appointed ? Was it not in consequence of the resolution of the Senate? Most decidedly. Therefore, to talk of the Senate having no responsibility is all nonsense. With respect to the heinous crime <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stone</inline> alleged against this firm, and for his evidence concerning which he was dismissed, I can speak with some amount of knowledge. I am surprised that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray,</inline> who has had much experience amongst working men, did&#39; not ask <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stone,</inline> when he was before the Royal Commission, a few questions on this subject. The same thing as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stone</inline> alleged against the company has been done by other companies and firms. It is done by working men themselves. Better opportunities are given to some men to do work for purposes of comparison than are given to others. I have seen it myself. I have seen it in the course of work on an ordinary building. A man would be engaged on trial, and I have seen the labourers give him bats to build a wall with, * whilst they gave others good bricks - just for the purpose of comparison. I have seen it done by Government inspectors and overseers. They would give a piece of soft ground to a good man to pick out in side ditching, and would form comparisons between what he did and the work of other men. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> knows very well that it is done. </para>

            <para>- I should not like to attribute anything but the strictest veracity to the honorable senator, but really, he knows very little about railway work if he has not seen it done. I know that it was done on the railway on which I worked in South Australia, where the work was carried out by his firm. I worked under the firm of Barry. Brooks, and Fraser, side ditching and side cutting, on piece-work. A good man was put on to a piece of work, and was given a soft thing to do. The piece-work rate was fixed according to the standard that this man fixed. I have been through the mill, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> is a very innocent man indeed if he does not know that the piece-work price is ordinarily fixed according to the work of an individual who is getting every legitimate advantage in setting the standard. I do not say that a fair firm would give the man an illegitimate advantage. It is done for the purpose of fixing the piece-work standard of payment. It is done to Mie knowledge of every man who knows anything about work. </para>

Although I have no knowledge of this case other than that which I have gained by listening to the debate this afternoon, my experience teaches me to believe that the practice referred to may have- been adopted.

              <para>- No ; because I have always declined to work under such a handicap. These foremen were seeking to prove to their employers and the world at large that the women were better workers than the men, and they were carrying out the test in an unfair way.. I cannot see what can be done unless the Government, as the result of their investigations, discover a method of compelling the  company  to do justice to this man. He will never get justice by means of the machinery at present in existence to deal with the case. He may seek a remedy in the Courts, but he has not sufficient means to enable him to carry his case far enough to secure justice. For these reasons I hope that the Government will make the promised inquiry, that a report will be .submitted to the Senate, and that justice will ultimately be done to this unfortunate man. This is no farce, so far as he is concerned. He may hawk vegetables, if he pleases, but there is no possibility of his obtaining employment in a tobacco factory in Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> has said that we are always finding fault with the employers. I have been a member of Royal Commissions appointed by the Parliament of South Australia, as well as by this Legislature, and heard both employers and employes give evidence. I have known <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> and others of the same school of political thought to declare that working men are all afflicted with the ca&#39; canny trouble, and are not prepared to give an honest day&#39;s work for an honest day&#39;s pay. I have heard hundreds of statements of that description. If the unfortunate employe is always &#34; down. &#34; on the employer, it is only a case of tit for tat, judging by the examples we have had in the Senate and elsewhere of statements made by the one section against the other. It has always been the desire of the party to which I belong that no injustice shall be  done  to either an employer or an employe. </para>

Apparently, there are only two processes open to them - an inquiry by means of a Select Committee or by a Royal Commission. I rise to support an inquiry by the Government quite as much in the interests of the employers who have been so vigorously slandered as in the interests of the workman Stone. Some honorable senators have entirely overlooked the propriety of refraining from expressing an opinion on <inline font-style="italic">ex partestatements.</inline> We do not know anything about the men who have made the statutory declarations at the basis of the trouble.

              <para>- I do not think that either <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> expressed an opinion on the facts; they confined their attention to an expression of opinion on the law relating to the matter. We may express what opinions we like on the law, but we have no justification for giving utterance at this stage to our views on the facts. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> carefully steered clear of that mistake. I do not think any honorable senator could have brought the matter forward in a fairer or more straightforward manner. I have no complaint whatever to make against him. He stated what he understood to  be  the facts, and on that statement asked for Government intervention. I admit that there was no occasion for the heated harangues to which we have listened this afternoon. All of them were out of place. As the Government have undertaken to make an inquiry,we should let the matter rest. I shall be quite willing, at the propertime,  to  express an opinion, when I know what are the actual facts, and when  the  two sides, instead of only one side of the story are before us. As an inquiry has been asked for on behalf of one person who is alleged to be injured. I think I am perfectly justified in urging an inquiry in the interests of the others who have been attacked this afternoon. </para>

It has been reiterated again and again  by  honorable senators opposite that the names of the persons making the statutory declarations were not disclosed before to-day. As a matter of fact, the firm in question could have asked a member of the Commission to call for the names of the persons making the charges. Another point is that  we  have here a letter addressed  by  the firm to Stone on 7th, June, in which they say - </para>

        <para>I submit this motion with an expression of great regret that it should be necessary for the Senate over and over again, by resolution and by deliberate action, to demand a due recognition of the position which it occupies in the Federal Constitution. In the four or five years that have passed, there has been sufficient action on the part of this Chamber of its insistence on its constitutional position being recognised, to have in all reasonableness rendered it needless for me to take the course which I feel it my bounden duty to take this afternoon. I do not wish to arrogate to myself the position of defender of the Senate, but, somehow or other, it has fallen to my lot on previous occasions to take action in this connexion. I do so again to-day in consequence of the remarkable manifestation of - I suppose the least offensive phrase I can use is - ignorance or neglect of the position to which this Chamber is entitled. I refer to paragraphs  12  and 13 of the speech of His Excellency the Governor-General at the opening of Parliament in this Chamber a few days ago. The paragraphs are as follow: - </para>

        <para class="block">When the question of addressing the House of Representatives only with reference to the Estimates was before this Chamber two years ago, special attention was directed by the present Minister of Defence to the words &#34;your control,&#34; which them appeared. As the word &#34; your &#34; has been omitted on the present occasion, while some portion, at least, of the old objectionable paragraph has been retained, it seems clear that now there is no question of oversight or forgetfulness on the part of those responsible for the framing of the paragraph. Clearly they had the previous speech of the Governor-General before them, and on the  present occasion omitted the word &#34; your,&#34; to which the present Minister of Defence directed attention two years ago. While there has been previous evidence of the ignoring of this Chamber&#39;s constitutional position in reference to finance, I think paragraph 13 in the speech is infinitely more objectionable. It is addressed to the  House of Representatives wholly and solely, with reference to the representation of the people in that House. There is not the most impalpable basis of an  excuse in the Constitution for any person, in framing a speech to be placed in the mouth of  His Excellency,  to cause him to address solely to the House of Representatives a message or words relating to that matter. Surely the Senate is not absolutely without power and without authority of representation. I think it as well to have at least half-n-doz&#39;en honorable senators in the Chamber when a question of this kind is being discussed&#39;. <inline font-style="italic">&#91;Quorum formed.}</inline></para>

There have been at least two motions submitted here taking exception to the omission of all recognition of the Senate in Vice-Regal speeches. One of the motions was carried and the other was withdrawn on a promise that the thing should never occur again. There have been several resolutions passed here in connexion with Supply Bills, insisting upon a due recognition of the status of the Senate. I shall, therefore, merely refer to what took place on the 2nd March. 1904. On that occasion, there occurred these paragraphs in the Governor-General&#39;s Speech, and the extreme similarity of one of them to the first of the two paragraphs to which I take exception, in the recent Speech, is sufficiently remarkable to be worth notice. On the 2nd March, 1904, the Speech contained these two paragraphs - </para>

          <para>- My honorable friend knows that I am not saying one word which has a tinge of unkindliness towards him. But I do think that we have to go somewhat further in this matter than merely rely upon the memory of a most genial companion and&#39; most popular member of the Chamber, who, unfortunately, has shown either that he was away from the Cabinet meeting when the last Speech was put together, or that he clean forgot the matter. I am absolutely certain that he did not commit any breach of faith. I believe that had he remembered the matter he would have seen that what has happened should not take place. I am also satisfied that there must be some one in the service of the Government who is concerned in the preparation of these speeches, because there must be some one who deliberately does these things. </para>

      <para class="block">That, I admit, is rather a strong phrase. It is no use to keep a house-dog merely to bark ; if he has no teeth, get rid of him and buy a fresh one. If is of no use for the Senate to pass resolution after resolution with reference to the non-acknowledgment of its status, and to be satisfied with an empty demonstration of words. I think it is necessary for the Senate to be prepared to bite as well as bark. My motion certainly will do no one any harm, if it is carried. The framers of the GovernorGeneral&#39;s speech in the future have merely to avoid that which we have over and over again affirmed to be objectionable, in order to give the dbg no chance of biting. I hope that the motion will be carried as it stands, as a declaration of what our future intentions are, because, if, time after time, we are to pass resolutions asserting our rights, and do nothing to enforce them, the assertion is but as &#34; sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.&#34; We accomplish nothing whatever by protesting over and over again if we have not the manhood to see the thing through. </para>

          <para>. - I had anticipated that the representatives of the Government would have said something before I spoke. I merely desire to indorse the remarks made by my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline> when he affirmed that it was necessary to do something more than pass resolutions. The Minister of Defence has said that it is unnecessary to pass this motion ; but he overlooks the fact that, although, in this particular form, it has only been once before submitted to the Senate, there have been other occasions when the same mistake or offence has been committed It was the same in principle, if somewhat different in form, and for that reason I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> that the time has really arrived when we ought, not merely to place a motion of this kind on record, but to do so with the determination to carry it out as far as we individually and collectively can. Judging from the fact that the Minister of Defence has not risen to speak, he appears to think that the statement which he made the other day will be sufficient. To my mind, it was sufficient whenhe made it, and I was content to let it rest&#34; with that assurance of the Government that the lapse would not be allowed to occur again. But, after listening to the remarks of my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline> I can but congratulate him on bringing the matter forward in this  form.  It will probably be remembered that, in speaking on the Address-in-Reply. I pointed out that little by little the power of the Senate was being whittled away, and that we were gradually drifting into a. position in which we were in danger of being regarded as a subordinate House. It is our duty to put it on record that the Senate insists upon having its rights and privileges recognised and safeguarded. I accepted the assurance of the Government the other day that in future the representatives of the Ministry in the Senate will take care that what Ave complain of is not repeated, and I feel satislied that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hayford</inline> will have due regard to our rights. But, notwithstanding that, I trust that the motion will be carried unanimously. </para>

Although the Senate consists of half as many members as the House of Representatives, there are six Ministers with portfolios in the other House, whilst there is only one here. Had we had our fair share of representation in the Cabinet, or had we even had two porrtolioed Ministers in the Senate, it would hare been impossible for both of them to overlook the glaring mistake which has been made. I trust that the motion will be carried,  and  that, as long as the present Minister of Defence is in office, no repetition of the mistake will be made. It is unpleasant to have to stand up for the privileges of our House, but  it  is our duty to see that the Constitution is loyally observed </para>

            <para>- As the Senate cannot originate Money Bills, though it has quite as much power as the other House in passing them, I think it  would  be  A&#39;ery  much better if all  words  especially addressed to the House of Representatives  \vere  omitted. I  have  said that I will see about it on future occasions, and I repeat that I will do so. I made the promise  two  years ago, and I did see that  it Avas  attended to after then. A short time afterwards the Reid Government came in. The next time Parliament met a very short Governor-General&#39;s speech was delivered and no reference  Avas  made to the Estimates or to economy. All that  Ave were  told  Avas that  a short measure  would,  be passed dividing certain States into electorates, and that  Ave  should then be sent about our business. When I came into office again the matter escaped my memory. The framing of the Governor-General&#39;s speech in the manner complained of was not done intentionally. With regard to the second paragraph to which reference has been made, regarding the plans for the redistribution of the electorates, I do not think any harm has been done. The paragraph embodies a proper recognition of the exact position. The electorates are for the special representation of one House, and the statement there made is that the resolutions necessary to give effect to the Commissioner&#39;s recommendations would be submitted - not &#34;to you,&#34; but to Parliament - to the  two  branches of the Legislature. I see no harm in that. I do not see why honorable senators should offer any special objection to it. because it absolutely states the facts of the case. My  OWn  opinion is. however, that it would be  verv  much better if no special references whatever  were  made to the House of Representatives. Then there  would  be no trouble. I will take care that if in future references are made to the Estimates being framed on economical lines, the remark shall be addressed to both Houses. Having made that promise, I have taken care that my secretary is acquainted  Avith  the facts, so that if I am not in my present position, he will bring the matter in the most prominent manner before any new Minister ; whereas, if I am here I shall take good care that no mistake is made. I do not see that there is the slightest necessity to pass a motion of this kind, but if the Senate thinks that there is, I shall not call for a division. I hope, however, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> will accept my assurance, and will withdraw the motion. </para>

              <para>- I - In moving this motion, I may say that I think it advisable that it should be dealt with by the Senate as early as possible, in view of the action taken in another place with reference to the subject with which it deals. I am disposed to regret that another place should have passed the motion in this form ; but, since it has done so, I think it is as well that there should be unanimity of opinion between the two branches of the Legislature. The question &#39; has aroused considerable interest thoughout Australia, and thousands of people have been waiting anxiously for the decision of the Parliament with reference to it. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Danysz</inline> was brought to Australia, I understand, by a number of pastoralists in New South Wales, and at their expense, with the object of inoculating the rabbits with a virus that would prove fatal to them, and so stamp out the pest. It is admitted, however, that the success of the experiment is still problematical, and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Danysz</inline> himself is not at all certain that the virus he has introduced will achieve the object in view. In support of this statement I quote the following paragraph from a subleader in The <inline font-style="italic">Pastoralists&#39; Review</inline> of 1 5th March, 1905 : - </para>

            <para>
              <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Danysz,</inline>of the Pasteur Institute, has replied to the New South Wales Minister of Lands&#39; invitation to visit Australia to inquire on the spot into the possibility of ridding the country of the rabbit pest, that he could come in April for five or six months with an assistant, and that the cost of his visit would be a fee of &#163;600 per month, from the day of his departure until that of his return to Paris, besides all the actual expenses of conducting the inquiry. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Danysz</inline> considers that the first thing is to discover diseases which would not be dangerous to other animal life, and that the search for this might be expected to occupy a year. Then he would proceed to study the conditions under which it would be necessary to propagate these diseases among rabbits so as to obtain appreciable results; in other words, he would found a bacteriological institute in Sydney, which would be a branch of the Pasteur Institute in Paris, and carry on such investigations as seem advisable for discovering a disease suitable to the conditions of the problem. As we have said before, the difficulty of coping with the rabbit pest on so large a scale by disease renders it impossible to entertain much hope of any sufficiently contagious disease being discovered, but nevertheless <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Danysz&#39;s</inline> suggestion appears to us worth following up, in view of the magnitude of the result in case of success. We do not take it upon ourselves to assent to or dissent from his terms, and there remains a good deal of detail to be filled up by scientific consultation before the Minister can definitely accept <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Danysz&#39;s</inline> offer, but the idea of practically forming a branch of the best bacteriological institute in the world at Sydney to study the problem on the spot strikes us as being on the right lines.

We are entitled to consider other phases of the question. If we cannot b&#39;e assured that the introduction of the virus or the rabbit microbe will have the desired effect of killing off the rabbits - and I, in common with every one else, acknowledge that they are a parasite on a big industry, and a great curse in many parts of Australia - we certainly ought to pause. While we acknowledge the rabbits to be a curse in some parts of Australia, we have to consider another and very important aspect of the question. The rabbit industry, which is a very large one. is, I admit, what may be called a parasitic industry - it is parasitic in relation to another industry. </para>

              <para>- W - We ought not to run the risk of injuring, and probably completely destroying, one industry unless we are satisfied that the experiments will be of good to the other industry. Unless -we are so satisfied, Parliament is justified in the step that has been taken elsewhere, and which I am now asking the Senate to take. The number of people employed in the rabbit industry throughout Australia is van.ously estimated at from  15,000  to  20,000,  and it has been stated that the rabbits are being killed off at the rate of  4,000,000  a year. I do not know whether those figures represent facts, and I do not accept any responsibility for the statements. I do know, however, from figures coming from the New South Wales Export Department, that in  7905  the skins exported from that State represented a value of  .&#163;93,000,  while the frozen rabbits exported represented a value of  ,&#163;92,000.  I am given to under stand that, in addition, there is a small export trade to South Africa, Western Australia, and even to the East, which is. not recorded in the books of the Export Department, but which is approximatelyvalued at &#163;10,000 per annum. If these figures are correct, the export trade of New South Wales in rabbits and skins was worth <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> 95,000  in  1905. </para>

              <para>- I h I have no objection to name my authority, which is the firm of Curtis and Curtis, of Sydney. They admit that their view may be taken to be a. biased one, seeing that they are engaged in the trade; but it is extremely unlikely that such a firm would supply figures that could be. very easily refuted if incorrect. As I say, this firm estimates the internal trade in rabbit carcasses at  ,&#163;30,000  per annum, and the value of the skins locally at a similar amount. Thev also inform me that the trade in preserved rabbits- represents about  &#163;5,000  per annum. I believe these figures to be given to me in absolute good faith, and I see no .reason why I should not accept them as correct until they are proved to be otherwise. At any rate, the figures I gave in connexion with the New South Wales Export Department cannot very well be doubted. It will be seen that, according to the figures I have given, the total trade in New South Waleslast year is represented bv about  ,&#163;250,000.  The same firm assures me that during the first half of the present year the New South Wales trade in rabbits, both external&#39; and internal, has increased bv somethingover  100  per cent. That may seem an abnormal increase; but if that be the rate,  and it continues over the year, the trade for New South Wales alone may be taken iis worth about .&#163;500,000 a year. </para>

              <para>- T - That generally confirms what I have said. If that were the total for all Australia, then the trade of New South Wales would, last year, approximate to &#163;250,000, and will probably be worth &#163;500.000 this year. There are thousands of poor people, whose children would probably never get a bit of flesh meat more than once a week, if then, but for cheap rabbits. </para>

              <para>- Exa Exactly ; I believe the rabbits have, over and over again, been pronounced to be wholesome food, and a considerable factor in the daily life of poorer families in Australia. In addition, <inline font-style="italic">an</inline> enormous external and internal trade has grown up in rabbits and skins. Still, as I said before, the industry may, from one point of view, be regarded as parasitic. In some portions of Australia, especially on the extensive pastoral runs in the larger States, the carrying capacity of the land has been very much decreased owing to the presence of the rabbits. That, however, is only seen in an aggravated form where the runs are very large; at any rate, it is nothing like so serious where there is closer settlement, with small holdings, and &#39;where wire netting and phosphorous poisoning have  been  resorted to. I have heard it said, not by town citizens, but by farmers, who have  been  interested for many years in the suppression of the rabbits, that wire netting, coupled with closer settlement, really form the best solution of the rabbit question. </para>

              <para>- T - The honorable senator verv aptly says that there may be the same effect as that of the Chicago revelations on the meat trade in Great Britain. The meat trust people in America are crying  out bitterly about the enormous decrease in their sales of packed meat. If it is stated in the newspapers, or the impression gets abroad in Great Britain, that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Danysz,</inline> or any other scientist, is experimentally inoculating Australian rabbits with the object of killing them off, the trade in rabbits will be seriously damaged. I do not intend to occupy the time of the Senate further. I believe that a. majority of honorable senators are in favour of my motion, as amended in a form which will make us safe for at least a period of twelve months. I should have much preferred to see the motion carried in its original form in another place, and also in this Chamber. But if the motion be carried in its amended form, there will be safety from the danger I suggest for, I should say, a vear, because the Federal Parliament, or if it is not in session, the Federal Government, will have some control over <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Danysz</inline> and his microbes. The effect of carrying a motion in each House, I take it, will be that the microbes will not be allowed to be taken outside the laboratory, and will, therefore, only be used for laboratory experiments until such time as scientific representatives of the &#34;Federal Government are absolutely satisfied, as well as <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Danysz,</inline> that there will be no danger of this disease being communicated to other animals. And. after all, that is, I suppose, the most important phase of the question. By that time we may, perhaps, be in possession of further evidence as to the exact value, of the rabbit trade, internal and external, about which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> says there is a good deal of difference of opinion. We may be in possession of further evidence to suggest how far the existence of a large number of rabbits is an injury to the squatting industry. What &#91; am complaining about is that this proposal, which emanated from a few people in New South Wales, was put before the people, of Australia very suddenly. </para>

              <para>- I am dealing with the motion as it is and the motion which was submitted to the other House, and which was to the effect that the microbes should only be allowed in for the purpose of laboratory experiments. What is the good or object of an experiment ? What is the good of allowing an experiment if, before you know what it will show, you declare that you will allow nothing more tobe done? What is the purpose of an experiment but to enable you to see whether you can do something more by-and-by ? You test a thing to see whether it is good, bad, or indifferent. The motion, in effect, said, &#34;We will allow the experiments to be made, but we tell you before you see the result, no matter what it is, we will not allow our precious rabbits to be touched.&#34; I think that, with the addition, the motion is one which can reasonably be considered. My only objection to the amended motion is that it leaves to Parliament the decision in the matter. I do not think that it is a competent body to decide a question which, after all, is a scientific one. </para>

Last year the total export from Australia was about &#163;583,000, which, if 20,000- men are employed, gives ,&#163;25 to each member of the great army which my honorable friend, alleges is employed in the rabbit industry. </para>

              <para>- What the internal trade is worth neither I nor any other man can state, therefore every one must make his own estimate. But if I ad&#39;d to that sum &#163;100,000, it will be seen that the remuneration paid to this army only represents mere bread and butter for them. But, as a matter of fact, there are nothing like 20,000 persons employed in. the industry. The real position of affairs is that in certain favorable centres - and in New South Wales one can count them almost on the fingers of his two hands - industries have sprung up, and as a result the rabbit industry has created certain interests: In these places there are not merely rabbiters, but townspeople, who profit bv the distribution of their money. That is the whole secret of the agitation against the introduction of these microbes. There never was a whimper against their introduction when it was first mentioned, because the rabbit industry had not been started. The movement for the introduction of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Danysz&#39;s</inline> microbes had made considerable progress. Meetings were held in Sydney. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> said that the people of Australia, did .not know of them until quite recently, but surely thev must have been cognizant of what was taking place: </para>

              <para>- I do not know the condition of benightedness into which Tasmania may have fallen. I only know that in New South Wales there was not a single newspaper which did not make reference to this matter. The negotiations have been in progress for two years, and that fact has been commonly known for, at any rate, twenty months. What protest was there when, not on Broughton Island, five miles from the mainland, but on Rodd Island, in Sydney Harbor, experiments with microbes were carried out a few years ago? There was no protest entered because there was no rabbit industry in existence. There were no interests of a few people to be considered. </para>

              <para>- Certainly not. , I am not dealing now with, that question, and I have not affirmed that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Danysz&#39;s</inline> experiments will be successful. I am pointing out that the whole of this agitation arose, not from fears on the ground of health, but from the selfish anxiety of those who, as the honorable senator admits, are getting a parasitical living out of the rabbit industry. If the agitation .had been founded on the possibility of injury to health, surely health was much more endangered when experiments were being conducted on a little island in Sydney Harbor than they would be if conducted on Broughton Island, five miles from the mainland. It is a curious thing that it is only now that this agitation has arisen. I am not going to say that I particularly blame a large number of persons who had the wisdom to disguise their real object in &#34;Hie matter by making this appeal on the ground of .public health. I want to quote to the Senate the opinions of authorities to justify the statement that there is no danger to the public health in what is proposed by the Government of New South Wales. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> has referred to scientific authorities who differ from <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Danysz</inline> im the matter, but he quoted  no one who affirmed that there was any danger to the public health in the experiments sought to be carried out. The first gentleman whom he mentioned. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Tidswell,</inline> said in the report which was presented to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne - and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Tidswell</inline> was not only an officer of the New South Wales Government, he was an officer who was called in to advise the Federal Department - that there is no possible danger to the pub lic health in what is proposed. The speech of the honorable senator - and I have no fault to find with it - proceeded on exactly the same basis of error as appears in so many of the statements which have been published in the press, and have been made from the platform, in regard to this matter. First of ail, what is proposed? What is it that we have to guard against? One would assume from what is said that there was a proposal to let loose a certain disease amongst the people. What has been proposed by the pastoralists, what is contemplated by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Danysz,</inline> and what has been permitted by the State Government? As a matter &#39;of fact, all that has been proposed is that an eminent scientist shall be allowed to carry out certain laboratory experiments on Broughton Island. Nothing more than that ! It is true that it is contemplated, if the experiments prove successful - if it can be shown that there is no possible risk, not merely to human life, but to the fauna of Australia - that the experiments shall be carried further. But does the honorable senator tell me - does he wish to affirm - that if it can be shown beyond doubt from these experiments that this disease will exterminate the rabbits without injuring any one or anything else, the experiments should still be confined to the laboratory? Surely he will not go so far as that ! If he does it justifies the statement which I have made, that the question really  is whether this wretched little rabbit industry, worth half a million pounds, shall be conserved at the expense of the great agricultural and pastoral interests of this country. </para>

It is quite certain&#93; that the rabbit industry, if unchecked, cannot last under present conditions for any length of time, because if we are to have this as an established industry of the country, you are not going to have one man paying for the grass, and paying for the conservation of the water, and some one else walking off with the product, in the shape of the rabbit, and paying nothing by way of agistment - nothing for the grass which it eats. </para>

              <para>- Surely it is an utter misuse of terms to speak of a subsidy when your tenant comes along and says, &#34; I have become absolutely bankrupt on this property; I cannot live upon it&#34;; and when the landlord turns round and says, !! I recognise that I have been  rackrenting  you in the past, the property is no: worth what you have been paying for it ; I want you to <inline font-style="italic">continue to</inline> hold the land ; do not go, and I will charge you a lower rent.&#34;&#39; Ls that a subsidy ? The State was mighty glad to do it. Thousands of pounds have been Jost in the western portion of New  South  Wales, and scores of those who have invested their fortunes there have been  ruinedI  can give numbers of instances to the honorable senator ; and if he thinks that there is a good investment to ba had by taking, up some of these lands, he is welcome to try it. I can tell him of properties upon which two or three artesian bores have been sunk, wool sheds built, and rabbit-proof fences erected1, and vet they have had to be abandoned. I will give an instance. I know of one case in which &#163;80,000 has been spent in improvements, and yet the property has been sold for &#163;4,000. What are \OU going to do with country like that? Are  you  going to use it for closet settlement? How are you going to get rid of the rabbits ? The moment we begin discussing this important question, honorable senators opposite say, &#34; Oh ! closer settlement-!&#34; But if they are under the delusion that such country as that is suitable for small holdings. I am not. </para>

All that I would say to the  State  is that which a certain classical philosopher said many centuries ago, &#34; Get out of the sunlight.&#34; And that is all that private enterprise asks. But I do  say  that it is a monstrous thing in this particular case, that the State should1 not  only  not assist those who are fighting for their lives against this rabbit plague, but should absolutely be urged to prevent private <inline font-style="italic">enterprise &#91;tom</inline> endeavouring to find a remedy which it hopes will be effective. </para>

No one - neither <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers</inline> nor those associated with the movement and responsible for it. nor <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Danysz,</inline> nor any one else - ever proposed to do more than carry on laboratory experiments under proper safeguards. Yet. while that has been the proposal from the first, there has been this tremendous howl about it. If it were proposed to carry on the experiments in the open, I could understand the protests, but they havebeen made against the laboratory experiments, or there is no meaning in them at all. Of course, I can quite see that when honorable senators are brought face to face in public discussion with the facts of the case, they are bound to modify their motion. Now I want just briefly to show what has been said by the leading scientific men of Australia about this matter. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> said that several scientists had expressed averse opinions. He did not quote a single one. </para>

He prophesied, however, that once it was whispered in England or in European countries where our rabbits are sold, that we were trifling with microbes, our export trade in rabbits would fall off. It may be assumed that when we use the microbes in the open - if we ever do - the export trade in rabbits will fall off, but not until then is any danger likely to accrue. The very object of taking the microbes into the open would be to stop the export trade in rabbits. No rabbits would be allowed to be exported once the microbes were used in the open. </para>

              <para>- The need of anticipating such a contingency has been realized. The Government of New South Wales, recognising that alarmists might get to work in the old country, communicated with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coghlan,</inline> and directed him to be on the look-out for statements in reference to this question appearing in the public journals, and to contradict any that were incorrect. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coghlan</inline> has reported that he&#39; invited the representatives of the leading newspapers devoted to the game trade in England to investigate the matter, and that they sent to the Pasteur Institute in Paris a representative, who reported that he was quite satisfied! from the assurances given him, that there was absolutely no cause for alarm. If there is one broad way of ascertaining how a trade views any question of importance relating to it, it is furnished by the journals devoted to that trade. And here we have <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coghlan&#39;s</inline> assurance. The action taken by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers</inline> shows that he is not acting recklessly in this matter, and the reply he has received from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coghlan</inline> - which appears in an official document - is a sufficient answer to the cry that has been raised. It shows that the trade at Home is not going to be alarmed! unless some cause for alarm arises. When the microbes are being used in the open there will be no cause for alarm about the export trade in rabbits, because there will be no1 such trade. I venture to say that the Federal, as well as the State authorities, would stop the trade the moment the microbes were used in the open. </para>

          <para class="block">O&#39;Keefe has said, is a parasite living upon the pastoral industry. Pastoralists and farmers, large and small, are at their wits&#39; end to know how to combat the rabbit pest. While they have no objection to rabbits being trapped, and carried away, we mayrest assured that if those who are earning a livelihood by taking away the grasseaters are going to build up a vested industry, and oppose the efforts of pastoralists to secure a remedy, the latter will find that the only cure is to stop the industry. That is really what is happening to-day. In certain districts land-owners are declining to allow trappers to go on their property, feeling that by building up this industry they are preparing a rod for their own backs. It is rather curious to note that on the evidence of gentlemen who, we may presume, are impartial and competent judges, trapping is iri no sense helping to lessen the evil. We have had in New South Wales, I am sorry to S:1\ several prosecutions of trappers. Mamtrappers have been earning money from the trade .in rabbits, and they have also been subsidized by the landowners to carry on their trapping. We have had in New South Wales several prosecutions of men who. whilst receiving the subsidy from station-owners, and securing a profit bv the sale of the pelfs, have been releasing the younger rabbits found in the pit traps. That is one way in which the development of the industry of rabbit trapping is helping to perpetuate the pest. When I was drawn off the track bv an interjection, I was about to quote from ,a report by an inspector of the Pastures Protection Board at Gundagai, one of the towns which has been making itself heard in connexion with this matter. The rabbit trade has been developed there, and naturally local tradesmen and those dependent on them are warm in their support of this great national industry. The inspector, after going through his district, appears to have reported to his Board, and to have had another tale to tell. He SavE - </para>

          <para class="block">If we have to rely solely upon trapping as a means of destroying the rabbits, the outlook for those who hone to keep Australia for legitimate farming is certainly not hopeful. I have yet to learn of any holdings - apart from very small ones, close to railway lines, and possessing facilities for easy transit - that have been by this means kept clear of the pest for any period. Reference has been made to the value of the rabbit industry. The export trade in carcases and skins last year was valued at &#163;583,000, but even if the figures were doubled, to what would they amount? I wish to emphasize the point that the rabbit industry is living to-day under conditions that are unlikely to continue. It is impossible to believe that men are going to pay rents to the Crown year after year - as a large number of occupiers of Crown lands in New South Wales are doing - on the supposition that the grass is to be turned into wool and mutton, and the cash product put into their own pockets when their grass is being eaten by rabbits, and the profits derived from their sale pocketed by others. The whole system must break down. If the lands of Australia are to be preserved for .grazing rabbits, in order that certain individuals mav turn those rabbits into money, we shall have to re-adjust our land system ; the Crown will have to be prepared to reduce its rentals on the understanding that the rabbits are to have free grass. I ask honorable senators to consider what this reduction of rentals would mean to New South Wales if we were to allow for the grass eaten by the rabbits there? Some one must pay for the grass so consumed. It is preposterous to imagine that one man is going to pay for the grass, while some one else walks off with the value of that grass in the shape of the rabbit that has fed upon it. What is the industry prepared to pay? A <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Benn,</inline> who has been making money bv freezing rabbits, recently gave certain figures showing his turnover. I think he said that it amounted to something like  &#163;60,000  a year. What is he going to pay towards the rentals of the Crown tenants of New South Wales? Who has to pav the rent? The man who secures the product of the land in the shape of rabbits, or the man who is trying to fight the pest? These are problems which we ought to consider. When those interested in the rabbit trade come forward with a proposition to pay for the grass, which the rabbits eat. thev will be entitled to say that it is an industry. At present, like the rabbit itself, it is a plague. It is surely unnecessary to go into figures to illustrate the absurdity of comparing a little tinpot industry of that kind with the .great agricultural and pastoral industries of Australia. We have no means of determining the extent to which rabbits depreciate the carrying capacity of the country, but we have a means of forming an estimate which for practical purposes should be some guide. New South Wales has to-day somewhere about  40,000,000  sheep. </para>

              <para>- But for the phenomenal seasons she has enjoyed New South Wales would be heavily&#39; taxed in carrying that number of sheep. She has had a phenomenal season, .in common with other large portions of Australia - such a season, I suppose, as we have not had for many years. In spite of that, New South Wales to-day is fairly stocked with  40,000,000  sheep. But not long ago New South Wales was carrying over  60,000,000  sheep. However, I should tremble for the position of that State if it were carrying that number to-day, because, in spite of the phenomenal season, we should find the land overstocked. I do not say that the difference in the number of sheep is to be put down entirely to the rabbits, because much may be due to the long series of droughts which have to some extent depreciated the carrying capacity of the country. </para>

              <para>- If New South&#39; Wales were put into the position it occupied in the early nineties, and the rabbits were removed, the State would, with the present improvements, carry  60,000,000  sheep. Improvements have been going on steadily, and the multiplication of artesian bores alone has very materially improved the carrying capacity of the country. </para>

              <para>- New South Wales was overstocked in the then condition of improvements, but I do not think it would be overstocked to-day, in view of the greater improvements, but for the rabbits. I admit at once that that is an estimate, but much has been done since the early nineties in the way of ring-barking - a most potent factor in increasing carrying capacity - and in the multiplication of artesian supplies. But for the presence of the rabbits, New South Wales could carry with comfort the same number of sheep that was carried with some distress in the early nineties. I am not going to assume that all the decrease is due to the rabbits, nor can I estimate how many rabbits eat the same quantity of food that is required by a sheep. </para>

              <para>- I cannot affirm to what extent the rabbits are destroying the carrying capacity of the country, but I say that the amount represented by the depreciation caused by them is far greater than that represented by the returns from the rabbit industry. Further. I say that the amount represented by that .industry is not as much, if any greater than the amount expended in the efforts to destroy the rabbits. While a few individuals and a few towns, with freezing works here and there, mav be making some profit out of the industry, from a national point of view that industry is a national loss both ways. It is a loss in reducing the income which comes in the ordinary way from the pastoral industry, and it is a loss inasmuch as the amount which it represents does not more than compensate for the expenditure in keening the rabbits down to a workable minimum. The industry is not one we are entitled to consider. The Question remains whether some means can be discovered bv which a check can be discovered of a. more economical character than those at present at our disposal. It. is only with that object in view that the experiments have been decided upon/. I have said that to the motion, as amended, the only objection I see is in the fact that it makes Parliament the judge of what is a matter for the decision of scientific men. I should have been quite satisfied with the amended motion if it had simply said that, until assurances had been obtained from scientific experts, the Parliaments of the States and of the Commonwealth would watch the matter. I am afraid that, in spite of what the experts may say, this wretched little industry may once more manage to raise such a clamour as to make people believe it to be of much more importance than is really the case, and to that extent may influence the judgment of Parliament. It may interest honorable senators, who seem to be so fearful just now about the introduction of diseases - I admit we ought to be cautious - to know what is being done in other directions. I suppose that one of the greatest troubles we ever had in the fruit-growing industry is the codlin moth. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> knows something of this matter, because he once gave us a graphic description of the moth, which he affirmed was &#34;running wild &#34; in Western Australia. </para>

              <para>- T shall deal withthe red scale later on. The journal fromwhich I am quoting. and which contains an official report, gives the Latin name-  for  a species of lady-bird. the parasite, which they are seeking to develop for the- purpose of destroying the codlin moth. The people of California experience some difficulty for a portion of the year in obtaining the food necessary in order to develop the parasite, which in turn is to prey on the mature codlin moth ; and, therefore, in view of the varying seasons, it is sought to obtain from New Zealand the grub of the codlin moth which is used to feed the parasite, the latter in turn being used to destroy the mature moth. Suppose the fruit-growers in California had got on their hind legs and howled about the introduction of the codlin moth from New Zealand ! </para>

              <para>- No cases are parallel when we do not want them to be. I say that the cases are parallel, inasmuch as in each we have a disease, the introduction of which is known to entail very considerable loss. Scientific men in California experimented, as we propose to do here, until they found the possibility of a remedy, and they have carried matters so far that, not content with raising the parasite in favorable seasons there, they take advantage of the varying seasons and import the codlin moth in order to feed the parasite. </para>

              <para>- I am speaking particularly of the red scale. I am not -well up in this subject, but I would point out that mining, agriculture, and grazing all require the aid of- science to-day. Mining and farming particularly are becoming matters of chemistry. To say, in relation to a matter so important as the future of the pastoral and agricultural industries, that we shall refuse the aid of science appears to me to be going back to the dark ages. All that is asked is that experiments shall be carried on under conditions which every scientific man declares to be safe - to carry on those experiments in the laboratory, and then, if it can be shown that they cam be extended without danger to the public health or to the fauna of Australia, to so extend them. </para>

              <para>- Not outside the laboratory - that was never intended. The honorable senator appears to have got a contrary idea, as many other people have, owing to the clamour which has been raised, and to a great deal of irresponsible writing in the public press, and not to have taken the trouble to look into the matter for himself. All that was intended was that at first the experiments should be carried out in the laboratory. Microbes known to be fatal to rabbits, and which have been collected! from rabbits, are in the laboratories in Sydney to-day. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Tidswell</inline> himself, not long since, in investigating an epidemic in the Wyalong district, succeeded in isolating the microbe, which to-day is alive in Sydney, and, so far as I know, well. That may be the very microbe which. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Danysz</inline> proposes to use in Australia. If we prevent <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Danysz</inline> from opening the tubes he brought with him, it will be only a matter of a few months before he can develop other microbes to the same virulence from those already in Australia. If we were to block <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Danysz</inline> absolutely, and order his tubes to be thrown over the South Head, it would only delay him for two or three months. </para>

              <para>- The microbes <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Danysz</inline> brought with him are exactly the  same as those already in the country, except that the virulence of the former has been more developed. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Danysz</inline> would merely have to start work from the commencement, and develop from the local microbe. In view of the assurance given by the State Government, and by Drs. Asburton Thompson, Norris, and Tidswell, and in view of the attitude of the Federal Government, there is no necessity for this motion. I had hoped that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe,</inline> in view of what has transpired in the last few days, would consider the propriety of withdrawing the motion, but the honorable senator has not done so. Although I regard the motion as much less obnoxious than as originally drawn, it still is, in my opinion, unnecessary, liable to be misconstrued, and likely to become mischievous under certain circumstances, and, therefore, it has my opposition. </para>

          <para>. - I desire to refer to some criticism of the use of the word &#34; industrial &#34; in connexion with the word &#34; design,&#34; in this definition clause. It is used in the same sense as it is used in what is known as an industrial exhibition, or in what are known as the industrial arts. But it has not been imported into the Bill for that reason alone. Throughout the articles of the International Convention the term used is not &#34;design,&#34; but &#34;industrial design.&#34; It is industrial designs that the contracting parties have agreed amongst themselves shall be protected each within its own sphere. The word &#34; industrial &#34; is not put into this definition as a. placard at all. The English Act was passed before the International Convention was entered into. But the Tasmanian Act has adopted the expression &#34; industrial designs,&#34; and I presume for the same reason as we do. </para>

          <para>. - It was suggested yesterday that the reference to the application of design contained in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> was merely a repetition of the words contained in clause 4 as a definition of designs, but the latter is purely a definition, and has no enacting value. In that clause we define what a design is, and in this clause we enact what shall be meant by applying a design. Subsequently, in clauses 12 and 30, we make reference to applying a design. If we did not set out here what was the applying of a design, it would necessitate a considerable enlargement of those clauses. As they stand at present this clause precisely sets out their effect. For instance, clause 12 enacts - </para>

          <para>. - At our last sitting reference was made to the factthat this clause made the registration take effect from the date of the lodging of the application. That seemed to be, on the face of it, out of harmony with the provisions of the English Act. Strangely enough, that Act reads as if the registration should take effect from the time of the registration, but on further consideration of the matter, it seems that it does not, in effect, do so.

            <para>. - I am extremely pleased to see that the Government have redeemed the promise given twelve or fifteen months ago in this matter, and that at last we have the pros pect of a federalization of the meteorological work of the Commonwealth. I also welcome the indication afforded by the Bill of a decision to separate meteorology from astronomy. I cannot speak from the happenings in other States, but I know that in New South Wales the meteorological work Has always been hampered by its association with astronomical research. We have had there at the head of the Sydney Observatory one or two very eminent gentlemen, whose training and inclination, unfortunately, have led them in the direction of astronomy rather than meteorology. I do not wish to in any way underestimate or decry the benefits which must result from pursuing astronomy as a science. But it does appear to me that in a country circumstanced as Australia is, and in its pioneering stages, more practical and immediate advantage is likely to result from meteorological work than from astronomical work. For that reason, I have always regretted the association of the two branches, as it has been to the prejudice of meteorology. This . is, as the Minister pointed out, an enabling Bill. I propose to invite attention to what appears to me to be its defects. Its value seems to me to depend entirely upon which of the two ways the power which the measure will convey is exercised. In the first place, we could have a federalization of meteorological work in absolute fact, or we could have the establishment of a Federal Meteorological Department, which would be subordinate to and dependent entirely upon similar institutions in the States. I wish to suggest to the Minister the grave danger which I think we should incur if we adopted the second of those courses. I listened with a great deal of interest and advantage to the extremely valuable speech of the Minister, whom, if he will permit me, I wish to compliment. But it was quite evident, whatever the decision may be as to the way in which it is proposed to administer the Bill, he has taken the very wise course of consulting both States Governments and States officials. Itwas in consulting them that he has evidently met with the first difficulty - the difficulty represented by the attitude of States Governments and States officials. But while I am quite prepared, as we all must be, to pay due regard to the opinions of States Governments and States officials, I think that there is a very great danger if, when the interests of Australia require it, we hesitate to override them. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Let me take the attitude of the States. It is a little contradictory, and, perhaps, not as conclusive as either the Minister or the Senate would have desired. I cannot help thinking that of late there has Seen a tendency to accept the decisions of States Governments as unduly binding upon the Federal Parliament. I am extremely desirous that in our legislative efforts we should, as far as possible, pursue lines agreeable to the States. But it does seem to me that we shall be sowing the seeds of future trouble if, when we can see a course clearly marked out as best in the national interest, we are persuaded from taking that course by undue regard to the wishes of those who control the States Governments. In this question an undue desire to follow the line of least resistance is manifest once more. I should like to make clear my object in suggesting&#39; what I regard as a weakness in this Bill. I wish to point out that wherever we have had joint action there has been more or less friction. I may refer to the efforts made in the earlier days of Federation to utilize State officers for the erection of public buildings. Friction arose there. We have another case now in reference to the Customs House, Sydney - a building utilized, as its name indicates, by the Customs Department, bub also utilized bv the State Department of Land and Income Tax. The Minister probably knows more about it than I do, but I am aware of the fact that a considerable amount of friction has arisen between the State and Federal authorities as to whether that building, used by both, is to be regarded as one of the properties to be transferred to the Commonwealth or not. We have also the matter of the deportation of the kanakas. There is some little trouble brewing there as to which Government shall do certain things. I only mention these instances to show that wherever we have points of contact there is always the possibility of friction arising. What I suggest, not only in regard to this Bill, but to all legislation, is that we should secure, as far as is practicable, as complete a separation of Federal and State functions as the circumstances will admit. </para>

          <para class="block">There may be cases - I can quite understand that there are many cases - in which economy may be promoted by joint action; and I am not at all advocating the appointment of two officers where one -will do. But my point is that where we are undertaking new functions - as in the case of the recentlycreated Statistician&#39;s Department, and in the case of the Meteorological Department which we propose to create - one of two courses are open to us. We can either create the Federal  Department  as dominant, the States obtaining information and service from it, or we can leave the States Departments as practically dominant, and appoint Federal officers who will have to obtain all the information they want from the States Departments. It seems to me that to leave the States Departments, as this Bill proposes, exactly as they are, and to appoint one central meteorological observer, is to increase the expense without increasing the efficiency of the present service. I wish to avoid that. I have referred to the tendency, as it seems to me, on the part of the Federation to give way whenever there is a protest from a State against anything that is toeing done. Whilst there is that tendency on the part of the Federation,^ the same time there is a tendency on the part of the States to keep control as far as possible of the services, to throw the cost on the Federation, and then to blame the Federation because, naturally, the expenditure steadily mounts up. </para>

              <para>- That is so; but I am not speaking of complaints from the electors, but of the complaints voiced by States Governments, who are the great offenders in the matter of extravagance, and are the very people against whose criticism I am now protesting. It is a fact that, although the States ha.ve been relieved of  many  of their services, they are to-day carrying on their business at greater cost than before Federation ; and no State is a greater offender than my own in that regard. I was dealing with the attitude of the States Premiers : and. as showing that the declarations made bv the Premiers are not to be taken as conclusive, the Minister has furnished me with a verv happy in stance. He quoted Tasmania, his own State, where we had the Premier making  a declaration in favour of a certain course being taken, whilst a short time afterwards, when the Government in question had been displaced, and another one had succeeded, an entirely different conclusion was arrived &#34;at. Neither in the first case nor in the second, however, was there any public expression of approval or disapproval, so far as I know. The sudden change of declaration on the part of the Government of Tasmania shows that we are not to accept as absolutely final and conclusive the declaration of any Premier. I cannot help thinking, that if there is anything in the elective principle at all, this Senate is better qualified to speak as to the opinion of the States, than is any State Premier, especially when dealing with matters of this kind, which really have never been before the electors; and&#39; nobody can say that they have been consulted on such a Bill as this. Therefore, we should not hamper ourselves unduly in regard to anything that appears to us to be wise and expedient, by the mere fact that the Premiers have arrived at a certain decision. I do not say that we should ignore their view altogether, because that is a term which might be misunderstood ; but we certainly should consider the question apart from their decision. As to the opinion of the officers, I quite recognise that thev are very able men, well qualified and equipped for their work. ; but I think we should be wanting in our duty if we accepted their decision in this matter, at any rate without a little inquiry as to the circumstances in which thev arrived&#34; at if. These gentlemen at the present time are the peers of each other. Thev are the heads of independent Departments. Some of them have spent many, years in building up their Departments and they naturally take a pride - an understandable pride - in the results of their work. We can quite understand, therefore, that when they came to consider the question whether they should practically recommend that their Departments, at present independent, should become subordinate, they were affected bv some unconscious bias in the decision they arrived at. It was human nature that they should be. I am not saying this .as a reflection upon these gentlemen, but ann merely pointingout that the decision they arrived at is not one that ought to weigh with the Senate. Further than that, their decision indicates a narrowness of view which, I think, should preclude the idea of our accepting them as safe guides. I refer to the decision in which thev declared that no Government meteorologist ought to issue forecasts for conditions outside the borders of his own State. It seems to me to be little short of criminal, that any meteorological observer in this country, knowing of the approach of a storm which not only might mean damage to property, but, in the case of seafaring citizens, loss of life, should hold his tongue, and say nothing about it, merely to subscribe to the principle that he should not issue forecasts affecting conditions outside his own State. These considerations seem to me to justify the Senate in ignoring altogether the report of the meteorologists in conference. We may safely turn to the examples of America, India, Canada, and a large portion of Europe. We may assume that the meteorologists in those countries are free- from provincial feeling in a matter of this sort. They have had years of experience of meteorological observations made over a wide area, and that experience has proved that such observations are more serviceable, economical, and reliable than are observations cut out into .small areas. It is curious that, though our officials hesitated to affirm the desirableness of federalizing their work, they still showed the necessity for that federalization, because they recommended a certain course of joint action, which really was federalization in certain particulars. Apart from their recommendations, the very fact that they were at variance as to what ought to be done shows the necessity of some central control, and joint action. Therefore, although these gentlemen have met together and arrived at a decision adverse to the establishment of a Federal Meteorological Department, it seems to me that their report confirms the wisdom, of this measure. There is another point which supports the Bill, and that is the evidence of a belief on the part of the heads of meteorological science in the necessity for international action and interchange of international data. The Minister stated last night that the Government had had communications from India asking for an interchange of cables furnishing data for the purposes of weather forecasts. The same has happened between; America and Canada, and happens extensively in Europe. This shows the desirableness of the area of observation being made as wide as possible; and we can only come to the conclusion that a wide area of observation adequately equipped and efficiently managed involves placing meteorological observation under Federal control. </para>

              <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> probably knows more about the cable business than I do, but I understand that there are such things as codes; and where you are dealing, as you would in this case, with certain well-known conditions, and have a constant repetition of certain phrases, the amount of information that could be conveyed by one code word would surely be considerable. The expense of cabling ought not to be great. Certainly I do not think it would be prohibitive. At any rate, I believe it would be one of the finest investments we could make. Speaking of India - although I wish the Senate to understand that I am not pretending to any meteorological knowledge - there is one matter that seems to me to be important from our point of view. It is well known that our monsoonal rains come from the north-west, and cross South Australia into Queensland, and sometimes into New South Wales and the southern States. At the present time, when the data upon which forecasts are founded is. obtained, it is wired, I suppose, to Perth, Adelaide, Sydney. Melbourne, and the capitals of the other States. The result is that we have a multiplicity of telegrams giving the same facts, and we have different officers working out the forecasts from the same data. These forecasts are published in the same newspapers for the same people. If honorable senators turn to the daily newspapers they will see forecasts, not only for the State in which the information is published, but for the other States. For instance, the Melbourne papers this morning contain forecasts relating to South Australia, New South Wales, and Victoria. Queensland, I think, is not issuing them at the present time. All this is an unnecessary duplication. By a true federalization of this work, great economy would be secured. It would put a stop to the endless duplication of the telegrams to which I have referred. There is another reason why we should take over this Department. I want honorable senators to understand that when I say that we should take over this Department, I mean, not the proposal in this Bill, but the absolute taking over of the whole of the meteorological work of the Continent. </para>

              <para>- That is&#39; so. But there are two alternatives. We might, on the one hand, merely appoint one officer, to be called the Commonwealth Meteorologist, as provided for in clause 3, and leave him entirely dependent upon the existing States observatories for his information ; or we might allow him to .get independent information, with the result that, whilst various observers throughout the States were wiring to him for Federal purposes, in order that he might issue a forecast for the whole of Australia, they would also be wiring to the States Meteorologists information to assist them in issuing State forecasts. Neither economy nor efficiency would thus be gained. I want the Government, in diplomatic terms, to say, in effect, to the Governments of the States, &#34; We have passed a Bill creating a Meteorological Department. We wish to take over your Departments and your officers, and we shall be glad if we can arrange satisfactory terms with you.&#34; If the States Governments agree to the transfer, well and good. If they do not, the course open to us will be to appoint our&#62; own officers. It may be said that this would lead to duplication. I do not think it would. As soon as it was known that the Federal Government intended to have its own observers and its own officers, the States would willingly fall in with the arrangement. Here, again, the interjection made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> that &#34; human nature plays its part &#34; comes in. The States are just a little bit jealous of being, as they think, shorn of any of their functions&#39;. </para>

              <para>- Certainly it is. If it were not, this Bill would not have been introduced. I wish to see a federalization in fact, and not the mere appointment of one officer, who will be, to all intents and purposes, subordinate to the States observatories. I wish the Federal Government to take over the whole business. In that way alone shall we be able to secure an effective service. I would prefer to see no Commonwealth Department of Meteorology rather than that we should have one that was not truly Federal and effectives I have pointed out the trouble likely to accrue if we followed the course which this Bill would permit - if we simply appointed an officer who would become merely a recorder of the work already carried out in the various States observatories. I can see no use in appointing such an officer, unless, at the same time, we secure that the States officers shall become part of the whole machinery. If they were to carry on independently the work of issuing forecasts for the several States, there would be little use in appointing an additional officer, who would simply duplicate their work. The only justification for the appointment of a Federal officer would be the formation of the States observatories into one Department, where  we should have uniformity of action and a central control. By such centralization very considerable economy would be secured in respect to the cost at present incurred in obtaining the necessary telegraphic information. I shall be very glad to hear the Minister give some indication of his views on the two alternatives which this Bill leaves open to the Government. Of course, the Minister would not care to say exactly what the Government are disposed to do, but it would be some comfort to me, and probably to other honorable senators, to know that they were favorable to the federalization of the Meteorological Departments of the States in fact as well as in name. I am sure we are all anxious to know whether they desire to secure a truly Federal&#39; control, or merely to appoint one officer to be called the Federal Meteorologist. </para>

            <para>. - I have listened with pleasure to the speech delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> and must say that I heartily indorse it. It is to be regretted that the whole of the States Departments of meteorology are not to be brought into line. It seems that it is proposed to appoint a Commonwealth Meteorologist who will have no power unless the States Departments choose to work harmoniously with him. I am afraid that our knowledge of human nature does not warrant the belief that thev will. Laws relating to meteorology and astronomy are within the scope of the Federal Parliament, and I cannot see what objection there should be to the States Departments being taken over and consolidated into one magnificent institution, which, if based on the J lines of the departments of Canada and the United States, would be of immense value to the Commonwealth. When I was on the hustings I pointed out that we had six Agents-General when one ought to suffice, and six Astronomical Departments when one should be sufficient. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wragge</inline> was the Government Astronomer of Queensland great confidence was shown in his forecasts by mariners, and also by pastoralists in most parts of Australia. Queensland got rid of him in an extraordinary fashion. </para>

              <para>- It is a pity that the Government are not prepared, as it were, to put their foot down, amd to say, &#34; We will take over the States Departments that we have power to federalize.&#34; I do not suggest that the States officials should be harshly treated. Thev would not suffer any loss of rights by being transferred, but those who had reached the retiring age should be pensioned off. In this way a great saving would lae effected. People complain with good cause that we have six Agents-General instead of one, that we have six Departments of Meteorology when one would suffice, and that we are spending large .sums in securing telegraphic information when the whole system should be simplified, amplified, and greatly improved. The producers, as well as the mariners of Australia, who, since the retirement of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wragge,</inline> have been lacking much information, would be greatly benefited bv the establishment of one Federal Department. The forecasts issued bv the Government Astronomer of New South Wales have certainly improved of late, but the information at the disposal of our pastoralists and mariners in regard to the weather is hot what it was in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wragge!s</inline> time. That gentleman had a wider experience, and i h&#39;adj made a very careful study of the subject. It is better that the Bill should not to be passed than that one officer should be appointed and left dependent on the States Departments for his information. We need a strong Government, prepared to take the bull by the horns. </para>

              <para>- If the Government would only tackle him in a proper way they would find that he is, after all, only a very small animal. I do not suggest that these officials should be treated improperly or in a niggardly fashion. We have been in existence as a Commonwealth for five or six years, and this is one of the first matters of administration that should have been taken over. In Canada the Meteorological Department is looked to toy the whole State. In Australia for many months we have had monsoons, and have been flooded with inches of rains, and yet we have had no forecasts, beyond, perhaps, a telegram, which should have been published long before if proper arrangements had been made to cover a wider sphere. The people are determined that this transfer, which would result in much saving, shall be made; and I hope that the reply of the Minister will prove satisfactory. </para>

            <para>.- I a.gree with honorable senators in congratulating the Honorary Minister on his lucid speech in introducing this Bill. If I have any exception to take to the measure, it is that it is not sufficiently comprehensive in its terms. We are seeking to acquire jurisdiction in regard to some of the subjects specially committed to our care - to exercise our power to make laws for peace, order, and good government in relation to astronomical and meteorological observations. It is admitted that this is an enabling Bill, tout it only enables us to take over the meteorological branch. In an enabling Bill we should, as far as possible, seek to take over all that we reasonably have an expectation of being able to acquire. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser.</inline> I think, put the matter a little teo strongly when he said that it was the duty of a strong Government to take over at once the administration of all these mat-  ters, quite irrespective of any objection or remonstrance on the part of the States Governments. That is not necessarily the contemplation of the Constitution. We may have abstract power to establish meteorological stations throughout Australia, quite irrespective of the stations which now exist, but I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> would be one of the first to object to anything of the kind. </para>

              <para>- That is one of the points with which I intend to deal. If the principle I have indicated is acted upon, the friction created may have a very alarming effect. The time is specially opportune to take over the complete control of both the Astronomical and Meteorological Departments. It will be noticed&#39; that these are associated in section 51 of the Constitution ; and, if I may so say, it is in the contemplation of the Constitution that they shall be taken over and dealt with together. I. do not say that that should necessarily happen ; but when we have an admission at the outset that this is an enabling Bill, coupled with the fact that the Premiers themselves have practically invited! us to take over both branches, now is the opportune moment for us to fulfil the contemplation of the Constitution, and secure complete jurisdiction. Iam not urging for a moment that it is essential that these two Departments should be dealt with together. I am urging that by the Constitution, the responsibility is cast upon the Commonwealth to assume jurisdiction ; and I ask the Ministerand the Senate to take advantage of the present specially opportune condition of affairs, though not by any overriding action on our part, or any autocratic assumption of power, to insist on securing jurisdiction that may be doubtful. Whenwe have an invitation on the part of the Premiers themselves to us to take over these two Departments, it is our duty to fulfil the responsibility cast upon us. </para>

              <para>- But they have been objectingall along. Up to the present time the States have spoken with several voices; that is to say. various Governments have come into power from time to time, and we have heard the views of each particular Government. Now, however, we have a unanimous resolution of the Premiers, who are at present in power, and with whom we have to immediately deal. Is there any likelihood of a more opportune time presenting itself for us to fulfil the contemplation of the Constitution ? </para>

              <para>- At this particular juncture I do not think it wise to pay too much attention to the reports of the experts ; as Artemus Ward says, &#34;There is a lot of human nature about man.&#34; I have the highest regard for those officials, whose representations are entitled to every respect in regard to their scientific knowledge, but in a matter of administration they must, as the Premiers themselves acknowledge, yield to the terms of the Constitution. I am strongly disposed to think that it would be a reflection on ourselves, and entirely our fault if by further organization on our part, and toy a federalizing process, we could not make these Departments more effective than at present. It was thought by the framers of the Constitution that greater efficiency could be secured in this connexion. </para>

              <para>- Exactly ; and consequently, in a matter of this kind, I prefer to accept the advice of the Premiers of the several States Governments, and to cooperate with them. If that be the proper course, it is the duty of the Senate to invite the Minister to alter his Bill, so as to give the additional enabling power. This would not commit us to anything, but it certainly would enable us to carry out the Constitution. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> very properly urged1 that in many matters it is advisable we should act alone, and on our own responsibility. But we should somewhat hesitate, and be practically driven by necessity, before we do so. In this case, as I say, we have mutual co-operation, and thus we manage to avoid friction. The Government in the Bill before us. which I welcome most cordially, have adopted the wise policy of, first of all. proposing to appoint a Central Meteorologist. I was going to say that the Government ought to carry out the resolution of the Premiers&#39; Conference, but I am debarred from that, because, if I remember rightly that Conference declared that we must take over both or neither of the Departments. Still the process the Government propose is set forth in clause 5, under which they may make arrangements to take over the several stations as they now exist. That enables the Governor-General to arrange with the Governors of the various States - that, of course, means the States Governments - to take over the stations. </para>

              <para>- I am putting the case as I understood it from the Minister, who now says that the effect of the resolution is that we must take over both or neither. The Government have introduced a Bill to take over one particular branch, and, as the negotiations will necessarily have to be with the Governments at present in power - who have affirmed that we must take over both or neither - clause 5 may prove abortive for many years to come. If thatbe the position of affairs, it is a cogent reason why the more comprehensive measure I have indicated should be passed. As to the necessity for national forecasts, notwithstanding the scientific advice of the officials who have reported in this matter, the opinion of the public, for whom we have to cater has, I think, established beyond all question that such forecasts are essential, and in the best interests of Australia. We know exactly how they were appreciated when, in a very enterprising manner, that eminent meteorologist, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wragge,</inline> by the aid of his Government, gave Australia the benefit of his splendid knowledge. Australia, therefore, looks for the accomplishment of this work at the earliest possible moment. I can quire understand, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wragge</inline> has urged that if he is furnished with the additional data which he desired, and which certainly is required, his forecasts must necessarily be infinitely more valuable. Ifhe has a wider area to judge from, and better data is secured to him&#39;, then I understand from him that he may almost promise that about 95 per cent, of his forecasts will be verified. This is a matter of no small moment to Australia. It may mean thousands, if not millions, of pounds to its people. </para>

              <para>- Judging from the experience of other nations, it is desirable that these twogreat branches should be separated, certainly so far as their work is concerned, but that does not mean for one moment that both branches should not be taken over. The Federal Government may,  and no doubt would, work them separately if that was the more efficient manner of dealing with them. The Board of Visitors to the Melbourne Observatory have recommended that the astronomical branch should not be taken over, because they feel that the States observatories should maintain their present individuality. It would be rather a serious reflection upon the Federal body, if these institutions were to lose their efficiency or value by reason of having come under Federal control. I do not think for a moment that such a contingency is possible. It is quite true that we are justified in inquiring into the question of expense. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wragge</inline> must have stated the annual expense at a minimum when he estimated it at &#163;10,000. Of course, it referred to meteorological work only, and certainly it would not include the cost of telegrams. But even if it were to cost ^&#163;20,000 or &#163;30,000, that would be a mere bagatelle, having regard to the magnitude and value of the work to be undertaken. In this connexion, it would be desirable for the Minister to supply us with some information, but he may assume that the Senate is not prepared to deal niggardly with the Government in regard to any proposals which thev have to make. One point which must be impressed upon the Government bv this debate is that, first of all, it is their duty to see that there is established, with the least possible delay, an effective meteorological service. If that is the object in view, then the most comprehensive manner in which it can be undertaken should be resorted to at once oy the Government. </para>

              <para>- My complaint is that it does not, and that unless the Minister is prepared to include the astronomical s well as the meteorological branch, then, in view of existing conditions, and the expression of opinion by the States Premiers, he will most seriously neutralize the value of the Bill. He will start with a very big handicap. He can. of course, appoint his Central Meteorologist, but the States Premiers have said that we must take over both services, or neither of them. The mere appointment of a Central Meteorologist will not satisfy the Senate, nor meet the requirements of Australia. Consequently, if the Minister purposes to go over the heads of the States Governments, and establish separate meteorological stations, that will mean an unnecessary duplication of affairs. </para>

The question with which the Bill deals is one of everyday importance to an enormous number of the citizens of the Commonwealth. If the meteorological branch can be taken over independently of the other branch, I think it would be wise to do so. </para>

              <para>- It gave the Commonwealth Parliament power to deal with these questions, and at such times as might be considered to be convenient. In my opinion both branches are extremely important to the world, but meteorology is extremely important to Australian citizens. We mav be in a position now to take over one branch, and) yet consider it inexpedient to take over both branches. I think, with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> that there would be very little use in appointing an officer who would be completely at the mercy of the officials of the States. Itseems to me that the Bill gives the necessary power. It is one to enable us to do something. It will not compel the Government to act if there does not appear to be a possibility of acting with economy and efficiency. But it will enable them, if an arrangement can be made, to take over and make efficient the meteorological services throughout the Commonwealth. That is a thing which is very essential if it can be clone. </para>

              <para>- I think it would be well, perhaps, to take over both branches, but I am not so sure about that at this stage. For that reason, I approve of the partial character of the Bill. Of course, the time will come, and probably not in the distant future, when the whole question, of astronomy will come within the control of this Parliament. I believe that the Government are wise in proceeding gradually, and taking control as quickly as they can of that branch which is of dailyimportance to a very large number of our citizens. </para>

            <para>.- In listening to the very interesting and instructive speech of the Minister, for which I desire to thank him, it struck me that this Bill was drawn to meet the facts and the difficulties that he presented to the Senate. I should like to deal shortly with two criticisms which have been offered. The only real criticism, of the Bill has come from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best,</inline> who thinks that we are making a blunder in not giving power to the Government to take over the astronomical branch. I could not make out why that power was not taken in the Bill until the Minister read the report of the Board of Visitors to the Melbourne Observatory. These gentlemen point out that there is no connexion between the astronomical branch and the meteorological branch. They state that one does not depend upon the other, and that if both are taken over complicationswill arise. I quite agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> when he says that the meteorological branch is of practical importance to the life of Australia. The other branch deals with the matter of science. I do not know whether the Board of Visitors raised the question in their report, but it appears to me that, as the best way of dealing with astronomical matters, one of our universities might establish a chair of astronomy and enlarge the astronomical work to a very considerable extent; or the universities might establish a kind of Federal professorship, and tints get the work done a great deal better than it could be done by the Commonwealth. Although I am not prepared to say that that would be the best course to adopt, I can see, with the help of the report of the Board of Visitors, sufficient reasons for not taking the necessary power in this Bill.&#39; I do not at all agree that, because astronomy and meteorology are joined together in one line of the Constitution, we must not take over one without the other. I do not think that that was intended. We have a perfectly free hand <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> take over either one branch or both branches, just as it mav suit us to do. The more practical criticism against the Bill came from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> when he suggested that we may have a Federal Meteorological Department in name and not in fact. </para>

              <para>- I have not sufficient scientific knowledge to know what is the right thing to do, but I can quite imagine that when we come to negotiate with the States we shall find it just as well to leave some of them severely alone. I am not in the confidence of the Premier of Tasmania, but I believe that he decided this matter contrary to the decision of his predecessor, on the ground of economy alone. In Hobart we have a very efficient officer to attend to meteorological work, but he certainly does receive a starvation salary. I believe that the Premier of Tasmania said to himself, &#34; My present one-man department, which is doing good and efficient work, will serve Tasmania better and more cheaply than can the Commonwealth.&#34; Whether that was the case or not, he has now given up his first opinion, and joined with the other States Premiers in wishing these two departments to be taken over. </para>

              <para>- I am inclined to think that the forecasts which we want, and which would be of the greatest value to us, would be those based upon information collected by trained officers in each State, or at such stations as science may determine to be best for the collection of such information. I take it that in all probability the Federal officer will be a man who will have many duties to perform. Perhaps the greater part of his work will be to supervise a red-tape Department, and the skilled forecasts of State officers may really be the information of which the Australian public will get the benefit. I am really in some doubt - and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> did not make the point clear to me - as to what the Federal meteorological officer is to do. Is he to make separate forecasts for the whole of Australia, and for the coasts of Australia, and for areas hundreds of miles outside the coasts, based upon the observations of a number of observers, stationed at various points? I do not know that that will be the best way to obtain the meteorological information which we would require. </para>

              <para>- But science has vet to determine upon what spot in Australia it is most advantageous that the Federal Meteorologist shouldbe situated. Is there one State which is better fitted than any other for this purpose? Is there one particular place where a meteorologist could better made up his forecasts, or is it immaterial where he is located, so long as he gets; accurate information from his observers? Are some stations more important than others ? I dare say that) they are. Therefore it seems to. me that the Government has done well to make this simply an enabling Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> has said that it is not comprehensive enough. It appears to me to be thoroughly comprehen sive. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> urges that it is not specific enough, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has pointed out the difficulties in the way of making it more specific, and!

It is purely an enabling Bill, because the usual phraseology is that the Governor-General may name a day for the transfer of the Department in question. Suppose the GovernorGeneral cannot make arrangements with one or two States, what would be the use of clause 5? Ought there not to be more power taken to enable the Governor - General, by proclamation, to take over State Departments ? </para>

I will give my reason. As regards meteorology, we desire to widen the area from which observations are taken. We desire to do away with the isolation of the States, which has rendered meteorological work of Less value to the Commonwealth than it was when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wragge</inline> acted practically as the Commonwealth Meteorologist. At that time, he practically gave Australia forecasts for the whole Continent, and he was only stopped from continuing that work by each State refusing to supply him with the necessary data. </para>

              <para>- This Bill will make it necessary to carry on the work over a wider area. But as regards astronomy, it appears to me that the obverse is desirable. Instead of widening the area for astronomical observations, we need to centralize the work. Astronomy is not in the same category with meteorology. While it may be necessary to have observation stations all over Australia for the purpose of meteorological work, it may not be so necessary for the purposes of astronomy. One central observatory fully equipped, instead of halfadozen half equipped, would do for astronomical purposes. </para>

              <para>- I am quite aware that there are different sets of instruments, but the instruments for astronomical purposes are side by side with the instruments for registering the velocity of the wind., rain gauges, thermometers, and other meteorological apparatus. The officers who undertake meteorological work also conduct the astronomical observations. It would be a most higgledy-piggledy arrangement to make a line of demarcation in one building between two sets of officers. Why should we create that confusion when we can save money to the States and promote efficiency in the work by taking over both Departments? By exercising our powers under the Constitution we can obviate the necessity of the States continuing in the haphazard fashion they have followed. I venture to say that if we were to agree to take over both these Departments, the result would be that not only should we have better results from the meteorological point of view, but also better results from the astronomical point of view. We should save money, and we should obtain better scientific results in both Departments. That being the case, why does not the Minister meet the State Premiers in their request? If they are willing to hand over both these Departments, why not accept their offer, not only in the interests of the Departments themselves, but also in the interests of the taxpayers, and for the benefit of Australia ? </para>

            <para>. - I should like to say. in answer to some criticisms that have been levelled at the Bill, that honorable senators will be well-advised in supporting it not only on its second reading, but also in Committee. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has invited my attention to the question of administration. He has pointed out that there are two courses open to the Government administering this Bill. One is that it should appoint a Chief Meteorologist, and rest satisfied with that. The Chief Meteorologist would be dependent for his information upon officers still in the employ of the States Meteorological Departments. That system, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has pointed out, would not give to Australia the great benefits and advantages that we hope to derive from the federalization of our meteorological service. The other alternative is to establish a complete, separate, and independent Federal meteorological service which may absorb, and should be intended to absorb, the existing States services. I can assure the Senate that the intention of the </para>

But, as has been pointed out in the course of the debate, it is not within the competence of the Federal Government to take over the existing States Departments by proclamation. The power given to us under the Constitution is to &#34; make laws for the peace, order and good government of the Commonwealth&#34; with regard to &#34;astronomical and meteorological observations &#34; ; but although that power is given to us, the corresponding power that the States have hitherto enjoyed is not taken away from them.

              <para>- I thought I dealt with that aspect of the matter fully last night. I showed what had been the opinions of the States Premiers at different times. I also quoted the views of the States meteorologists and of the Board of Visitors to the Melbourne Observatory, whose views are entitled to respect and consideration. I &#39; do not think it is necessary for me to repeat them. </para>

              <para>- No. I can assure the Senate that the object of this Bill is to have the Meteorological Departments of the States effectively and completely federalized. It is our object to establish the most efficient service that we can get in Australia directly and immediately under Federal control. The necessities&#39; of the case require that we must legislate in the form we propose. We make provision, therefore, for the Governor-General to arrange with the Governor of any State for the transfer to the Commonwealth of any of the equipment of any of the departments in any of the States, for -  the transfer to the Commonwealth, on such terms as are agreed upon, of any observatory and the instruments, books, registers, records, and instruments used or kept in connexion therewith. </para>

Although we have had six meteorologists, each having his own particular State as the area with which he was more directly and intimately concerned, and in connexion with which he more closely worked, it does not necessarily follow that that separation or division would be the best division of Australia for Australian purposes. The Chief Meteorologist appointed by the Commonwealth may divide Australia into a larger or smaller number of divisions. These are matters for organization which must remain for the men who are to be put in charge of this work. This is one of the difficulties with which we are confronted in making legislative provision for these matters. Consequently, we make our Bill as wide and as elastic as possible, so that it can be adapted to the exigencies and requirements of the future. </para>

              <para>- Certainly ; that is the whole basis of the Bill. I dealt as fully as I could last night with the severance of the meteorological from the astronomical services. I pointed out that we had some very valuable information before us in the correspondence between the Government of the Commonwealth and the Governments of the States ; and that valuable information was supplied by the Board of Visitors to the Melbourne Observatory. It cannot be suggested for one moment that the members of that Board had any axe, personal or political, to grind, or that they were influenced in their report by party or political considerations. But these gentlemen, including, if I remember rightly, Professor Lyle, Professor Kernot, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ellery, Mr. Theodore</inline> Fink, Captain Tickell, and other eminent men, reported most emphatically that the two departments of science were not related, and that the astronomical work at the Melbourne Observatory was suffering by reason of the fact that those who were charged with the carrying out of its work had super-added the duty of meteorology - a science with which astronomy is not necessarily related. I pointed out last night that, although the State Premiers had said that they were prepared to hand over both departments to the Commonwealth, the Premier of Tasmania, only a few weeks before the holding of the Conference at which that decision was arrived at, declared that that State was opposed to the establishment of a Commonwealth Meteorological Department. No dissent from the resolution of the Premiers is recorded, so that I presume the Premier of Tasmania was then agreeable to a proposal which would involve the Commonwealth taking over both the Meteorological and the Astronomical Departments of the States. </para>

              <para>- The position amounts to this : There is no Astronomical Department in Tasmania, and in Queensland the Astronomical Department is in no way connected with the State Department of Meteorology. It is a branch of the Survey Department of that State. It is a very small Department, and the Surveyor-General of Queensland is atthe head of it. I think it is agreed on all sides that it is essential that we should have, as early as possible, an efficient meteorological service. There is considerable doubt as to whether any advantage to the people of the Commonwealth or to those engaged in scientific investigation in Australia would flow from the immediate federalization of the astronomical work. Whether or not those doubts will soon be resolved I am not in a position to say. But, to my mind, there is this difference between meteorological and astronomical work in Australia : a Meteorological Department has a practical value to every citizen - a practical value which astronomical work has not. To the great bulk of the community astronomical work - the research which is involved, and the results of that research - has nothing but a theoretical value. On the other hand, meterological work has in it for us all something of practical urgency and necessity. That being so, why should we - in the face of the fact that there is a considerable difference of opinion among people in Australia who are competent to judge as to the value of federalizing our astronomical work - imperil or delay the assumption of the Federal control of the more important and practical Department of Meteorology? I ask honorable senators to consider the question from the points of view given, and to assist us in passing the Bill through its remaining stages as early as possible, so that it may be sent without delay to another branch of the Legislature. I have only to add that if arrangements cannot be made with any State to carry out the matters referred to in paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">a, b, c</inline> of clause 5, it may be possible under the general powers given to the Governor-General by paragraph <inline font-style="italic">d</inline> to surmount the difficulty that might otherwise arise in relation to our system. </para>

Although there is at present a protectionist Government in power, the members of that Government seem to be suffering from the importing disease just as badly as anybody else. They think that nothing produced in Australia is good, and they would go outside for all they require. Australians have proved themselves good men in many of the scientific walks of life, but they are denied the opportunity to prove their ability and capacity in this country, and have to go elsewhere to win their name. These men, when the opportunity presents itself, are given the gobye, while the Government look abroad, as if there was some special qualification in an official who was imported. I move - </para>

              <para>- I know what is current knowledge amongst those who are more in the way of ascertaining Government secrets than I am. I know nothing of my own knowledge. I do know, however, that in the case of Papua the Government, in response to a generally expressed desire from all sides of the Chamber, assured us that an Australian, who possessed the necessary qualifications, should be given the position of Administrator. So far, we have seen no disposition to redeem that promise, and, if rumour be correct, there is no intention to redeem it. A promise implied is just as binding as an explicit promise. I want the positions at our disposal to be given to Australians, and the only way I can see to successfully accomplish that end is to so provide in the Bill. If we trust this or any Government we shall have a very poor chance of attaining our desire. </para>

I think the trouble now before us may be got over. I do not suppose it is the intention of the Government in the next few weeks to take over the States Departments, or to appoint a Commonwealth Meteorologist. In the various countries that I have visited, if it is intended to appoint a skilled official to a position, he is given three months or six months to Travel to other places where the best systems are invogue, and the best information can be obtained. In the Malar Possessions, in Java, and the German Possessions, the authorities never think of going outside for officials of the kind. There are excellent Meteorological Departments in the places I have mentioned ; I do not suppose there is any place where meteorological information is better tabulated than in Java. If there was an Australian official who had some knowledge - perhaps the best man we could take  -  and if, before the Department was established, he was allowed six months in which to visit India or Java or whatever places have the most uptodate and scientific methods, I should think that that would get over the difficulty, and a competent Australian could be appointed. </para>

          <para>- I wish to point out to the Senate that the debate on a notice of motion standing in the name of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> was interrupted by the suspension of the sitting for dinner, and that no order was made as to when it should be resumed. It is, perhaps, irregular to do it now, but I think that, under the circumstances, the honorable senator may ask leave to move that it be made an order of the day for some future day. </para>
