                    SYMON (South Australia) [2.37]. - This is the. provision which is directed at restraint of' trade in two forms. It penalizes any "person," which word, of course, includes a corporation or firm, " who, either as principal or agent, makes or enters into any contract." Rightly or wrongly the clause is intended to prohibit the making of, or entering into, a contract, but then it goes on to say - or is or continues to be a member of or engages in any combination, in relation to trade or commerce in other countries or among the States.
                </para>
                <para class="block">I do not suppose it is intended that the measure, whatever its operation might be, should be retrospective. It would, I think, obviously be extremely unjust if existing contracts were put in peril, or if persons who were concerned in contracts, which an informer might suggest were a violation of the law, should be put in jeopardy of being prosecuted and fined. From what I have heard, I do not think that the intention of the Government is that the law should be retrospective in that way - that it should, so to speak, cut existing covenants, or do serious injury to persons who happened to be members of associations which might be charged as combinations. The measure will be a very drastic weapon, and if it be placed in the power of private individuals or firms, or corporations, who might wish to raise difficulties in the way of a rival's, trade to make use of it for their own purposes, it would be possible for, say, the proprietor of the Sunshine Harvester to set the law in motion against his rivals in a way of which we  might not approve. When I was speaking on the second reading, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> interjected that he had conferred with the Government, or with the Attorney-General, and had been assured that the Bill was not meant to be retrospective, arid that it would not be. But if the. words ''or is or continues to be a member of " be retained, I think it would necessarily be construed to be retrospective as to combinations already entered into. We might have a combination which was beneficent, or we might have a combination which was vicious, and which every one of us would seek to crush. The Minister of Defence said, quite candidly, that he could not name any combinations that were in existence; he believed that there were combinations in Australia, but that they were not bad or vicious. If there are any combinations in existence - and I do not know of any - we have not heard of them as being vicious or bad within the meaning of paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of this clause. A combination is really a contract or arrangement such as is indicated in clause 3. It might be called a partnership. Therefore, the word " combination " ought to be put in the same position as the correlative word "contract " in the same line, which is not made retrospective. But, because " combination ' ' is used instead of " contract " or "arrangement" or "cooperation" or "partnership," it is sought to make the Act retrospective, ,and to make a partnership in such a combination penal. </para>
                <para class="block">Of course, it may be said that there would be no harm in that if the persons who were mixed up in the combination were not affected with intent to restrain trade or commerce. But the point is that we might have this instrument used improperly to disorganize existing trades and to injure the workers employed in existing businesses. The provision is to relate to Inter-State trade and commerce only. It might be used to injure a rival in regard to existing combinations with the result that his business might be paralyzed, and everybody might suffer. Whilst he was put on trial in order to determine whether he was filled with that intent or not, what would be the state of his business and of his workmen? His business would be paralyzed, and his workmen, if not thrown out of employment, would be in a state more or less of suspended employment. One manufacturer or trader in Australia might be brought under the clause if at present he has made an arrangement with one or more firms or individuals to regulate, it might be, prices without injuring the public. I appeal to honorable senators to consider what might be the consequences of putting this weapon into the hands of a rival trader. I do not wish to whittle down the clause in the slightest degree in regard to anybody who hereafter might enter into a combination or arrangement or co-operation because he would be acquainted with the law, and must take his chance. But I contend that it ought not to be applied to those who are engaged at present in a combination or partnership or an association of different firms. Such men should not be put on trial in respect of anything which was not an offence when the arrangement was entered into. It is a new offence, so far as we are concerned. There is not one of us who would desire to make any citizen of Australia liable to be punished in respect to an offence that is now created, but which was not an offence at the time he entered into the arrangement.

                    <para>.- I quite agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> that if this clause is susceptible of making some act unintentionally done a crime, undoubtedly we should do all we can to prevent such a contingency. But with great respect to him, I find it difficult to attach any retrospective meaning to the clause. As I read it, the intention is, first of all, to deal with the making or entering into a contract. That is one' definite act which is specifically dealt with. The apprehension has been expressed that contracts entered into by various boot manufacturers in regard to Goodyear machines would be affected. Of course it would have to be shown that the contracts were entered into with intent to injure Australian trade or were detrimental to the public. If they were, this Bill would apply to them. The next offence relates to any person who is, or continues to be, a member of, or engages in, any combination. It is considered possible that that may be retrospective. First of all, we must ascertain what the offence is. If a combination has for its deliberate intent the restraint of trade or the injury of an Australian industry the preservation of which is advantageous to the public, an offence is committed. We will assume that at the passing of this measure there is a person who is a member of a combination which is desirous of crushing out an Australian industry, or of doing something detrimental to the public. This Bill provides that such a person shall be liable to punishment. Continuation of membership of such a body amounts to precisely the same as committing a new offence. It is the duty of the person concerned to at once relieve himself from membership of the combination. If he does so, he will be, of course, free from liability. If he continues to be a member of the combination, surely that is an act with which we can have no sympathy. The duty of Parliament would, I should say, be to put an end to such a state of affairs with the least possible delay. I am disposed to think that if any person were so unfair as to commence proceedings within a few hours of the passing of such a measure, and without allowing reasonable time for a man to get out of. an illegal com- . bination, the Court itself would say that the person proceeded against was entitled to a reasonable time to allow him to get out of the combination. </para>

                        <para>- Undoubtedly. A charge might be made against any honorable senator to-morrow. He might be dragged before the Court, and have to relieve himself from the stigma. If the combination is such an one as I have referred to, we cannot be too expeditious in compelling persons to relieve themselves of membership. When the prosecution takes place, undoubtedly the persons who are proceeding will do so at their own. risk, and be liable to be penalized if they fail in what they attempt. If the intent of the combination is to do wrong, that, of course, must be proved in order to secure a conviction. What is meant is not something that is retrospectively done, but something that is done and continues to be done after the passing of this Bill, and I do not think that our Courts would give any sympathy whatever to a man who in a reckless manner, and with a view to injure a rival trader, took proceedings against him, before he had time to clear out of an illegal combination. I think that the clause is clear and expressive in its present terms. </para>

                    <para>. - What I understand <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> to argue is that it would be unfair to make the clause apply to contracts already entered into. If that be so, would the honorable senator desire to extend immunity for all time to any combination or trust that is at present in existence in. Australia simply because it was in existence before this measure was passed? That point has not been satisfactorily cleared up. If there are in Australia monopolies that are injurious, it seems tome that it would accentuate the evil to provide that no other similar trust should grow up to compete with it. Take the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. That may or may not be a monopoly; and. if it is a monopoly, it may or may not be injurious. When legislation affecting the Colonial Sugar Refining Company was imminent some time ago, the company refused to supply its clients with sugar to the amount of their ordinary requirement. </para>

If the effect of leaving out the words quoted in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> 's amendment would be to allow to continue any possible monopoly which may exist in Australia, it would be a mistake to agree to it. We should put existing monopolies on exactly the same footing as monopolies that may arise after the passing of the Bill. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> can show that anything in this Bill will unfairly curtail the legitimate rights of trusts and combines-, I am quite prepared to vote with him, but it would not be well to put existing combinations on a distinctly better footing than combinations that may afterwards arise. </para>

                        <para>- That is what I understand that the amendment will accomplish. We say to the members of combinations, " We do not punish you for what you have done in the past. What you did was legal, although it may have been injurious <inline font-style="italic">ip</inline> the public. But directly we pass this measure you must stop doing that which is. detrimental to the public interest." That is a fair position. I do not know what combinations! may be in existence. There may be some which are highly detrimental to the public. Strike out the words to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon'</inline> objects, and the result will be that those combinations can go on for ever, and we cannot interfere with them. What honorable, senators would prefer, I think, would .be to provide that the measure shall not be retrospective, and shall not interfere with what the members of combinations have already done, but that as soon as the Bill is passed they must not continue their injurious practices. If the practices are not injurious to the public, they can of course be continued. If they are injurious, surely they should not be continued. </para>

                    SYMON (South Australia) [3.10]. - I am glad to hear what the Minister has said. He tells us that the Bill is not intended to be retrospective, and that a man who has been a member of a combination will not be penalized for what has already been done. As
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline>
                    puts it even more clearly the passing of the Bill will be an intimation to members of a partnership of different traders that they must, so to speak, clear out of any combination they may have formed. That being the intention, the words go further than the desire. Therefore I shall ask leave to withdraw the amendment I have submitted with a view of, in the first place, moving the elimination of the words "or is." I frankly acknowledge the force of
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford's</inline>
                    point in discriminating as to continuing to be a member of a combination, but that does not apply to the words which I intend to move shall be omitted. It is not intended to punish a man for being a member of a combination, but for continuing to be a member ; and if we retain the words "or is," any man who is a member of a combination at the moment the Bill is passed, will be liable to punishment, whether he continues to be a member or not.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline>
                    is perfectly right that any one of us is liable to be unjustly summoned and charged with an offence; but we cannot be charged with an offence which is non existing. It is an unalterable principle of British law that when a new offence is created, persons who, in the absence of any law to the contrary, have, as it were, acted innocently, shall not be liable to fine or imprisonment. That is what I mean by retrospective legislation.

                        <para>- The moment the Bill is passed a member of a combination who may, up to that time, have acted perfectly innocently, will be liable to prosecution. While it is absolutely true that there is no offence in the absence of the element of intent, that element cannot be determined until a man is put upon his trial, and placed, so to speak, in the dock ; and I object to the possibility of any citizen being haled before a Court in respect of an act which, up to that moment, was not an offence. It is not pleasant to be subjected to a prosecution for a criminal or <inline font-style="italic">quasi -criminal</inline> offence; and we must also remember that by such proceedings a man may be harassed and put to considerable expense in defending himself, while at the same time his business and prospects may be ruined and his employes thrown out of work. We ought to try as far as possible, whilst carrying out the objects of the Bill, to preserve individual freedom, and prevent men from being charged with offences in respect of acts which, before the passing of the measure, were perfectly innocent. I ask leave to withdraw the amendment. </para>

                        <para>- Then the clause provides that any person commits an offence if he, as principal or agent, continues to be a member of a combination, for what purpose? With intent to injure the public, or to restrain trade to the disadvantage of any Australian industry. A person must enter into a combination with that object before he will be liable to a prosecution. So far as the objection to retrospective legislation is concerned, no proceedings can be taken for any act done up to the passing of the Bill, because, although a man might have been doing wrong, there was no law against his wrong-doing. But the framers and supporters of the Bill say that if, after the Bill is passed, a man is, or continues to be, a member of an injurious combination, then he shall be guilty of an offence. Why should it not be so? I hope honorable senators observe the difference between the two divisions of this clause. The first portion deals with, contracts, and that is not interfered with by the amendment. Originally, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> desired that all the words "or is, or continues to be," should be struck out; but, as I say, he found out that he was wrong. </para>

                        <para>- If I moved an amendment and thought it was right, I should stick to it; but, if otherwise, and I desired an alteration made, I should be man enough to acknowledge I was wrong. It might be months or years after the passing of the Bill before any action was taken ; and if the amendment were adopted there would be a nice job for the law Courts to decide whether any punishment could be inflicted on a person who had ceased to continue to be a member of an injurious combination. As soon as the Bill is passed any person committing the act contemplated ought to be deemed guilty; and the introduction of the measure ought to be sufficient warning to those who are now doing wrong. If coining were not an offence, and the public suddenly awoke to the fact that the practice was injurious, and introduced a law against it. would any one attempt to insert an amendment of this kind? We are not legislating against the innocent, but for the purpose of preventing any one, or any combination; committing a certain act with intent to injure the public. People may now be committing a wrong of the kind, and they certainly ought to be liable to punishment immediately the Bill becomes law; indeed, we should be failing in out duty if we legislated otherwise. Every honorable senator who has the interests of Australia at heart must agree that a man who is, or continues, to be, a member of such a combination after the passing of the Bill - indeed, that is implied in every instance - should be deemed guilty of an offence and liable to punishment. </para>

I have already endeavoured to show that this clause cannot possibly have any retrospective meaning, because "or is" makes it clear that an offence can only commence on the passing of the Bill, and the words " with intent" imply something done in the future. " Intent" cannot relate to any prior act, but must necessarily refer to the future. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> contends that if the words " or is" are permitted to remain, there will be the possibility of an innocent man being attacked immediately. </para>

                        <para>- As a matter of fact, every one of us is liable at any moment to have an information sworn against us for an act of which we may be absolutely and! completely innocent. It appears to be contended, however, that under the Bill there is some special facility - a facility which H cannot quite comprehend - for some rival in trade or a member of the public to prosecute an innocent ' individual'.. That could only be done by an unfair or improper conspiracy with the Attorney-General, because before a proceeding of that kind could be taken, his consent must be obtained in accordance with clause 14. My honorable friend has suggested that an Attorney-General might be so utterly wanting in a knowledge of his duty to the public and to justice, as, upon the passing of the measure, to go so far as to authorize a prosecution against an individual. </para>

                        <para>- The object of the Bill is to make it an offence for a man to be a member of a combination formed for the purpose of doing injury to an Australian industry. That is the class of combination which we are seeking to punish. Ever since last session, a warning has been given to persons engaged in such combinations, that not much longer would they be permitted to be members thereof. The terms of the Bill are generally well known. One provision is that if a man is a member of a combination formed with intent to do injury to Australian industry, he must clear out of it at once. The measure can only apply to something which is <inline font-style="italic">in futuro.</inline> because it will operate from the time when it is assented to. Under clause 1.4, a prosecution for an offence created bv the Act must be initiated by the Attorney-General, or by some person authorized by him. Consequently, the dire consequences to which my honorable friend referred could not ensue. If a person went to the Attorney-General immediately after the Act was brought into operation, and expressed a desire that a prosecution should be commenced against a man, the Attorney-General would at once reply, " We must give the man reasonable time in which to retire from the combination, and if he should fail to do so, then I shall authorize a prosecution." The Attorney-General would have to be a party to each prosecution, and if he did wrong he would be responsible to Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- In my speech last night I mentioned the case of the shipping ring. Before the Navigation Commission, members of the Chambers of Commerce in the principal cities of Australia declared that the enforcement of the rebate system by that ring was equivalent to holding a pistol at their head, and that it acted so unfairly that they were obliged to do things which they did not desire to do. We wish to put an end to any agreement of that sort. The evidence of the witnesses to whom I have referred ought to carry some weight with honorable senators, because they have suffered from the existence of the agreement. Some merchants declared that the rebates had been retained for a period of two years and a half, and that at the end of that time they were not forthcoming. If I thought that, immediately the Bill was assented to, there was likely to be a proceeding taken against the shipping ring, although it is acting in a very unfair manner, I should still support the proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon.</inline> But I 'do not believe that any Government would be so unreasonable as to take an unfair advantage of any one who happened to be in that position. </para>

                            (New South Wales) [3.42]. - My vote will always be given against retrospective legislation of the character which has been indicated by honorable senators. It may be that there are in existence certain combinations with intent to injure the public; but the mere fact that a man was a member of such a combination not illegal when the Bill was assented to should render him liable to a prosecution upon its passage is entirely contrary to the principles on which the Legislature generally acts. Wherever it is intended to create a criminal offence, we ought to be very careful to see that the legislation Cannot be regarded as retrospective in its operation. I share the view of
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline>
                            as to the effect of the wording of the clause. It is perfectly true that, before a prosecution could be initiated, the sanction of the Attorney-General must be obtained. But are honorable senators going to place the Attorney-General, or any other Minister, in the position of an arbiter, with the right to say whether the law should be put in motion or not? Suppose a man were guilty of an offence. Is the Attorney-General to say. " Well, although the man has been guilty, I shall not permit a prosecution " ? If he were placed in that position he would be practically above the law. When representations were made to the Attorney-General, it would be his duty to ascertain whether a
                            <inline font-style="italic">prima facie</inline>
                            case had been made out", and, if so, not to take it upon himself to say whether punishment should be meted out, but to say that the Court should determine his guilt and what punishment should be awarded. We have been told that the Attorney-General would be unworthy of his position if he were to allow a prosecution to take place simply because, at the time of the passing of the Act, a man happened to be a member of a combination. The Bill, however, ' provides that the man shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding ^500, and the Attorney-General could not take it upon himself to say whether it should be inflicted or not. But let us assume, for the sake of argument, that he could do so. In what position would he then be placed ? To one man he could say, "I am not going to prosecute you, " and to another, " I intend to prosecute you." Would it not open the door to corruption and political persecution? 'It is said that, if a man were a member of a combination the day before the Act came into operation, and had then got out, he would not be liable to the penalty. But is not the offence really the continuation of membership of a combination? If we use the phrase " any person who is, and continues," we should achieve the object which is, desired by the Minister. Otherwise, it would be left to the Attorney-General to determine in each case what should l&gt;e done. There is now before Parliament legislation, which is alleged to have been introduced simply because of the importunity and influence of a particular firm of manufacturers. The allegation may or may not be true, but still it is made. Our desire should be to prevent the possibility of imputations being cast upon the purity of Ministers. The Bill adopts certain official! means to convict people of intentions. We are abandoning an English principle that has always been supposed to be imbued
                            <inline font-style="italic">m</inline>
                            our very blood - the principle that no man is to be held to be guilty unless his guilt is proved. It has always been held to be better that twenty guilty persons should go free than that one innocent person should be convicted. But under this Bill the guilt of a person is to be inferred unless the contrary is proved. Then turn to the provision defining " Commercial Trust." It is very wide. It is intended to be wide. I do not suppose that it is as wide as some people imagine it to be, but still it may be effective against combinations that are managed by a board of directors possessing somewhat extensive powers. I do not say that the clause would extend to such a body, but it is arguable that it might. It is to be assumed against persons who belong to a commercial trust that, because of their membership, their competition is unfair. It is a monstrous proposal, and one that is absolutely wrong. I say also that a Bill containing such a provision as that relating to the disorganization of industries penalizes honest men. I have no sympathy with the dishonest man who deliberately sets to work to injure the public. But I do say that we should be exceedingly careful in our legislation not to do anything which will penalize a main for a perfectly legitimate act. We should remember that we are dealing with novel legislation, embodying new ideas. We are constantly interfering with commerce. We are putting it in handcuffs and chains. A mercantile man can hardly move in any .direction without being confronted with some legislation affecting his business. There are honorable senators who condemn this Bill, but who nevertheless voted for its second reading.

                    has told us that he reads the clause as meaning what I have just read. But, after all, we must bear in mind that the words are capable of a different construction. I think that if my suggestion is accepted the object which the Government has in view will be met, and the Bill will carry out its purpose, whilst at the same time it will not punish a man because he may happen to be in a combination at one moment, though he may get out of it the next. The Minister will not be injuring the Bill by accepting the amendment, but he will get over a difficulty that may become a real live subject of trouble in the future.

                    <para>. - I may point out to my honorable friend who has just resumed his seat, and to other honorable senators, that the clause as at present framed makes it an offence for a man not merely to be in a combination formed for certain purposes regarded as mischievous, but to continue to be in it. The words "continues to be" in the clause would cover such a case as this : We will assume that there is in existence at the moment when this Bill becomes law a combination carrying on operations of a character which we regard as mischievous. The Bill will have no legislative effect upon any prior action that may have been taken by any individual member of such a combination. But the words "continue to be " throw upon every individual member of ouch a combination the obligation to get out of that combination the moment the Bill becomes law. If a man does hot get out he "continues to be" a member. Take the case of a combination that may be hereafter formed, but is not in existence at present. If before you can prove the guilt of a man who enters into such a combination you have not merely to prove that he is a member, but " continues to be " in that combination, it is quite possible that you would hardly ever be able to secure a conviction. Who is to determine what continuity is? Is it to be continuity for the space of a day, two days, or three days? We can measure continuity in the case of an individual who is a member of a combination before the passing of this Bill. That continuity is measured by extending over the point of time that separates the Bill from the Act - that is to say. the point of time when the Bill becomes law. But a man may "Be a member of a combination one day, and get out of it the next. </para>

We make all these sets of circumstances offences - the making or entering into the combination, the continuing to be a member of the combination, and the engaging in the combination. All of them are separate offences. Why do we use those different terms? Simply because of the peculiar sets of circumstances we have to deal with. Some isolated cases may be such that even, when a prosecution was instituted the Court would not feel warranted in coming to a conclusion if these words were not left in. </para>

                        <para>- We want to leave no loop-hole of escape for any individual who engages in any combination which is calculated to injure an existing Australian industry. I think, therefore, that honorable senators will see that it is necessary that we should have words making it an offence for a man actually to be a member of a combination which is guilty of the practices denned. Let us assume that the Bill has become law, and that an individual is being prosecuted. Suppose that the information laid against him is that he is a member of a combination which operates in restraint of trade and commerce. It would be necessary, in order to sustain the prosecution, to prove that he was a member of the combination. If we are going to strike out the words "or is," and simply leave in "continues to be," how should we .have to prove continuance ? We could not determine how long the continuance was to last. What we want to prove, however, is that a man "is" a member of a combination. We are striking at the men who enter into combinations. We are not going to pass this legislation on the assumption that there will be no further attempts to form combinations. The clause as it stands is designed to strike also at those who remain members of existing injurious combinations which continue after the Bill becomes law. and I think that it had better be adopted in its present form. </para>

This is the first operative clause in which the word " combination " appears. If we are not quite clear about the meaning of a word in a Bill it is always a good principle to strike it out. The more ambiguous are the words used in an Act of Parliament the greater the trouble afterwards. There is no reference to combination " in the Sherman Act. The word appears to me to be unnecessary.

                        <para>- That is so. But honorable senators will see that there is no necessity for the reference to a combination, because the offence is complete if a person enters into a contract with intent. As I read the clause, a combination means a combination between tire persons who enter into the contract, and a person who afterwards entered into a contract with intent would be guilty of an offence. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> said that we have to contemplate the making of a contract afterwards : and that is quite true. But sub-clause 2 provides that any contract entered into in contravention of the clause will be absolutely illegal and void ; so that provision is made for contracts entered into after the passing of the Bill. I do not see the use of the words in regard to combinations, unless the Minister is going to contend that a combination is something which goes further than a contract between persons to do certain things. I should be glad to be shown the difference between a combination and the entering into a contract. </para>

                    SYMON (South Australia) [4.15]. - The discussion has, in the hands of some honorable senators, drifted a little wide of the amendment before the Committee. But I do not think the time has been mis-spent ; on the contrary, this being a penal enactment, both
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline>
                    and
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline>
                    have pointed out that such an enactment is construed most favorably to the defendant. I originally moved to strike out " or .is or continues to be a member " ; and then the Minister of Defence pointed out that the intention of the Government was not to penalize persons who happened to be engaged in a combination - assuming the word to have the meaning ascribed to it by the Minister - at the moment the Bill was passed, but to penalize those who remained or continued to be members.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline>
                    adopts the same view, that the clause is to meet the case of those who remain in existing combinations, or who join combinations subsequently organized. Wilh that view I agree ; but when the Minister of Defence pointed out what was the desire of the Government, I thought I made it perfectly clear that I recognised the force of the distinction. In order that honorable senators might have the view of the Minister clearly before them, I temporarily divided the amendment, but did not abandon or qualify the position I took up, that the whole of the words ought to be eliminated as unnecessary. I thought the Minister would have consented to the elimination of "or is," and then have relied on what I admit was a fair argument, not wanting in force, that we ought to reach those who remain or continue in combinations previously established.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline>
                    advanced the very sound reason, from the prudential stand-point, that nobody will be likely to suffer, seeing that prosecutions will not be initiated without the consent of the Attorney-General. I am not going to discuss that provision now, but merely to deal with the particular argument offered to the Committee. One of my strongest objections to the Bill is, however, that it imports political considerations and political influences, which are distinctly disadvantageous in a measure affecting trade and commerce. I would rather leave it to the unrestricted action of those who might wish to protect the public or themselves, or any particular trade or industry, than I would put it in the power of an Attorney-General of one particular political complexion to direct f prosecution, or of an Attorney-General of another political complexion to refuse one. The less we bring proceedings of whatever kind within the scope of political influences and considerations the better. This is. not like the case of a magistrate who listens to evidence, and decides that there is a
                    <inline font-style="italic">prima facie</inline>

                    of the Minister of the da)s and we cannot disguise from ourselves the influences and considerations that may be brought to bear. While I frankly admit the force of what has been said, that does not affect the question whether or not we are to make this clause applicable to a person who is presumably .an "innocent member of a combination that was perfectly fair up to the passing of the Bill. As
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline>
                    pointed out, we have a precedent in the Sherman Act, which uses words that are perfectly clear and sufficient. I am not certain that the words "rr engages in a combination " are not sufficient to deal with existing combinations which are subsequently continued. A person who " engages " in trade is not one who merely enters into trade ; he may have been in trade before the expression is used regarding him, and he continues in trade if he engages in it. I am afraid that, in the desire to extend the net widely, and to bring everything within the scope of the enactments, a great many unnecessary words have been used. It is laudable to insure that no leakages shall occur, but I know from experience that when' unnecessary words are used, particularly in a penal enactment, the object in view is very often defeated. The Sherman Act. on which this Bill is founded, provides that - . . every contract, combination, in form of a trust or otherwise - showing what is aimed at - or conspiracy -

                <quote>
                    <para class="block">That is what it amounts to - conspiracy with, intent to injure or restrain trade, which is punishable at common law - in restraint of trade or commerce to be illegal ; every party thereto, guilty of a misdemeanour. </para>
                    <para class="block">What could be more clear? In the clause under discussion more words have been used, without imparting any additional force. The Sherman Act goes on - or engaged in any such combination or conspiracy, shall be deemed a misdemeanour. </para>
                    <para class="block">That is all. In the Bill, however, we interpose the words " or is or continues to be a member of," which I regard as unnecessary, and likely to lead to confusion. The intention is good, but the effect of these words may be to make. the Bill less workable than we should desire in crushing out mischievous monopolies. Lawyers have been taunted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> with "weaving a web " ; but it is the language used in the Bill that is the web. I merely wish to call attention to the fact that in temporarily withdrawing the amendment I do not recede for one moment from the objections which I expressed. I give the Minister of Defence credit for advancing arguments which are seriously worthy of consideration as to the second part of the provision; but as to the first part, honorable senators are asked to do something which I think they ' would not ordinarily be disposed to do. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best,</inline> who has put his point of view very clearly, that the words may possibly relate to subsequent combinations ; but that is not the intention. The word " engages ' ' is intended to cover subsequent combinations, and also as I think, the continuance of combinations. Why should we not adhere to the Sherman Act,' and thus get the benefit of the great mass of decisions on1 the law in the United States? I trust that the Committee will eliminate " or is," or, if not, that the Minister will consent to substitute " and " for "or." </para>

In clause 4 of this Bill we exercise the power which is granted by paragraph 1. of section 51, while in clause 5 we exercise the power which is granted by paragraph xx. of that section. In each case the clause follows the wording of the legislative power. Therefore, my contention is right all through. </para>

The reason why different verbiage is adopted in regard to clauses 4 and 5 is because in each case the draftsman has adhered to the wording of the legislative power in virtue of which it is drawn. Clause 4, for instance, is the enactment of a provision under paragraph 1. of section 51, while clause 5 is an enactment of a provision under paragraph xx. of that section. </para>

                    <para>- - The reason for the difference in the verbiage of the two clauses may be obvious to the legal mind ; but certainly it is not obvious to my mind. What is obvious1, however, is that, if clause 4 be passed as it stands, we might as well throw the Bill into the waste-paper basket. It would be a direct invitation to any monopoly to outwit the law by simply establishing in each State an agency which would have an instruction not to trade with any person outside its limits. If, according to the Constitution, it were incumbent upon us to take up that position, I could see some force in it. But, if we turn to clause 5, we find that a trading or financial corporation formed within the Commonwealth cannot do anything with intent to destroy or injure trade within the Commonwealth. Why do the Government assume over a corporation, foreign or local, a power which it does not assume over a person who is either a principal or an agent? I do not intend to take any part in placing upon the statute-book a measure which: could be so easily evaded. So far as I understand the purposes of clause 4, the Constitution does not know any of the States. The Commonwealth is one area, and practically the State boundaries do not exist. If that were not the case, each State could establish a Customs House at its borders. So long as it did not interfere with Inter-State trade, it could put the territory within its boundaries in any shackles or bonds it pleased. Surely the framers of the Constitution never contemplated anything so stupid as that! In any case, the words of my amendment are embodied in clause 5. Why then, should they not also be inserted in clause 4? </para>

                    <para>. - I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> is unduly worrying himself, because the two clauses are aimed at the same thing, and that is the repression of monopolies. In clause 4 we are exercising the trade and commerce power, and the Government have naturally adhered to its wording. But, in order to cope effectively with monopolies, it is necessary to take power to deal with a company which appoints an agent within a State. Clause 5 is designed to meet a case of that kind, and it is based' upon paragraph xx. of section 51 of the Constitution. Under clause 4 it would be possible to get at a foreign monopoly even if established in only one State, because it would be engaged iri trade with other countries. Surely an agent who obtained his goods from other countries would come under its purview. Will <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> deny that the Melbourne agent for the Massey Harris Company is an agent within the meaning of clause 4? </para>

In any case, he is engaged in commerce with other countries, and therefore comes within the scope of clause 4. Take the case of the sugar trust, which is located in Queensland, and has no works in any other State. That is a trading corporation, formed within the limits Pf the Commonwealth, and therefore is covered by clause 5. That is, I think, the case which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> had in his. mind!. If we were to alter clause 4 as he desires, it would be made practically a repetition of clause 5. In the two clauses as they stand, we are getting al] the power which he desires to obtain, and in a constitutional manner. </para>

                    <para>-45]- - Of course, there are objections, and I think strong ones, to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart's</inline> amendment, just as I think that from the constitutional point of view there are very strong objections to clause 5. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> said he could not believe that the Constitution was s'o very stupidly framed as to enlarge, by paragraph xx. of section 51, our legislative powers, so that we could prevent in a State a kind of commerce or arrangement which would' be in restraint of trade locally in regard to a trading corporation, and we could not do it in regard to a combination of individuals. That strikes one at once as a very extraordinary position. The Constitution does riot mean what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> said. The Convention never intended anything of the kind. Paragraph xx. of section 51 has been grievously misunderstood. It is paragraph 1. alone which gives the Parliament power to deal with trade and commerce, and that power is limited to trade and commerce with other countries and among the .States. It does not give power to interfere with trade ,or commerce within the limits of a State. It was never intended that it should be given. Whatever legislation may have to be adopted' in regard to restraint of trade within the boundaries of a State, must emanate from the State Parliament alone. It has been said that paragraph xx. of section 51 enlarges the power contained in paragraph 1., so that where we have a trading or financial corporation or a foreign corporation, we can interfere with trade within the limits of a State. It does nothing of the kind. The only effect of paragraph xx. is to enable the Commonwealth Parliament to make uniform companies laws. It was introduced in order to enable this Parliament to pass companies laws which would be applicable throughout the States, and give a status to foreign corporations as well as to local trading and financial corporations. We could by the exercise of this power create these legal entities. Instead of persons, we have foreign corporations or local trading and financial companies. How are they to trade? The moment we deal with such bodies in that connexion we act under paragraph 1. of section 51, and we can only legislate with regard to their operations with other countries and among the States. That, I assert emphatically, is what the Convention intended, and what the Constitution says. </para>

                        <para>- That is because of the navigation laws, which must be uniform throughout the Empire. Trade and commerce are dealt with, in paragraph 1. of section 51. Then in section 98, with regard to two subjects, the provision of paragraph 1. of section 51 is extended - that is to say, with' regard to navigation and shipping, and also with regard to railways the property of any State. But the only power we have to deal with trade and commerce is in respect of trade and commerce among the States and with other countries. If that is what is relied upon to give us power to deal with corporations as we cannot deal with individuals, it will be found to be a broken reed. Obviously so; because, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has indicated, and I affirm that he is right, this means that we should not be able to deal with individuals acting in restraint of trade within a State, but should be able to deal with a trading corporation. How grossly unfair that would be ! We must nave uniformity. Clause 4, dealing with trade and commerce within a State or outside the Commonwealth, applies to individuals, as well as to corporations and firms. So it should. If we wish to stop monopolies we should stop them, whoever cause them, whether individuals or corporations. But it is admitted that we cannot do that within a State, because paragraph xx. of section 51 of the Constitution only applies to foreign corporations and trading and financial corporations. All that they would have to do would be to say, " We will resolve our corporation into a combination of individuals, and then roll cannot stop us." The thing is ludicrous on the face of it- I should be ashamed of any construction of the Constitution which led to such a result as that. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best,</inline> than, whom no one in the State of Victoria is better acquainted with companies law, knows that every  State has its own companies laws, and fixes the status of foreign corporations within its limits.

                    <para>.- The Committee is entitled to listen with the greatest respect to anything urged by my honorable friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> particularly in regard to a constitutional point, he having had the advantage of being a member of the Convention which ultimately framed the Constitution as we have it today. But in attempting to construe the Constitution we are obliged to eliminate from consideration1 every debate that took place in regard to it while it was being evolved. We have to cast aside every expression of opinion at the Convention. As a matter of fact, the High Court has held that in construing the Constitution it has no right, for judicial purposes, to look at the Convention debates, although for historical reasons it is justified in turning to the various stages of the Bill as considered by the several Conventions. The High Court has drawn that distinction. Although even an anomaly may be created by the terms of the Constitution itself, it has to be construed exactly as we find it. That principle of judicial construction of Acts of Parliament is constantly applied in the Courts, where sometimes it leads to hardship, and even to a degree of absurdity. But the Courts will, of course, endeavour to reconcile every section of an Act of Parliament, and, so far as they can, will give to all the sections the most intelligent meaning they can be made to bear. We have to see exactly what the Constitution, as we find it worded to-day, and as the Courts have to construe it, actually provides. Section 51 of the Constitution is generally governed by the words - </para>

                </quote>
                <para class="block">Then follow thirty-nine paragraphs. According to my view, for the purpose of construing each' one of those thirty-nine paragraphs, the Court is* justified, if it so desires, in reading each independently, and even in not looking at the other thirty-eight.. The principle followed by the American Courts is to look to each paragraph which confers jurisdiction, and give to each the widest meaning and the fullest construction. It will even read them independently. I am not announcing any views of my own. I am announcing the views of the highest authorities of the United States, and views which have been laid down in judicial decisions. My first point is, therefore, that each paragraph can be read independently, being covered by the opening words of section 51, which I have quoted, and being also affected by paragraph XXXIX., which, reads - </para>

                <para class="block">That is to say, Parliament has power to make laws "for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth," with regard to each matter mentioned in the paragraphs of section 51, and also under paragraph xxxix., with respect to matters incidental to the execution of any power vested by the Constitution in Parliament. That is my first important point - that Parliament has the widest and fullest jurisdiction to deal with every subject mentioned in the thirty-nine articles. My second point is that where the Constitution intends any limitation we must find that limitation within the paragraph itself. For instance, there is a limitation in paragraph 1., which says that Parliament may make laws with respect to - </para>

                        <para>- That consideration is hardly relevant. What the States might or might not have done is beside the question. The question is, what are our powers under the Constitution ? If it h|ad been intended, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> contends, to limit our powers in regard to foreign corporations and trading and financial corporations formed within the limits of the Commonwealth, to status, or .the enactment of uniform laws, the Constitution would have said so, and the limitation would have appeared in paragraph xx. itself. Instead of that we have the widest and fullest words - </para>

When the Constitution confers, as it does, the right to deal with the subjects set forth in the various paragraphs of section 51, why not give the fullest meaning to the words, instead of .limiting the meaning in the manner suggested. </para>

                    <para>The powers conferred upon Congress must be regarded as relative to each other and all means to a common end ; so when Congress has power to do an act by virtue of distinct powers it may exercise which it pleases; and when it professes to act under one it need not resort to any other, or when Congress has power to accomplish a certain result, indirectly by one mode, it may do so directly by another; but no power in itself substantive can be exercised or contravened by action under an incidental power, nor can an act which cannot be done directly, because of defect in power, be done indirectly. </para>

                <para class="block">That seems to me to show very conclusively ' that Congress has. distinct powers, and may exercise which it pleases, and in clauses 5 and 8 we have seen fit to exercise the powers given by paragraph xx. of section 51 of the Constitution.

                    <para>In this chapter it is intended to refer to certain instances in which the treaty-making power has been exercised to its widest extent, and far beyond any prerogatives expressly stated in the Constitution, and, possibly, in direct contravention of constitutional limitations, but in which it has also been determined by the Supreme Court that it was properly exercised. </para>

                <para class="block">The author goes on to refer to State legislation as controlled by treaty stipulations. In the United States the Federal authority has direct power to make treaties, and I desire to show that the exercise of this power extends even to the contravening of State laws, if the latter in .any way interfere with the making of treaties. </para>
                <para>As already shown the regulation of the descent of property, a matter wholly within the local jurisdiction of the separate States, has been the subject of treaty negotiation and stipulations, with the result that State laws in regard thereto have been declared inoperative, so far as they conflict with treaty provisions; that condition, however, results from the fact that the United States, through the treaty-making power, directly controls State legislation pursuant to that clause in the Constitution which makes treaties the supreme law of the land ; in this chapter it is intended to refer to matters which are not within the jurisdiction of any State, but which affect the people of the United States in their relation to the Federal Government. </para>
                <para class="block">This shows that the mere power to make treaties enables, the central power to enter into treaties of such a character as to interfere with State laws; it shows the great extent to which the Courts, bv giving the widest and most extended meaning, have carried the powers conferred by the United States Constitution. That must be so, because, otherwise, where is the limit to be drawn ? </para>

                    has laid down some rules for the construction of Statutes correctly, and others), I think, incorrectly. There are some rules to which he has not referred. One is that if the construction which ia contended for a Statute leads to an absurd and ridiculous conclusion the Court will struggle against that construction. Does not the construction for which
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline>
                    contends lead to a ridiculous conclusion? He, in effect, affirms that if two corporations - one a foreign corporation and the other a corporation registered in the State - are trading within the limits of a State, the laws of the Commonwealth may be applied to one but not to the other.

If a corporation trades alongside an individual in a State, and attempts to do the same kind of business, those two persons - for in law both are persons - have to trade under different laws, namely, one under Commonwealth law and the other under State law. Can it be supposed for a moment that the Convention ever intended a differentiation of that kind ? </para>

                        <para>- Where the construction of a Statute leads to an absurd conclusion, the Court will always try to put a common-sense meaning on the Act, or, as. in this case, on the Constitution. When the Constitution Bill was introduced in the Convention of 1891 - I was a member of the Convention of 1891 and of that of 1897-8 - the words used were " The status in the Commonwealth of foreign corporations," and that phrase was not intended to be altered, nor was it ever altered, except as a drafting amendment. I contend that the framers of the Constitution undoubtedly did what they intended to do. </para>

                        <para>- It was taken out of the paragraph as a drafting alteration, but it is there in effect, although not in words. Undoubtedly that is what it means. I entirely agree with the contention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator' Symon.</inline> The Senate is not a court of law, and we ought to adopt a common-cense meaning when we can. Is there anything in paragraph xx. of section 51 which prevents us from doing so ? It seems to me to be quite clear that our powers in relation to trade and commerce are limited to " trade and commerce between the States." I do not believe that the States would have agreed to accept the Constitution Bill if they had imagined for a moment that the Commonwealth could interfere in their internal affairs. I am an&gt; advocate of States rights, and I do not desire to speak at any length. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> has spoken at great length, and used a great many arguments which seem to me not to bear upon the point at issue. As regards the power of the American Congress to regulate the strength of drugs which are imported into the United States what has that to do with the point under consideration? I do not see that it has any relevancy. No one doubts that this Parliament has the power to regulate the strength of drugs imported into the Commonwealth ; the contrary is not contended for. I hope that the <inline font-style="italic">Committee</inline> will not so frame this Bill that it would be upset directly it was taken before the High Court, which, 1 feel sure, would be the result if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best's</inline> view were adopted. I do not pretend to be an admirer of the Bill. If I wanted to make it null and void I should certainly vote with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best.</inline> That would be mie best course for the violent enemies of the Bill to take. </para>

A uniform practice is indispensable, considering that the activity of the great enterprises has extended far over the boundaries of individual States. It can only be a question of time, until, by an amendment of the Constitution, the corporation law shall have been brought within the reach of congressional legislation. </para>

It will be recollected by those who have read books on trusts that one of the greatest curses or evils of the trust system in America is that when a big meat company seeks to get rid of competition it sets to work to buy up every meat factory or canning company in the territory. It gives the different factories full market value, generally their own price, and issues to them preference shares for that amount. But in order to make a good thing out of the transaction, the big company issues millions of ordinary shares, for which there is no good-will or value. Of course, in order to pay a dividend on this enormously watered stock, the trust has to be run for all it is worth, and, therefore, it acts with that brutal tyranny and selfishness which we read about.

                    has said that it rests with us to show the limits of our legislative power in regard to foreign corporations. I contend that the Parliament has the power to enact any law" in that regard. It is enabled to say that there shall be the most perfect publicity relative to different trading companies; also, that trusts shall not issue shares beyond a legitimate value, certified to by proper valuers, and shall publish the results of their dealings. It can lay down rules without limit in regard to the status and doings of companies.

                        <para>- I hope that; for the sake of our credit, the amendment will not be passed. I might give another illustration. The Bill provides in a later clause that a trust may not do anything to destroy an Australian industry or to lessen the rates qf wages or to interfere with the hours of work. That provision is, I contend, <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires.</inline> Docs the Minister say that we can regulate the wages which corporations may pay in a State, but cannot regulate the wages which individuals therein may pay ? The absurdity of the differentiation is apparent at once. Every, illustration which one can conceive of shows the unconstitutionality of an amendment of this kind. </para>

                        <para>- I also am opposed to the amendment. I most strongly object to the Parliament of the Commonwealth claiming the power to interfere with trade within a State. I feel perfectly certain that on a true interpretation of the Constitution our powers in regard to trade and commerce are limited by paragraph 1 of section 51, as extended by section 98 to shipping and navigation, and to railways the property of any State. I disagree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best's</inline> interpretation of our powers. The High Court has held, and, no doubt, would hold again, that the Constitution must be construed as a whole; that every provision must be construed as a part of the Constitution, and not separately. I am familiar with the class of American cases which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> has cited. These are cases in which the question has arisen as to how far the plenary power of Congress over trade and commerce can be carried out in the United States. It has been held that all State laws must give way to the exercise of that power, which,. of course, is given with only certain limitations. When we ask how the Government propose to get power with regard to trade and commerce in the case of corporations, we are pointed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> to paragraph xx. of section 51. If the construction of that paragraph were taken before the High Court, it would have to decide what was the meaning of its words at the time when the Constitution was assented to, and therefore it would consider the history of the provision, but it would not have any regard to the opinions expressed by individual members of the Convention. When we turn to the history of the provision, I think there cannot be the slightest doubt as to what was originally intended. It was one of the legislative powers intrusted to the Federal Council of Australasia under the Imperial Act of 1885, and it was granted in this form : " The status of foreign corporations, &amp;c." In the Constitution Bill of 1891, the expression used is still the same as before, namely, the " status" of corporations. If there is any doubt in the minds of any honorable senator as to what was the meaning attached to the words in that year, perhaps I had Letter quote the discussion on the provision in the National Australasian Convention on the 3rd April, 1891 - </para>

                    GRIFFITH. It is sometimes difficult to say what is a trading corporation. What is important, however, is that there should be a uniform law for the recognition of corporations. Some States might require an elaborate form, the payment of heavy fees, and certain guarantees as to the stability of members, while another State might not think it worth ils while to take so much trouble, having regard to its different circumstances. I think the States may be trusted to stipulate how they will incorporate companies, although we ought to have some general law in regard to their recognition.

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Munro,</inline>
                    is worth a little more consideration than honorable members seem disposed to bestow upon it. We know what some of . these corporations are; and I think joint-stock companies might be incorporated upon some uniform method. In South Australia a banking company is not allowed to be incorporated under the Companies Act ; still, there is nothing in Victoria, of which I am aware, to prevent a banking company from being registered there as a limited company, and opening a branch in South Australia a few days afterwards. I think it is necessary, therefore, to have some uniform law. There is nothing in which the public should have more confidence than in banks, which are in any way recognised by the State ; and I think we should have some uniform system of incorporating banks. Many companies, although doing business under different names, are, in reality, banks.

                    BRAY. You can establish financial companies, which you do not call banks, but which answer all the purposes of banks. We have provided that the Federal Parliament shall legislate as to the incorporation of banks ; but there is nothing to prevent the incorporation by the States themselves, quite apart from the Federal Parliament, of trading companies which will do all the ordinary business of banks. If it is desirable to intrust legislation as to the incorporation of banks to the Federal Government, there is no reason why we should not say that the registration of financial companies doing all the business of banks should be dealt with in the same manner.

There are financial institutions which are not banking institutions, and if we are going to give the Federal Parliament power to legislate with regard to banking, and with regard to trading corporations, we should go a step further, and give it power also to legislate with regard to financial institutions.

                        <para>- The portions of the debates which I have read are exactly what would be read to the Court, and the Court would learn from that passage what is the history of the paragraph in question. Reading that passage, we have no doubt as to the meaning of the provision. I think it is perfectly clear with regard to trading, as in many other matters, that the Constitution draws a clear and hard-and-fast line between what are Commonwealth interests and what are State interests; and nowhere in the Constitution is it provided that trading within a State is to be interfered with by the Commonwealth Parliament. It is almost incredible that it should have been intended that the Commonwealth Parliament should have power to interfere with trading operations by a corporation and not be able to enforce the same laws with regard t'o private persons trading in the same State, and probably in the same place. If the view of the Government were correct, we might have rival traders in a street, the one being a corporation and the other an individual ; and we might have Commonwealth law imposing restrictions upon the trading corporation, but not touching the individual trader. Such a thing seems to me to be absurd. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> wishes to put on one side the intentions of the framers pf the Constitution, and to look simply at the words and say what they mean. Then my, honorable friend says that if there is an anomaly we must take it as we find it. I say no. If there is an anomaly in a Statute, the law will not allow some obnoxious regulation to be enforced upon a suffering people because of it. The Court will look past the anomaly to what was really meant. I am reminded' of a case with regard to the construction of a Statute which, would come, I think, under my honorable friend's rule. It was a case where a man wanted to import a quantity of bolts and) nuts. He said that he was willing to pay duty on the bolts, but that nuts came in free, and he pointed triumphantly to the provision in the Tariff with regard to green fruits. The law will not be deceived bv anomalies of the kind referred to. The Court will always look broadly at what was the meaning of the particular section. I have not the slightest doubt that in this case the Court could come to no other conclusion than that the power intended to be given to the Commonwealth Parliament was to do such things as were referred to by the framers of the Constitution during the Convention debates. They show us clearly and exactly what was intended to come within the. scope of the particular paragraph of section 51 with which we are dealing. Mv contention is that with regard to trade and commerce we must be limited by paragraph 1., and that we have no power to interfere with corporations in regard to trade and commerce within a State. </para>

We are there empowered to make laws with regard to marriage. Should we be able in our marriage laws to provide whether the married couple should carry on trade, and how they should carry it on within a State? The principle is exactly the same.

Just so; and reading them independently, if we have power to legislate with regard to foreign corporations and trading or financial corporations within a State, we have power quite independently to direct how married people shall carry on trade within a State. </para>

Who is it that has to have regard to those interests ? I presume that the Court is meant. </para>

                    <para>-. The Bill, on the face of it, is very strict. We all know what we desire to do, but it is difficult to carry out our intention ; and we ought to give the Court" all information possible as to what we really mean. We know that trusts are sometimes beneficent, and that large organizations of capital are to be allowed ; and under the circumstances we ought to show that it is unreasonable restraint of trade that we condemn.

                <para>Seantor DRAKE (Queensland) [6.14].- There seem to be a great many provisions in the Bill which will have the effect of preventing competition by prohibiting the importation of goods and their sale at a low price to the injury of Australian industries. But there does not seem to be any provision to prevent persons from combining together to raise the prices of the necessaries of life. </para>

                    <para>. - We have already provided, in the earlier part of the clause, that, continuance in any combination, which, of.' course, would be the result of a contract, shall be an offence. That being so, we provide also that a contract, although it is not avoided until the Bill comes into force, shall then be avoided. We do not interfere in any way with any acts or transactions anterior to the Bill coming into operation, but the moment it does come into operation, it renders the making of such a contract illegal, and all contracts already in existence become illegal and void from that moment. We do not in any way act retrospectively or attribute to any action or transaction arising out of a previous contract, any particular force or effect under the Bill ; but the moment the Bill comes into operation contracts for the establishment and maintenance of combinations become illegal and void. </para>

                    has either not read sub-clause 2 or misapprehends it. The amendment I have proposed does not deal with the continuance of combinations, but with contracts. Neither the draftsman nor any one else ever pretended that sub-clause 2 of the clause was intended to deal with combinations, which become illegal and void at once; it was intended to relate to contracts only.

                    SYMON (South Australia) [7.46]. - This is a Bill to make the High Court a Court of four Justices and a Chief Justice, instead of at present a Court of two Justices and a Chief Justice. The reasons which have been presented by the Government in its support, are chiefly if not wholly, based on the ground of the large increase of judicial work which the establishment of the Court has brought about, and the pressure to' which
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline>
                    referred. In the few words I have to say, I do not propose to enter into that aspect of the question, as he dealt with it fully. .1 propose to look at the subject from what I conceive to be the higher and broader aspect which I have always entertained. To the opinion which I expressed and sought to give effect to in 1903, when the Judiciary Bill was before the Senate, I still adhere. I still hold the view that the High Court of the Commonwealth should consist of not less than four Justices and a Chief Justice. When honorable senators look back on the history of the establishment of the Commonwealth, and the steps which throughout a considerable course of years were taken with a view to the framing of the Constitution, they will, I think, find that the volume of opinion, I believe I may say, probably the best opinion, on this momentous question in relation to the Federal Judiciary, has been consistently and uniformly in the direction of a Court of not less than five Justices. The Constitution framed by the Convention of 189 1, of which you,
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline>
                    had the distinguished honour of being a member, provided for a Chief Justice, and not less than four Justices. In the Convention which assembled in Adelaide in 1897, the subject was dealt with. In the first instance, it was brought in the ordinary course under the consideration of the Judiciary Committee of which I had the honour to be chairman. We had before us the provision of the Constitution framed in 1891, and a suggestion was made for the reduction pf the number, so that the minimum should' be fixed at three .instead of at five. After the question had been most anxiously and earnestly discussed, the provision made in the Constitution Bill of 1891 was retained. In1 that shape, accompanied by the report of the Judiciary Committee, it was submitted to the Convention. On that occasion,
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers,</inline>
                    who is now Premier of New South Wales, moved to strike out the minimum of four Justices, so' as. to leave the Parliament entirely at large in that regard.  His  amendment was defeated by a majority of three, the numbers being, if I recollect rightly, sixteen to thirteen. So that the Constitution, when it emerged from the Adelaide session, contained a provision with regard to the strength of the Judiciary as a Chief Justice and four Justices. No interference was made with the provision at the Sydney session in 1897, but at the last session, in Melbourne, the subject was revived, and a proposal was made that the minimum should be three, namely, a Chief
                </para>
                <para class="block">Justice and two Justices, instead of five, as originally provided. That was carried, but only by a majority of one vote. Honorable senators will therefore see that when I say that the volume of opinion was in favour of establishing the Court with that degree of numerical strength, it was so throughout, and that at the Melbourne session there was practically an even division. The amendment was made, not, I think I may safely say, because there was any change in the opinion of a <inline font-style="italic">majority</inline> of the members of the Convention, but because of what I might call prudential reasons in regard to presenting the Bill for the acceptance of the people at the referendum. That was the state of things up to the assembling of the first Parliament, and in 1903, the Judiciary Bill as it is now on the statute-book, was brought in. It was introduced, and I think properly introduced, by the Ministry, with a minimum of four Justices and a Chief Justice, and it so remained until the House of Representatives reduced the number to three. It then came here. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> who spoke immediately before I did, criticised the Bill adversely from certain stand-points. With some of his criticisms I agreed. He rested one of his criticisms on the ground that the Court ought to consist of five Justices and not of three.

Well, I cannot go quite that length with him I shall vote for the Bill, also with reluctance, because the Court will be one of three Judges; and I will give reasons why I think there ought to be five. </para>

                <para class="block">No effort was made in the Senate to increase the minimum from three to five, because there was a very strong feeling, in Parliament at the time in respect of cost, and so on. I believe I am correct in stating that no amendment was moved, because it was felt that in all probability it would not be successful. On the same, occasion, I said - </para>

                    <para>As to the number of Judges, I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> that there ought to be five. There is a numerical strength as well as an intellectual strength. . . Judges are human, and therefore I say that we ought to have a numerical strength as well as an intellectual strength. I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> referred to the number of Judges in America, and to an intention there is of increasing them. I should like to tell honorable senators that when the United States were launched on their national career of union in 1789 with a population less than ours-, and with, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Higgins</inline> and others admit, less possibilities of work than are presented to pur High Court, five Judges and a Chief Justice were appointed. And not only so, but a large number of other courts were constituted at the same time for the purpose of doing work under the Federal Constitution. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">Three years have elapsed since that time, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has alluded to additional consideration, but with that aspect of the question I shall not deal. I adhere emphatically to the view I expressed in the Convention in 1897-8, and in the Senate in 1903. I still think that we ought to have had 'from the beginning, and we ought certainly to have now, a Court of five Justices. The great reason by which I am influenced is that which I stated then, that there is a numerical] force, if I may so call it, as well as an intellectual strength. Whatever criticism may be offered to the view I venture to submit, there is this to be said : That we want our tribunal to be imposing in power and ability, and also imposing, within limits, in number. That is really all I have to say, except that, with the proposed numerical increase, we shall get increase of strength, increase of dignity, and increase of influence. I think that the dignity and power of the Court will certainly not be lessened, but will be augmented, by that numerical addition, the judgments will carry undoubtedly that greater weight which the number associated in them will give, and the stream of justice, will be none the less strong throughout this community by increased strength in the fountain from which it comes. </para>

                    <para class="block">I move the amendment, not because I have any doubt about the necessity for appointing two extra Justices, for I understand that the Court is worked at great pressure, and .that at least one Justice is showing signs of very hard work. My objection to the Bill is based upon the fear that Ministers who have, as a shibboleth, the cry of " Australia for the Australians " are likely to follow the example of the Government of Western Australia, who, during the past three years, have imported two barristers to fill positions upon its Bench. The Government appear to be extremely anxious to have coats, boots, collars, and cuffs made in Australia - and that is a very laudable ambition - but, apparently; they have no confidence in the capacity of Australians to fill these high offices, lately they have been casting round outside Australia for a gentleman to fill the position of Administrator in Papua. So far they have not been able to get a gentleman, but they are marking time in the hope that they_ may discover one. If that is their attitude towards the filling of an office which I do not think requires as much education or ability, as does the position of a Justice of the High Court, is it likely that they would appoint Australians to the additional Judgeships ? I do not think it is. </para>

The Government has not given us any assurance that two Australians will be appointed. Many names have been suggested, and if I could rely upon it that two of the gentlemen who have been mentioned would be chosen I should not oppose the second reading of the Bill.

                            <para>- I am not, but I have not the slightest doubt in my own mind. But a case for the appointment of two additional Judges has not, in my view, been made out. In Committee, therefore, I intend to move that one additional Justice be appointed, instead of two. We are told that an enormous amount of work is before the High Court, and that litigants have to wait longer than they should be required to do. But I have heard the opinion expressed by legal gentlemen that the Judges of the High Court might do something to discourage so many appeals being made from States Courts. </para>

                            <para>- How could they do it? ^Senator O'KEEFE. - They may not be able to do it. Reading the correspondence that has passed between the Chief Justice and the Attorney-General, it appears to me that the strongest feature of the case for appointing two additional Judges is that the Judge who has to do the conciliation and arbitration work has not yet been able to devote his attention to it, and that if we still limit the number of Judges to three he will not be able to undertake that work at all. If that be the strongest reason that can be given, why need more than one additional Judge be appointed at the present juncture? It may be urged by legal senators that it would be rather awkward to have four Judges, because there should be a majority decision when the Justices are not unanimous. But that consideration may be left out of the question. If we appoint an .additional Judge, three Judges can still adjudicate in appeal cases, while the time of the extra Judge is occupied with other business. In addition to that, the additional Judge will be able to relieve the other Judges from the strain of their work. We are tol'd that there is danger of some of the Judges breaking down from stress of work. If an additional Judge were appointed there would always be one Judge in reserve to form a member of the Full Court. It is being urged in every State of Australia, and I think, in this case, with some show of reason, that there is a. disposition to pile up expenditure. Those who advocate the appointment of two additional Judges will say, "Let the States reduce the expenditure on their Supreme Courts- If litigants choose to take their cases to the High Court the expenditure connected with the States Courts can be cut down." But how can that be done? Judicial appointments are made for life, and unless a Judge in one of the States is verging on the age when he will be entitled to a pension, and will be inclined to retire, the State "Government cannot decrease expenditure in this direction. If in the High Court we have four Judges instead of three, the next Parliament will still have the power to pass a measure enabling a fifth Judge to be appointed if that is thought to be necessary. What is to prevent a further amending Bill being passed twelve months hence if it is found that four Judges cannot cope with the work? </para>

I should have seconded <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs'</inline> amendment. It would be an outrage on common sense, and a serious reflection on the acumen and ability of Australian lawyers1 to appoint an outsider. I have not circulated an amendment, because I was not aware that the Bill was to be proceeded with to-night. I submit, however, that the cry that is being raised - very often on flimsy grounds - that there is1 a disposition to pile up expenditure unnecessarily affords a strong reason why we should not appoint two extra Judges. T have looked into the question with some care, and have come to the conclusion that in another place an excellent case was made out for appointing only one additional Judge. In Committee I shall submit an amendment to that effect, and trust that I shall receive sufficient support to carry it. </para>

                        <para>.- My honorable friend who has just resumed his seat has raised the question, of the desirableness of appointing one or two additional Justices. I quite agree with him that if the Senate were satisfied that a fourth Judge would be sufficient for the purpose of effectively carrying on the work of the High Court, we should not be justified in appointing a fifth. I do not see any objection to having four Judges instead of five, from the mere fact of an odd number being desirable. That would not be a substantial objection to a Bench of four Judges, if we were satisfied that four could do the work. As one having considerable experience in regard to High Court work, and speaking generally, I say that the High Court has been a very great success. There are, in fact, many persons who were bitterly opposed to Federation who have not hesitated to express the opinion that the shining success of Federation has been in respect to the High Court. I do not for one moment agree with the view that that is the only success Federation has accomplished, but I do agree that the High Court has been both popular and successful from a judicial stand-point. </para>

That the Court has worked at very high pressure cannot be doubted for a moment. I believe that the most conscientious attention has been given by the members of the Court to the highly responsible duties attached to their position. It has been one of the features of the Court that its members have never spared themselves. Their judgments have never been delayed, but have been most promptly and expeditiously delivered - a matter of very great importance indeed to litigants. But, at the same time, working as they have done in order that the public demands might be met, the members of the Court have been obliged to subject themselves to great pressure. </para>

                            <para>- It is a piece of advice conveyed to us by the Chief Justice on behalf of the present, occupants of the Bench, that we cannot afford to disregard lightly. I have referred to the popularity of the High Court Bench. I know that my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> does not agree as to the expediency of appeals being made direct from the judgment of a single Judge of a State Court to the High Court. But I think that he will admit this much at all events : that when litigants have chosen to appeal direct to the High Court in the numbers in which they have done, it at least betokens the greatest confidence in the judgment of the High Court and in the justice which litigants may expect to get from it. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. There is considerable unanimity of feeling that, instead of taking the risk of going to the Full Courts of the several States, appeals should be made direct to the High Court. I am aware, moreover, and I speak from personal experience, that litigants have preferred to go to the High Court, as was originally hoped they would, instead of to the Privy Council. </para>

                            <para>- We have to accept the fact that there can be direct appeal to the High Court; and, personally, I think it is a wise provision, though I know other honorable senators do not accept the same view. I have been before the Privy Council with several of my cases, and, so- far as I can influence my clients by advice, I shall never have any hesitation in advising them to go to our own High Court, so long as we' have the same high standard of legal ability and acumen as at present on the Bench. I do not wish for one moment to discount the great ability to be found on the Benches of the States Courts, but, at the same time, the judgments of the High Court have commanded a great amount of confidence and respect. I agree with. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> that this is not so much a matter of increasing the numerical strength. The more important point is to increase the intellectual strength of the Bench, so as to secure for it a dignity and high position which will command confidence. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; but I feel that we cannot ignore the advice of the High Court, the members of which know what the work is, and that it is increasing. Above all things, we cannot afford to overwork the members of our High Court; the interests of litigants are too great and serious to permit that condition of affairs to last for any extended time. The present Judges have been working at high pressure, and it is now proposed to relieve them. In view of the increasing work of the Bench, we are called upon to accept the advice of those? who are capable of assisting us, and to appoint two additional Judges. I hope the Bill will be carried into law ; and I am. quite certain that the effect will be to further add to the lustre of this great institution. </para>

                            <para>- Decidedly ; but we hear a great deal about the high pressure at which the members of the High Court are being worked, and about the economy that might be affected by the appointment of only one Judge. It must be remembered, however, that the Commonwealth Parliament is passing a number of new laws, and creating a variety of positions which did not exist under the States Parliaments. In this way we are placing those who are foolish enough to go to law in a very dangerous situation. We have passed a Commerce Act. and an. Arbitration and Conciliation Act, and we have before us the Australian Industries Preservation Bill, all of which, together with a number of other new laws too numerous to mention, will provide work for the Courts of law. Whether we look at the present Bill from an industrial or a commercial stand-point, we cannot but realize that thousands of pounds might be lost to the community in one twelve months if the Court were not in a position to deal promptly with the cases which come before it. That is the reason why we should be prepared to remove any difficulties which there may be, not in connexion with the Court itself, but in connexion with those who are compelled to go to law. If, for instance, a case under the Commerce Act, or under the Australian Industries Preservation Bill, which we hope to pass, involved the suspension of a gigantic business for six months, there would probably be misery caused and more money lost than would justify the employment of five Judges for all time. When we judge of the work of the future by the work which has been done in the past, we shall be very foolish if we do not take care to create an effective Court. The only objection that weighs to any extent with me is that raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs,</inline> when he points out the danger of the present Government appointing outsiders to these positions. </para>

I do not like to be continually in a minority, but always, if possible, to be in the majority when I am right. I hope the Bill will be passed as quickly as possible; and I see no necessity for an amendment. </para>

                        <para>-35l- - When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> rose, I anticipated that he would have shown his usual consistency, and submitted a motion asking the Senate to decline to consider or pass this Bill unless it contained the names of the two gentlemen to be appointed. Such a step would have been in conformity with a motion the honorable senator once invited the Senate to pass in regard to another appointment. </para>

                            <para>- No, because I should then be making a proposal in which I did' not believe. Little confidence as I have in the present Government, it would be too serious to follow the course taken by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> on a previous occasion. As to the Bill, I have listened to two speeches by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best.</inline> I agree with that portion of the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> in which he points out that owing; to the rapidity with which we are turning out legislation, and creating new crimes and offences, it is possible that .we shall require additional Judges. It is a question, however, whether" that is not an argument against the class of legislation we are passing, rather than an argument for the appointment of additional Judges. If every night we meet here we intend to make fresh offences and crimes, we had better face the inevitable, and agree to appoint twenty additional Judges, or leave it to the Government to appoint an unlimited number. I am satisfied that if the legislation of the future is to be like that of the past, five Judges will be insufficient. </para>

The honorable senator assured the Senate that in no case had the public been kept waiting for decisions; and that in every direction, there was unbounded satisfaction with the work the Court had performed. If there is no evidence of an \ injury to the public interest owing to delay on the part of the Judges, surely it is only reasonable that, instead of jumping immediately from three to five Judges, we should try the experiment- indicated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe.</inline></para>

                            <para>- With one exception to which I shall refer, there has, it appears, been no just cause of complaint against the Court on the score of delay. I do not dispute the statement that the Court has been working at high pressure; but, with the exception of one case under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, there has been no cause of complaint. The appointment of an additional Justice would mean increasing the strength of the Court by 33 per cent., and a very considerable easement to the present Justices. One additional appointment would not only meet any case of indisposition, but would enable a considerable amount of work in original jurisdiction to be carried on concurrently with the sittings in Full Court ford appeals. That would constitute a large measure of relief ; and, having regard to the unsatisfactory financial position into which the Commonwealth is drifting, we ought to try the experiment of one additional Judge before we incur the large, expenditure which would result from a double appointment. What is the financial position? We are face to face with, an absolute deficiency in Federal finance. </para>

We have been living, to some extent, in a fool's paradise. Before incurring large expenditure we ought to look ahead, and, when1 we have spent the 25 per cent, allowed by the Constitution, ascertain how to raise' additional revenue. For that reason I intend to support the suggestion thrown out -bv <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe.</inline> As that honorable senator said, it will be easy enough, if we find one Judge is not sufficient, to appoint a second ; but, once we make two appointments, we cannot cancel one. A man in ordinary business, if he found the work in his shop, office, or factory becoming a little too much for his employes, would make appointments by degrees. As I say, we may always make an additional appoinment, but once a Judge is placed on the Bench, no matter whether he be required for the Court or not, his services cannot be dispensed with. Bearing in mind the necessity for financial care, I intend to vote for the appointment of one Judge only. </para>

My fear is that, instead of the Government refusing to appoint men because of their nationality, or anything of that sort, the appointments may be more for political than for any other reasons. It is possible there are gentlemen whom the Government fear may not secure election to another Parliament, and these gentlemen mav be provided for by seats on the High Court Bench. But, whatever may be the idea in the mind of the Government, I hope the Judges appointed will be men of ability and sterling character, in whom we may have absolute confidence.

                                - At the present time we are in a peculiar position. We are nearing the end of the life of this Parliament, and really do not know of whom the majority will be composed after the elections. The present Government may disappear in the course of a few months, and if they have it placed in their power to appoint two -gentlemen to the High Court Bench, it will be impossible to call them to account, should Parliament be dissatisfied with the appointments. I admit that, according to the statement made by the Justices, there is a necessity to strengthen the Bench, and the fact that there is no bar against litigants appealing straight from the decision of a Justice of the Supreme Court to the High Court, instead of going through the Full Court, must unquestionably add very much to the work of the Federal Justices. In some cases where a decision has been obtained in one Court, and an appeal has gone to the Full Court of the State, it has invariably been the practice of an unsuccessful litigant to go to the High Court, on the chance of getting the decision reversed. A man who goes into litigation, if he has any sense at all, will consider carefully how far it may be carried on. He will see that there is no wisdom in appealing to the Full Court of the State, when he knows that in all probability there will be an appeal to the High Court, and he may find himself saddled with the costs of two appeals. Some honorable senators appear to think that it is not wise to allow a direct appeal from the Supreme Court of a State to the High Court. I cannot say that I (agree with that view, because I think that if men have to resort to litigation, and know that eventually they have to get to one goal, the sooner they get there the better it will be for themselves and their pockets, instead of going through two Courts. Therefore I do not think it is a mistake to allow a direct appeal. One gentleman has said that he will always advise his clients to go to the High' Court instead of to the Privy Council. There are some very good reasons for giving that advice. In the first place, a decision can

                        <para>. - I intend to support the second reading of the Bill. When the original measure was passing through the Senate, I said that three Judges would be found insufficient, and I think that forecast has been abundantly proved. The question we have to consider is whether the case for two additional Justices has been sufficiently made out. Reading the correspondence which has been tabled, I find the. following passage in a communication from the Chief Justice to the Attorney-General : - </para>

                        <para>So far as it is possible to form an estimate for the future, we think that the appellate business of the High Court is likely to keep it engaged almost continuously throughout the year. We are at present unable to fix any day before the end of this year for the hearing of a case before a single Judge. </para>
                        <para>The appellate business of the Court is of very onerous and responsible character. Tn the large majority of cases, it is expedient, if not necessary, to reserve judgment. The present continuous pressure of work leaves us very little time for research, and for the preparation of written <inline font-style="italic">or</inline> even oral judgments. We do not think it desirable that a Court of final appeal should work at such constantly high pressure, from which, however, there is no prospect of escape so long as the number of Justices is limited to three. </para>

                    <para class="block">A great many persons imagine that the work of a Justice consists of sitting on a chair, wearing his wig, looking as wise as he possibly can, and them saying ditto to the Justice by whom the decision is given. But I take a very different view of the matter. I believe that a great deal of the best work pf our Justices is done, not upon the Bench, but after the arguments in the case have been heard. Again, the High Court is a Court of final appeal, and we all know what that means. An ordinary District Court Judge, or even a Supreme Court Justice, knows that somebody else will come after him. and, if necessary, take the kinks out of his judgment, but the Justices of the High Court know that their statement of a law must be accepted by the public until that law is changed. Therefore, the, responsibility upon them for giving an accurate judgment legally, and a wise judgment from the common-sense point of view, is all the greater. We find that for months yet <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> O'Connor, as  President  of the Arbitration Court, cannot possibly grant a hearing to a case which has been filed, owing to the fact that there are only three Justices on the High Court Bench. I do not think it is desirable that the working of an Act with which we took considerable pains here, and from which we hoped so very much, ought to be suspended simply because we have not a Justice to sit on any case which may be brought up. It seems to me to be a very unwise kind of economy which denies justice in that fashion. With respect to the objection raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs,</inline> I believe that there are too many local luminaries on the pounce for these positions for any outsider to have the ghost of a chance. No foreigner need apply where members of the Bar are concerned We may go to the other end of the world.' for a Governor or a Lieutenant-Governor, but we certainly will not go outside the Commonwealth for any Judges. I do not think that we ought to go outside the Commonwealth, or that there is any need to do so. I have no fear that a foreigner will be appointed to either position. But, apparently, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> looks upon the measure as one designed to place patronage in the hands of a dying Government. If a case for the appointment of two Justices has been made out, and I believe it has, then some Government will have the making of the appointments in its hands. I would just as soon trust the present Government in that respect as any Government that we are likely to have during the next few years. </para>

                            <para>- Even a Labour Government would not be perfect, although, perhaps, it would be very much nearer perfection than would any other Government. I do not see that we are at all likely to see perfection on the Government bench or in the ranks of ordinary members of the Senate during our time. The standard is very high, no doubt, but there are peaks of achievement which even we have not' reached, and which, probably, our descendants will not reach. I should like the Bill to be amended with regard to the making of rules for the admission of solicitors and barristers, because I think that Parliament should have a voice in that respect. </para>

A few days ago I was reading the history of President Lincoln, who, as everybody knows, was a lawyer. It is stated in the book that it was very doubtful whether he had ever passed an examination. We all know that he became a famous lawyer, and a still more famous statesman; but the fact remains that the legal union is yearly raising the height of the barrier between itself and the public, so that only young men who have plenty of money and, of course, some brains, are able to get inside the charmed circle. I shall try to get an amendment of clause 4. </para>

                        <para>.- I was always in favour of the appointment of five Justices to the High Court. After a few years' experience we can all see that the work it has to do has been more than sufficient to keep three Justices going. Having regard to the administration of the Conciliation and Arbitration. Act, and the </para>

                    <para class="block">Australian Industries Preservation Bill, it seems exceedingly probable that in the future there will be sufficient work for a Court of five Justices. The reason why I strongly favour the Bill is because I think it desirable that we should, if possible, have a final Court of Appeal in Australia. At the present time, the High Court is the final Court of Appeal in certain matters, and it may be the final Court of Appeal in all matters if litigants are satisfied that it should be so. I believe that the more we strengthen the Court, the greater will be the tendency on the part of litigants to accept its decisions as final. The more they have reason to be content with the learning and knowledge of local conditions possessed by the High Court, the more satisfied they will be to accept its decisions as final, and not to appeal to the Privy Council. In a matter of this kind, as in all others, I should like to' be with the economists, but I think that the extra cost Qf providing for another Justice will be very small in comparison with the great saving to the people, and also to the Government, bv having a final Court of Appeal in Australia. </para>

                        <para>-- The only question before the Senate is whether we shall have four or five Justices. I think it must be apparent to every one that a good case has been made out for making additions to the High Court Bench. I had the honour of being a member of the Judiciary Committee which was appointed by the Convention of 1:897, and was presided over by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon.</inline> We had a great deal to do with the' High Court as arn appellate Court. What struck most of us was that we were creating an appellate Court for the whole Commonwealth, and that litigants from the larger S'tates would be appealing from a Court of six Judges to one of three. That appeared not to put the High Court in as strong a position as it ought to occupy. But ' since then we have had two years' experience of a Court consisting of three Judges. We all know that the Court has won the confidence of the people of the Commonwealth. That being so, my objection to a Court of three Judges has to a great extent disappeared. We should on every occasion be guided by the principle of economy. Unless we believe that we should do an injury to the public by carrying out that principle, we should enforce it rigidly. While I admit at once that a good case has been made out for the appointment of an additional Judge, I do not think that a case has been been made out for the appointment of two Judges. It will be noticed that the section of the Judiciary Act which, says that the Court may consist of two Judges still remains in force. So' that, even if we have five Judges, the Court may consist of only two. It is true, that, in a subsequent section, the Court to hear appeals from the Supreme Courts of the States must consist of three Judges. But, even so, if we appoint an additional Judge, we shall have the Full Court, it may be, consisting of two Judges, with two who need not attend, and the Court of Appeal consisting of three Judges, ,-jvith one who need not attend. While I quite agree that it is necessary to have an additional Judge at once, I hesitate to conclude, on the facts before me, that we should appoint a fifth. The High Court; has been able to carry on its work with efficiency and with promptitude as at present constituted. Unless the High Court 'has been working at frightful pressure, ai case cannot be made out for the appointment of two additional Judges. I am inclined to think that the existence of the Arbitration Court is being made the ground for the appointment of two extra Judges. But I do not think it offers any sufficient reason. I can scarcely credit the statement that the litigation that is likely to arise in that Court will require the attendance of a Justice all the year round. If that is to be the case, there must be gross abuse, and disputes extending beyond a State must be almost manufactured. </para>

                            <para>- I cannot believe that one Justice will be required to act as President of the Arbitration Court for the whole of his time to dispose of the disputes extending beyond a State that are likely to arise in the ordinary course of business. Again, I consider that a great deal of the work of the High Court has been brought about because appeals are taken from a single Judge of a State Court. That may be done in order to save expense, the ordinary litigant desiring to go to the final Court of appeal as soon as possible. It appears to me that that practice has continued largely owing to the fact that the High Court is presided over by a Chief Justice who eminently commands and deserves the confidence of the people of Australia. But it is likely that litigants will come to recognise that, although the Federal Chief Justice is a man of great ability, and, although the other two Justices are men with judicial minds and of considerable attainments, yet the State Judges are men of such ability that the appeals to the High Court will not increase. If they do, it is quite certain that the work of the States Courts will decrease. If we do not mind what we are doing, we shall have more Judges in Australia than there is work for them to do. It appears to me that too frequently arguments are brought forward here, and in the other House, for giving extravagant and generous administration the benefit of the doubt. </para>

                            <para>- I was originally in favour of five being appointed, because I thought that to appoint only three would place the High Court in an unfair position, as it would have to hear appeals from two States in which the Full Courts consist of Benches of six Judges. But, inasmuch as the High Court has proved that it commands the confidence of the people of the Commonwealth when consisting of three Judges, that argument to some extent falls to the ground. At the present time we should give economy the benefit of the doubt. In Committee I shall support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe's</inline> amendment, unless a very strong case is made out for the appointment of two extra Judges. </para>

                        <para>. - I shall vote for the second reading, and shall support the measure in its present form. The High Court is a feature of the Commonwealth service as to which we should be careful to provide fully, I will not say lavishly. I remember, three years ago, speaking on this matter, and expressing the opinion that the number of Judges ought to be five. I then said I hoped that, in the course of a few years, an increase in the number would be made. The business that has fallen to the lot of the High Court during the past three years strengthens my view. I have watched its proceedings almost every day since it has been at work. I have seen that the Court has been well occupied, and have noticed that "the Judges have frequently been under considerable pressure. There seems to be no margin for those possibilities, of illness and trouble which must at times affect even High Court Judges. We have much to be thankful for in the fact that, during the three years, not one of the Judges has been laid aside by illness, and that the business of the Commonwealth has not been delayed iri consequence. But we ought not to continue to rely on Providence helping us in our improvidence. Therefore, I shall support the ]ml as it stands. </para>

                    <para>I do not think that it is necessary for me to add much to what I have said in support of my amendment. It has been urged that important cases are awaiting decision in connexion with the Federal Conciliation and Arbitration Act. How many cases are there, and how many are likely to arise within the next year or two ? I believe that two cases are awaiting settlement, and when they are disposed of two or three years; may elapse before the Federal Arbitration Court will' have any more work to&gt; do. When the Arbitration Act was being considered by the Senate it was contended by a large number of honorable senators - the point was put with considerable strength by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> for instance - that under our Constitution there could be very few cases, inasmuch as the Constitution only gave power to deal with a limited number. The cases mentioned were those affecting shipping strikes, strikes among seamen, and also among shearers. Some senators went so far as to say that, outside those divisions of industry, no other disputes could arise which could constitutionally be brought before the Federal Court. If the Court itself decides that its powers are limited, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> assured us was the case while the Bill was under consideration, all the arbitration work cast upon the High Court will speedily disappear. That being so, it is quite possible that all the work that may arise within the next twelve months will easily be disposed of in two or three months, and that the appointment of an additional Judge would meet all requirements. I do not for a moment think that we ought to be penurious in dealing with justice. That would be false economy. If I thought it was necessary that we should have five Judges, a question of <inline font-style="italic">?3,000</inline> a year would not weigh with me at all. That is not a very big matter. But it appears to me to be capable of demonstration that it 's not necessary to have more than four Judges, and, therefore, I think it is a mistake to have five at this juncture. If we appoint an additional Judge, and if, in twelve months' time, it is found that the best interests of the Commonwealth are not being conserved through the lack of a fifth Judge, nothing can be simpler than to introduce an amending Bill. </para>

                        <para>. - I should have thought that the papers circulated amongst honorable senators, apart from their own personal knowledge of what has taken place, would have convinced them that it is desirable that the High Court should be numerically increased to the extent proposed by this Bill. My honorable friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe,</inline> in movking his amendment, seemed to think that the whole object of the increase in the strength of the High, Court was to enable a member of the Bench to devote some time to the consideration of matters arising in connexion with the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. He did not refer at all to the difficulties with which the High Court is confronted in other respects - to its practical inability to deal with' matters of original jurisdiction, for instance. The Court, as I pointed out in moving the second reading, is constituted under the Judiciary Act, and invested with jurisdiction under it. But, apart altogether from the provisions of the Judiciary Act, many of the Federal Statutes directly invest the CoUrt with original jurisdiction. I made special reference to that in my second-read^ ing speech. What bulks large in the public eye in regard to the work" of the Court is entirely its appellate work, and honorable senators who will peruse the papers wall see that it has had practically to relegate its original jurisdiction work to the background. In the last memorandum appearing in the papers, that from the Principal Registrar of the High Court, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gordon</inline> Castle, under date 10th July, it is stated - </para>

As the greater part of the business before the Court had to be dealt with by a Full Court of three Justices, no Justice has been available to try original jurisdiction cases, or cases in the Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. Notwithstanding the continuous work, the Court has been unable to dispose of all the business on the lists, and certain cases have had to stand over until the next half-year. </para>

Apart from matters which have been dealt with before the Full Court, sittings before single Justices have occupied 33 days. Judging from the amount of business during the past half-year, and the amount of business already waiting for the present half-year, I do not see how, with the Court as at present constituted, the original jurisdiction work could receive attention without delaying the appellate work. </para>

                            <para>- That is the same argument the honorable senator brought before us previously. The honorable senator then, asserted dogmatically that there was not a case awaiting the attention of the High Court, but four honorable senators interjected to the effect that there were cases waiting in their own States. Every one of those cases has since been tried, and the work of the High Court has multiplied considerably. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> has pointed out, the work to which the members of the High Court have applied themselves has been done with expedition, but the reports show that the whole of the work cannot be dealt with. It is stated that some of the work will have to be left over until next half year - that is stated in a memorandum written as far back as July last. . With all these circumstances before them, the Government asked the Justices of the High Court to fully consider the matter, and report what increase in strength, in their opinion, the High Court should receive. The Chief Justice, speaking on behalf of himself and colleagues, expresses the opinion that the strength of the Bench should be increased bv the appointment of two additional Justices. I do not think that any honorable senator will imagine for a moment that the request preferred by the learned Chief Justice for two additional colleagues is based on any belief or desire that he or his colleagues will be relieved of work which they legitimately and "reasonably might do. The reputation of the hon- 01 able and learned Chief Justice for industry in his profession, both before he was elevated to the Bench and since, is so great that no honorable senator will imagine that he is going to waste any of his time or devote it to other purposes when he might be performing the judicial work of the Commonwealth. We may reasonably infer that when, after full consideration, he recommends that the strength of the Bench should be increased by the appointment of two additional Judges, there is ample work to keep the whole of the five Judges employed - that five is the minimum number, if we are to have regard to the individual rights of the members of the community and expedition in the administration of justice. Unless honorable senators are absolutely satisfied that the Chief Justice has made a recommendation which he, intimate as he necessarily is with all the circumstances, knows to be extravagant, I ask them to support the Government in carrying out the recommendation made by him on behalf of himself and colleagues. </para>

                            might use arguments that are fair and reasonable; but the case has been placed bv him before the Committee in a very unfair way.

                        <para>. - The case presented by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> for the appointment of more than one additional Judge is very weak. I certainly expected when the honorable Minister rose, to hear much stronger arguments presented in favour of the Bill, but the honorable gentleman had to fall back on the communications of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Castle,</inline> who, in my opinion, does not present sufficient evidence in favour of so large a demand. If one additional Judge be appointed, and, first of all, undertakes the work of the Arbitration Court, we shall find that much of the so-called block will be removed. I have a suspicion - and I think this has had more influence than anything else- that there is a reluctance on the part of the Judges to do the work of the Arbitration Court. I do not blame the Judges in that connexion, because the work is of a very delicate kind for a Judge to perform. There have been so few registrations, and there are so very few cases likely to come forward for hearing, that I do not think there will be much work for the Judge of the Arbitration Court to do. In mv opinion, three months in, the year will be sufficient to meet requirements in this connexion, and the additional Judge could devote the rest of his time to the usual work of the High Court. It would be far preferable to appoint a fourth Judge now, and a fifth later on if necessary, because, as has been pointed out, if we appoint two additional Judges it will be impossible to dismiss one, should his services not be required. I shall support the amendment. </para>

                        <para>.- I certainly expected that the Minister would have presented a stronger case. The honorable gentleman relied very strongly on the following paragraph in the report by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Castle:</inline> - i have heard from the representatives of the organizations concerned that there is a probability of disputes in relation to the woodworking timber yards and saw-milling industry, nml in relation to the butchering industry, including the frozen meat trade, being submitted to the Court. </para>

                    <para>I 'cannot help saving that I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> rather shirked the arguments which 1 presented, and it seems rather necessary to repeat them. It will first have to be made clear that such disputes as are there referred to can be brought within the jurisdiction of the Arbitration Court. It would not take verv lang to ascertain the facts ; but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Castle</inline> writes as if it had already been demonstrated that disputes, in the industries mentioned can be constitutional Iv settled by the Federal Court. As a matter of fact, seeing that in some Spates Arbitration Courts have not been established, it would be a good thing if a number of those disputes could constitutionally be brought before the Federal Court. I know that' many senators do not hold that view, but there is a general opinion that there are only three or four kinds of disputes which will ever come within the jurisdiction of that Court, as the Constitution will not allow the Court to deal with disputes which do not extend beyond the borders of one State. When the Arbitration and Conciliation Bill was before this Chamber, I expressed1 the hope that it might be possible for disputes in the mining industry, for instance, to be brought within its provisions} and equally it would be good if the cases indicated by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Castle</inline> could be heard by the Court. But whatever view we hold on that point, we have to remember that we are face to face with a constitutional difficulty, and until it is decided whether or not such' disputes can properly be brought before the Arbitration Court, what work will there be for that Court to do? Once the cases which are now pending were settled - and, surely, it will not take the President long to settle them - it is very probable that he would not be called upon to do more work in that Court than would occupy his time for more than two months in the year. The Minister did not make out a very strong case for the clause. I would ask him, if he speaks again, not to shirk the question as he did before, but to say whether, as a lawyer, he thinks that such disputes as those which may arise in connexion with timber-yard employes and butchers are ever likely to go before the Arbitration Court. </para>

                            <para>- No. I am asserting that it has not yet been satisfactorily determined what class of cases can be brought before the Arbitration Court. If the Court says that within the four corners of the Constitution Act it is not able to hear such cases, there will be an end to them. In my opinion, there is a very strong probability that not many of these disputes will ever come before the Arbitration Court. In that case, what necessity is there for appointing a fifth Justice at the present time? It has been said that the appointment of a Judge, when once made, could not be annulled. 0|f course, it would be unpleasant to cancel an appointment, and, therefore, it would not be done. Probably Parliament will be sitting in February or March next, and if, by that time, it be found that a fifth Justice was required, would any injustice have been done to any litigants by having had to wait a few months to get their cases settled? 1 think it would be far better to appoint a fifth Justice then than to appoint two Justices now. In my opinion, the appointment of an additional Justice will lead to the disappearance of many cases in the Arbitration Court. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> has referred to the question of the cost to Tasmania, but that is a very small matter.

                            <para>- The honorable senator certainly did not say so, but he said something very much like that when he spoke on the second reading of the Bill. But, apparently, when the Chief Justice gives his advice to the Government, or to the Parliament, it. is not held to be worth two-pence. His judgment is not to be compared with the great sacrifice that has to be borne by Tasmania, where the people have been taught by their leading men that it is virtually a crime to put their hands into their pockets to pay their way, and to make the country prosperous. They are behind every other State. If the local statesmen had any acumen, they would perceive that Tasmania has great potentialities - that it might be made the greatest State in the Commonwealth. But they will not move. They must cringe and crawl to the lowest feelings of the people. </para>

                        <para>. - I shall support the clause as if stands. I think it is admitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe</inline> that there is too much work already for the Justices of the High Court to do. In view of that fact, and also of the possibility that the Commerce Act and the Australian Industries Preservation Bill when passed will probably encourage litigation, we may take it for granted that the work of the High Court will be increased to such an extent as to justify the presence of five Justices. What concerns me most is the fact that although we have an Act not only for the settlement of disputes, but to encourage unions of both employers and workers to approach the Arbitration Court, in order that equitable working conditions and wages rates throughout the States shall as far as possible be established, it cannot be taken advantage of to any extent until the services of a Justice of the High Court are available. Until the Bench is strengthened, unions will- hesitate before they approach the Arbitration Court for the settlement of any disputes, or for the purpose of trying to regulate the wages in a trade in order to enable the better class of employers to compete with their rivals on fairer lines. For these reasons, I feel justified in voting for the "appointment of two extra Justices. </para>

                        <para>. - What it is proposed to do is to give the High Court a power, which it may or may not exercise at its discretion. Under section 86 of the Judiciary Act, the Court is given power to make rules for several purposes - for appointing and regulating the sittings of the Court, for regulating procedure, pleading, and practise, regulating matters relating to the duties of officers, prescribing forms to be used, regulating fees to be charged by practitioners, and fees to be collected by officers of the Court, prescribing the extent to which the Act shall be applicable to the Courts of Territories of the Commonwealth, and generally regulating all matters of practise and procedure. All that it is proposed to do in this clause is directly to empower the Court to make regulations for the admissions of persons to practise as barristers and solicitors, and to prescribe the conditions of and qualifications for admission. We do not throw upon the High Court any obligation to make such provision, but simply empower it to do so, leaving it to the Court to act as it thinks fit. At the time we passed the Judiciary Act, it was necessary to make provision as to persons who would be entitled to practise before the High Court, and it was considered only reasonable that every practitioner admitted in a State should be entitled to practise before the Federal Court. We now propose to empower the High Court to make regulations regulating admission in regard to other persons. The Court has had the advantage of experience in every State, and has come into contact with the Bar in every State. It will be able from its experience to exercise this power if it thinks fit. We throw no duty- upon the Court, but simply give it the right to. exercise the power prescribed. </para>

                        GOULD (New South Wales) [10. 11]. - I cannot see the necessity for the clause, even after the explanation of the Minister. In section 49 of the Judiciary Act, it is expressly provided that a person entitled to practise as a barrister or solicitor in any State shall, have the right to practise before any Federal Court, provided that he produces to the Principal Registrar evidence showing that he is so entitled. There is also a sub-section enabling the High Court to direct the name of any person to be struck off the register, upon proof that he has been guilty of conduct which renders him unfit to be allowed. to continue to practise before the High Court. It appears to rae that the Judiciary Act has already made ample provision in this connexion.

Section 49 of the Judiciary Act provides amply for the admission of barristers and solicitors to practise before the Federal Courts. This clause practically takes it out of the hands of the States Courts to admit barristers and solicitors to practise before the High Court. It appears to conflict with the power which the States Courts have to admit men to practise before the High Court bv virtue of their being admitted to practise before States Courts. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> urges that some learned person not being a barrister of a State Court may wish to appear before the High Court. But the clause does not specifically provide for that. The clause appears to r»"* to conflict with section: 49 of the Judiciary Act- </para>
