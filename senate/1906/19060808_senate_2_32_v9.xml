                        <para>take this course in order to afford to honorable senators an opportunity to express their opinions. I think it will be generally admitted that the report will bring about the best conditions which, in the circumstances, could possibly exist. Outside caterers have had an opportunity of tendering under existing conditions, and it is plain that they are not able to render the service for less than the present expenditure. During last recess the dining room and the bar were closed. On several occasions this caused great inconvenience to many representatives of other States, who had occasion to visit the premises. Under the proposed arrangements, however, such visitors, and even the representatives of Victoria, would be able to get at least a cup of tea instead of being compelled to go outside. Meals are always prepared for the members of the Parliament, but their attendance is very irregular, and consequently it is impossible for a caterer to render the service at a less cost than the present amount. That, to a very great extent, is the reason why the Department has to be subsidized. From the character of the report, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane</inline> might easily have seen that no members of Parliament, or even visitors, are on the free list of either the bar or dining room. </para>

                    <para>. - This clause was postponed because of considerations urged by certain honorable senators that as it stood it made it appear that the provisions of this Bill might be used in connexion with the acquisition of territory for the Federal Capital. Since our last discussion of the measure an amendment has been drafted and circulated. We consider that it is better not to make that amendment in clause 16, but to insert a separate clause. We propose that it shall follow immediately after the definition clause, and be practically the first operative clause in the Bill. The suggested amendment reads as follows : - 5A. This Act shall not be construed to authorize the acquisition of the territory for the Seat of Government of the Commonwealth. </para>

                <para class="block">If placed where we intend to place it, the proposed new clause will be on the very forehead of the Bill, and any one looking through the measure would see at a glance that it was not applicable to territory acquired for purposes of the Federal Capital. I think that the proposal will meet the wishes of those honorable senators better than if an amendment were made in clause 16. We may leave clause 16 as it stands. </para>

If honorable senators will turn to clause 5 they will see that the suggestion I am about to make has a good deal to commend it The definition clause contains the paragraph - &#34; Public purpose&#34; means any purpose in respect of which the Parliament has power to make laws.
                </para>
                <para class="block">Those words are taken from the Constitution; rightly taken from it in my opinion, so as to define the public purpose for which property may be secured in the terms used in the &#34;Constitution. I suggest that we should add to that paragraph some such words as these - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>But shall not include the acquisition of the Federal territory. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">That provision would expressly exclude the acquisition of any portion of the Federal territory. If a clause like that proposed by the Minister were inserted it would certainly be precise and distinct, but it would be inconsistent with the definition. There would be a definition of &#34; public purpose,&#34; and then a clause negativing its application. But if some such words as I have suggested were inserted after the definition of &#34; public purpose &#34; there would be a provision . governing the whole measure. <inline font-style="italic">Ai</inline> to clause 16 itself, I should have been glad to see it modified in respect of the acquisition of land from a State. Some honorable senators have argued that there is no reason why a State should be treated with any more consideration than a private individual. I thoroughly agree with that view, to a certain extent. But in relation to a Federation, we cannot place a sovereign State, whose interests and particular sentiments we are all anxious to consider, in the same position as an individual. The object of the Bill is to give power to acquire land, whether from an individual, a corporation, or a sovereign State, and, intrinsically, looking at the matter as merely one of morals, the question is whether the superior power or right of eminent domain, according to the. American phrase, should or should not be exercised with a high hand. Of course, if it comes to the pinch, the Commonwealth must exercise it with a high hand ; but when dealing with a sovereign State, there is a kind of courtesy which ought to be exhibited, particularly to a State which forms part of the same Federation. If I may use the expression, it is rather unmannerly to provide that by a mere notice in the <inline font-style="italic">Government Gazette,</inline> we shall take whatever land we choose, quite irrespective of the feelings of the State which owns the land. I do not take the ground that if land is necessary it should not be taker from a State, just as it is from an individual ; but we ought to have some regard to the position of a State as it was before Federation, and only exercise the powers, legislative and otherwise, which have been transferred to the Commonwealth. I should, therefore, have been glad to seethe power stated not quite so baldly as it is in this clause, and to have had a provision similar to that in the English Act prescribing a notice to treat, or something of that kind. If it were thought better to adopt the shorter cut in regard to individuals, we might retain the old-fashioned and more mannerly method in dealing with the States. This clause might be further postponed in order to give the Government an opportunity to consider some method more consonant with the position of the States. I do not mean that if it comes to an absolute insistence on the rights of the Commonwealth, the States will be entitled to any more consideration than individuals ; but if my suggestion were acted upon it would be, as it were, a little more delicate method of achieving the end. -Whichever way we adopt, that end would be achieved, and the land would be taken compulsorily ; but a notice to treat would be an intimation to the States, and any suggestions made on their behalf might be considered. Subclause 3, as I pointed out before, does not contain much of a safeguard to the control of Parliament. It is provided that: a copy of the notification shall be laid before Parliament within fourteen days after its publication in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> if the Parliament is then sitting, and, if not, then within fourteen days after the next meeting of Parliament ; but, in the meantime, the process of acquisition may- have gone too far to permit of successful or prudent interference on the part of Parliament. It is, of course, for Parliament to say whether that is sufficient control. However, I draw attention to sub-clause  3,  and shall be glad to hear from the Minister whether, in his opinion, it might be modified in regard to the acquisition of State lands. </para>

                        <para>. - If the only provision we had for the acquisition of land was that in clause :i6, there might be some force in the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> but I fail to see that those remarks have much application when we consider that, first of all, we provide for acquisition by agreement. I do not think it at all likely that the compulsory powers of acquisition will ever be exercised in regard to States lands until the opportunities for peaceful negotiation have been exhausted in vain. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has suggested that we might consider the advisableness, in regard to the States lands, of adopting principles parallel with, or similar to, those in the British Act. In- my opinion, the principles on which we propose to act under this Bill are still better than those in the British Act. We provide, first of all, that whether the land be the property of a State, or of a private individual, the Commonwealth shall be able to acquire it by agreement. The desire is to exercise the power to acquire by agreement as often as possible. As I pointed out on a previous occasion, the difficulty is that some of the States do not think that the agreement sections in the present Act are strong enough to warrant&#34; their parting with land under their operation. That fact, I should think, ought to clearly indicate to honorable senators the desire of the Commonwealth Government to exercise, wherever possible, the power of acquisition by agreement. We must, however, have some ultimate power in the event of a State not agreeing to part with the land; and it is, therefore, provided that, whether in the - case of a State or a private individual, land may be compulsorily acquired. I shall ask Honorable senators to agree to clause <inline font-style="italic">5a</inline> as circulated. </para>

                <para class="block">This amendment is proposed in order to meet the criticism raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> as to the definition of &#34; Crown land.&#34; The honorable senator referred to the case of selectors in New South Wales who had acquired some rights to land, but had not obtained the title deeds, and who, therefore, might possibly not have rights included in the definition. As I pointed out on a previous occasion, the definitions are, in my opinion, sufficient to cover all classes of cases which would arise under the Bill. I am still of that opinion; but honorable senators opposite seem to think that the definitions as they stand do not sufficiently protect the rights of the persons I have mentioned. Rather than that there should be any doubt. &#39; I am perfectly willing to submit the amendment, which will ensure that the possessor of such an estate or interest shall be able to exercise, in regard to compensation, the rights of a full and unencumbered owner of land. </para>

                    SYMON (South Australia) &#91;3.14&#93;. - The only effect of the clause is to say that it covers land, subsequently defined, of which the State is the owner. That being the case, all that the State owns is, as subsequently defined, the estate or interest in the land which belongs to the owner. Therefore, if the land were acquired, there might be two owners, namely, the State and the owner of the lesser interest ; and I am not sure that the additional words proposed may not cause difficulty. All Crown land is defined to be land of which a State is the owner, but that can refer only to the estate or interest in the land of which the State is possessed ; the remaining interest, if any, being that held by the individual. I do not know whether
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline>
                    is satisfied that the proposed amendment fully meets the objection raised.

It would be perfectly competent for Parliament when doing so to decide that, so far as private lands within the proposed territory were concerned, a certain procedure should be followed, or that certain provisions of this Bill should be incorporated to deal with those lands. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. By adopting either of the amendments suggested we should decide that this Bill, of its own force, is to have no application to the acquisition&#39; of territory for the Seat of Government. Parliament has supreme power to describe how that territory shall be acquired, arid might adopt for certain portions of that territory the method of acquisition prescribed under this Bill, but which this Bill of itself would not bring into force in respect of those acquisitions. </para>

                        <para>- It is not as to place merely. I like the honorable and learned senator&#39;s term- the forefront of the Bill. The definition clause is absolutely in the forefront - it is on the forehead of the Bill. &#34; Public purpose&#34; is that which gives the key to the power taken under this measure to&#39; acquire land, and &#34; public purpose &#34; means any purpose in respect to which Parliament has power to make laws. It is right that we should exempt the public purpose which we do not intend to include in this measure, and that is the public purpose of acquiring territory for&#39; the Seat of Government of the Commonwealth. If we do that, as I propose, we shall put in one passage the whole scope of the Bill, and it will not be necessary to go to some other clause to see how the Act is to be construed. It is very undesirable to insert what lawyers call a <inline font-style="italic">non</inline><inline font-style="italic">obstanti</inline> clause, to say that a Bill is not to be used in a particular way. All that we require to do is to show that under this Bill &#34; public purpose &#34; means every purpose in respect to which Parliament has power to make laws, except one. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> will agree that that should be put in the forefront of the Bill, and attached to the words which&#39; are the key to the object of the measure. Then every one reading the Bill will be able &#39;to see that there is one public purpose which is not dealt with by the measure, and that is a public purpose which must be dealt with by the Parliament of the Commonwealth pass&#39;ing a separate and independent Act for the acquisition of the Federal Territory. </para>

                    SYMON (South Australia) &#91;3.33&#93; - I have no objection to the reconsideration of clause 20. There are one or two other clauses which I desire to have reconsidered. I should like to give the Committee another opportunity&#39; of eliminating that misleading title &#34; Eminent Domain Act,&#34; and substituting the title &#34;Lands Acquisition Act.&#34; Since the point was previously discussed same persons have got the impression that the Sydney Domain is dealt with by the Bill. Perhaps, after consideration, the Minister may adopt my suggestion. &#34; Eminent Domain &#34; is merely the source of the power to which we give effect. The Bill does not deal with that subject at all, but with, the acquisition of lands. Therefore, the short title which tells what a Bill is should be the Lands Acquisition Act. I also desire that clause 6 be reconsidered. It gave rise to a considerable amount of debate. The gist of trie contention was that we ought 10 to keep the provision as it stands in the existing Act, namely, to empower the Governor-General to enter into an agreement, on the ground that we by this measure cannot give, and ought not to pretend or profess to give, to the Governor of a State, a power which must be conferred upon him, if at all, by the Parliament of his own State. We cannot give powers to Governors of States in relation to dealing or parting with State land. I am sure that, on reflection, the Minister will see that it is a blot on the Bill to put in words which affect to give such power to a State Governor. I also wish to draw his attention to clause 35, with a suggestion that in the interests of every person whose land is taken, there should be a time limit in which the Minister shall cause the claim for compensation to be examined. In previous clauses, as well as in clause 36, great care is taken, and rightly taken, to put in a time limit within which a person shall make a claim for compensation. Under clause 34 he has to make the claim within 120 days, and then, after the Minister has communicated to him the result of his consideration, he has to say within sixty days whether he accepts the decision or not. It is a little hard upon the claimant that there should be no time limit within which the Minister, who is the purchasing party, should be obliged to cause the claim to be examined. The clause merely says -
                </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>As soon as practicable after a claim for compensation has been made, the Minister shall cause the claim to be examined. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">That is not quite just, because, as we know, the Minister, as well as the Department, is greatly occupied. If an unfortunate individual had his claim held up for a long while, he would have no remedy of any sort. He would be literally paralyzed. Having regard to. the multifarious duties of the Minister, and the Department, I suggest that a time limit of 120 days should be prescribed. I have had considerable experience in these matters, and the smaller a claim the more likely it is to be overlooked by a subordinate officer. Although the amount of compensation might be&#163;100or&#163;200, still, the claimant might have the greatest difficulty in getting the matter brought to a head. The last clause which I desire to have re- considered is clause 63. It is a pity that it should be put into a measure dealing with the acquisition of land, and I ask you, sir, to say whether it comes within the title or scope of this Bill. This is not a Bill for the purpose of authorizing the Governor-General or the Commonwealth to dispose of land or to grant leases of land. If it is intended either now or at any time to empower the Governor-General to deal with the land of the Commonwealth, and grant mining or pastoral or agricultural or other leases, that should be dealt with by a separate measure. After we come to acquire Federal territory we all contemplate that there shall be some reform in the method of disposing of our Crown land. The subject ought to be dealt with in one measure. But if, sir, you should think that the clause is within the scope of the Bill, I would still appeal to the Government to delete it. Nobody would expect to go to an Act for the acquisition of Crown lands for a provision as to how the Commonwealth shall dispose of Crown lands or lease them for mineral purposes. I do not know an\, Act in which such a provision is contained. This clause gives substantive power to the Governor-General to grant- mineral leases. It ought to appear in a special -Bill, with, which we could deal, because, in the interests of the community, we might wish to impose conditions to provide for the better working of the mines. But the clause is certainly inadvisable. We are incorporating the laws of the States affecting mineral leases. I am not prepared to say that State mineral laws in regard to what might be Commonwealth lands in South Australia should apply. We are legislating . in the clark. We are asked to shut our eyes and open our mouths. The laws of the States with respect to mineral leases may differ. Probably they do differ in each State. Hut by one stroke of the pen we are practically re-enacting all the mineral laws of all the States, and making them apply to Commonwealth lands. The question is whether we are prepared to legislate in that fashion. </para>

                SYMON (South, Australia) &#91;3.56&#93;. - This is a clause in which we profess to assume the right to give power to the Governor of a State to deal with the Crown lands of the State. I venture to point out that we have no right to do by legislation anything of the kind. It will be a blot upon our statute-book if we attempt to do it. The words of the existing Act express the power that we have exactly, and are much better to the point. Those words empower the Governor-general to enter into arrangements or make an agreement with any State. That is an intelligible and proper enactment. We have no more right to say that the Governor of a State shall have power to dispose of the Crown lands of the State than to order that I shall do so. The Governor of a State takes his power from the Parliament of the State. The only possible suggestion that can be made in favour of the clause is that it would be nugatory, and that it would do neither good nor harm. But there it would be on the face of our statute-book. It would be an attempt by us to vest in the Governor of a State a power which it is for the Parliament of the State alone to exercise. There is a subsequent clause 15, which is intended to have the same effect, except that instead of the Governor-General executing an agreement, the Attorney-General is to have that power delegated to him. Therefore, it is unnecessary to insert clause 6. For these reasons I ask that it be negatived.

As Senator Symon said, this question was previously discussed very fully, both when we were dealing with the clause itself, and when we were dealing with other parts of the Bill. If the clause is struck out, every one of the Departments of the Commonwealth, which is called upon to acquire land from a State, will remain in its present paralyzed position. </para>

                        <para>- There is no nonsense about it. Every time the Commonwealth desires to acquire one foot of land from New South Wales, for instance, we are unable, as the law stands, to take the land by any ordinary negotiation. There has been no opposition raised in New South Wales, or in any other State, to the compulsory powers under the Property for Public Purposes Acquisition Act; but we are confronted with the position that in every transaction, involving, it may be, only <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5</inline> or  &#163;10,  with a State, our law is said not to be strong enough to enable a State Governor to dispose of land amicably and peaceably. In each case we are told that we had better exercise our compulsory powers; and to this course we are forced in every instance. </para>

Does it not seem scandalous that we should be so paralyzed in connexion with the acquisition of land, that, in the case of two 5-acre adjoining blocks, one belonging to a private individual, and the other belonging; to a State, we can obtain the one by peaceful negotiations and arrangement, while in regard to the other we are compelled to use our compulsory powers? . </para>

                        <para>- In the case of a State, we are, in every single instance, compelled to exercise our compulsory powers. And why? Because the Crown Law authorities of the States say that the Commonwealth Act does not go far enough - that it only empowers the Governor of a State to dispose of State lands subject to the limitation of the laws of the State. The States do not object to the States Governors disposing of lands in the way we desire, but they point out that at present there is not the power to do so; and, that being so, all lands disposed of to the Commonwealth by States are subject to certain conditions. For instance, in some States the lands must be submitted to auction or selection, and the Commonwealth must acquire the land as a selector or bid at auction. There is no aggressiveness on the part of the Commonwealth in seeking the powers conferred vt the Bill. We are empowered under the Constitution to exercise to the fullest extent all legislative powers incidental to the execution of the trusts reposed in us ; and this is one of the powers contemplated. BI OW is the Post and Telegraph Department to be administered, or the defences of the country to be looked .after, if the Commonwealth is not empowered, under any circumstances, to acquire lands which may be absolutely necessary ? </para>

                        <para>- Yes; and that is one of the main reasons for the introduction of this Bill. -I laid particular stress 011 this point when J moved the second reading of the measure, and I then gave a striking instance. The Commonwealth entered into negotiations under the Act with the Government of Western Australia for the acquisition of land for public purposes, and, as in the case of a private individual, we came to terms, and a deed was prepared and forwarded transferring the land to the Commonwealth. But this deed contained a condition that the State Government could resume the land unless certain improvements were made within twenty-one years. The Commonwealth held that it was not in the position of a private individual ; but the Western Australian: Government pointed out that, according to the law of the State, the deed must contain a condition of the kind, 01 the Commonwealth must exercise its compulsory powers. Are we always to be forced to use our compulsory powers, as we should be if this amendment were adopted? I. ask honorable senators to assist the Government in the endeavour to so legislate that hereafter, in all transactions between the Commonwealth and a State, we shall be able to precede any compulsory acquisition by the fullest negotiation for a satisfactory settlement. Clause 6 is intended to effect that object, and if the clause be removed the conditions will have to remain as at present. New South Wales and Western Australia do not afford the only instances of difficulty in this connexion. In New South Wales Commonwealth action is very often likely to be misunderstood or misrepresented to the prejudice of those responsible for Commonwealth administration, and I again point out that in that State we cannot obtain a foot of land by ordinary negotiations with the State Government. It is to remedy this condition of affairs, and to enable us to deal with States as with private individuals, that I ask honorable senators to retain clause 6. </para>

                    <para>. - Would not the objections urged be met by re-enacting section 3 of the present Act, with an addition? The Minister points out that when it is sought to acquire land from New South Wales, or any of the other States, we are informed that the Commonwealth has not sufficient power to free that land from the obligations imposed by the State law. What was suggested previously in the debate - and I cannot see that the Minister has met the arguments then advanced - was that section 3 of the present Act should be re-enacted, with the addition of certain words. Section .3 of the present Act is as follows: - </para>

The amendment .1 suggest would free us from the difficulty of apparently instructing the Governor of a State as to what his duties are. </para>

I do not think that such a clause is desirable, if it can be avoided; and I ask the Minister to consider whether all the powers he is seeking could not be obtained by the amendment 1 have suggested. The law at present empowers the Governor-General to do certain things, and to enter into certain agreements, while the clause before us purports to tell the Governor of a State what he can or ought to do, although the laws of his State may, apparently, provide to the contrary. </para>

                    SYMON (South Australia) &#91;4.13&#93;. - We have listened to an extremely vehement and heated speech in opposition to the- suggestion I made to omit clause 6 ; but I scarcely think that vehemence and heat are likely to assist very much in the determination of this question. The Honorary Minister drew a picture of the defences of Australia being paralyzed by the striking out of the clause, and various other pictures, which are altogether creations of his imagination, and do not help to any end. other than, I am quite sure unintentionally, misleading honorable senators and drawing attention away from the real meaning of the provision, and the suggestion made regarding it. I do not think there is any honorable senator who is not desirous to facilitate in every way possible the exercise of the powers cf the Commonwealth. It is our duty to see that those powers are large, and that they are carried out in order to effect the public purposes the Commonwealth has in view. But the clause in its present shape does not bear in any way on the powers of the Commonwealth. The Minister has told us how the States arts unable to enter Into&#39; agreement for the disposal of lands which are subject to restrictions. But the remedy for that is for a. States Parliament to remove the restriction. We have no power to repeal a State law, but we have power to acquire land for Commonwealth purposes by virtue of our superior authority under the Constitution ; and when we take land in that way the effect under subsequent provisions is to sweep away any reservation or dedication. I think there ought to be some limitation in this connexion, but that is not now the question before us.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline>
                    has pointed out that the remedy is to put at the end of the corresponding section in the existing Act the words that on such acquisition the land shall be held by the Commonwealth free from those limitations or reservations. Whether we could do that might or might not be problematical, but, at any rate, that would be a way of doing what is desired, which would not, on the face of it, assume on the part of the Commonwealth the right to give power to the Governor of a State to sell or lease the Crown lands of that State, notwithstanding anything contained in the laws of the State. That is a most preposterous provision; to put into any Commonwealth law. The clause provides that -

                <para class="block">I say that we have no right to confer upon the Governor of any State a power to negotiate voluntarily for the sale or lease of Crown lands of the State in defiance of the laws of the State. In addition to that, this clause, as it stands, does not contain any provision for doing away with dedications and reservations. There may be dedications and reservations quite irrespective of the laws of a State, and the clause is defective from that point of view. The main question, however, is this: Is this Parliament entitled to enact that the Governor of a State may sell or lease Crown lands of that State in defiance of any law of the State? I say we have no power of that kind, and should not insert a provision which is altogether unnecessary, as this certainly is, to effect any such purpose. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> says that the acquisition of land, the property of a State, is paralyzed under the existing conditions. I venture to say that that is sheer nonsense. The power of the Commonwealth to acquire the land exists at this moment, and might be carried into effect under this measure.

We could overcome the difficulty in some other way, and I do not believe that any State Parliament would agree to the Commonwealth Parliament conferring powers upon the Governor of the State to sell or lease the lands of the State by mutual agreement with the Commonwealth Government, and in defiance of the laws of the State. </para>

We propose to enact that the Governor of a State may do certain things with the advice of his Executive Council. We. are here asked to insert a clause revoking States laws, but we have nothing to do with States laws in regard to land matters. I think the Minister must agree that to ad&#39;d the few words which have been suggested to section 3 of the existing Act would be a much nicer way of doing what we desire than by forcing a provision like this upon the States Parliaments. </para>

                        <para>- There is an agreeable as well as a disagreeable way of exercising compulsion. The object sought to be attained&#39; by the clause is all right, but the provision is worded in an extraordinary way. Surely the Minister can have no objection to follow the advice given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> in this matter? If that honorable and learned senator&#39;s suggestion were adopted, no one could object to it. </para>

                    <para>. - We can all claim that in any matter in. which States rights are seriously threatened we would be prepared to do our duty. We would not stand by and&#39; see the Federal Parliament usurp powers which belong legitimately to the Parliaments of the States. But, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has pointed out, the obligation is imposed upon us to carry out our powers to the fullest extent. The Government have had five years&#39; experience of the working of the existing Act, and they find that, not because of any opposition, on the part of the States authorities, or any opposition intended by the States laws, but simply because of the operation of those laws, and the fact that the States Governments are powerless to set - them aside, conditions have arisen which render the provisions of the existing law exceedingly cumbersome. The Government of a State for the time being is charged&#39; with the administration of the laws of the State. They can by lax administration set aside any law, or render it a dead letter, but they are responsible to the Parliament of the State whose duty it is to see that they do administer the law. In this clause we do not lay any obligation upon the State Governor. We do not interfere with his duties, or with the control exercised over him by the State Parliament. All that we say is that on the advice of the State Executive, that is to say, the State Government charged with the administration of the State laws, and responsible to Parliament, he may say, in certain circumstances, &#34; We are willing that laws of the State which hinder the transfer of this land to the Federal authorities shall be set aside in order that the transfer may be speedily made. &#39; &#39; </para>

                        <para>- The question as to the method by which the acquisition of the land is carried out does not affect the question whether this provision is an infringement of States rights. That it is an infringement of States rights is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon&#39;s</inline> main reason for endeavouring to secure an amendment of the clause. My reply to that is that I do not think it is an infringement of States rights, because it lays no obligation upon the Governor of a State. It provides that he may take certain action, with the advice of his Executive Council, who are responsible to the State Parliament for the administration not only of the particular law affected, but of all the laws of the State. I cannot contemplate a State Executive Council going out of their way to set aside laws of the State in order to suit the convenience of the Commonwealth Government, if in doing so they would bring upon themselves the censure of the State Parliament. They would take very good care to retain the good- will of the State Parliament. I think that no infringement of States rights is involved, and I shall support the clause as it stands. </para>

                    <para>. - I cannot forget that we are here, amongst other things, to protect the rights of the States. I believe that in New South Wales there is likely to be a considerable outcry against the wording of this clause, because, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon&#39;</inline> has already said, it looks as though we were endeavouring to teach the Governor of a State what his duty is, or that we were endeavouring to supersede the laws of a State. I have throughout believed that the proper course would be for the State Parliament to authorize the Governor in Council of the State to negotiate with the Commonwealth Government with respect to State, lands. We should at all events endeavour to do the thing in such a way as not to cause unpleasantness. Rightly or wrongly, there is a feeling growing in New South Wales that the Commonwealth is encroaching rather too much upon its rights. It is the duty of the Senate, as the States House, to see that States rights are not injured. This clause seems to me to be an interference with States laws. </para>

                    <para>. - It seems to me that the clause does not invest the Commonwealth with new powers. It merely provides that with the consent of the Governor of a State acting with the advice of his Executive Council, the Commonwealth may exercise in another way the power which it already possesses under the compulsory provisions of the measure. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> I think, said that that difficulty could be overcome. He mentioned that we should not necessarily resort to those provisions if each State were to alter its Act in so far as it related to lands transferred to the Commonwealth.

It is quite true, as
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline>
                    says, that there is no obligation imposed upon a State Governor, but this clause purports to give him a power which can only be given to him by the Parliament of his State, and that is the power to deal with its lands in any form. The Commonwealth Parliament can override the State law by taking any lands compulsorily, but it cannot empower the Governor of a State to deal with its lands in any shape or form. That must be done by the State Parliament alone, and the point is apparent in the use of the words &#34;the Governor of a State.&#34;

                    said quite truly - and so did
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline>
                    too - that when we are dealing with an owner of land we have no trouble. Why ? Because the owner can do what he likes with his own. If, however, the ownership of a State is limited, the Commonwealth Government cannot increase the extent of that ownership. That must be done by the Parliament of the State.

                        <para>- The remedy for that position is for the State Parliament to pass an Act empowering the Governor, with the consent of the Executive Council, to dispose of Crown lands. If it will not free the Governor from all restrictions and limitations we cannot do so. Our only method is to take the lands compulsorily. Instead of having an agreement drawn out, it will only be necessary for the Commonwealth to arrange with the State to take a certain piece of land, and for the State to say &#34; Very well, put your notice in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette,&#34;</inline> and the thing will be done. </para>

                    SYMON.Neither the State Governor nor the State Executive could deal with the lands of a State by sale, or lease, in opposition to the local law, nor could the Commonwealth Parliament enable them to do so. But the Commonwealth Government, as the superior sovereignty, might take the land, and, when a price was agreed upon, the State Government if it had no power to enter into an agreement could say, &#34; Now that we are agreed upon the price, put the notice in the
                    <inline font-style="italic">Gazette,&#34;</inline>
                    and the thing would be done. All I desire to accomplish is to preserve this Parliament from taking, in form, at least, if not in substance, a false step. and that is to assume to vest in the Governor of a State the power to sell, lease, or otherwise dispose of its lands in defiance of State law. That is not the way to get over any difficulty which may &#39;have arisen in respect of agreements in connexion with the taking of land without compulsion. The compulsion is a mere myth. If an owner of land agrees with the Commonwealth Government to hand over his land, but owing to some difficulty, he is unable togiveatitle,there is no compulsion if he says to the Commonwealth Government, &#34;Now that we have agreed about the price, put the notice in your

In New South Wales, for instance, there are millions of acres which are not freehold. To these lands are attached conditions regarding cultivation, fencing, and improvements. Yet, it is proposed by this clause to revoke such conditions.

By the clause as it is printed, I understand that it is proposed to alter the laws of the States. Can we make a law for a State? What right have we to empower the Governor of a State over whom we have no jurisdiction to act contrary to its laws? Undoubtedly we have power to override the laws of a. State, if we keep within the limits of the Constitution. But have we power to make a fresh law for a State, and if so, in what section of the Constitution is it given? All it comes to, I admit, is a question of doing the same thing bv a different wording. We ought to adopt such a wording as would undoubtedly place the provisions of the measure within the limits and terms of the Constitution.

                    <para>. - The arguments used against this clause seem to me to be somewhat confusing. It is admitted that the Federal authority has power to take land from any State, in spite of State laws. The States already know that the Federal Government has such power. In what way would there be an insult inflicted upon a State, simply by enforcing the power that the Con.stitition gives? It would appear from the arguments of some honorable members that the Constitution itself has inflicted a severe insult upon the States, inasmuch as it has given to the Federal Government power to take, at its free will, for certain purposes, such lands as it may require. Honorable senators who are opposing the clause are endeavouring, I understand, to take the sting out of it. Where that sting is I candidly confess that I have not been able to discover. The Government has submitted a Bill to Parliament in which certain machinery is formulated to enable it to attain in an easy manner the position which it is desired to attain. The Minister has given us a good illustration in the case of Western Australia. The Land Act of that State certainly provides that the Government shall have power to resume within twenty-one years, but no difference can be made so far as the land law is concerned between the representative of the Commonwealth Government and some private individual. If the Western Australian Government wished to make the acquisition of land easier for the Commonwealth, it would have to alter the law now applying generally in that State. The simplest way to attain the object sought is for the Commonwealth Parliament to express in its own Act its&#39; own way of doing what it wants to do. I shall support the Government in maintaining the clause as it stands, because I have not yet heard sufficient reasons why we should vote against it. </para>

                    <para>. - I am rather surprised at the turn affairs have taken in reference to this clause. I thought the matter in dispute was settled a week ago, and that we should not again hear the old arguments repeated. I cannot see what difference a reversal of what we did on a previous occasion would make to the States. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> does not think that, where there is a reservation of land of any description, the Commonwealth has any right to take that land, even compulsorily. But every one admits that our compulsory powers in relation to the lands of the States are paramount. Some honorable members contend that we have no right to empower the Governor of a State to do anything. This Bill does not give to the Governor of a State any powers. It only says that he may do certain things. </para>

                        <para>- If we desire to give powers to the Governor of a State; this is not the way we should do it. The Governor-General is the head of the Executive authority of the Commonwealth. Seeing that he has vested in him all the powers that are given to the Commonwealth Government by any Commonwealth Act, there is no reason to mention again that he is clothed with those powers. Now what does this clause do? It says that the Governor of a State, with the consent of the Executive Council of the State - that is, with the consent of his advisers - may make an agreement with the Commonwealth, which, if we like to strain the provision to its ultimate effect, means that the Governor-General, notwithstanding any law of a State, may cause any piece of land in that State to be transferred by agreement, thus avoiding the necessity of using compulsion. When an agreement is made, all that has to be done is to insert in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> a notification that it has been arrived at, and that it does away with the law of the State in that respect. Is it not more honest and above-board to say that the Governor of a State, with the consent of his Executive Council, may make an agreement with the Commonwealth, notwithstanding any State law, than to attain that end by a round-about method ? The object is to avoid the necessity of going to the trouble of compulsory acquisition, with probably the recriminations that might arise from taking that step. Say that the Government of New South Wales has reserved Tickell Bay, and that a State law provides that a house shall not be erected on the foreshore ; so that in perpetuity the people may go to gather whelks there. Suppose that suddenly it is discovered that Tickell Bay is one of the most vulnerable points in the Common wealth, and that it is necessary to erect a fort there. The Government of the State could not order the revocation of that reserve without repealing the State Act. But the Commonwealth Government, notwithstanding the reservation, might say to the Governor of the State, &#34; If you, with the concurrence of your advisers, are prepared to enter into an arrangement with the Commonwealth to transfer this land, notwithstanding your State law, we are prepared to take it. If you are not prepared to make an arrangement we shall have to take it compulsorily.&#34; The same would apply if a reservation had been made by a State of a piece of coast, on account of the drainage of a city being emptied into the sea at that point. In the event of the Commonwealth Government requiring that piece of coast for some public purpose, it could take what it wanted. Many illustrations might be given of the advantage of giving facilities for the making of an amicable agreement, and thereby avoiding the use of compulsory powers. The method adopted in this Bill gets over the difficulties in an opera and above-board manner, which is better than that suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake.</inline> That, is my opinion, and it is the opinion that was expressed by a majority of honorable senators on a previous occasion. I hope that honorable senators will adhere to their determination. </para>

                        <para>- That is so; and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> asked why I had not directed my attention to this particular amendment. I may remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> that I referred to this suggestion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> when addressing the Committee on a previous occasion. I cannot be expected to be constantly repeating arguments, simply because the attention of honorable senators may be called elsewhere when I am dealing with particular matters. I pointed out that the Commonwealth does not always desire to acquire the whole of the rights attaching to lands which are transferred. It may happen that, when negotiating with a State for certain lands, there are attached rights which the Commonwealth would rather be without. For instance, in connexion with a large area, there may be certain underground mining rights, and the Commonwealth would not desire to be burdened with the obligation and duty to make mining laws and regulations. Later on in the Bill we deal with cases where such rights have passed over to the Commonwealth, and it is proposed, under such circumstances, to make the law of the particular State applicable. Honorable senators can see, however, that in many instances no more than the surface rights are desired by the Commonwealth; and if a hard-and-fast line is laid down, and certain consequences must follow acquisitions, the Commonwealth may obtain more than it wants, and be saddled with undesirable duties and obligations. It is proposed to enable the Governor of a State, with the advice of the Executive Council - in other words, to enable the Government of the State - to dispose of land to the Commonwealth. As I said before, we may, under the Constitution, legislate with respect to all matters incidental to the exercise of any of our powers Section 51, sub-section xxxi., of the Constitution empowers the Commonwealth to acquire property on just terms from any State or person ; and the same section later enables the Commonwealth to legislate for matters incidental to the execution nf any powers vested by the Constitution in this Parliament. Having those powers, we find we are confronted with a practical difficulty. Even honorable senators who are opposed to the clause do not, I think ignore the fact that there is a practical difficulty in the way of acquiring Crown lands, more particularly in the case of New South Wales, though also in other States. It is proposed by the Bill to empower - not to command or order - the States Governments to transfer, by agreement, lands for the purposes of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> were in the position of those who have had practical experience of the working of the present Act, the objection might appeal more strongly to him. I have been in conference with those who have been associated with &#39;the operation of the existing law, and in connexion with some of the properties we occupy there are conditions which necessitate the subsequent clause in the Bill dealing with mining leases and so forth. At this stage of the Commonwealth&#39;s history we do not desire <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> have &#39; cast upon us the obligation to make mining regulations, and  probably  to establish within a State a separate code of mining laws, applicable to Commonwealth properties. For that reason provision is made in the Bill for State laws to apply under such circumstances. There are other conditions and reservations in regard to which similar reasons would hold force as against <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best&#39;s</inline> suggestion. The only other alternative that seems to be offered is that we should wait until the States severally make provision that, . notwithstanding any limitations there may be imposed on the Lands Departments in connexion with the disposal of lands to private persons, such limitations shall not apply to land disposed of to the Commonwealth. Is it reasonable to ask the Commonwealth <inline font-style="italic">Government to</inline> wait until the several States legislate to that effect? What hope or what immediate prospect have we of any one, not to say all. of the States legislating in that direction? What guarantee have we that the States would legislate uniformly? Another suggestion which seems to be offered is that the present procedure in the case of New South Wales might be persevered in. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly, by mutual agreement in fact, but by compulsion in form. We have power under the present Act to compulsorily acquire land by <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> notice, whether the owner be a State or a private individual. It is suggested that it would be easy to come to an arrangement with a State to have the necessary notice gazetted. Legally and strictly, if there were any dispute as to the Commonwealth having properly acquired the land, the High Court, or any other Court having jurisdiction, would have to decide that it had been acquired compulsorily. </para>

                        <para>- It may not be clear to the honorable senator&#39;s mind, but the present Act already provides that the Governor of a State &#34; may grant land in the name of the King to the Commonwealth.&#34; We have already, by a law on our statute-book, conferred a power on the Governor of a State. But the provision to which I have referred has been construed to mean that a State Governor must grant the land subject to the laws of the State. </para>

                <para>The Governor of a State already has the power with which he has been invested by the legislation of the Commonwealth Parliament; but the extent of that power is the matter that is in dispute at present- between the Commonwealth and the States. It is proposed to overcome the difficulty by enacting that the power may be exercised by the State Governor, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any law of the State. Under the Constitution, we have power, when legislating in all matters entrusted to us, to override the laws of the State. According to section 109 of the Constitution, when a law of a State is inconsistent with the law of the Commonwealth, the latter shall prevail. </para>

                        <para>- As I have already pointed out, the Crown law authorities of the Commonwealth hold that the Governor of a State possesses the power under the existing law. The question has been raised, however, in one or more of the States as to whether a State Governor has the power. I am not sure, but I believe that in some of the States the Governors already exercise the power we propose to confer. </para>

                        <para>- The States Governors, I believe, exercise the power in some of the States now ; and although the point has been raised, the Commonwealth Crown law officers hold the opinion that this Parliament has already invested the several Governors with the amplest power to transfer land to the Commonwealth altogether apart from any of the restrictions which would apply to the granting of land in the case of a private individual. The object of the clause is not to invest the States Governors with any new power, but to set aside all doubt, and make it abundantly clear that in the future we shall not be compelled, in every instance, to reso.t to the unpleasant compulsory method. Surely there is nothing offensive ii! the words of the clause or aggressive on the part of the Commonwealth? That is a fair, honest, and straightforward way of conducting these negotiations with the States. I indicated, when discussing the matter previously in Committee, that, in many instances, under the existing law, when the State of New South Wales actually agree to the compensation to be given in respect of certain lands, and when everything necessary for its acquisition has been arranged, the State authorities find themselves obliged to say, for instance, in, such a case as that cited by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> by way of illustration, &#34; We are agreeable to accept ^75 for this land, but we cannot transfer it to you. You require the land, and we wish to get rid of it; but our law compels us to dispose of it by public auction or by methods of selection!. &#34; The Commonwealth has the power under the existing law, and will have the power under this Bill, if it be passed, to compulsorily acquire the land. So we have had to fall back in every such instance on our power to acquire the land compulsorily. It is proposed that we should do what is desired neither more nor less than in connivance with, or in collusion with, the States. </para>

                        <para>- It might, because it is proposed that we should acquire land free from all kinds of reservations and dedications. We might desire to obtain a considerable strip of land from a State for the purpose of a rifle range. If we were going to take that land by agreement, and the provisions with regard to acquisition by agreement would exempt that land from all reservations and dedications, we should not only acquire the surface, which might be all that we would require, but also the minerals beneath, and would either have to prevent persons mining on adjoining land from extending their operations to the land acquired, or to pass some legislation to control their operations in respect of that land. We might not desire to have to do that. There might be reservations of another character in connexion with fore -shores with respect to fisheries;, and so on, where we might desire to acquire no more than the surface rights of the land. </para>

                        <para>- If we make arrangements with the Governor of a State that he can dispose of the land, these difficulties can be met by agreement in every instance. In almost every instance in the past it might be said that we have- acquired land bv the system of compulsory acquisition. We introduce compulsory acquisition in the existing law as. a method which it was contemplated would be used only as a last resort, because we had made provision earlier in the Statute for acquisition by agreement. I am certain that every honorable senator who took part in the discussion of the Property for Public Purposes Acquisition Act believed that the compulsory method would be resorted to only after all effort at acquisition by agreement had failed. I think that was in every honorable senator&#39;s mind. I have just had an opportunity to inform honorable senators how the existing Act was worked. We have had to use the compulsory method in cases in which we least desired to do so, and in such circumstances as would warrant a belief in the minds of ordinary individuals that the attitude of the Commonwealth towards the States, and towards one State in particular, was very aggressive. I cannot help thinking that citizens of New South Wales, learning that every time we acquired land from that State we did so compulsorily, would imagine that the Commonwealth Government were proceeding in . a very high-handed way with what ordinarily, as between the Commonwealth and individuals, or other States, would be transactions settled by agreement. I point out to honorable senators that, inasmuch as we are not imposing any duty or purporting, to cast any obligation upon the Governor of a State, and are not making it any personal matter so far as the Governor is concerned, but a matter to be dealt with by him with the advice of&#39; his Executive Council, we are proceeding in a proper way in empowering that entity, which might be called the Government of the day, for the public purposes of the, Commonwealth, to grant or transfer the lands of a State. </para>

                    <para>.- I confess that I feel somewhat disappointed that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> should have so carefully ignored the complete answers which other honorable senators and myself have from time to&#39; time given to the&#39; objections which he makes. If those objections were not absolutely and completely met by the words of the proposed amendment, I should be the very last to urge its acceptance upon him. First of all, it is contended by myself and other honorable senators that the clause in its present form is offensive to the States, and that it is a departure from the precedent already established by the Commonwealth as to the way in which we should deal with the States, namely, by empowering the Governor-General to do certain things with the Governor of a State, and not, as in this case, making laws for the guidance and assistance of the Governor of a State. I contend, and I hope I . shall do so incontestably, that everything that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> seeks to do can be inoffensively done in another way. The present law dealing with this particular subject is embodied in sections 3 and 5 of the Property for Public Purposes Acquisition Act. The fo:!m of words used in section 3 is as follows : - </para>

                <para class="block">I frankly admit that if that section were at present before us, I might have some objections to take to the form in which it is stated. In my opinion, the law as it stands is sufficient for all the purposes sought by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> but as the honorable and learned senator has stated that there are certain doubts in regard to it, I am entirely with him in the desire to meet the difficulty which he says has from time to time arisen, particularly in regard to the acquisition of lands in New South Wales. For this purpose. I have proposed, though I do not for a moment claim, that the words I have suggested are complete in themselves, that we should add words to the effect that upon the publication of an agreement in the Government <inline font-style="italic">Gazette,</inline> the land which is the subject of the agreement should vest in the Commonwealth according to the terms of the agreement, or that, if the Government desire absolutely to acquire the land free from all encumbrances, then it should vest in the Commonwealth free from all such encumbrances. I desire &#34;to deal with the Minister&#39;s objections to the amendment. The first objection the honorable and learned senator takes is that it would not answer the present undesirable features of the law, which he says exist, that if. he were to negotiate with New South Wales, and had a mutual arrangement with the Government of that State to acquire a certain piece of land, it would be- necessary to go through the compulsory process. If such an objection arises under the existing law, the purpose of the amendment is to do away with it once and for all. So that once a mutual agreement has been made with the Government of New South Wales, or of any other State, upon the publication or notification of that agreement in the Commonwealth <inline font-style="italic">Gazette,</inline> the land shall vest in the Commonwealth. In these circumstances, and with the words I have suggested in the Bill, there would be no necessity whatever to resort to the compulsory process. I challenge the honorable and learned senator to say whether that is not a complete answer to his first objection. I challenge him to say that there is any doubt or . uncertainty that with the words I have suggested added to section 3 of the .existing Act, it would <inline font-style="italic">he</inline> necessary to resort to any compulsory process. I come now to his second objection. The Minister says that the insertion of the amendment would mean that the Commonwealth would be obliged to take more than it intended to take. That is entirely wrong. The honorable and learned senator claims that if the Commonwealth desired to acquire land for a rifle range, and required only the surface according to the proposed amendment it would be necessary that we should acquire the land completely. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> was going to meet that objection. I originally suggested the use of words taken from clause 17, but honorable senators will remember that by saying; that the property should vest in the Commonwealth free from all encumbrances, I have overcome the necessity for the introduction of those words. I wish now to deal with the objection which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> sought to drive home that, according to the amendment, in the event of the Commonwealth seeking to acquire surface rights in respect to an area of land required for a rifle range, it would be essential that we should acquire the land completely. I wish to show how absolutely fallacious such a suggestion is. The terms of the agreement might be to acquire either the surface of or other interest in the land, because, under the clause &#34;land&#34; includes &#34;&#34;&#39; any interest in land.&#34; The agreement in its terms would be to acquire the surface of the land, and consequently there would be only compensation therefor. My amendment proposes that upon the publication of that agreement in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette,</inline> the land shall be held subject to its terms. </para>

If it wanted a right of easement over a particular piece of land, the agreement would contain that statement, and then that right of easement alone would vest in the Commonwealth ; and, what is more, the compensation would be regulated accordingly.

                        <para>- Yes, but in an inoffensive way. I would urge the Committee to adhere to the precedent which it has established. The Bill makes a departure from the existing Act when it proposes to enact what the Governor of a State may or mav not do. It would be a waste of time on my part to attempt to deal with the other objections which were made by my honorable friend. In the circumstances, T think that the proper course for the Committee to adopt is to reject the clause, and thereupon I shall propose a new clause, which will be section 3 of the existing Act, with the addition of the words I have indicated. </para>

                        <para>- There has not been a single instance where a State Government, or a State Parliament, or anybody outside this Parliament speaking on behalf of the States, has objected to section 5 of the Act. Under that section, we can do what we are doing by the clause under consideration - simply empower the Governor of a State of transfer land to the Commonwealth. Certainly we do add some other words to this clause, but we do not assert any right other than we have previously asserted, but simply endeavour to make it absolutely clear that State authorities can rest upon this measure in respect of any transfer that they purport to make to the Commonwealth. We are not assuming any new power, nor are we proposing any new application of it, nor imposing any fresh duty upon a State Governor other than we have already given power to exercise. But we endeavour to make it clear that the power rests upon Commonwealth legislation. </para>

                    <inline font-style="italic">volte face</inline>
                    that excels that to which we have just listened from the Minister at the table. Apparently his objection now is that

                    has not put his amendment in writing, but has merely indicated what he desires to accomplish. I take the ground that the clause as it stands is unconstitutional in substance, and is equally unconstitutional and disagreeable in form. But I have no objection to some such amendment as
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline>
                    has, outlined. I gather from

                    that his amendment was to be exactly the same as
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline>
                    suggested on a previous occasion. Whether he expressed the meaning in the same words, I do not know.

I thought that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> would take some notice of the objections then made. In regard to the words to be added to section 3 of the existing Act, I am not at all particular as to the form, so long as they give to the Minister the power he has claimed to have under this Bill. No one has objected to the Minister having all the power that he wants. The objection is to the offensive way in which the power is expressed in the present clause. The Minister wishes to get rid of all obligations and encumbrances upon land that is compulsorily taken. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so; and in the case of compulsory acquisition the Minister desires to have words inserted, so that the land acquired will be free of all encumbrance. The Minister&#39;s objection is, however, that what is now proposed gives him too much power - more than he wants ; that he would be embarrassed &#39;bv having the land so entirely free from all encumbrance, and would prefer a provision under which some obligation might still attach to it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best&#39;s*</inline> amendment is now drawn in such a. form that the actual terms of the agreement will go into the notification, and the land will be acquired exactly in the terms of the agreement. I think that the Minister will admit that that&#39; amendment will give him every power that he desires to have. If that be so, I think there can be no question as to the desirableness of putting the power in an inoffensive form. </para>

                        <para>- In the&#34; clause as it stands we propose to legislate as to what the Governor of a State may do in pursuance of this measure; and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> says that where an agreement is entered into between the Governor of a State and the Commonwealth Government State Acts shall be set aside. Is not that another way of saying the same thing? Are we to suppose that the States will not know what is intended ? Is it supposed that they will be mollified because we do not say openly what their legal advisers will tell them is the meaning of the clause? It seems to me that we are fighting shadows. The only objection to the clause can be either that it is unconstitutional or that it is unnecessary. The legal .gentlemen opposite do not argue either of these points. </para>

                        <para>- The most that could be said is that, although we have an undoubted right to legislate as to the Governor-General, we may have no power to legislate as to the Governor of a State. That argument, I think, has no force, because the provision is not mandatory, but permissive ; and no objection could be raised by the States on that score. If the States did object they could render the provision valueless by refusing to enter into any agreement ; and, under the circumstances, I think the clause might be allowed to pass. </para>

In the meantime, I point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> that in the Bill there are definitions which are not to be found in the original Act. In the Bill the word &#34;owner&#34; includes a State in respect of Crown lands; and to that extent the words of the amendment, &#34; and with any State where such land is Crown land,&#34; are unnecessary. </para>

I am not in a position, standing here as a Minister, to give the Committee any guidance as to what words might prove to be dangers in the present amendment. I do not say there are dangers, but there may be some difficulty and danger attending the amendment. Personally, as a Minister, I am not in the position to give any information at this stage, and I shall have to consult with those who carry out these negotiations with the States, before I am able to say what may be the exact effect of the amendment. </para>

Indeed, we have a right to expect that amendments of this character shall be revised by the draftsman in consultation with the Minister. Nor is it unreasonable for the Minister to say that he reserves to himself the right to consider the substance of the clause, and whether some alteration in this respect may not be necessary after consultation.

                    <para>. - When this matter was previously before the Committee, I strongly objected to park lands dedicated to the public for purposes of health and recreation, being acquired for the Commonwealth for any purpose whatever. The amendment now proposed merely puts the power to which I objected in a somewhat milder form, and enables the Commonwealth Government, if the course proposed is approved by Parliament, to acquire any of these lands. I hold the view that the people to whom these lands have been dedicated have a greater interest in the matter than has either House of the Commonwealth Parliament. I am being placed in the position of having to accept what the Government now propose or nothing, but I do enter my protest against the Commonwealth making any inroad upon lands dedicated to the public in the different States, for any purpose whatever. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot imagine that any lands which have been dedicated to the public for purposes of health and recreation, should be required for the defence of the Commonwealth. They might be desired for the erection of drill sheds, or the establishment of parade grounds, but. in my opinion, we would not be justified in robbing the public of their heritage in these lands which the States Parliaments have in their wisdom granted to them, merely because we require land for a rifle range. I. know many of the public parks and recreation reserves throughout the Commonwealth, but I do not call to mind any on which it would be necessary to erect a fort for the defence of the Commonwealth. </para>

In the near future it will probably be necessary in South Australia to secure a range for artillery practice. I can quite imagine that the Minister of Defence will say, &#34; It would involve a very large sum if we had to purchase the land required from private individuals, and there is no reason why we should not take land for a range from the National Park.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- Then I take another case. The Minister will admit that we could get a range of ten miles along the beach. I think it is absolutely necessary that the people should be given every possible means of access to the beaches. The Government might propose to acquire the beach from Marina for ten miles southward, and might refuse to allow any person to have access to it. </para>

The first attack we know must be from the sea, and we shall require to be able to concentrate every available man of the field, as well as of the garrison, artillery on the coast. </para>

                        <para>- I recognise that, as an ironclad could not get very near to any part of the coast, a hostile attack or any attempt to land a hostile force would have to be made by a smaller vessel, and in that event the field artillery would be useful for defence purposes. 1 am afraid that we are getting away from the subject, and I repeat that I hold a very strong opinion that land dedicated to the public) should mot be taken from them under any condition whatever. </para>

                        <para>- On a previous occasion, the Committee supported a provision empowering the Government to take over public parks and reserves ; but out of deference to the wishes of those who voted against them, the Government said &#34; Do not shoot ; we will come down.&#34; They have come down a little, but not far enough to suit me. My contention is that the Commonwealth should net be empowered to impinge upon any lands which have been dedicated in a State for the purpose of amusement and recreation. </para>

On looking into the question pretty closely, I found that the park lands of Adelaide were laid out by Colonel Light, and dedicated by the Imperial Parliament, but no provision was made for the reservation of a site for the purpose of a cemetery, or a store for water-pipes, or markets. The only reservation which was made in the dedication was for the purpose of military drill. The site of our present cattle market was taken for the purpose of erecting a barracks. When it was abandoned by the military, it was taken by the corporation, only a short time ago. for the purpose of a cattle market. When they applied for some space there, the citizens spoke with no uncertain sound with regard to taking any more of the park lands. The result was that the Government of the day abandoned the position they had taken up, and so did the corporation, who are looking for land elsewhere. Every one in South Australia is proud that these park lands have been set aside for the purpose of healthful recreation. Under the dedication, the Minister of Defence has the right to drill the Commonwealth troops in the park lands. What more does he want? </para>

                        <para>- A little time ago <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> complained very much about the action of New South Wales in restricting the Commonwealth to a certain area for the purpose of the Federal Capital. What argument did he use then? He said that in Sydney more land was dedicated for the purpose of public recreation than the representatives of New South Wales proposed&#39; to let the Commonwealth have for the site of the Federal Capital. Let the representatives of that State hold on to every inch of land which they possess for recreative purposes, because it will be wanted by-and-by. People will desire to get out of narrow streets like George-street, and go to a place where they will have elbow room. I hope that in Australia cities as large as any in Europe will be built up. Are we not going to leave the citizens with breathing spaces ? Are we going to take their breathing spaces for the purpose of drill sheds or any other purpose? Under this measure park lands can be taken not only for defence purposes, but for any purpose within the scope of the Constitution. Who will say that the Constitution will always be confined to its present narrow limits? There are some members of this Parliament who think that constitutional means should be taken to broaden the Constitution. I hope that in the near future it will be broadened, at any rate in some directions. There are many members of this Parliament who think that it ought to take legislative power to deal with industrial matters. Under this measure a public purpose might be the erection of a soap factory on lands which have been dedicated to the public for the purpose of health. The Minister of Defence also contemplates the starting of a small arms factory. He knows as well as I do that there are many persons who think that coal is contained in the Adelaide park lands, and that on several occasions they have- been tested. It is well known, too, that iron abounds in South Australia. I feel so strongly on this question that I intend to press for a division. If I am- defeated, I shall have done my duty. </para>

                        <para>- No; I only propose to exempt Crown lands which have been dedicated for the purpose of a public park or for the recreation and amusement of the people. I admit that the Commonwealth .ought to have the power to take whatever Crown or private lands it may require on paying fair compensation therefor. It would be impossible to recompense the citizens for any park lands which might be taken. </para>

                        <para>- The country will always be able to protect itself without robbing the poor citizens. The rich man can always get plenty of breathing space, but why should we empower the Commonwealth to take breathing spaces away from those who are shut up in small cottages in the cities? There is no proposal on the part of the Government to recompense the citizens for any park lands which might be required by the Commonwealth. If they had said that, where it was absolutely necessary to resume a portion of park lands the Commonwealth would provide an equal area convenient to the city, the position would have been different. But they ask for power to take away from the citizens a great privilege which they have long enjoyed, without&#39; compensating them for the loss of it. </para>

                        <para>- Only a little while ago a deputation waited upon the Premier of Victoria in reference to encroachments in one or two up-country towns. It is easier for the Government, if it wants land for the purposes of this Bill, to obtain it from a State Government than from private individuals. I have seen a good deal of encroachments upon public reserves. In the old country people have absolutely had to take up cudgels to protect their commons. I trust that the Committee will insist that public lands shall be kept sacred, and that no one, not even the Commonwealth Government, shall have a right to filch them from the people. </para>

                    <para>.- One cannot but sympathize with the sentiments of mv honorable friend who has just resumed his seat in his insistence upon the preservation of lands reserved for the recreation and amusement of the public. But while the honorable senator is quite right ag to the duty of the Parliament to preserve public rights and interests, all that is contemplated by this Bill is that where national interests are greater than the limited interests of the public -of a locality in respect of dedicated land, the greater public interest shall prevail. That is a fundamental principle that not only underlies this measure, but has been recognised during the last century in connexion with the resumption of land in the public interest. I fear that my honorable friend has taken rather a limited view, and has practically confined himself to grievances and hardships of a somewhat provincial character. I am not disputing for a moment the great value of the Adelaide park lands, and the duty that is cast upon public men to conserve them fully. What he has said in that regard also obtains in reference to many other recreation reserves. But .the fact remains that if the interests of Australia are so pressing that even the park lands of Adelaide should be taken, say, for purposes of defence, the greater interests of the Commonwealth must necessarily prevail. The honorable senator overlooks the fact that, this principle is at present the established law of the Commonwealth. He forgets that since the year 1845 there have been consistent provisions in the Acts of the various States, as well as of other portions of the -Empire, enabling public lands to be taken for public purposes. That principle has been recognised almost ever since we had responsible government in Australia. The Parliaments of the States have, not improperly and unfairly exercised their powers. </para>

                        <para>- The law in Victoria is that it shall be competent for the Minister to reserve permanently certain lands. The purposes for which they may be reserved are set out in the tenth section of the Land Act. If it should be found that it is necessary to revoke a reservation for certain public purposes, it is necessary to pass a special Act of Parliament. But my honorable friend forgets that we have to deal with different circumstances. We are dealing with what may be done by the Commonwealth, the laws &#39; of which&#39; are superior to States laws, and the interests of which in certain matters are superior to local interests. If the Commonwealth interest demands that local interests shall - to put it baldly - be sacrificed, the fundamental principle is that the lesser Interest must give way to the greater. </para>

                        <para>- It would be idle, and would increase the difficulties to have to resort to the formidable machinery of a special Act of Parliament for the purpose of doing something of this kind. Mv honorable friend appears to possess but little confidence in the judgment and public spirit of honorable senators when he objects to the clause as it stands. May I assure him that in my opinion there is not a single honorable senator present who d&#39;oes not feel as keenly as he does that recreation reserves should be preserved for the public as far as possible. This clause &#39;provides that if the Government conceives that in the public interest of the Commonwealth a certain area dedicated for the amusement and recreation of the people should! be (resumed, before the actual resumption can be consummated it shall be necessary to come to Parliament. If honorable senators are animated by the same views as is my honorable friend, and the circumstances of a particular case brought before Parliament by the Government are such that the land in question should not be resumed, my honorable friend and others would be able to make such representations as would prevent injustice being done. Nothing could be more reasonable and fair, and nothing could give Parliament a better opportunity to assert its views and insist on regard being paid to its wishes. </para>

                        <para>- The machinery of passing a special Act would be more cumbersome, but the same deliberation can be exercised in regard to a motion, which, however, is not so dilatory. One House can prevent a reservation being revoked if a motio.ni has to be passed. It will be competent for the Senate, for instance, to object to pass such a motion, no matter what the other House may do. </para>

I can state, from experience, that in Victoria there have been reservations of areas of land which have been dedicated to the public in the expectation of settlement springing up in a certain district. In a number of cases it has been found that those reservations are not required for recreation and amusement purposes, and never can be so required within reasonable limits of time. Reservations have been lavishly made, but the expectations originally entertained have not been consummated, with the result that, in session after session, Acts have had to l&#62;e passed revoking them, and even going so far as to sell the reserved areas for the purpose of enabling other land to be purchased in a more convenient position. My honorable friend need not be at all fearful, because, if he is satisfied that honorable senators are as fully alive as he is to maintaining reservations for public purposes, he mas- be sure that the public interest will be respected, and that only the greater public interest of the Commonwealth will justify the resumption of land. The question has been fully debated. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> and myself spoke prominently on the matter ; and made the suggestion that this particular clause should be introduced. The Government have seen fit to submit the clause under consideration ;. and. in my judgment, if I may be permitted to say so. it really answers all the purposes which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> desires, and will conserve the best interests of the public. </para>

                    <para>. - I merely desire to explain why I cannot support the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie.</inline> That amendment goes much further than I ever intended to go. We all recognise the sovereign right of the Commonwealth to take such lands as may ba necessary ; and it would not be proper to interfere with that right so decisively as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> proposes. My idea. was to cause delay - to put a break on the acquisition of certain lands used for public recreation or amusement; and that object has, to a great extent, been accomplished, though not quite so completely as I would desire, by the proposal of the Government. If there is a public outcry after the taking over of lands without due consideration for the- wishes and the welfare of the people - as might verv likely happen, especially in the Defence Department - there will be a&#39;n opportunity for either House to veto any action the Government may contemplate. </para>

                    <para>. - In view of the reasonable proposal m aide by the Government, I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> ought to see his way to withdraw his amendment. Every safeguard now appears to be provided in the Bill ; and to me it is inconceivable that any Government would go out of its way to acquire public lands which were not really necessary for some more useful purpose. In several parts of the Commonwealth, especial lv in the neighbourhood of some of the cities, there are hills, or, it may be, mountains, which at present are used as pleasure resorts, but which might be the very best sites possible for a fort or some other defence structure; and yet, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> the Federal Government, before they could acquire a foot of that land, would have to pass an Act of Parliament. </para>

When the honorable senator says that the Commonwealth Government are taking something away from the people, that is true in a sense, because they are diverting the land from one use by the people to another use by the same people.

The Corporation have not the power to do that which the Commonwealth Government have the power to do, so long as their action is approved by Parliament. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> may&#39; be very well satisfied with the provision offered by the Government. I quite agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> that the more direct way would probably be by Bill, setting forth the particular purpose for which land was sought to be acquired; but, with the provision offered by the Government, I think we may trust each other to be very keen about States interests in regard to lands dedicated to amusement and recreation, and to be very prompt to submit a motion should such reserves be in danger. The interval of thirty days after the notification is laid before the Senate, affords a distinct opportunity for control, in view of the fact that either House may interpose. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> will, I think, see that the object he has in view will be accomplished by the Government proposal. </para>

                    <para>. -I am astonished at the small measure of support which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has hitherto received for his very reasonable amendment. It appears to me that honorable senators have not been keeping their eyes very closely on the action of our various States Governments, or otherwise they would have seen that wherever an area of land, big or little, is required for any public purpose, a portion of a reserve is immediately seized on. That has been consistently the conduct of every one of our States Governments ; and the presumption is that the Commonwealth Government, instead of making a new departure, will follow that extremely bad example. That is a point which, apparently, has not occurred to honorable senators. The Committee, in. my opinion, seem disposed to do what may prove to be an act, or a series of acts, of vandalism. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> professed to be deeply sympathetic with the amendment proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie;</inline> but of what earthly good is the sympathy of the honorable senator? In effect, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best,</inline> says that the amendment is perfectly just and that he believes in it, but he will not vote for it. The honorable senator contends; that the Commonwealth must be supreme; and in that regard we all agree with him. Bearing in mind the tendency of the States. Governments - and I have no doubt the Commonwealth Government will develop exactly the same tendency - to nibble at public reserves, the honorable senator is. perfectly justified in his endeavour to introduce a safeguard. Do honorable senators realize that our city reserves are the lungs of our huge centres of population? What would happen to a man if his lungs were taken out ? He could not breathe, and he would be no longer of any earthly use as a member of Parliament. Take the wind out of a man, and he is of no use here. If we deprive the cities of their lungs they will breed a feeble and degenerate people. I have not the slightest doubt that if the Commonwealth Government wanted land they would seize some of the people&#39;s reserves without any scruple. The probability is that the act would be committed before Parliament would have an opportunity to express an opinion upon it. I again point out that the public reserves all over the Common wealth are every day becoming smaller in area, and fewer in number, and when it is remembered that at the same time our population is increasing, and is likely to continue to increase, the necessity for maintaining the reserves we have must become apparent to every member of the Committee. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> does not intend to deprive the </para>

                <para class="block">Commonwealth Government of the power to take any land which may be required. His object is merely to provide a sufficient brake to prevent precipitate action on the part of the Commonwealth authorities.

We find that legal gentlemen in this Senate are so continually at sixes and sevens with each other that we laymen can only sit afar off, and wonder that lawyers should possess so little knowledge of law. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie&#39;s</inline> desire in this matter is one that should appeal to every patriotic Australian. We have a huge continent, and there is no earthly reason why the States Governments or the Commonwealth Government should ever seize a single acre of a. public reserve. We have over 3,000,000 square miles of country, or about a square mile to every inhabitant of the Commonwealth, and most of it vacant, and that being so, I do not see why we should be nibbling at the reserves&#39; which have been set apart for the health of the people. </para>

                        <para>- No doubt man is prone to evil, and Governments are especially prone to evil, but members of Parliament are elected to see that Governments do not go further wrong than is necessary or desirable. The arguments adduced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> should have some weight with the Committee. The honorable senator has laid it down as an axiom, and it is one with which I agree, that every public reserve should be looked upon as sacred, and should not be invaded, except in case of extreme necessity. These reserves should not be nibbled&#39; at and destroyed as they have been by the various States Governments. We should set a good example to the Governments of the States ; an example of self sacrifice. We should say to them, &#34; We have abandoned our claim to these public reserves, go thou and do likewise. We are the mentors, and you should follow our good example.&#34; Instead of that, I am afraid we are likely to follow their bad example, and so lead the Commonwealth into exactly the same labyrinth of difficulty as that into which the States have been led by the action of the States Governments. I hope that honorable senators will reconsider this matter, and will assist <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> to place the amendment he has moved in the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- I should like to say that I have quite as great a regard for the Adelaide park lands as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has. I agree with the honorable senator, and, indeed, with every other member of the Committee that lands dedicated to the public should be held sacred to the use of the public. I am satisfied that neither the Commonwealth nor any State Government will ever dare to take any lands dedicated to the public unless it is impossible to secure other land that will answer the purpose as well. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has said that in Australia we have over 3,000,000 square miles of land, but that should be a proof that the Government will have no desire to acquire land of such value as the lands of a public reserve unless it is absolutely impossible to get other land any where in the neighbourhood that will answer the purpose as well. If it became absolutely necessary that the Commonwealth Government should acquire any part of the Adelaide park lands for public purposes, ample compensation would be paid to the citizens of Adelaide for the land taken, and it could be devoted to securing land in some other part of the State for the use of the people. I am certain that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> does not mean to suggest that the interests of the people of Adelaide should be placed above the interests of the whole of the people of the Commonwealth. </para>

Honorable senators desire to delegate to others something which they ought to do themselves to-night. If the Commonwealth Government proposed to acquire some of these lands, a motion might be brought forward in opposition to the proposal, and some honorable senators present might vote against it. Others might not be here to vote at all. I say that any such proposal should be given effect to only by fresh legislation, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has agreed with me that that would be the better way in which to deal with the acquisition of these lands.

On the other hand, a Bill would have to pass through its various stages in each House, and the people would be fully alive to what was taking place, and would have an opportunity to express their opinions.

                <para class="block">The idea in cutting out the period of time was to meet every conceivable class of case. In some cases a considerable amount of time has to elapse before the claim can be properly dealt with. Sometimes the notice is received, and fresh information is required before the claim can be sent on. Section 14 of the existing Act provides a time limit of sixty days, within which the claim has to be forwarded for examination. Many claims, however, are of such a character that they can be dealt with in six days. In one sense I have no opposition to offer to the amendment, but it seems to me that in many instances it might be construed by the officers in the Department to mean that they were to have the opportunity, if they thought fit, to wait for something approaching sixty days before they pushed on with a claim. We thought that by taking out the time limit, and substituting the expression &#34; as soon as practicable,&#34; it would expedite all claims in every instance in which they could be dealt with in a very much shorter space of time. If, however, it be the desire of the Committee to introduce a time limit, I shall offer no objection. At the same time. I believe that the introduction of the words, &#34;as soon as practicable&#34; would be calculated to lead to much greater expedition in dealing with every claim. </para>

                    SYMON (South Australia) &#91;8.57&#93;. - I still think that the question of letting the lands of the Commonwealth under mining leases would be very much better dealt with in a separate measure. It seems to me that the clause is rather out of place in this Bill. But as you, sir, have ruled that it can be considered within the title of the Bill, of course I do not place the view that I expressed before against your ruling. Still, I would submit that unless there is some special cause, the question would be much more conveniently dealt with in a separate Bill. Perhaps the Minister knows of some cases in which difficulties have arisen.

                        <para>- If the Minister says that there are cases which require to be immediately met by the clause, of course I shall offer no amendment, because in that view it is really for a temporary and immediately pressing purpose. That is a matter of Executive administration, which, of course, I do not wish in any way to embarrass. </para>

                        <para>- Why should not the short title of the Bill stay as it is? It is really absurd to ask for a reconsideration of the clause, because on the third reading of the Bill the question will be dealt with again. If my honorable friend thinks that there are some supporters of the original clause away - I do not know whether there are or not - let him take a division on the third reading. </para>

                    <para>. - The new clause which has been inserted by the House of Representatives simply enables arrangements to be made, in connexion with the meteorological work that may be conducted in Australia, with the Governments of other countries that carry on similar work, for the interchange of information. When the Bill was introduced in the Senate reference was made by me to the fact that it was probable that proposals would be made for the interchange of such information with India. I had not amongst the papers then in mv possession any official document conveying such an intimation, but some quotations which I then submitted to the Senate from a Sydney newspaper were to the effect that an offer was to be made to the Government of the Commonwealth on behalf of the Government of India. Honorable senators. I think, appreciate the importance of an interchange of such information. There is nothing novel in principle in the new clause. It simply enables us, in connexion with our own meteorological service, to carry out our work with the advantage of the latest information that can be supplied to us from other sources, in return for which, of course, Ave may be expected to reciprocate by furnishing information to those who give us advantages in that respect. I think that there can be no objection to the amendment, and I therefore move - </para>

                    <para>ThisBill has been before Parliament for a number of years, and, therefore, the remarks I have to make, in moving the second reading, will not occupy much time. Honorable senators will recollect that when Federation was under discussion the people of Western Australia showed some anxiety to have their State joined with the eastern States by means of a railway, if they consented to join the Union. The Government of Western Australia made inquiries as to whether the adjoining State of South Australia would be prepared to assist in the furtherance of such a project. </para>

The following letter was addressed to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, who was then Premier of Western Australia, by the Premier of South Australia, on the1st February, 1900 : - </para>

                            Following our conversation as to the possible blocking of the construction of a railway line from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta by the Federal Authority, by South Australia refusing consent rendered necessary by Section 34 of Clause 51 of the Commonwealth Bill, to the construction of the line through her territory, I regard the withholding of consent as a most improbable thing, in fact, quite out of the question.
                        </para>
                        <para>To assure you of our attitude in the matter, I will undertake, as soon as the Federation is established (Western and South Australia both being States of the Commonwealth) to introduce a Bill formally giving the assent of this Province to the construction of the line by the Federal Authority, and to pass it stage by stage simultaneously with the passage of a similar Bill in your Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- I am at present merely giving the history of the events in connexion with the proposal to construct a transcontinental line, and I do not see why I should be subject to these unnecessary interjections. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> will have an opportunity later on to express his own peculiar views, which I have no doubt he will do in that extremely forcible and unique style of which he is master. That letter, of course, was written before South Australia and Western Australia had joined the Commonwealth, and there is no doubt as to the anxiety of the people of Western Australia to ascertain whether they would experience any difficulty or opposition at the hands of their neighbour. Such a line would, of course, have to go through South Australian territory, and without the consent of that State neither survey nor construction could be undertaken by the Federal power. It was mainly on the assurance contained in the letter that I have read, and in the belief - which was shared by the principal politicians at the time - that no trouble would be experienced so far as South Australia was concerned, that the people of Western Australia were induced to join the Union. In my opinion, if that assurance had not been given, Western Australia would not have formed part of the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- Surely the honorable senator has lived long enough to know better than to subject me to this constant interruption. Western Australia joined the Commonwealth believing that she would receive no opposition from South Australia and the rest of the Commonwealth in the matter of a transcontinental line, without which it was felt by the people in the West they could never be regarded as forming an indissoluble part of the Federation. </para>

                            <para>- It is extremely strange that all the interjections come from the representatives of the little State of Tasmania. Of course, Western Australia anticipated that she, with the other States of the Union, would pay her share of the cost of what was regarded as a national undertaking. There is not the slightest doubt that unless we have a transcontinental railway, the western State cannot be said to be properly defended. Of course, we are secure so long as Great Britain has command of the sea; but if at any time that command should be lost, we should, in the absence of railway communication, be unable to go to the assistance of Western Australia in time of invasion or stress. Under such circumstances, Western Australia would be completely isolated, bearing in mind that the deserted, waterless country which lies between east and west would prevent anything in the nature of the marching of troops. </para>

                            <para>- I should like to be permitted to proceed with my argument. At present, I am merely pointing out that for strategic and defence purposes a transcontinental line is absolutely necessary ; and I base the justification of the present proposal on no other ground. Personally, I do not believe that such a railway would pav for a good number of years, but it would certainly pay indirectly by affording an assured means of rendering assistance to the western State should the necessity arise. In the absence of the railway, it can easily be conceived how foreign troops could conquer and hold the western State, always supposing, of course, that Great Britain had lost command of the sea. </para>

                            <para>- In order to just i 1 v the proposed expenditure on a survey, it must be shown that a railway is necessary. I do not contend, of course, that a line to the west should be constructed at once, but there is no doubt that in the immediate future it will be necessary. I have to put forward the strongest arguments possible in order to show that a transcontinental line is required for defence purposes, and then to deal with the proposal that a survey shall be made. Amongst the papers circulated in connexion with this Bill, is a report by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Muir. Departmental Surveyor of Western Australia, who, with a number of other experts, examined a portion of the country over which this line would be taken from Kalgoorlie to the borders of South Australia. The report, which is lengthy, points out that one of the difficulties would be that of water supply. The line which they suggest would be from Kalgoorlie to Eucla, and thence to Tarcoola; and they furnish an estimate of the cost of the construction of the line within the borders of Western Australia. There has been no real examination of the country from Port Augusta northwards, but its nature is known, as far as Tarcoola, and a little beyond. There is also information as to the country in the neighbourhood of Lake Gardiner, should it be decided that the transcontinental line, instead of going <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> Tarcoola, should take the more direct route on the western side of the lake, instead of the eastern side. From the border of Western Australia to a point net far from Tarcoola, on the South Australian side, we know little or nothing of the country. We are informed that a considerable area consists of rolling sandhills, and that in some parts water is found at the foot of those hills. There is a very fair supply of what is known as pot-hole water nearer Tarcoola, and, until the drought drove him away, a squatter occupied a portion of that country with sheep. Honorable senators will recollect that a Conference of the Engineers-in-Chief of the States was held in Melbourne in March, 1903, and issued a report in which they pointed out what they believed would be the cost of a transcontinental line. I desire, by reference to this report, to emphasize the necessity for a survey before proposals are introduced for the construction of a line. Parliament ought to be placed in possession of all possible information of a definite and unmistakable kind, so as to be able to come to a conclusion as to whether or not a line is necessary. I am quite certain that a transcontinental line must be constructed sooner or later, so that in any case the money spent on the survey will not be thrown away ; but, of course, if the information does not warrant the construction now, then the matter may be allowed to rest. The points on which they were asked to submit a report were the probable expenditure in construction ; the probable annual revenue on construction, and for ten years after; the probable annual expenditure in working the line and its maintenance ; the route recommended; the gauge proposed; the probable time which would be occupied in its construction ; the probable present and prospective effect of such railway if constructed; the advisability of constructing the line, and any other matters in connexion with the scheme which they thought should be brought under notice. I do not desire to go into all these matters, because I am not concerned with them in submitting this Bill, but I wish to emphasize the fact that these .gentlemen! admitted that they had not the necessary information to enable them to make a reliable estimate of the probable cost of constructing the line.

                        <para>From the information at our disposal, we formed the opinion that the line can be constructed for the above amount (&#163;5,090,183). The estimate may appear large, but, as already pointed out, many of the data are uncertain - no survey has been made, the waterways have not been fixed, and the cost of water supply is indeterminate. We are strongly of opinion that further and closer examination and partial survey will show that the line can be constructed for a less sum than that named. </para>

Honorable senators are aware that the matter was previously before Parliament, and they are familiar with the whole subject. I submit the Bill for the purpose of asking the Senate to authorize the survey, and I believe that when it is made it will possibly be found that the. estimate of the cost submitted in the report of the States Engineers&#39;in.Chief can be considerably modified. </para>

                            <para>- Verv possibly it will be reduced1 to ,&#163;4,000,000. But whether it is reduced in that way or remains at ,&#163;5,000,000, or is fixed at more than that sum, before Parliament can fairly consider the construction of the line, we must have an accurate survey of the route. I point out to honorable senators that the money expended in the survey proposed will certainly not be thrown away.. The only objection which any honorable senator can offer to the Bill <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> that the survey is not necessary at the present time. But I contend that it is necessary and advisable that the survey should bo commenced at the present time, because it will take a year or two to complete it, and to procure and lay before Parliament the necessary data. &#39; The money will not be wasted, because the survey is an absolute necessity. No .honorable senator car* say truthfully that the line will never be required. It must be admitted that sooner or later it will have to be constructed, and, that being so, why should we not set to work as early as possible to secure the data necessary to place us in a; position to say what the cost of its construction will be? That is- all that honorable senators are asked by this Bill to do. When the matter was under discussion in the Senate last year, an amendment was moved to the. effect that the Bill should not be proceeded with until, by an Act of the State Parliament, South Australia had agreed to the construction of the line. The present Premier of that State has given a direct assurance, in unmistakable language, that he agrees to the survey. All that he desires is that South Australia shall be consulted as to the route and the gauge. </para>

                            <para>- I am aware of that. Some honorable senators asked last year that South Australia should give a. distinct assurance in favour of the construction of the line. /I can quite understand that before the Parliament of South Australia would be prepared to agree to the building of the. line they would require to be assured of two things - the route to be taken, and the gauge to be .adopted&#39; for the railway. The route is a most important consideration, for the State of South Australia, because if the line goes in one direction it will be of very little use- to that State, whilst if it goes in another direction it will be of use. If the line does not traverse the mineral country in .South Australia, it will&#39; not be of as .much use to that State as it will be if it is taken bv way of Tarcoola,, and thus opens up the mineral country/&#39; If, on the other hand, it is decided that the line shall be built on the 4 ft. 8&#163; in. gauge, South Australia might very well say, &#34; No, thank you,&#34; because that would mean the alteration of the gauge of the existing railway from Port Augusta, and the State of South Australia could not afford to make that alteration. </para>

The idea is preposterous. Yet the Engineers-in-Chief recommend the adoption of the 4 ft. 8J in. gauge. That is a proposal to which I do not think South Australia or Victoria will agree. Possibly the only State that would be prepared to agree to that would be New South Wales, where &#39; they already have the 4 ft. 8J in. gauge. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator is quite right. It has nothing whatever to do with this Bill. I am satisfied that honorable senators generally are thoroughly acquainted with the whole of the facts connected with this measure. It was previously before them for consideration, and it has passed the other branch of the Federal Legislature by lange majorities on two occasions. Tt was lost here last year by a majority of only one, and I do ask the Senate on the present occasion to agree to the expenditure of the moderate sum proposer! tor such a survey as will enable proper plans and estimates to be supplied, on which a reliable estimate of the cost of the line can be made when any proposal is submitted for its construction. &#39; </para>
