            <para>- I desire to ask the Minister representing the Minister of Home Affairs, without notice, whether, in view of the desire generally expressed yesterday, during the debate on the Commonwealth Electoral Bill, he will instruct the officers of the Electoral Department to arrange for an exhaustive trial of any voting machines which may be offered for that purpose at some of the more populous polling booths, during the ensuing Federal elections - not, of course, for the purpose of recording and counting the votes, but for the purpose of testing the efficiency of the machines? </para>

            <para>- I understand that for some time the Electoral Department has had under its consideration a number of different voting machines. I think it is quite prepared to apply any test to any machines which may be forthcoming. But I cannot say definitely that it will carry out a test in connexion with the forthcoming elections. I shall bring the matter immediately under the notice of the Department, and if the hon orable senator renews his question on a later date I may be able to give him specific information. </para>

            <para>. - I wish to record a vote against the third reading of the Bill, because I disagree with that portion of it which provides for the maintenance of Sydney Government House. We have been able to get along very well without any legislation other than the annual appropriation for the GovernorGeneral&#39;s residences. I understood last year, when the Estimates were under consideration, that we had seen the last of the vote for the maintenance of a residence in Sydney. Certainly the Minister in charge of the Estimates at that time did provide a loophole through which he might escape by saying that if the matter were ever brought before the Senate again it would  be in the shape of a Bill, but I think that the majority of us believed that we had seen the last of the item. The objections which were being raised in the early hours of the morning to the item would not have been withdrawn, I think, if we had had any idea that, in this session, we should be asked to vote money for this purpose, I believe that, in making this arrangement, the Government is only pandering to the desires of a very small section of the people of Sydney. In my opinion the majority of the people of New South Wales do not expect, and have no desire, that the Governor-General should be compelled to reside in Sydney for so many monthsin each year. </para>

              <para>- There certainly is compulsion, because, if  His Excellency  knows that an arrangement has been entered into by the Commonwealth Government with the Government of New South Wales to pay a certain sum for the upkeep of Sydney Government House he will feel that it is incumbent upon him to reside there for so many months in each year. I desire to support the views of those honorable senators who said that, if there is to be an arrangement of this kind made, it should apply to all the States. What is there about New South Wales that entitles it to special consideration in this matter? What is there in the Constitution to justify this proceeding? It may be said that, until the site of the Federal Capital is selected, we ought to make this arrangement for the Governor-General ; but I would point out to the representatives of New South Wales that the passage of this Bill is likely to delay the construction of the Federal Capital. If an arrangement be made now for the occupancy of Sydney Government House for a term of five years, that, I suppose, will satisfy those persons in New South Wales who think that the site of the Federal Capital ought to be selected as scon as possible; whereas, if we refuse to indorse the proposed arrangement, there will be a renewed agitation on the part of the representatives of that State to have the question of the site settled. Most of those who come from other States are anxious to have the question settled as soon as possible, because we do not want to stay in Melbourne any longer than we can help. I desire to see the question settled, because, when that is done, I shall be so much nearer to Queensland. I hope, therefore, that honorable senators will reject the Bill at this stage. If I get any support, I propose to call for a division. </para>

            <para>. - In my opinion, those who are opposed to the provision of a second residence&#39; for the Governor-General are justified in adopting every reasonable means to secure the defeat of this Bill. From time to time we have pointed out the unfairness of having a residence for His Excellency in a State when there is no necessity that it should be provided. I doubt whether, apart from Victoria, it is constitutional for the Parliament to provide a residence for His Excellency in any one State more than any other. And, in fairness to that principle, we should adopt every means to defeat the proposal to lease Government&#39; House in Sydney. I intend to vote against the third reading of the Bill. </para>

        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir JOSIAH</inline>SYMON (South Australia) &#91;10.46&#93;. - This clause is taken from section 49 of the existing Act. Honorable senators will notice what a strong but necessary power it gives. Before the acquisition of any land, the Minister, and all persons authorized by him, are entitled to enter with the view to ascertainby sinking or taking levels whether the land is suitable for the public purpose intended. In the existing section, there is a provision for compensation being paid. The land so entered may not be taken at all. There may be no acquisition. It is obviousthat the man whose land is entered upon and turned upside down, so to speak, should receive compensation for any damage done. It is better to put this right to compensation affirmatively. The compensation ought not to be limited to the occupier, because an injury to the soil is an injury to the owner. </para>

I think it a pity that the existing Act was altered in this respect, and that two clauses have been drawn in place of one section. Of course, the object of this clause is not that persons employed by the Commonwealth may go upon adjacent land and pitch their tents, but thatthey may occupy it for certain purposes. Under section 53 of the existing Act persons empowered by the Minister may occupy adjacent lands -  so long as may be necessary for the purposes of any works connected with the carrying out of such public purpose, and may make use of the same for any of the following purposes, that is to say :  - </para>

        <para>The real object is to enable the authorities, when they are occupying land which they have acquired, to go upon adjacent land, say, to get gravel for railway construction purposes, compensation, of course, being paid. But clause 23 gives power to occupy adjacent land for any purpose unrestrictedly. It will be better to combine clauses 23 and 24, as they are in the ex- isting Act. Then we should have the benefit of the interpretation which has been put upon these powers as contained in Acts which have been in force in England and other parts of the British Empire. </para>

            <para>- No; it is a clause which is absolutely unrestricted. That is, except for limitations which may be put upon the words &#34; occupy the land so entered,&#34; the persons authorized by the Minister may enter for any purpose whatever. The real restriction is embodied in clause 24; but, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> will see, the two provisions are combined in section 53 of the existing Act, which-, as a whole, defines the limits on the occupation. Otherwise, under clause 23, questions might arise as to whether there was any restriction as to the occupation, of adjacent lands. Tlie intention is that the occupation shall only be for the purpose mentioned in clause 24; but:, whether that be so or not, that clause should be the guide as to the occupation of adjacent lands, not. necessarily the property of the owner of the land which is required, tout the property of some other person. That other person may be very seriously injured ; and we know that, in many such cases, the compensation is quite inadequate to the damage done. I therefore suggest that the two clauses should be incorporated as in the original Act. I also desire to call attention to what seems to be a restriction on the powers of the Commonwealth. According to the Bill, the power is conferred &#34;when any public purpose is being carried out on any land,&#34; whereas the condition in the existing Act is, &#34; when any land has been purchased or taken.&#34; Under the clause the power of the Commonwealth is limited to the actual carrying out of the public purpose; tout it seems to me that there ought to be power to occupy if necessary, as preliminary to the public purpose, not merely the land acquired, but adjacent land. Under the clause the powers of the Commonwealth cannot be exercised until the public purpose is being actually carried out. The object of the Bill is to give the fullest power possible to the Commonwealth ; and it would, therefore, be advisable to adopt the words of the existing Act. I move - </para>

          <para>. - This alteration in the existing law is a restriction on the Commonwealth authorities, who are enabled to exercise the powers conferred by clause 23 only when a public purpose is being carried out on any land. &#39; The power under the present law and the power it is proposed to confer toy clause 23 is to enter upon land - not the land that is required for the public purpose, but land which may be within a distance of 200 yards, which must not be a garden, orchard, plantation, park, or such other property, anc! which must not be nearer the dwelling house of the owner than 500 yards. It is obviously necessary, &#176;in many instances, that over and above the land which is actually required for the public purpose, adjacent land, the property perhaps, of the same owner or of another owner, should be entered upon for the due execution of the particular public purpose. It is well to remember that we acquire the land the moment there is the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> notice of the compulsory acquisition ; and, under the present law, it is competent for us to enter any adjacent land under the conditions I have already mentioned. The Commonwealth, or the Departments which are associated with these works, are not seeking to maintain the extensive powers they have now of entering what mav be called adjoining land. </para>

            <para>- I do not know that the powers have been abused, but this provision is distinctly in favour of the private owner - it leans towards the private owner rather than to the Commonwealth. If we do not want these extensive powers, I do not see that there is any necessity to extend them beyond the limit proposed by the clause under consideration. I do not think there is any necessity for the power to enter adjoining lands of the same or some other owner, and to use them temporarily, unless we enter the land with the actual object of executing the particular purpose in respect of which the land is acquired. That should be the determining point, namely, that we are entering on the land for business, so to speak - that we are entering in pursuit of the particular public purpose. The fact of having acquired or purchased other land for a public purpose should not be the determining fact. I hope that the Committee will allow the clause to stand as at present, and permit the right to enter adjoining lands to be based on the proceedings in the actual execution ofthe public purpose, rather than on the acquisition of adjacent land. </para>

          <para>. - I am rather surprised at the attitude of the Minister, because I understand him to have insisted on the perfect safety of giving the Commonwealth such powers as may, under any circumstances, be requisite, leaving it to the good sense of the officers, under the control of Parliament, to see that the powers are not abused. The difficulty pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> - to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has not referred - is that it might be necessary to carry out a public purpose promptly, and, in order to do so in a case of emergency, the Government might resume the land by compulsory process. The mere fact of the notification in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> places the land in the possession of the Government ; and it might be desirable to enter adjoining lands in order to erect preparatory works. </para>

            <para>- So does the existing section. I do not know whether there is any particular reason why the two provisions should be separate, but I can see none ; and there would be a great disadvantage to the owner or occupier, in that he would have no power to restrict the occupation. The owner would not be able to point out to the foreman or manager over a great body of workmen that while there was power to enter on the land to take stone, gravel, and so forth, there was no power to establish anything in the nature of a village or canteen for the purposes of supplying the men with necessaries.

I do not understand what is meant by the expression &#34;in relation to&#34; land. Draftsmen very often introduce unnecessary words, believing that they give additional force, and that is probably how these words have been introduced into this clause.

          <para>. - These words have been introduced to take the place of a -number of different prepositions which might properly be used in conjunction with the preposition &#34;on.&#34; It might be correct to say that we could take clay &#34; from &#34; the land, or stone, gravel, earth, timber, wood, or material &#34;on &#34; the land, but the preposition &#34;on&#34; will hardly apply if taken in conjunction with some of the powers set forth in the clause. For instance, there is the powerto make cuttings or excavations, and some persons would think that it would be more correct in that connexion to use the expressions &#34;in &#34; the Hand or &#34; through &#34; the land. The words &#34;in relation to&#34; have been substituted for the expression at first suggested &#34; on, in, or through,&#34; and in order to cover all cases, whether the preposition &#34;on&#34; could be properly applied in connexion with the powers granted or not. It would obviously be correct to say that the Minister might erect workshops &#34;on&#34; the land, but that preposition would not foe appropriately applied where the power given is to make cuttings or excavations. It is for these reasons that the words &#34;or in relation to&#34; have been introduced. </para>

My desire, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> has been good enough to recognise, is to make the Bill as clear as possible. The instance to which the honorable senator has referred rnakes it quite clear that the words &#34; in relation to &#34; are not required. If the Commonwealth desired to run a tunnel through land, they would have to acquire it. This clause has no relation to that state of things. It refers to lands adjacent to land acquired by the Commonwealth, and merely enables the Commonwealth authorities not to run a tunnel through those adjacent lands, or to acquire a single foot of them above or below ground, but to occupy the surface, and to take material from it. The authorities of a State, for instance, acquire the land on which a railway &#39;is constructed, but they have the right to go, it may be, 200 yards on either side of the line, and occupy adjacent land for the purpose of taking ballast. That is dealing only with the surface of the land. </para>

            <para>- I am sure that the Minister does not desire 10 use any words which would leave room for a very considerable measure of doubt, but wishes to clearly express the intention of the Legislature. There are many brick-fields and quarries which, for various reasons, are worked periodically. Under the existing law where a quarry or brick-field is so worked it is not necessary that it should be in actual work at the date on which the Commonwealth proposes, for a public purpose, to utilize the land. I think that instead of having the shorter provision in sub-clause 2, it would1 have been much better to follow the lines laid down in section 53 of the present Act.  I  do not propose, unless the Minister is agreeable, to move the adoption of subsection 4 of that section. </para>

            <para>- Yes. What  I  imagine the Minister wishes to exclude is a brick-field  which has been actually abandoned, and in respect of which, when the Commonwealth intervenes, the owner of the land may put forward a bogus claim. I have no sympathy with anything of that kind. There are brick-fields and quarries which, owing 10 the peculiarity of the district, are only worked at certain periods of the year, but which, to all intents and purposes, are live business concerns. If the Minister is agreeable, I shall move the omission of sub-clause 2 with a view to insert in lieu thereof subsection 4 of section 53 of the Act, minus the words &#34; at the commencement of this Act.&#34; </para>

          <para>. - I would prefer that a more definite provision should be made. I entirely agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> that because a quarry or brick-field had not been worked on a Sunday orbecause the proprietor had knocked off work in order to take a holiday, it would be very improper if a representative of the Commonwealth Government could go upon the land and occupy it. I think that the term &#34; commonly,&#34; used in section 53 of the existing Act, is so indefinite that it might lead to endless litigation, that is, if there was any necessity for temporarily occupying any land. In my opinion it would be far better to fix a period, say six or twelve months, within which the quarry had been worked. Perhaps <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> particularly the latter, might suggest an amendment to carry out that idea. I think that they will agree with me that. a provision to that effect would be more definite, because, unless a definition of &#34;commonly&#34; were inserted in the interpretation clause, it would be difficult to gather what was meant. If the provision be left as it is, however, we might define &#34;in actual work&#34; in the interpretation clause, but certainly I think that a more suitable word than &#34; commonly &#39; &#39; might be used. </para>

I would point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> that it would be impossible to lay down any arbitrary rule. Suppose that we were to fix the time at three or six months. On the hills near my residence there are quarries on private lands, from which, perhaps, for six months in the year a stone is not taken. It is generally understood that these are quarries, and the district councils get stone from them. That is often the case with brick works, too, as I know places which, for many reasons, are shut up for a time. </para>

          <para>. - In this clause I observe a departure from the corresponding provisions in the existing Act, no time being set out within which the Minister shall pay rent for the land temporarily occupied. Under the existing law, not only has the Minister to pay within a specified time rent for land temporarily occupied, but within one month he has to pay the value of any crop or dressing which is on the land, or which may be destroyed or rendered valueless by reason of the occupation. That provision is omitted from this clause, arid it seems to me to be extremely un desirable that the rights of private owners should not be clearly expressed. I should. like to hear some explanation of the clause before submitting any amendment, because I assume that the alterationhas not been made in a haphazard way. The two alterations made are, first, that there is no time limit within which rent may be paid., and, next, that there appears to beno express provision by which the Minister shall pay for injury to crops or dressing. </para>

            <para>- It may be that the amendment which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> is to move at the end of the clause will sufficiently protect the rights of individual landowners, but there is the further point that where the Crown takes away the value of a crop which the owner has on his land, and which he could convert into money, there ought not to be an indefinite period within which he shall be paid for it. The Crown should pay promptly where it takesfrom a land-owner that which represents hiscurrent income. More particularly do I express these views in face of the fact that in our extremely economical way of dealing with other people&#39;s money we have limited the amount of interest payable to 3 per cent. Very few people engaged in land occupations can finance at 3 per cent., and&#39; I doubtvery much whether the Commonwealth itself could raise money, including all charges, at that rate. </para>

            <para>- As the interest which would have to be paid by an individual would be at least 31/2 per cent., it seems to me that we are not merely offering no inducement to pay promptly, but are really offering a premium to delay payment. I am sure that there would be nodelay of special purpose, but any one who has had any experience of obtaining payment from the Treasury of a State knows perfectly well that it is one of themost difficult things to obtain the reimbursement of money. Therefore, it is desirable that we should adhere to the existing law, and get a time limit within which payment of the kind indicated shall be made to the owner. </para>

            <para>- In the existing Act the time limit of one month; is left out in regard to rent&#39;. We provide in a subsequent clause that the amount of rent shall be settled by agreement between the Minister and the owner or occupier, or, if no agreement is made, by any Court having jurisdiction to entertain1 an action for compensation. It is obvious that if the Minister enters into temporary occupation, you cannot say that, from his actual entry, one month shall be allowed him for the payment of rent. It might be that he would occupy the property for a long or for a short period ; and it might be that, in other circumstances, he would pay a lump  sum  agreed upon by himself and the other interested parties. It would be inexpedient for us to lay down a hard-and-fast rule that rent should be paid within one month. In the existing Act it is simply provided, so far as rent for temporary occupation is concerned, that it shall be paid half-yearly or quarterly, as the case may require. So far as damage , is concerned, whether it be by way of injury to a crop or otherwise, we deal with compensation generally in Part IV. of the Bill. Clause 32, subclause 1. is very wide and general. Under it, any damage of any kind occasioned to an individual by the occupation1 of his land would be recoverable by him. It reads - </para>

            <para>- No. I think that any damage which might be suffered by reason of the exercise of any of the powers given under Part III. would be properly the subject of a claim for compensation. The damage is not necessarily confined to any alteration in the character or nature of the land. The  removal  of crops, the preven tion of sale, the prevention of letting to a tenant, or anything of that character, would clearly come within clause 32, and be damage occasioned by the exercise of the powers of the Bill in that respect. The persons injured would; be entitled to claim compensation. I think that the amendment indicated bv <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> would be hardly appropriate ; but, if it were necessary, it might be set out more distinctly in clause 29 that rent shall toe paid quarterly or half-yearly, as the case may be. </para>

            <para>- It does not refer to temporary occupation. Section 68 of the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act extends to lands that are injuriously, affected by carrying out works. The provisions, we are discussing do not concern that subject. They refer to the power of temporarily occupying what are called adjacent lands. Therefore, the compensation under these clauses is not that covered by section 68 of the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act. The draftsman has inserted express provisions for damage in Part III. of this Bill, because it is like the compulsory leasing of adjacent lands not more than 200 yards away, for the purpose of being temporarily occupied. These provisions are in the nature of a contract. They have nothing to do with the injury caused, which  would  come under clause 32. There are three cases to be dealt with. There is first compulsory acquisition. Secondly, there&#39; is damage in respect of injuriously affecting other lands by carrying out works. Then there is the third category which we are now dealing with - temporary occupation by virtue of statutory powers to enable us to get material and other facilties in carrying out work. That is mot injurious affecting, and the remedy is practically contractual. </para>

            <para>- Clause 32 does that; but all the other provisions of Part IV. deal with, compensation - that is, the value of the lands taken, and the compensation to be paid to the owner and occupier. It is obvious that, in preparing sub-clause 3 of the clause under consideration, the draftsman had in his mind the necessity to convey to the owner of adjacent lands, whose occupation was interfered with, that he was entitled to compensation. Then we have to go to Part IV., which does not deal with the subject of temporary occupation, in order to see what compensation such owner would be entitled to. I suggest that it would be much better to adopt the amendment I have proposed. </para>

        <para>It will be admitted that it is desirable that we should have all general provisions as to compensation as far as possible included in one part of the Bill. We are dealing in this part of the Bill with the powers of the Minister in relation to lands. One is the power of temporary occupation of what might be called adjacent lands, subject to the payment of rent, with a specific intimation in sub-clause 3 of clause 25 that the payment of rent does not neces- saril v prevent the owner of the land from claiming other compensation. As I have said, he would naturally look to the part of the Bill dealing with compensation to ascertain what are the principles as to compensation enacted by this Bill. He would find general provisions for compensation in all cases of damage, and specific provision in the case of damage resulting from temporary occupation, and&#39; the taking from temporarily occupied land of material of any kind. I think that it is better that the Bill should be allowed to stand as it is, and that those who have to work under it will find that its arrangement is as good as can  be desired. </para>

        <para class="block">The provision of the existing Act clearly sets out that compensation shall be paid, and we are asked to substitute for that positive provision the negative provision of sub-clause 3, of clause 25. When the matter was previously referred to, the Minister agreed that under this sub-clause the owner or occupier of the land would have to fall back upon his common law rights to compensation, and the honorable and learned senator assented to the proposition that it would be better that we should insert a positive statement of what we intend. I think&#34; that it would be much better to adhere to the provision of the existing law, and say that the owner or occupier shall be paid compensation for any damage sustained bv reason of the temporary occupation of his land. I am surprised that the Minister, having &#39;assented to that proposition in the course of this morning, should now find1 himself once more in what I assume to be an inquiring frame of mind. </para>

          <para>. - I enter into this debate with a very great deal of diffidence, because we are discussing a highly technical Bill, but it seems to me that there is an obvious reason for the in sertion of sub-clause 3 of clause 25, in the negative form to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has referred. We have provided in the clause specifically for a form of compensation which does not arise in connexion with the other forms of the acquisition of land. We have provided for compensation iri the form of rent for the temporary occupation of land, and lest it should be assumed that rent is to be the only compensation given, we say, in sub-clause 3, that nothing in this clause shall deprive the person whose land is temporarily occupied, of the right to compensation for damage sustained. Then, in subclause 3 of clause 32, we set out in the most comprehensive form, what are those rights of compensation, and they cover any damage sustained in the carrying out of the provisions of the law. I think that the Bill is sufficiently clear. My experience leads me to the conclusion that it is unwise to specify a particular form of damage, unless we desire that the compensation shall be restricted to that. I feel that I am bound, in the circumstances,  to support the Bill as it stands. </para>

No one desires that, but subclause 3 will become unnecessary if we insert a substantial provision, giving the owner or occupier of the land the right of compensation to which we think he is entitled. </para>

            <para>- Quite 10. It is possible that if we provided for compensation for any damage done or sustained that&#39; would include the value of a crop upon the land, but the word&#39;s I have used are those . which appear in the existing Act. and they are required in order that there may be no doubt that the value of a surface crop and not merely the damage to it shall be taken into consideration. It is, I think,only fair that if the Commonwealth temporarily occupies land on which a crop is growing, we should pay for the whole of the crop and not merely for the portiondamaged. A crop of 40 acres is onething, and a crop in patches is a very different thing </para>

            <para>- Yes ; but we have in this Bill what might be called a complete system of provisions with respect to compensation. These are set out in different divisions of Part IV. I have mentioned the headings of two of these divisions, and division 3 deals with the &#34;determination of &#34; Disputed Claims for Compensation &#34; : division 4 with the &#34; Determination of Compensation where no Claim made&#34; ; division 5 with &#34; Payment of Compensation.&#34; That part of the Bill is, so to speak, complete in itself, and its various provisions are inter-related. It might be dangerous 10 take out of these general divisions some particular classes of damage, and insert provisions dealing with them in another part of the Bill. It is desirable to have all these provisions with respect to damage in the same part of the Bill. There can be no doubt that in the way in which the Bill has been framed, sub-clause 3 of clause 25 is treated in every respect in the same manner as any ordinary claim for compensation, as to the time within which the claim shall be made, the manner in which it shall be prosecuted in the event of difference, and also with regard to payment and interest, and the determination of the claim, when no claim has <inline font-style="italic">been</inline> forwarded, or when, after it has been forwarded, it has not been prosecuted. It is desirable that all these provisions should apply in every instance where compensation is being paid in respect of land actually acquired for a specified public purpose, or in respect of land temporarily occupied. That is, I think, a consideration which will appeal to my honorable and learned friend, who will see that even if there were, perhaps in an individual case, some inconvenience in the fact that the claimant for compensation would have to consult two different parts, yet, forthe general working of the law, it is desirable that it should be free from any ambiguity or doubt that this particular claim for compensation shall be subject to all the general provisions in the several divisions of that part of the Bill entitled &#34; Compensation.&#34; </para>

A difference of opinion very rarely arises, because the persons are reasonable in regard to fencing,, and all that kind of thing. But if an occupier or owner should require a certain fence to be erected, and regard it as necessary, and there should happen to le an honest difference between the persons looking after the work and the owner or occupier, who would settle it? I merely suggest to the Minister that he might look into the matter, and see whether there is provision made to meet such a case. I believe he will find that it would not be included in the compensation for damage. This is included in accommodation work&#39;s, and is determined usually under the pro.cedue of the States by Justices. </para>

            <para>- No. The Minister would say, &#34;I am not going to give damages, because you got your level crossing.&#34; That would not be part of the compensation. The owner would have to go to the tribunal created, bring his claim forward, and apply for an order that the Minister should give the accommodation. It is temporary here, but it would be permanent in the case of a railway. That is a different question from compensation. It is a question of whether there is to be an accommodation work for the purpose of facilitating the convenient use of the owner&#39;s land. I shall be glad if, when we reach a later part of the Bill, the Minister will intimate what provision is made for settling a dispute. </para>

Whatever compensation a State is entitled to get it should receive. In regard to land ordinarily acquired, apart from the Federal territory, there can be no question of rights of dominion, though there mightbe a question of rights of taxation. In regard to the acquisition of a quarter acre block of land it is absurd to talk about rights of dominion. The term is absolutelyillusory.. </para>
        <para class="block">The question of imposing a land tax would have to be determined as a revenue problem. Again, why should not a State get compensation for severance, as well as any individual? Suppose that there was a block ofland upon which. State buildings were erected, or State industries carried on, and that, owing tothe paramount national necessity, the land was taken. Why should not the State get compensation for severance when damage had resulted therefrom? If we place the States, in regard to the compulsory acquisition of lands, in the same position and under the same disabilities as an individual owner, why should it not get the same advantages? It does not seem to me to be fair to give this right to the individual owner, and to take it away from the State. Again, in respect of any injury to other land of the State, why should not the State get compensation therefor? We are all agreed that the State should get no more than the private individual, but there is no reason why any favour should be shown to the latter. </para>

        <para class="block">As honorable senators are aware, the State properties transferred were used before Federation in connexion with Departments of the States. The States did not impose taxation upon their own properties as they did upon the properties of private individuals. We, as the custodians of the revenues now being derived from those properties, are custodians for the Commonwealth, and the States. It would be highly inexpedient, therefore, if a State were to make, in respect of any transferred property - and it is to be remembered that the assessment or adjustment of compensation to be paid to the States is by this&#39; Bill determined - any claim in respect of loss, because they are no longer able to tax the properties, seeing that they never taxed them while under their own control.

            <para>- Yes, in determining the amount of compensation to be paid. When the existing Act was before Parliament a considerable amount of discussion took place upon this subject, and one Thursday evening, if I remember rightly, the debate, which had occupied a long time, caused the then Vice-President of the Executive Council* <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor,</inline> to state that he would bring down some amendments on the following day to deal with that particular class of case. He did so. It is desirable that the States should not be allowed to make any claim in respect of loss of taxation rights over the great bulk of the properties taken over from the States; nor should they claim compensation in respect of loss of dominion or loss of revenue entailed by parting with those properties. There has merely been a transfer from one authority to another by virtue of the Constitution. The same interests are at stake, namely, the interests of the people of the Commonwealth. I do not think that the States will be prejudiced, and the provision will, at any rate, prevent many additional complications being added to the already difficult problem of determining the amount of compensation to be paid to the States on account of properties transferred under section 85 of the Constitution. </para>

          <para>. - The Minister has made the definite statement that the payment for properties transferred by virtue of the Constitution will be determined under this Bill. I hesitate to dogmatize in a matter involving a question of law, but it seems to me that as, under the Constitution, the properties were transferred absolutely, they cannot be dealt with by a Bill which relates only to properties acquired in the manner set out in the Bill. There is a difference between properties transferred, under the Constitution, and those which it isintended to acquire under this Bill. But. there is one matter to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> made no reference. I allude to thequestion of severance, upon which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> dwelt at some length. It seemsto me that the argument is unanswerablethat where an estate fs injured by severanceit should, if it belong to a State, be placed in the same position as the estate of a private individual. Throughout this Bill we group States and private individuals together. We make no difference between them. If we run a road) through property belonging to a State, I see no reason why the State should not receive the same compensation as a private individual would get. I cannot understand the distinction. There is no reason for it. I point to the very ominous silence of the Minister regarding <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon&#39;s</inline> criticism on this point. I trust that the Minister will see the force of it. If he is not able to agree to the elimination of the whole sub-clause, which I think ought to go out, I hope he will agree that the exemption as to severance should be omitted. t </para>

          <para>.. - I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> that reasons should be shown why a State which has suffered loss through severence, should not be compensated, but there is sufficient reason why the words it is&#39; proposed to omit should be retained. We know, as a matter of fact, that the proper principle is adopted&#39; by the States of not taxing State property. In some instances, a State preserves fromtaxation the property of other public bodies. It also preserves State properties from municipal taxation. The principal is a sound one : that there should be no powerto tax the Crown. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir JOSIAH</inline>SYMON (South Australia) &#91;2.0&#93;. - The Minister has pointed out that this provision, is in the existing Act; but honorable senators will recollect that the Act was passed without, in some respects, the consideration which it deserved. I must take some blame for not giving the Act as much attention as. perhaps, I ought, when it came before us as a mere machinery measure. In the second place, the Minister has referred to clause 65, which, however, does not touch the question before us in any way. I quite agree with a good deal of what the Minister has said as to the constitutional position in regard to the acquisition of land. But I point out that this sub-clause is intended to declare that the States shall not be entitled to compensation for the loss of any rights of &#34; dominion, taxation, or revenue.&#34; I think it a mistake to have that provision, because it assumes that a State may, under the circumstances, lose the right of taxation in respect of Commonwealth property. That is a question for the Court to determine; and, no doubt, there have been decisions in regard to municipal rights, and so forth. I do not think we are justified in assuming that a State may lose its right of taxation, and in providing that there shall be no compensation for the loss. It is difficult to decide whether a State would lose the right, but&#39;, if so, we ought npt to take away the right to claim compensation for the loss of a portion of revenue, which is an asset, small or great, of the State. So far as regards the introduction of the word &#34; dominion, &#34; I do not think there should be any compensation in that respect. I am convinced by what the Minister has said in this connexion, but I feel that we ought&#39; to retain -the provision in regard to taxation or revenue. &#34; Dominion&#34; could not be assessed for damages, except in regard to land taken for the Federal Capital, whereas &#34;taxation or revenue,&#34; being money, is susceptible of assessment in some shape or other. With the permission of the Committee, I shall withdraw the amendment, with the view of substituting another embracing simply taxation or revenue. </para>

          <para>. - I was hoping for the moment that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> would permit the words &#34; taxation, or revenue &#34; to remain, because, in my opinion,&#39; they are the crux of the whole question. There may be seme decisions in regard to the power of a municipal authority to tax or not to tax, and to draw revenues from Commonwealth-occupied or Commonwealthowned property; but these decisions hardly touch the difficulty we are trying to overcome by the clause. The question  has reference to properties of the States that have been transferred. Those properties, although they were within the taxable powers of the States have, as a matter of fact and practice, never been taxed. When they have been transferred to the Commonwealth, it would be hardly fair for the States to claim in respect of any loss of a taxable area, so to speak, seeing that they are transferred, not to a foreign body, but to abody of which the States themselves may be said to be an integral part. No doubt, the property was taxable, but, in actual fact and practice, it never was taxed. The other decisions to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> referred have more point with regard to the subsequent taxation of this property, either by a State or by any delegated authority. </para>

            <para>- The fact that it is the property of the Commonwealth takes away the taxable right, but at the time it was handed over to the Commonwealth, and prior to that, it&#39; was no doubt taxable by the State, although, as I say, it never was taxed. If there are any words in the clause that should be preserved, they are &#34;taxation, or revenue.&#34; I hope the honorable senator will not press the amendment, but will recognise that the great bulk of these properties are transferred properties, and that it would considerably complicate the problem, to the advantage of nobody and to the disadvantage of all parties, if we allowed questions of the taxable value and the revenue-returning value of property so transferred, to enter as elements into consideration in adjusting the compensation to be paid to a State. </para>

            <para>- I am afraid, it would, because, one particular State, for instance, might raise the question. It is not to the interests of either the States or the Commonwealth that these should be elements, in the determination of compensation. Is it not better to set the whole question beyond the possibility of any doubt? If we were proposing to take away from a State, or the people of a State, anything to which they were accustomed, we might consider the advisableness of leaving out the words ; but the absence of the provision, especially in view of the fact that it has been the law for five or six years, might lead to the belief in the minds of some persons that it was intended to consider on its merits any claim that might be made by a State for compensation in regard to the two items, or either of them. After all, this would be to a large extent, a matter of bookkeeping, and we should be only opening the door to the complication of the whole question of compensating the States for the properties transferred. I venture to say that seven-eighths would be a low estimate to give as the proportion of the transferred properties compared with all the properties that would now be affected by this clause. I venture tosay, further, that none of the transferred properties in any State have ever been subject to taxation. At the same time, each State had the opportunity, if it chose, to tax its own property and apportion the revenue in a bookkeeping way. </para>

          <para>. - I shall anticipate one argument that the Minister may address to the Committee in reply to the objection I am about to take to paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> of sub-clause 1, by admitting that it is a reproduction of <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> corresponding section in the existing Act. It does not appear to me that paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> will be at all fair in its incidence. I do not propose to refer to the equity or otherwise of the betterment principle, but merely to point out that that principle differs very materially from the proposal set out in the clause. Under the betterment principle, when a public work is carried out, it is followed by a charge on all the lands benefited ; whereas paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> provides that the one individual, to be subject to the betterment tax, shall be the individual from whom the land is resumed. All his neighbours may share the benefit with him - they may even obtain the greater portion of the benefit - and yet they are not to be called on to contribute one iota. Under this clause the Commonwealth, might resume property and never have to pay the owner a single penny. An owner might have several parcels of land in the locality of a proposed public work, and if the Commonwealth resumed one parcel, and determined that, under the operation of the clause, the benefit to the remaining parcels equalled the value of the property resumed, the owner might get nothing. All round, however, a multiplicity of other owners might reap even a greater benefit, and yet would not be called upon to contribute. I appeal to those honorable senators who believe in the betterment principle. They must recognise the inequality of this proposal. If  Ave  desire the betterment principle to be attached to public works, let us so provide, and see that all who benefit are called upon to contribute. I recognise that this provision is in the existing Act; but the very fact that the Minister has introduced the Bill is an admission that the present law is not perfect in many particulars. Amongst its defects is the one I have pointed out, and, if honorable senators agree with me, it is our dutv to remedy such a defect when an opportunity presents itself. I ask the Minister not to allow the fact that this provision is part of the present law to unduly weigh with him, but to consider whether there is not some force in my argument, and whether it would not be possible to draft an amendment more equitable in its incidence. If it is thought desirable to adopt the betterment principle, let us do so, but, otherwise, let us agree to the elimination of paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c.</inline></para>

          <para>. - The alternative suggested! by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> is, I think, surrounded with a certain amount of difficulty. In estimating the compensation to be paid we propose to consider the value of the land acquired for public purposes, the damage sustained by the owner as the result of the severance of his land, and, thirdly, the enhancement in value of the other land held by ihe same proprietor, which is, of course, set against the other considerations in determining the amount of compensation to be paid. That is the principle adopted not only in the existing Act, but also, I think, io some of the States Acts. If my recollection serves me .rightly, it is the principle adopted in Tasmania, in connexion with the resumption of land, if not for general public purposes at least for the construction of railways. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> points out that, although the balance of the land retained bv an individual from whom a portion of his land is acquired under this Bill may be enhanced in value by the construction of the public work, the value of the lands in the vicinity in the possession of other persons from whom no land has, been acquired! bv the Commonwealth may also be enhanced in value in the same way. The honorable senator suggests that the question of betterment .shall be determined, not only in relation to the particular individua.1. a portion of whose land is acquired, but in relation also to every owner of land whose property is enhanced in value bv the construction of the public work. I doubt very much whether we could do what the honorable senator proposes in this Bill. We have power under the Constitution to make laws with respect  to - </para>

        <para>The acquisition of property on just terms from any State or person for any purpose in respect of which the Parliament has power to make laws. </para>
        <para class="block">It might be open to question that what the honorable senator suggests would be just terms. It isverydoubtful whether it is within our power in such a measure as this to impose any conditionson persons other than those from whom we acquire property. Tor instance, A, B, C, and  D  are adjoining owners, of land, and for the purpose of the illustration I assume that the value of the land owned by each is&#163;1,000. Under this Bill we take a portion of A&#39;s land, valued at&#163;250, and the improvement in value of the rest of his land due to the construction of the public work is estimated at&#163;150.In estimating the amount of compensation we shall pay him for the land we take we must take into consideration the extent to which the land he retains is enhanced in value by the construction of the public work, and we deduct that from the value of the land taken, to which, of course, there is added the value of the damage occasionedby the severance of the land. No land is taken from B, C, or  D,  although the construction of the public work enhances the value of their property. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> suggests that we should not deduct from the compensation paid to A any amount in respect of the enhancement in value of the remainder of his property, since we do not propose to do the same to meet the enhancement in value of the properties held by adjacent land-holders. I do not know that we should hesitate in the matter.It might be that, in the case I have suggested, under this measure, A- will be placed in a less fortunate position than his neighbours, but are we to say that we shall not give ourselves credit in the individual transaction with which we have the power to deal for the additional value which the construction of the public work will give to the balance of the land held by the person from whom we take the land? I doubt very much whether we have the power to go beyond that individual and impose conditions on third or fourth parties- </para>

I do not know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> would favour legislation of that character. At present we are concerned merely with the purposes of this Bill. I say that we should not go by this particular clause, and wait until some systematic legislation is passed in regard to betterment generally, but that in this measure we should apply the betterment principle in every transaction with individuals where the effect of a public work is to enhance the value of land retained by them. I think that is a fair and reasonable principle, and it has certainly been acted upon in the past by some of the States in connexion with acquisition of land for railway purposes. </para>

          <para>. - I will put this case to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> : Suppose that in resuming land we take a strip along the border of a man&#39;s property which might be worth ; &#163;100, whilst the block from which it is taken might be worth some thousands of pounds. It is clear that the actual improvement in value of the balance of the property due  to  the construction of the public work might amount to considerably more than the actual value of the strip of land taken. What are we to do in such a case as that? Are we to pay the owner the value of the strip taken, without taking into consideration the value added to the rest of his property? </para>

            <para>- Quite so, and let me put another case to the Minister. The owner of a block of land worth&#39; ^1,000 is, say, one of a group of owners of land in the same locality, each of whom owns- a block of the same value. The Commonwealth resumes one-half his land and for that should pay him ^500. The effect of the public work carried out is to double the value of all the lands within a certain radius of it. Under this provision, in such a case the Commonwealth would take half of the first man&#39;s land and would pay him nothing for it, whilst it would make the adjoining owners a present of ^1,000 each. </para>

Where the Commonwealth steps in. to do anything for the commonweal, it should not throw upon any one individual the sole burden of the operation. It seems to me that it would be far better to omit this provision, and if the Ministry think that the betterment principle is of so much value, they should introduce a separate Bill as they have power to do under the Constitution, to provide that wherever a public work is constructed the betterment principle shall apply to all property, the value of which is enhanced by the construction of the public work, is propose, as is done here, to tax one man and exempt others who are equally benefited by the construction of the public work, is unjust, and is entirely opposed to the principles on which we are supposed to legislate. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir JOSIAH</inline>SYMON (South Australia) &#91;2.2*8&#93;. - With <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> I do not see how it would be possible under this Bill to take from owners of land, none of whose land is acquired, the enhancement of value which the carrying out of a public work would give them. A special mode of taxation might be devised which would enable that to be done,, if we were introducing a complete system to give effect to the betterment principle, with which I agree. Where land isimproved in value by the construction of a public work, that increase in value should not go entirely to the owners, but: the whole or some portion of it might very well go to the State. The objection tothis provision, however, is that it introduces, a lopsided kind of betterment under which, where the half of a man&#39;s land was taken,, and by the construction of the public work, the balance was improved in value to theextent of the value of the half, he would&#34; be compelled to make a present to the Commonwealth of the land, whilst tenadjacent owners of land, who might have their properties doubled in value, would&#34; escape. That, on the face of it, is unjust. We should not do an injustice by attempting; to introduce a partial betterment system by which one land-owner would have to pav something whilst his neighbourswere benefited at his expense, without contributing anything to the Commonwealth.. A similar provision is contained in the existing Act, but, like many other provisions, it was not sufficiently considered, and it seems to me that it is&#39; not desirable that <inline font-style="italic">it</inline> should be re-enacted in this Bill. </para>

            <para>- It might. On the other hand, it might happen that the land not taken had had itsvalue enhanced fivefold. Yet it is proposed to compel the man whose land has- been taken to present it to the Commonwealth for the benefit of neighbouring owners. I am entirely in favour of the betterment principle, and I am glad that it is being introduced into State laws with regard to State undertakings. But I think it is a bad thing to attempt to introduce it in a one-sided way. It ought to be made equal in its application all round if that can be done. It cannot, however, be done in this Bill. Therefore, I think it is unfair to the man whose land has been taken that he alone should be singled out as the person who is to make a compulsory present to the Commonwealth, simply because his land has been enhanced in value. Then let us take the other side. Suppose that land has been depreciated in value, why should not that be considered ? </para>

            <para>- T think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> is mistaken. In the case of railways it would verv seldom occur, but that is not what the Commonwealth has to deal with. It has to establish batteries for defence purposes, and that would mean a very serious depreciation in the value of a man&#39;s land. I am quite sure that my honorable friend would not like a battery or rifle range to be placed within a few hundred yards of his front door. The existing law is limited to the enhancement in value o&#39;f other land adjoining the land taken or severed therefrom. That is a right principle. But it would be a monstrous thing to deduct the enhancement in value of other land which a man might have in a place half-a-mile away. Suppose, for instance, that a railway station were put near a man&#39;s land in one place. That land might be enhanced in value; but it would be very unfair to make an assessment of the improvement in the value of . his other land, situated halfamile away, in consequence of the erection of that railway station. I admit that it is a very difficult and complex question, and I think it is a pity that the provision in the existing Acf should be altered. I did not hear what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> said, but Tor these reasons I am against paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> altogether, because of its fragmentary character. If it is to be retained, I shall propose the insertion after the word &#34; enhancement.&#34; of the words &#34;or depreciation,&#34; and the insertion after the word &#34; land &#34; of the words contained in the present Act, namely, &#34;adjoining the land taken or severed therefrom.&#34; If it be part of the same land, then it might be only a fair thing that the enhancement should be taken. If the Committee are agreed that one man is to be singled out to be a sort of scapegoat, and to the advantage it might be of adjacent owners, at an,r rate, it should only relate, as the Act limits it. to land adjoining the land taken or severed therefrom.

            <para>- The arguments have been so forcibly and- clearly stated that surely it is superfluous for me to reiterate them. I think that the Minister must see the force of the position which has been stated by Senators Millen, Walker, and Symon. What is the position? If the Commonwealthacquire a certain area of land worth, say, <inline font-style="italic">&#163;50,</inline> and the damage causedby the severance of that portion from adjoining lands be estimated at &#163;10, theduty of the Commonwealth should be to pay the owner&#163;60. Then if the land of that man and of other persons in the neighbourhood has been increased in value by the expenditure of public money, a betterment tax ought to be imposed which would apply to each owner whose land had been increased in valuethereby. If, however, it were done in the way proposedby the Bill, it wouldsimply penalize one man and allow a number of men to escape scot free. Let us take the instance given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> of a man who had an area ofland worth&#163;1000. If the Government took half the area, valued at . &#163;500, and the value of the other half were increased to , &#163;1,000, the Commonwealth would set that increased value against the&#163;500 which it ought to pay the owner for the area resumed, and give him nothing. Suppose, for instance, that originally his land comprised1,000 . acres. At the end of the transaction he would have 500 acres worth &#163;1,000. Take the case of his next-door neighbour, who had an area of land worth &#163;1,000.  His  value would be increased to &#163;2,000, and yet he would pay nothing. Is there anything fair or reasonable in that? I would ask the Minister to eliminate paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> and sub-clause. 2. </para>

          <para>. - I trust that the Government will not accept the amendment. I think we ought to look at this question from a practical point of view. What is the most likely kind of case to which, this clause would be applied? I suppose that more land will be resumed by the Post and Telegraph Department than by any other Department under the Commonwealth. Say that the Government proposes to &#34;take an area in a country town for the purpose of building a post-office. Those who have had any experience of country towns know that the determination of the site of a post-office determines the centre of the town, and therefore affects the value of land in the vicinity. The farmers come for their letters to the post-office, and&#39; the store which is nearest becomes the principal store in the town. In fact, the whole business of the place centres around the post-office. What does the determination of the Government mean? Suppose that there is a block of land half-an-acre in extent, and that the Government say to the owner, &#34;We want a quarter of an acre of your land for a post-office site.&#34; Take the value of the land before the determination is made as &#163;100. The Government, we will assume, say &#39;to the owner, &#34; We will give you <inline font-style="italic">&#163;50</inline> for a quarter of an acre, and we estimate that the damage sustained by severance will be <inline font-style="italic">&#163;10&#34;</inline> That is to say, the Government give credit to the owner for <inline font-style="italic">&#163;60</inline> for half his block. But  there is a contra account in the increased value given to the quarter of an acre retained by the owner. We will assume that that added value amounts to ,&#163;10. The owner1 of the land has been compensated to the extent of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;50,</inline> and is still in the possession of a block of land worth. &#163;60. If the Government take the whole block there is no factor to be considered except the value of the land taken. The owner gets &#163;100 in money, and the transaction is at an end. He has no cause to complain. Under this Bill, if half his property is taken, he will be treated equitably and fairly, allowance being made for the damage caused by severance. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> took a most unlikely case. He assumed that the Government would! take half a man&#39;s farm. What would they want half a farm for? I admit that to carry out the principle &#39; to the extreme of justice, something should be taken from the owners of property in the district on account of the added value given to their land by the building of the post-office. I agree with that principle because I advocate a tax on land values. But we have to deal with this matter in a practical way ; and those whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> proposes to assist in striking out this clause would be the last to assist him in getting back from the land-owners the increased value given to them by the. erection of public buildings. </para>

            <para>- We are not singling out an individual for special taxation. We are doing no injury whatever to the man whose land is taken. He is paid for his property. The example given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has only to be looked at for its improbability to be realized. He assumes the case of a farm worth ^1,000, the Government taking one half and paying, ,&#163;500, and the other half being increased in value to the extent of ^500. But can we imagine any public work that is likely to be carried out in a country district having the effect of increasing the value of land to such an enormous extent. There is no public work which the Commonwealth is likely to undertake which would increase the value of land in the district to the equivalent of the value of the land taken for the purposes of the work. The effect of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart&#39;s</inline> proposal is that not only will he not achieve what he has in view - the carrying out of the betterment principle - but he will also strike out the measure of justice which this proposal contains. We have not only to consider justice to the land-owner, but also justice to the community ; and what right has <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> to say that the individual whose land is taken shall reap the value given by. the community in erecting the public work ? The position of the land-owner in the illustration which I gave will be this : He has, in the first instance, a block of land worth o&#163;i 00. He is paid <inline font-style="italic">&#163;50</inline> for one-half of it, .&#163;10 for severance, and the remaining half goes up in value &#163;10. The very fact df the erection of the Commonwealth public work gives him .&#163;120, whereas formerly he had only <inline font-style="italic">&#163;100.</inline></para>

            <para>- We cannot get at the neighbouring land-owners by means of this Bill. But because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> cannot get at them, he would enable a person, from whom land is purchased, to reap all the advantage from the community. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon&#39;s</inline> amendments are necessary, because, if it is just to take into account the enhancement in value, it is ako just to take into account the depreciation in value of any property. </para>

          <para>.- I cannot conceive of a case where an increase in the value of broad acres would be occasioned by the erection of a Commonwealth public building. It is only railways which enhance the value of broad acres. They cannot be affected by building a post-office in a country town. Such a work would improve township sites, but broad acres  would be unaffected. I have known broad acres to be increased in value  threefold  by a railway. Of course, there is a selfish propensity on the part of people whose land is increased in value by railway construction. If a railway goes to a township, and stops there, the local residents will want their town to be a terminus for all time. The question is this: Say that the man whose land is taken has a township block. Why should the Commonwealth give that man more than he is entitled to? He is not made any poorer by the Commonwealth taking it, and he is not entitled to be made rich at public expense. Because we cannot get at B, C, and D, that is no reason why we should put a lump of sugar into the mouth of A. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> and I shall not support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart&#39;s</inline> amendment. </para>

          <para>.- I deem it to be my duty to oppose <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart&#39;s</inline> amendment. I am in accord with the principle of the Bill. I recollect that some thirty years ago in Tasmania we first had to do with the betterment system in connexion with our main line of railway between Hobart and Launceston. If it is desired to carry it further than it has yet been carried in the matter of railway construction, that can only be done byadopting the system of not building a railway until the people of the locality affected form themselves into a trust, and contribute in proportion to the increase in value of their land. But we cannot apply that principle in connexion with the erection of postoffices and other Federal buildings. It may become important if we ever undertake the construction of a railway to Western Australia. Then we shall probably have to say, &#34; If we are going to build this line, the land must be given to us free &#34; ; and the Western Australian Government will have to pass an Act applying the betterment system. But we cannot apply that principle now. I have been struck with the verv terse way in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> has dealt with the matter. Because we cannot do ample justice to half-a-dozen people, is that any reason why we, ns trustees for the public, should pay more for land than property-owners are entitled to? The system proposed by the Bill is just as between the land-owner and the taxpayer. If we take a portion of a man&#39;s property, and benefit him almost to the extent of the value of the land taken, he is not entitled to anything more than the fair price. </para>

Let us say that the quarter-acre is worth. .&#163;20, that the .Commonwealth resumes ^10 worth of it, and that the remaining portion of the allotment is, by the building of the post-office or other buildings, increased in value by 50 per cent. The half of the allotment resumed is, as I say, worth ,&#163;10, and the half that is left over is increased in value to .&#163;15; and, thereupon, the Commonwealth says, &#34; We have increased the value of your land by .&#163;5, and, therefore, we shall pay you only ,&#163;5.&#34;&#39; The owner of the land finds that, instead of possessing, a quarter of an acre worth .&#163;20, he has an eighth of an acre worth ,&#163;15 and &#163;10 in his pocket. </para>

            <para>- I do not say that we can deal with them, but  surely  we will not single out an individual simply because he is unfortunate enough to be the owner of the allotment which the Commonwealth desires? Why should he be penalized? All I ask is that he should be placed on  exactly the same level as the other owners. What I now desire is to show the position of those other owners. Each of the holdings has, by the erection of a  public building, been increased in value by 50 per cent., so that each owner finds himself in the possession of land worth ^30, while the man on whose land the building has been erected has only an eighth of an acre, worth &#163;15, and &#163;10 in his pocket. If I had to choose whether a post-office should be built on my land or the Land of the other fellow, I should say that bv all means it should be on the other fellow&#39;s land. What I claim is that each person whose land is increased in value should pay in proportion to that increase. There ought to be no differentiation between the man whose land is taken and the man whose land is not taken. The Government ought to pay the market value for the land, and tax the owner on the increased value; that is the only just and moral way. </para>

I do not desire to penalize any man in the way proposed by the Bill ; and so long as I occupy a seat in this Chamber I shall never be a consenting party to legislation of the kind.

Let me go further with my argument. Suppose the Stale Government imposed a betterment tax, the man whose land had been taken, and who had already been penalized by the Commonwealth Government, would be called upon to pay to the State as well as. to the Commonwealth, while the other owners would pay only to the State. The poor wretch who had had the misfortune to own the particular corner desired&#39; by the Commonwealth Government would pay double. </para>

After a time, the Queensland Government desired to construct a railway to Bolimba, and the line was constructed through this property, leaving such a narrow strip betweenthe railway and the river that the river frontage had to be sold for a song, while the balance of the estate, which was valued at ?30,000, has, up to the present, not realized ?8,000. All that the Queensland Government had the impudence to offer as compensation for severance was ?600 ; and on resorting to arbitration the owners received only ?1,200. </para>

            <para>- I dare say, when I have agreed with the honorable senator. I am inclined, to think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has been solong, at his farm, near Rockhampton, that he has come to regard himself as a land-owner, and he fancies that theremay be something in the Bill which will adversely affect him. The honorable senator&#39;s argument when boiled down means that if the Government take from a man half his land, they should not consider the enhancement in -valueof the remaining half, because the value of the land of other people, who cannot be reached1, has been increased in greater ratio. In other words, the local land-owners should get the whole of the benefit of the public work. </para>

            <para>- That is the sum and substance of the honorable senator&#39;s argument. When framing laws of this kind, all we can do is to act as fairly as possible; and if other people benefit to a greater extent than do the individuals with whom the Government are doing business, we cannot help it. </para>
