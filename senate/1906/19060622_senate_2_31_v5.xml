                    <para>. In Committee, yesterday, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> succeeded in getting inserted in clause 3 an amendment providing that not only the Government Meteorologist, but all such officers as may be required, shall be appointed by the Governor-General. Rightly or wrongly, Parliament adopted! the system of placing all public servants under the Public Service Commissioner. If we leave the appointments to be made under this Bill entirely in the hands of the Governor-General, every officer of the Department, down to a mere recording clerk, will be outside the jurisdiction of the Public Service Commissioner. </para>

                    <para>. - In moving the amendment, as I did, on the spur of the moment, I certainly had no desire that the appointment of these officers should be taken out of the hands of our properly constituted authority, namely, the Public Service Commissioner. If the effect of the amendment be as suggested, although I do not think it is, I shall certainly join in asking, as I believe the Minister himself would ask, for an opportunity of remodelling it. But if he, in his reply, can give an assurance that the danger indicated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> is an imaginary one, then it will give satisfaction to every one in the Chamber. </para>

                        <para>- If the Governor-General proceeds to exercise the power which is given by this Bill, he will act in conformity with the provisions of the Public Service Act and regulations thereunder. He will not go outside those limits. That is the law of the land in regard to appointments to the Public Service. The Bill contains a provision that the Governor-General shall have power to appoint a Government Meteorologist, and in order to overcome any doubt which might exist in the mind of any one as to the provision being intended to be limited to the appointment of a single officer certain words were inserted. To my mind it does not matter much whether they are in the Bill or not, but it certainly assures honorable senators that it is not intended to confine the provisions of the Bill simply to the appointment of one central officer, who shall be dependent upon States services. I would oppose as strenuously as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> a proposal to give to the Governor-General personally or to the Governor-General in Council the power to appoint any officers to any branch of the Public Service in a way not in accordance with the provisions of the Public Service Act. </para>

I refer to the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll,</inline> whose troubles were inquired into bv a. Select Committee of the Senate some two years ago. Being in Queensland recently, I saw something of this officer. He is now engaged as an instructional officer in the Queensland branch of the Defence Force. I not only saw him, but I saw Lieut. -Colonel Rankin, the officer commanding one of the regiments to which MajorCarroll is attached for instructional purposes. It will; be, I am sure, a satisfaction to the members of the Senate who espoused&#34; the cause of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> in the interest of their view of what was right, to learn that he is spoken of in very high terms indeed by those under whose command he is acting, as doing excellent service, and&#39; giving every satisfaction in the position which he has been allotted. I think it is only fair that I should make this statement, because it has very recently come to my notice. I am sure that what I have said Wil be heard with; as much satisfaction by the members of the Chamber as I feel in making the statement. </para>

                <para class="block">There is <inline font-style="italic">no</inline> necessity for me to make a long, speech. It will be remembered that the provision which Parliament made for carrying, on the work of the Commonwealth will cease at the end of this month, and that further provision is necessary if we are to pay accounts after that date. This is simply a Bill to enable the Treasurer to pay the expenditure incidental to the month of July. It appropriates the s;um of ,&#163;459,064 for a month&#39;s service, or nearly exactly the same amount as was voted last year. It will be sufficient for the purpose. It may be thought by some honorable senators that, as the ordinary public servants are only paid once a month, if we were to pass the Bill towards the end of next month it would* be quite sufficient. But the Treasurer informs me that there are a number of persons engaged in the Commonwealth who are paid weekly, and a still greater number who are paid fortnightly, and that therefore it is always necessary to have a. Supply <inline font-style="italic">Bill</inline> passed as early as possible in July, or else the payments could not be made. As I propose to ask the Senate to- adjourn to the nth July, the Bill has been introduced at this stage. </para>

It has now been agreed that public tenders shall be called for. Until they have been received and dealt with, we cannot tell whether we shall be justified in Intrusting the work to a caterer. If no tender is accepted, some other arrangement will have to be made. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to take _ this opportunity of saying that I believe the opinion of a great many Members of Parliament in each branch of the Legislature, I think I may say of the Parliament as a whole, is that it is extremely desirable that the parliamentary refreshment-rooms1 should be made to pay. Members of Parliament do not wish to have a deficiency which the country is called upon to make good. It is one of those very unpleasant things which create an entirely wrong impression outside, and lead the public to believe that Members of this Parliament are getting perquisites to which they are not entitled. I believe that every Member of Parliament ought to pay for what he gets at the refreshment-rooms, and I welcome the announcement that the House Committee is endeavouring to devise means to make them self-supporting. </para>

                        <para>- I do not wish to be misunderstood. Perhaps, for the moment, I forgot that ray words will be reproduced where my meaning will not be apparent. Therefore, I wish to say quite clearly that no one in this Parliament obtains anything at the parliamentary refreshment-rooms for which he does not pay, and that, in fact, he pays more here than he would have to do outside. Nevertheless, the fact remains that there is a deficiency which the taxpayers have to make good. I recognise gladly that the House Committee is addressing itself seriously to the task, and if no other means can be devised, I suggest that the tariff should be raised until the rooms are enabled to be carried on without loss. </para>

                    <para>. - - I can assure honorable senators that the House Committee, during last session., and at the commencement of this session, has devoted itself seriously to the consideration of the question of the deficiency in the management of the parliamentary refreshment rooms. The subject has engaged our earnest attention. There is one phase of the matter which has not been mentioned, and which I think is not understood. It appears to me that it will be absolutely impossible to prevent a loss occurring in the management of the refreshment-rooms when we have to keep up a certain staff to provide meals on an average of three and a half days per week, whilst wages have to be paid for the full week. So far as concerns the purchase of supplies on the one hand, and the revenue derived from the sale of meals on the other, there would be a credit balance if it were not for the cost of management. The loss is involved in the payment of the cook, the waiters, and the necessary staff. The members of this Parliament may as well make up their minds that so long as the refreshment-rooms are maintained, and so long as we have what I may describe as a teetotal Parliament, or a Parliament a large number of whose members are teetotalers, a loss is bound to occur, for the simple reason that no profit is derived from the bar, which in other circumstances would be one of the largest sources of revenue. Personally, I should be quite satisfied to see them done away with altogether, and let Members of Parliament go outside for their meals. If, however, it is determined to maintain the refreshment-rooms we must make up our minds that there is bound to be a deficiency, and must put up with whatever blame the public casts upon us on account of it. I am convinced that there is no private caterer who, under the circumstances, could prevent a loss occurring. </para>

                        <para>- Let Let me put the facts to honorable senators. We have to cater for in Members of Parliament, only a. portion of whom take their meals here. Those members only take their meal&#39;s here for about half the&#39; week; but any caterer would have to pay the wages of the staff for the whole week. The revenue derived from the sale of meals and liquors balances the expenditure, and we should have a credit balance if it were not for the necessity of paying the staff for a whole week when their services are actually required for only one-half the week. </para>

The Committee has done its best to make the ledger balance, but so far has always been unable to do so. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> has told us that the State Parliament, when it occupied these buildings, was able to run the refreshment -rooms in a better manner. But as a matter of fact we have in charge of the refreshment-rooms the same manager as the State Parliament had, and he has assured us over and over again, and has given us details in proof, that the State Parliament was actually in a. worse position than we have been. The only difference arises from the fact that there was then a larger revenue from the bar than we have been able to secure. We have a very small income from the bar. To that is largely due the fact that we have not- been able to make the lederer balance at the end of each session. There is only one way to avoid a debit balance, and that is to shut the place completely down. So&#39; long as we maintain the refreshment-rooms there is bound to be a deficit. </para>

                        <para>- There is not a parliamentary refreshment-room in Australia that is paying. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefehas</inline> mentioned, the trouble is that we only keep the rooms open for three days a reek whereas we have the full expense of maintaining the staff for the seven, days. There is no doubt that the rooms would be run at a profit if they were utilized every day in the week. I am convinced that they cannot be conducted better than they have been1. Unless we are prepared to make good a deficiency, I can see no alternative but to close the refreshment-rooms. It has been suggested that we should raise the tariff. That has been tried, and it was a/ failure. As soon as we raised the tariff many members went elsewhere, and consequently the loss was greater. </para>

                    <para>. - I think that a discussion like this will have a good effect, because, undoubtedly, there is an. impression outside that the Members of this Parliament obtain some perquisites to which they are not entitled by reason of their membership. It is just as well that it should be thoroughly understood that we have to pay for everything which we obtain at exactly the same schedule of prices as any one would pay at an ordinary refreshment house in Melbourne. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> has asked why we cannot run a parliamentary refreshment-room ais well as a private individual could conduct such an establishment? The answer is perfectly obvious. In the first place the two Houses of this Parliament adjourn for dinner at the same time. There are iri. members, or a lesser number, who all want their meals simultaneously. That involves a large staff of waiters being employed. In the second place, only two meals per day are supplied, which makes a great deal of difference in regard to the staff, the waiters being paid so much per meal, instead of being engaged by the week or month. In the third place, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator 0!</inline> Keefe has pointed out, we have meals on only three or three and a half days during the week. These facts dispose absolutely of the suggestion that members of this Parliament obtain some advantage, in view of the fact that the refreshment-rooms are managed at a loss, whereas a private individual could conduct them at a profit. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know that it was so intended. The object of the refreshment-rooms is the convenience of members. We have to adjourn for an hour for lunch or dinner, and in the stress and hurry of legislation, it is necessary for us to have rooms close at hand where meals can be obtained. Verv few members, I think, devote the whole of the hour to the meals, or to friendly intercourse, because they may have authorities to consult in the Library, or notes to arrange in view of a forthcoming debate. Last year, I understand, the refreshment-rooms showed a loss of something like &#163;800; but I ann prepared to say that that is less than the loss shown under a similar head in most of the States Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- I think that is so. In the Victorian Parliament, I understand, the extra cost of the refreshment-rooms amounts to something like ^1,000 per annum. However, one great reform has been effected in connexion with our own refreshment-rooms. I was not a member of the House Committee at the time, but it was decided to close the rooms, altogether during the recess. The keeping of the rooms open at that period of the year was a great source of expense;, but, in consequence of the reform I have mentioned, I believe that this year the loss will be reduced by, at any rate, one-half under ordinary circumstances. The question has been asked why the tariff is not raised. But when the tariff was raised on a former occasion, the result of the experiment was that members went elsewhere for their meals. This seems to be a Parliament, the members of which are not only teetotal, but also devoted to plain living and high thinking; and they, wisely, decline to pay a high price for the plain food they require. It has been decided by the House Committee to call for public tenders, under the conditions which obtain here for meals ; and when those tenders are received, we shall see whether the rooms have or have not been more extravagantly managed by the Government officials than they can be by private individuals. The Committee were well advised in deciding to call for tenders; and the result will disclose whether, under our exceptional circumstances, the management has been associated with economy and foresight. <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> should Tike to point out thai the balance-sheet of last year did not disclose quite the correct state of affairs. The cost of the refreshment-rooms included the up-keep and cleaning of the billiard-room and corridors. A great part of the time of the attendants in the refreshment-rooms is devoted to keeping the suite of rooms in good order; and if the refreshment-rooms had been closed, one or two of these attendants would still have been required. The salaries of these attendants should pro.perly be debited to the up-keep and cleaning of Parliament House; and had that been done the cost of the refreshment-rooms would have appeared much less than it did last year. </para>

                    <para>. - I take the liberty of suggesting to the House Committee that a reasonable charge might be made for the use of the billiard-table. I often go into the billiard-room, and I see comparatively a few members playing, who might well be asked to pay for their pleasure. I have not the slightest doubts that some hotelkeeper would be very glad to take the contract in hand, and would probably ascertain, in the course of the sittings, how many members intended partaking of dinner or supper. I am a great believer in private contract. </para>

                    <para>- As a business man, I realize that it is well-nigh impossible to make a profit cut of the refreshment-rooms, or even to pay expenses, under present conditions. 1 imagine, however, that the cost of the refreshment-rooms, which, to my mind, is reasonable, represents in itself a profit to the Commonwealth at large. Under the peculiar climatic conditions which very often obtain in.&#39; Melbourne, it is unreasonable to ask that members should go outside for their meals. If we were away from the precincts of the House during the adjournments for refreshments&#34;, and thus separated, the work of Parliament would be carried on under a disadvantage, which would react upon those who have sent us here. The refreshment-rooms, even in a modified form, are a benefit, inasmuch as they bring the members of the two Houses together in friendly chat, and sometimes friendly counsel. </para>

                        <para>- Very probably ; but the good nature and friendly spirit in which we meet must be of great advantage in the conduct of parliamentary business. Then, again, it would be extremely inconvenient if there were no refreshment-rooms in which members could entertain visitors from other States who might have a desire to see the Commonwealth Parliament Houses. If we had no rooms of the kind, we should, I am afraid, appear somewhat niggardly; and, further, it is desirable that we should be able to show some little hospitality to visiting members of the various1 States Parliaments throughout Australia. </para>

                    <para>. - Like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> I am pleased to find that the House Committee are endeavouring to grapple in the very best manner with this very serious matter, seeing that we are incurring a loss of something like &#163;800 or &#163;900 per annum. I quite agree that, under present conditions, it is utterly impossible to conduct the refreshment-rooms at other than a considerable loss. I question very much whether, if some1 private individual undertook the management under contract, he would be very long in finding that he was unable to make a profit. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> has urged that the refreshment-rooms are an essential adjunct to Parliament House, and gives as one of his reasons that the climatic conditions of Melbourne are such as to render it very inconvenient for members to go outside for refreshment. I am one who believes that if the refreshment-rooms cannot earn expenses, they ought not to be continued, and I am prepared, on the first opportunity, to record a vote in favour of their entire abolition. Hundreds and thousands of times, when I have gone to work, I have had to take my refreshments under much worse circumstances than I should have to do here if the rooms were abolished. I see no particular reason why we could not bring a billy-can and tuckerbag - bring our &#34; crib &#34; with us - and quietly sit down and have our smoke and chat in the usual manner of working men, who are doing so much for the welfare of this and every other country. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope that some honorable senators are joking, and that those who are serious will consider the position. We should not be fanatical or ultra-saving in a matter of this kind. If the refreshment-rooms are necessary for the proper and convenient working of Parliament, then Parliament ought to contribute something to their maintenance. I am surprised when I hear honorable senators talking about the extra .6 000 per annum which the refreshment-rooms cost in, addition to what honorable members pay for what they receive. I contend) that members pay quite sufficient for their refreshments ; at any rate, if they had to pay more, I am certain&#39; they would go outside, or, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> has suggested, bring billy-cans. I am credibly informed that the refreshment-rooms in the New South Wales State Parliament cost an extra .&#163;3,000 a year. </para>

I do not know exactly what the extra cost was to the Victorian Parliament, when the State members occupied these buildings. The parliamentary refreshment-rooms in South Australia do not appear to cost anything extra, the reason being that our predecessors in that Legislature were judicious enough to cover up the expenditure. Instead of making the salaries, &#38;c, a charge against the refreshment-rooms, they engaged a caterer- </para>

                        <para>- They granted these perquisites to the caterer, and, in addition, gave him the services of the Parliament House cleaners free of charge. If all these charges were debited against the refreshment-rooms account of the South Australian Legislature, it would show a greater deficit in proportion to the number of members, and the business done, than, is shown by ;h&#39;e Federal parliamentary refreshment-rooms accounts. In view of all these facts, why should it be suggested1 that tenders should be called for the catering? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> are such venerable gentlemen that their judgment should convince them of the unwisdom of bringing here a caterer who might employ fascinating barmaids to lure legislators away from their duties. I would draw special attention to the inconvenient situation, of the dining-rooms and kitchen. The arrangements are so defective that it would be exceedingly difficult for any one to make the business pay at a reasonable tariff. Another point is that the gentlemen of the press and of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff find&#39; it a great convenience to be able to obtain their meals on the premises, and that it would be a very serious matter, so far as they are concerned, if the tariff were so high as to compel them to obtain their meals elsewhere. As to the closing of the dining-rooms during the recess, I would point out that the majority of members of this Parliament do not reside in Victoria, and that consequently during the recess they are  seldom  here. If this were a State Parliament, members would be here nearly all the year round, and the receipts would thus be much larger. I do not know whether it is wise to close the dining-rooms during the recess. If the House Committee think it necessary to do so because they are not used to any extent, well and good. But I should certainly allow the bar to remain open, not merely that honorable members might indulge in the good spirits to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> has referred, but to enable them to obtain a cup of tea or coffee when they come here. With that object in view, a gas or spirit stove should be kept on the premises ; or, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> has suggested, provision made for boiling the billy. I certainly would not close the bar. During last recess, although it was closed, there was an officer constantly in attendance. Would it not be better for that attendant to serve honorable members during recess rather than that he should be drawing his salary and dobie little for it. I hope that the House Committee will take these matters into consideration, and that if we ever reach the Federal Capital care will be taken to provide in the Commonwealth Parliament House every facility for the caterer. If the people of Australia were aware of the difficulties with respect to the refreshment-rooms, and of the difference between&#39; the position of members of this Parliament, and that of members of the States Legislatures. I am sure they would not grumble about this matter. The deficit is of such little consequence that the House Committee would be justified in carrying on the business without inviting tenders. Honorable senators opposite are always ready to speak of what a business man would db in such circumstances. It is only during a few days in the week that there is any business to be done, and I am satisfied that even a business man would find the catering arrangements so inconvenient that if he charged the tariff customary outside he would be in difficulties in less than three montHs. Probably he would be unable to pay his bills, and in this way even greater discredit would be brought upon the Parliament. The discussion that has taken place to-day will do good; it will disabuse the public mind. I have heard it said repeatedly that Federal members enjoy all these advantages and services free of charge. Some members of the Federal Parliament have themselves made statements with respect to parliamentary perquisites that have led the public to entertain the belief that refreshments are supplied to us free of charge; but this discussion will clear away misapprehensions, and I am pleased that it has taken place. </para>

I have confidence in dealing with this question, &#39;because, in addition to the experience gained as a member of the Refreshment-rooms Committee of the Parliament of New South Wales, I have been for some five years a member of the House Committee of the Federal Parliament. It is impossible for any parliamentary refreshment-rooms, at the tariff customary in the city in which that Parliament meets, to pay its way, as the phrase goes, when the takings at the outside extend over only three and a half days per week, while the salaries qf its officers are paid for the six. The Senate sits One day per week less than does the House of Representatives, and the expenditure by members of either Chamber is very small on Friday . I am, therefore, well within the mark when I say that the business of the refreshment-rooms extends over only three and a half days per week. In the circumstances, it is impossible to&#39; balance the accounts. Coming to the question of whether there is a deficit in the refreshment-rooms accounts, I honestly believe that there is not. That is the conclusion I have come to as a member of the Committee. Whether I shall so report is immaterial, but I account for my opinion in this way : A sum of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;720</inline> is charged to the refreshment-rooms in respect of salaries voted bv Parliament. I hold that it is no function of a Refreshment-rooms Committee to recoup or endeavour to recoup the consolidated revenue the salaries that have been so appropriated. It might just as well be said that honorable members who stroll in the Parliamentary Gardens should pay for the privilege of doing so, and that the revenue thus derived should be put against the salaries of the gardeners which are appropriated by Parliament. </para>

We might just as reasonably be asked to do so as to make up the salaries appropriated by Parliament for the refreshment-rooms, which are a necessity. There is no Parliament in the Empire, so far as I am aware, which has not its refreshment-rooms - which has no provision for the supply of food and drink. Whether it be spirits/ or that terrible stuff called tea, with which people destroy their digestive organs, members should be able to get it on the parliamentary premises. Win* is there no complaint about the billiard-room, which is not a necessity. </para>

But we cannot conduct a billiard-room without having some&#34;one to clean it, to take care of the tables, the cues, and the rest of the paraphernalia. If we had not refreshment-rooms, and &#34;the work of the billiard-room &#39;was not being! carried out by one of the officials whose salary is voted by Parliament in connexion with the refreshment-rooms, we should have to find at least &#163;150 ia- year for the charge of that room. It costs nothing at the present time, because unfortunately the refreshment-rooms bear it all. </para>

                        <para>- No, I think he is charged against the vote for the garden. It is known that Parliament votes&#163;50 a year as a kind of honorarium to the Usher of the Black Rod for acting as controller over the whole of these premises. He is, so to speak, the permanent head of the department. He has to do the whole of the bookkeeping. All the accounts for light, water, insurance, repairs, and furniture go through his hands. He is very busy most of the day, and very often at night, in dealing with these matters. Even that sum of &#163;50 is charged against the refreshment-rooms. The thing is utterly ridiculous. It has no more right to be charged against the refreshment-rooms than has the insurance of the building. Why has not the insurance of some part of the building, or the whole of it, been charged against the refreshment-rooms vote? It seems to me that somehow or other these charges against the refreshment-rooms have been inflated in a most needless and unreasonable manner. I may say in passing, without any breach of confidence, that I placed this very matter, in conversation, before a very distinguished member of the Government, and he was entirely in agreement with me that it was no part of the duty of the Refreshment-rooms Committee to recoup the consolidated revenue for the salaries that Parliament votes, and that must be patent to everybody. For argument&#39;s sake, we will take the alleged deficit at &#163;870. If we take off that sum the salaries which Parliament appropriates, it leaves a balance of &#163;150. If we do away with the officers whose salaries Parliament votes, and put the business into the hands of a caterer, we shall have to find&#163;150 a year for the billiard-room. These two items - the salaries now voted by Parliament and the salary that would be necessary otherwise in connexion with the billiard-room - make up exactly the amount of the deficit. Therefore, practically there is no deficit - no more than there is in connexion with the gardens, nor the cleaning of the building, because Parliament votes some salaries. There are one or two matters which I think it only fair to mention. I find that when a member of either House takes a drink of whisky, he pays a price which represents a profit of 20 per cent. There cannot be any allegation of cheap drinks under the circumstances. There is a profit of 20 per cent., reckoned upon the spirits which are sold in the bar. In six months, however, the bill for tea has amounted to&#163;30, and the bill for milk to &#163;35. </para>

                <para>SenatorCol. NEILD.- The takings for afternoon tea do not average 5s. In a six months&#39; session, if we reckon tea, coffee, milk, and loaf sugar, there is not less than &#163;70 worth of these articles given away, while the people who take a little whisky have to pay an advance of 20 per cent, on cost price. I make this statement, because I think it is only fair in the interests of the whole Parliament that I should do so. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. A Member of Parliament who does not take any spirits pays nothing to the caterer for the tea or coffee which he drinks at his meals, whereas I, to whose digestion tea is very destructive, take whisky, and have to pay. In other word&#39;s, one Member of Parliament pays a shilling, and he has something to eat and a cup of tea, while another member pays a shilling for the same quantity- of food, and sixpence extra for his drink. I do not say that the cup or pot of tea costs sixpence - it may cost much less - but there is a distinct difference drawn. My own view is that tea ought not to be given in unless one shilling and sixpence is paid for the meal. </para>

I make this statement, because I think it is of interest to honorable senators. I found it of interest when I began to put all the figures together. I assure honorable senators that I am not quoting at random. I have got all the details, month by month, in my hand. I hope that honorable senators will see that there really is no reason to raise a cry of deficit in connexion with our refreshment-rooms, and no reason to besmirch the reputation of the Senate or another place by making out or maintaining the proposition that the refreshment-rooms of the Federal Parliament are conducted at a great loss to the community. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir RICHARD</inline>BAKER (South Australia) &#91;11.40&#93;. - I do not know that any good will result from discussing in the Senate small details concerning the refreshment-rooms, and therefore I do not intend to follow <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline> who, no doubt, is probably correct in everything he stated. I only rose to correct a misapprehension into which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> has evidently fallen. The Joint House Committee wished to ascertain whether a greater or lesser expenditure would occur if the refreshment-rooms were carried on here, as in South Australia, by a contractor. With that view, we unanimously decided to call for tenders on the basis that the prices to be charged should be exactly the same as those charged now. If there was to be a difference we could not compare the two systems one with the other. I am not at all sanguine about a tender being accepted ; in fact, I am not at all sanguine that we are not able to carry on this business at as small an expenditure by the present methods as we could by a contractor. As a matter of fact, we have had tentative tenders before us. Although we are now publicly calling for tenders, previously we did so privately. We had one or two tenders, and the expenditure was a great deal more than at present, the prices being much higher than at present. But we vindicate our position that we ought to carry on this department at as low an expenditure as possible by calling for tenders, everything to be on the same bash&#39;s as at present. No extra charges would be made, Members of Parliament would not be driven out of the refreshment-rooms, because they would have to pay exactly the same as they do now. I only rose to correct that misapprehension, because I think it is due to the Joint House Committee. We are trying to do our best. All we want is to give as great accommodation as possible to the members of both Houses, as efficiently as we can, and at as little expense as possible. </para>

One fine morning, at about11 o&#39;clock, just when he was hurrying off to attend a Select Committee, of which he was clerk, he was informed that there was a constable upstairs who had seized everything in the interests of the creditors of the caterer. What became of the latter I do not know. I do not think that he ever returned.

                        <para>- I do not know. It is very awkward when an irresponsible person is allowed to come into the premises of Parliament and conduct a business there. I am not in favour of a proceeding of that kind. The premises of Parliament should be under the control of Parliament, and not in the hands of irresponsible people. But so satisfactory was the arrangement carried out by the controller at the time, and so great was the saving as compared with the contract system, that the Victorian Parliament afterwards carried on its own catering, just as we have hitherto done, and has never reverted to the contract system. I may mention here that at the initiation of our present system the controller, who was, of course, appointed by the Government before Parliament met, had to make arrangements for honorable members before there were any funds with which to operate. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Upward</inline> actually started our refreshment-rooms, and carried them on out of his own pocket. He conducted them for the convenience of Members of Parliament at his own charge for some length of time. We have had evidence that they have been conducted with a great deal of satisfaction. I am satisfied that we shall not do well to place the control of any portion of the parliamentary buildings in the hands of strangers. We shall not find that the arrangements are as satisfactory as they have been in the past- </para>

                    <para>. - I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> has made a very informative statement with regard to the refreshment-rooms, and, generally speaking, it was correct ; but his undying repugnance to tea has led) him into a statement from which a wrong inference may be drawn. He has said that &#163;30 worth of tea was consumed last year in six months, and &#163;35 worth of milk. He says that 5s. per day is spent on afternoon teas. As a matter of fact, I think the amount is greater. But he must remember that milk is used in various comestibles, such as puddings. Furthermore, 6d. is paid for a cup of afternoon tea, which costs about id., whereas a glass of whisky costs probably 3d1, or 4d. Therefore, a greater profit is made from tea than from whisky. It appears to me to be ridiculous to contend that tea supplied at an ordinary meal should be specially charged for. It is not charged for at any refreshment-room in Australia. It is a portion of the meal, for which a fixed price is paid. One might as well be asked to paxextra for salt or pepper. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild&#39;s</inline> repugnance to tea reminds me of a certain individual&#39;s repugnance to water. He said that water must be very injurious, because when some water got into his watch he observed that fearful injury  was done to the delicate mechanism; and he said that he. was not going to drink any water lest such injury should be done to his internal mechanism ! </para>

There ought to be a minimum, and a man should get at least one hour&#39;s pay if he is brought back for Sunday work. The work itself may only occupy five minutes, and yet the man&#39;s whole day may be spoilt.

                        <para>- I am informed that there is not. Take the case of telegraph operators who are brought back on a Sunday morning for the purpose of telegraphing that a ship has arrived at Thursday Island. Officers at various repeating stations all along the line are brought back to transmit this message. That is all the work that they have to do. I am told that they get little or nothing in the way of payment, and yet the whole of their Sunday morning or afternoon may be spoilt. The people in whose interests these telegraph messages are sent are compelled to pay a sum of 2s. 6d&#39;. for each officer who is thus called upon to do Sunday work, and in addition to that double rates are charged for the telegrams so sent. The double charge for the telegram would be sufficient remuneration to the Department for the use of its plant and instruments, and I think that the 2 s. 6d. paid on account of each officer brought back should be paid to the officer for his extra service. </para>

                <para class="block">As to the Minister&#39;s reported statement that not a word appears upon &#34;the Estimates about military bands, I find that as a matter of fact there is quite a number of references to bandsmen. For instance, in last year&#39;s Estimates honorable senators will find on page 128 the items &#34; two band sergeants, ^&#163;8 &#34; ; &#34; forty-two bandsmen at &#163;6 8s.&#34;; on page 130, &#34;band allowance, Australian Light Horse, ^.1 50 &#34; ; again, &#34; band allowance, Volunteers, <inline font-style="italic">&#163;50.&#34;</inline> A number of the men in the Forces in Queensland feel rather hurt over the remarks that the Minister is supposed to have made, because they recognise the necessity for their having bands, and they know that a certain amount is placed on the Estimates for the purpose. But, in addition, nearly every man, from the officers down, put their hands in their pockets towards keeping up their own bands. The officers usually give a subscription of, perhaps, a guinea, and the men, say, half-a-crown, annually, in recognition of the services of the bandsmen,, who devote to the work a lot of time for which they are not paid. As was pointed out to me by one &#39;of the men, all the bandsmen are trained soldiers, just as are those in the ranks ; the only difference is that the former have devoted themselves to the band, and given a lot of time in making themselves musically efficient. The men feel hurt at this statement, reported to have been made by the Minister, though had it been uttered by any one outside possibly no notice would have been taken of it. Has the gentleman in charge of the Department any idea of the responsibilities of his office, or is he making statements at random, without ascertaining whether they are correct? </para>

                    <para>. - If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> takes various statements which are attributed to me in the press, and asks me whether I have made them, all- I can say is &#39; that, in many instances, the reporter&#39;s imagination has amplified any little thing I may have said into something simply unrecognisable. So far as the wireless telegraphy station is  concerned, a reporter* did ask me as to what was intended to be done in the matter. It is well known that one of the Admirals on the Australian Station recommended to the Government of the day, before my time, that wireless telegraphy stations should be established all along the coast of Australia, commencing in Western Australia and running to Cape York, and even to Port Darwin. However, a new Admiral arrived, and he reckoned that, instead of the large number of stations recommended by his predecessor, only three were necessary. It was on the report of this Admiral that the reporter asked as to my intention. In the course of. casual conversation!, I did say that, to my utter surprise, I had found in Queensland a wireless telegraphy station of which I had known nothing previously, and in regard to which I had- seen no provision on the Estimates. But the statement by the reporter about my &#34;discovering&#34; a man in charge is pure imagination. The reporter doubtless concluded that there would be a man in charge, and that, as there had been no provision, made on the Estimates, this man had got there in some peculiar manner; and so the tale goes on. Since that time I have been requested to provide money for the repair of one of the large masts of the apparatus, which seems to have come down, or become- weakened, and I have sent to Captain Tickell, asking for full particulars. I inquired as to whether this station was used at all. and, so far as I could ascertain in Queensland, it is useless for any practical purpose. The question, now is whether, under the circumstances, I shall provide money for the repairs, and I am at present making inquiries. The newspaper account&#39; proceeds : </para>

The paragraph goes on to say that I stated I had found Tasmania in a state of &#34; utter disorganization.&#34; I do not know whether or not I used the word &#34; utter,&#34; but, when I took office, I certainly found defence matters in Tasmania in a state of disorganization. </para>

                        <para>- We heard of revolution and mutiny, and of Major-General Hutton disbanding a corps.. I am now looking into that matter, and reestablishing the force as nicely and quietly as possible. I have had to do some rather serious things which I should not care to make public in connexion with the defences of Tasmania ; but, so far as I know, matters are now going on very pleasantly. With regard to the bandsmen, I never made any such statement as that attributed to me in reference to any particular corps in Queensland ; but I did make a statement relating to some bandsmen in Victoria. The newspaper paragraph goes on to say that I stated I found military bands everywhere, but that not a word appeared on the Estimates about bandsmen. Considering that I make up the Defence Estimates, I was not likely to make such a statement, in face of the fact that provision is made for bands. I can suggest, however, how such a statement may have been written by the reporter. There is a band provided for every regiment, and for each band certain provision is made on the Estimates. A regiment may, however, be composed of men who are very mu:h scattered; a portion may be stationed at the head-quarters at Bendigo, for instance, and a branch or company of the same regiment stationed at Echuca. When regiments are scattered in this way, it very often happens that bands are improvised by the men themselves. A band is already provided at the head-quarters at Ballarat or Bendigo; but in an outlying district, 50 or 100 miles away, the little squadrons organize a band of their own, all the expenses of which they pay themselves. The trouble arises from the fact that men are put into these bands who are not effective as soldiers, and who cannot pass when the corps goes up for the effective allowance. In this connexion the officers complain very much because, while a man may be able to read music, blow a trombone, or beat a big drum, he is not an effective soldier, and does, not earn the grant. In speaking with the reporter, I may have referred to some such case as that ; I have a Victorian case in ray mind. I do not think I did refer to the matter, but if I did, I certainly never intended my remarks to apply to Queensland. Statements of the kind taken fi om their context are. of course, exceedingly misleading. There may have been a general conversation in which I alluded to bands ; but the circumstances are as I have stated. I can assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> that when the reporters have to &#34; dress up,&#34; as they do, what they may casually hear from a Minister in a&#39; general conversation, perhaps as they walk along the street, they make mistakes, and lead people to form wrong impressions. In the present case a very wrong impression has been formed in regard to the wireless telegraphy station, and the wonderful man I am supposed to have found, <inline font-style="italic">hut</inline> did not find. ^ A mistake has also been made in attributing to me the statement that military bands are not provided for on the Estimates. As I say, recognised military bands are provided for, but there are those other improvised bands, which are not provided for, and which cause some little trouble. </para>

                    <para>. - I should like some information as to the intentions of the Government in regard to a very important matter. If our defences are to be of any use at all, there must be some means by which the Forces can be adequately armed without our having to go 12,000 or 14,000 miles for weapons and ammunition in case of emergency. Something should be done by the Government towards, the establishment of a small arms factory, or even of a large arms factory in Australia. What would be our position if the mother country were engaged in a life and death struggle with a European Power or a combination of European Powers? Such a thing may never occur - we hope that it will not - but there is the possibility, and it must be faced. In such a contingency we should have to defend ourselves ; indeed, it would be our duty to adopt that manly course rather than to hang on to the skirts of the mother country, and to ask her to defend us. It is absolutely necessary that in such circumstances we should be in a position to adequately arm our soldiers. What should we do if. our uninterrupted sea communication were cut off? We should be absolutely dependent upon some European country for our supply of arms and ammunition. </para>

                        <para>- But Japan is oversea, and there is a possibility that in time of war our free and uninterrupted sea communication might be cut off. If we are to be independent and self-sustaining in this respect, we must establish a factory in which both large and small arms of every description, as well as ammunition of all kinds, can be manufactured. Another point is that, even in time of peace, big guns are often thrown out of repair, and that in time of war, when such occurrences would be far more frequent, we should be unable to make them effective. </para>

I hope that the Minister will be able to give us an assurance that the Government have in contemplation, at all events, the establishment of the nucleus of a factory such as I, and, I believe, the p&#39;eople of Australia, desire, and that steps will be taken as early as possible to put in a plant and engage the workmen necessary to manufacture everything we require in the way of arms and ammunition. </para>

                    <para>. - I can assure the honorable senator that I have not lost sight of the matter to which he has referred. As a protectionist, I am in favour of our doing all the work we can in the Commonwealth ; but in this connexion there are positions which even we, as protectionists, cannot take up. The question is, whether the quantity of arms and ammunition that we require would be sufficient to justify the erection of the necessary machinery, and keep it going. Let us take, for instance, the manufacture of cordite, which is now used for all arms. It certainly could be made in Australia, but its manufacture by the Government would . involve immense loss, since we should require but a very small quantity. I could erect one of the smallest factories here foi a given sum, but the manufacture of cordite in that factory would not be payable, unless we had&#39; an output of something like 50 tons a year. </para>

I can buy cordite at 2s. 8d. per lb., whereas calculations that have been made show that it would cost something like 59. per lb. to manufacture it here, if the output of the factory were simply that required to meet our own demands. The question is, whether we are going to double our ammunition charges for the purpose of giving a month&#39;s employment annually to a few workmen. </para>

                        <para>- That is the position as it appeals to me. We have to determine whether it would really be worth while, from a practical point of view, to undertake this work. I have been in communication with two companies, and Nobel&#39;s have offered to supply the Department with cordite at a certain price for a certain quantity, the price to be reduced in proportion to the quantity ordered. But we cannot take the quantity necessary. When the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Seddon</inline> was here, the question of whether New Zealand would give us the manufacture of the supplies it required was discussed. If it would, that would increase our output by 5 tons a year. We have also been making inquiries to ascertain whether the Admiralty could not take from us! the supplies required for the Australian as well as for the Eastern Squadron. Inquiries are still being made, and I hope to be able to establish a cordite factory. I should certainly do so if I could say to the Senate, &#34; We shall only have to pay a sum not very much in excess of what we are now paying for our cord&#39;ite.&#34; But) as the cost would be so much in excess of what we are now paying, and we have a reserve of cordite sufficient to carry us over, not only this year, but next year- - </para>

                        <para>- When I tell the honorable senator what provision we have made he will recognise that our position with regard to arms and ammunition is exceedingly favorable. Nevertheless. I should like to see cordite manufactured here. A war might break out at any time, but it would not be altogether wise to incur a large expenditure because of a mere probability. As long as we keep up a reserve that will tide us over a certain time, we shall have nothing to fear. Nowadays, wars are generally sharp and decisive. We are not likely to have a recurrence of the one hundred years&#39; Avar, or a thirty years&#39; war, such .as we read of in history, and as long as we take care to have reserves of ammunition sufficient to tide us over a certain time, and a supply of arms sufficient, at all events, to equip the number of troops, necessary to enable us to meet any likely invasion, we shall have done as much as we ought to do. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> urged the establishment of a factory capable of turning out big, guns, as well as small arms. Canada has started the manufacture of small arms, and&#39; I have made inquiries as to what would be the cost of providing such an establishment here. It is estimated that an outlay of &#163;150,000 would be required to start the factory, and that even then we should not be able to keep it working full&#39; time. The trouble is that we require,, comparatively speaking, only a very small quantity. Are honorable senators prepared to support the erection of a big factory, which would be kept  going only a month a year? Are they prepared to incur this expenditure in order that we may be ready to defend ourselves in a war which, might&#39; not take place for another forty years? </para>

                        <para>- I would if I could, but the honorable senator knows that in all branches of industry nowadays work is done automatically. An article is made, not by one machine, but by a number ; it passes from one machine to another until its manufacture is complete. Once a machine is started in a small arms factory, it must go on at its full capacity. If its speed be reduced power is wasted. </para>

                        <para>- I have been alluding to only one set. Small arms are turned out very quickly by machinery, and one set would probably manufacture ten or twenty times more than we should ever require. We should thus have an expensive plant lying idle for a considerable time every year. My inquiries lead me to believe that there is no escape from that position. At the same time, I recognise the advantage that would flow from the establishment of a factory capable of turning out all that we require. Cordite has a more detrimental effect upon our rifles than has ordinary black powder, and&#39;, consequently, new barrels are frequently required. Provision has been made this year for a considerable number off new rifle barrels. I do not know whether it would be impossible for us to make a start in the direction desired by Senator* Givens by establishing a factory, in which we could replace rifle barrels out of repair, and gra-dual.lv extend it as our population increased and our position improved. 1 can assure honorable senators that I have looked into this matter very carefully. I would ask the Senate to vote the money to start the manufacture of these articles if I could see that it would pay the Commonwealth to take that step. But the cost of the undertaking would be so great that I have shrunk from making a proposal. My idea is that, if it is decided to have a little fleet of our own, we ought to establish dock-yards and build the vessels here. So far as I can see from the inquiries I have made, it will not pay us at the present time to manufacture ammunition or rifles. I shall look still further into the matter. If any honorable senators will give notice of particular questions, I shall give them all the information I can get. If they are then dissatisfied, and consider that we ought to incur this expense simply for the sake of the .advantage of having, in a problematical time of war, the means of manufacturing our own rifles more quickly than possibly they could be imported from the old country, they can bring the matter before Parliament. </para>

                    <para>. - In my opinion, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has introduced! a subject of great importance. I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> has raised some debatable objections to the proposal, but I do not think that it should be looked at purely from the commercial aspect. The whole exigencies of defence are not regarded from that aspect, but from a broad national stand-point. Upon defence every year we spend ^1,000,000, of which only &#163;250,000 is spent upon our naval defence. I recognise that for our safety we are entirely dependent upon the British Navy, but that does not absolve us from the responsibility of being able to defend our own shores in the event of an invasion. If such a misfortune even occurred as that the great British Navy were crippled or evaded, and a hostile force could land in Australia, we, as descendants of British people, should be able to defend our own shores and hearths. We are spending ,&#163;750,000 a year upon internal defence. The question which occurs to me is: Are we spending that money to the best advantage, and are we providing for a possible eventuality which may endanger our national existence. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> has said that we have in store enough cordite to last us for two years - that is2 when we have purely encampments and a little rifle shooting. I venture to say that, if the 100,000 riflemen, or persons who have arms, in Australia were fighting for two or three days, they would expend all the cordite we have. </para>

                        <para>- I quite admit that a subject like this requires very careful consideration, and that it has to be looked at from all points of view, including the commercial aspect. When I told the Minister that in Canada they make these things, he said that he did not know what they do. It is well for us to know what is being done in Canada and other parts of the Empire in the matter of internal defence. I know that in Canada they make small arms, cordite, and shrapnel. Would it not be well for the Minister of Defence to inquire what is the cost of carrying on these manufactures in Canada, and what quantities are manufactured, and whether it would be possible for us to imitate the example of our brothers in that country, instead of depending upon outside sources for our supplies of ammunition. Surely if in Canada, with 5,000,000 persons, they have had these factories for some time- </para>

                        <para>- Why could we not make arms for sale? We make a lot of other things for sale. We shall never make these articles unless we try to do so. What I wish to point out to the Minister is that the annual vote of &#163;1,000,000 is not spent for actual war purposes. On the contrary, it is spent for the purpose of preparing us to meet such a contingency. Is it not advisable, whether it is employed fully or not, to provide ourselves with the machinery to make the arms and ammunition for our men? And before we obtain that machinery and begin the manufacture of arms and ammunition, is it not necessary that we should produce steel and iron in Australia? In my opinion the Minister is the proper person to make all these inquiries, and tell the Senate what, in his view, is the best way to proceed in this direction. I was very glad to hear from the Minister that if it is decided to have a small navy of our own an attempt will be made to build the vessels here. In view of the possibilities which have been suggested, we ought to be in a position to construct the ships on the spot. I heard an honorable senator on the other side accuse the Minister of coquetting with the Labour Party. That is all nonsense. The Minister was talking to every senator in the Chamber, and that accusation ought not to have been made. We, as a party, were not asking the Minister for anything in connexion with defence. Some honorable senators are always talking about the great navy of Great Britain, what it has done, and is doing, and how dependent we are upon its efforts. The way in which we can render the greatest assistance to the mother country is by being able to defend ourselves. Every senator who is the head of a family naturally anticipates the time when his children will be prepared to provide for themselves. Look at how we provide for our defence by water ! What do we get for our subsidy, which, I admit, is not a very great one? Are any inquiries made by honorable senators opposite as to what we get for the money? </para>

                        <para>- Do honorable senators, who interject, know that, early in this year, when the flagship went on a trial trip, her machinery broke down? It is very easy for some persons to say that we are well defended, and to suggest that the machinery of every ship is liable to break down, and that a mishap is just as likely to occur to the machinery of the <inline font-style="italic">Powerful</inline> as to&#39; that of any other ship. These mishaps occur too frequently. Suppose that we were dependent upon the efficiency of these vessels for our defence, and that &#39;when they went out they broke down one after another, what would; be our position ?  No inquiry is ever made. Honorable senators do not know that these vessels are continually breaking down. For the last three or four months the <inline font-style="italic">Pylades</inline> has been lying alongside Garden Island. Her tubes have been blown out two or three times, although she came out with almost new boilers from the old country. It shows that we cannot depend upon these vessels. There ought to be in Australia some place where they could be repaired efficiently instead of lying alongside Garden Island. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, but look at the question of cost and inconvenience, and the way in which the work has to be done. We are dependent upon these vessels for our security when they are lying alongside Garden Island to be repaired. Cannot honorable senators opposite see that they are only living in a fool&#39;s paradise? It is the duty of the Minister of Defence to inquire into these matters, and to be in a position to tell the Senate whether in sending out these vessels the British Admiralty are fulfilling their dutv towards the Commonwealth, and whether we have a right to quietly sit here and consider ourselves safe when that&#39; sort of protection is afforded to us in return for our subsidy. I hope that the day will soon arrive when we shall have the material to build our own vessels manufactured here, because it could be produced with greater economy here than in any other part of the world, as we have the coal and the iron lying alongside each other. Australia is far richer than are many other places in the world where iron is produced to-day. </para>

                        <para>- Steel is being manufactured in South Melbourne to-day by a process which I venture to say the honorable senator has never heard of. Queensland has deposits of coal which are just as plentiful as those in New South Wales. But I am not arguing in the interests of any particular State. I do not care whether the work is undertaken in New South Wales, South Australia, or Vi;toria. But the time has arrived when we ought at least to consider whether it is not advisable to make provisions for future necessities in connexion with naval defence and for the manufacture of our own small arms and guns. Unless we begin to consider it seriously, the work will never be undertaken. I believe that it would pay us to have an arms factory of our own, even if we only kept ir. going for a month in the year. I have heard complaints made that if we had a larger military force we should simply increase the number of idle men. What is to prevent us from forming a force in Australia of such a character that those who composed it could work in the arms and ammunition factories at the same time that they were learning to be soldiers? They could, it seems to me, be useful citizens, while still carrying out their military duties when not required to work in the factories. This would be a means of utilizing a certain amount of labour that is at present lost in every civilized community. I am quite aware that trained soldiers are not employed usefully in times of peace in other countries. But we in Australia should begin to teach the rest of the world a lesson. Many of our soldiers at Queenscliff and other forts would be far better employed if a certain portion of their time were occupied in making ammunition in a factory under the control of the Commonwealth. </para>

They know that if a large number of men are kept in idleness they, as workers, have to provide their sustenance; and they would far rather have the assistance of these men in doing useful work. Trade unionists are no fools. There may have been a time when they were as narrow-minded as some honorable senators are to-day. They might then have objected to a proposal of this description. But they see too far and too clearly now what their interests are, and I am sure that they would raise no objection to what I propose. I hope that inquiries will be made as to the possibility of building our own vessels and manufacturing our own ammunition, small arms, and guns ; that we shall see to it that we obtain good service for the money that we pay : and that the security which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> profess to have so much at heart will at last be attained. </para>

                    <para>. - I rise to support the remarks of other honorable senators upon the subject that is now being discussed. I believe that the time is coming when any Government that does not seriously take up this question of defence in an earnest and practical manner will cease to exist. The radical parties in the politics of Australia especially recognise that their ideals are only possible of attainment if we are in a position to defend our country by force, if necessary. Because a power has arisen in the world within the last few years which offers the greatest possible menace to our ideals. We have that danger to face. I allude to the rise of Japan, the possibility of aggression by that Power, and of her expansion in the Pacific. We have recently seen an armed Japanese demonstration in our own waters. We have recently seen Japanese vessels-- </para>

                        <para>- This discussion will serve a valuable purpose if it encourages the Government to come forward with a bold, well-defined plan of Australian defence. At present we spend a large amount on our land defences, but whether we are getting the best value for our money I am not in a position to say. There has been a report by Captain Creswell on- the question of harbor defences, placed before us bv the Minister; and we are at present in the position that, while the report is before us, we do not know what the Government propose to do. I venture to say that the great bulk of the people of Australia would support the Government in taking action on the lines indicated by Captain Creswell. What <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> has said about the British Squadron, towards which we pay a subsidy, is well known to be the fact. One of&#39; the vessels repeatedly broke down on the way out, and when the recent squadron, to which we paid a subsidy of &#163;120,000 per annum, reached England, the vessels were immediately sold as scrap iron. These facts create a feeling of uneasiness and insecurity in the minds of the people. While we cannot build battleships and so forth, the Government should, at any rate, make a commencement on the lines laid down by Captain Creswell ; and we desire the Government to tell us, at the earliest opportunity, when they propose to do so. The report of itself is nothing, but if the Government are going to take any steps they will have the hearty support of both Houses, and the people of Australia will bear the necessary taxation in order to secure harbor defence. </para>

                <para class="block">SenatorPEARCE.- They are not British subjects, but subjects of the British. However, this does not relate to the question of defence. I hope the Minister will commence at the earliest opportunity a vigorous policy of Australian defence, both in the direction indicated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> and that indicated in Captain Creswell&#39;s report. If the Government regard the question from the same point of view as does the Minister - if they take into consideration whether the scheme is likely to pay - then the Defence Department might as well be abolished. We know that the &#163;750,000 we spend on our land defences does not pay. The guns lying at the forts, the field artillery in the drill-sheds, and the rifles stacked there, are all non-paying, and represent so much money lying idle, just as would the machinery in our rifle factories, and the machinery for making cordite. Does the Minister not see that the very argument he uses against the establishment of a cordite factory can be used against the maintenance of the Defence Department? The Minister must not allow such considerations to stop him from taking action. Even if all this does mean money lying idle, it is the most useful reserve we could have, and there would be the knowledge that if we were entirely cut off by sea from our base of supplies, we could make our own rifles and ammunition. I trust the Minister will take heart from the discussion, and will be prepared, even at the expenditure of a considerable sum, to submit a vigorous defence policy on the lines indicated. </para>
                <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Col. NEILD</inline>(New South Wales) &#91;2.7&#93;. - I have only a few words to say in regard to defence matters. I desire particularly to bear testimony to the admirable work being done at the Commonwealth naval yard at Williamstown. I visited the yard only the other day, and I wish I had done so long ago. I hope every member of this and another place will take an early opportunity to see the work there carried on in the public interest at very small cost. I mention this matter in conjunction with the suggestion thrown out that the permanent members of the Military Forces might be utilized in the preparation of war materiel. I quite sympathize with the suggestion of the Minister that these men are widely scattered, and that it is difficult to bring them together in order to carry out work of any great consequence. Still, I think they might be trained more usefully than at present in connexion with the preparation of war materiel. They have spare time, because their duties do not wholly occupy them during hours that are reasonable for members of the Military Forces. There certainly must be work connected with the preparation of such materiel, to which members of the permanent Military Forces might be usefully devoted under proper authority. Whether they can do much or little, it boots not, perhaps, to inquire; but the fact that they are trained, and have the tuition necessary to enable them to have their services utilized) in the way I have indicated, is of immense consequence. There is another matter I desire to mention, namely, the absolute illegality and unconstitutional position of the Cadet Forces recently established. That force is clearly outside the law, and I desire the Minister to take into consideration the early introduction of a measure to amend the Defence Act, so as to bring the Cadet Forces within its operation. The Defence Act specifically sets out what constitutes members of the Defence Forces, and cadets are not included. Therefore, those lads who are in training are not members of the Defence Forces. What are they? They are lads undergoing instruction. Now, instruction is not a function of the Commonwealth under the Constitution. </para>

                <para class="block">Commonwealth under the Constitution. The only way in which we can train lads or men for military or naval purposes is by making them adjuncts of the Defence Forces. But the Defence Act does not make the cadets adjuncts of the Defence Forces: - the cadets stand clean outside. They are simply in the position of so many school boys getting so much instruction - instruction in defence, I admit - and as they are not members of the Defence Forces they are being illegally instructed. We have no more right under the Constitution to instruct boys for military purposes than we have to instruct them for some other purpose. </para>

                        <para>- I admit that it is no use discussing a semi-abstract, constitutional, and legal proposition here, and I merely throw out the suggestion. But if I cannot prove a positive, honorable senators opposite cannot prove a negative. A point of the kind can only be settled by appeal to the High Court; but I submit it because I believe it to be a sound point. As to &#34; climbing down,&#34; I have no more thought of doing that than I have of resigning my seat in this Chamber. I am not in the habit of &#34; climbing down.&#34; I never shin up such a rotten sapling that I want to climb down. </para>

When I disagree with the views of honorable senators, I. do not allege that they are blundering. I have mentioned these matters, and the most important at the present juncture is the very admirable work being done at the Commonwealth Naval Dockyards. T suppose that is the .proper term to apply. I did not go there for half-an-hour, and leave with the remark. &#34; All this is very wonderful &#34; ; I spent fire hours in seeing all that was to be seen, and I earnestly suggest that members of this Parliament should visit the establishment. It is worthy of the Commonwealth, and is unworthy only in the sense that it ought to be a great deal larger. It is certainly entitled to a very handsome vote for its maintenance. </para>

                    <para>. - The Minister of Defence, whether he be regarded as a protectionist member of a protectionist Government, or as the Minister charged with the conduct of the national defences of Australia, cannot be congratulated upon his reply to my contention with respect to the establishment of a Government arms and ammunition factory within the Commonwealth. His chief argument against the establishment of such a factory was that our needs were so small that it would not pay us to instal the necessary machinery. He seems to think that for all time Australia must be content to have her needs in this regard supplied by people at the other end of the world, or else be ready to expend a large sum to enable us to supply our own small requirements. Apparently, the honorable senator does not think we should ever do more than that. I disagree with his view. I fail to see why Australia should not supply arms and ammunition to other nations, just as she is now being supplied from other parts of the world. I fail also to see why the inventive genius of Australians should not have an opportunity to devise improved appliances. It is common knowledge that an Australian produced an implement of warfare which was eagerly sought after bv all the great Powers. I allude to the inventor of the Brennan torpedo. If an implement of warfare were devised at the present time, it would be found impossible to perfect it in Australia, and for want of a Commonwealth arms and ammunition factory, the Government would be unable to test it here. There is no reason why we should not encourage Australian genius and give our people a chance to perfect any instrument of warfare they may invent. There is no reason why we should not only manufacture the arms and ammunition required for our own defence, but be prepared to supply the wants of other countries. What is to prevent us from supplying New Zealand, South Africa, and Canada, with a superior ammunition that would be much sought after? The idea that because our own needs are small we must ever look te people on the other &#39; side of the globe to supply them - that we should be merely wood and water joeys - is: unworthy of .1 protectionist. What is the attitude of the Minister? He views the question of national defence from the pettifogging stand-point of &#163; s. d. Let me show him that a Government arms and ammunition factory would pay, and pay to&#39; an extraordinary degree. If this country were involved in war it would pay us to sacrifice 95 per cent, of our property in order to maintain our national independence. To what does the defence expenditure of Australia at present amount? Let us consider the question from the Minister&#39;s standard of ;&#163; s. d., and see what it means. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> justly pointed&#39; out just now, de fence is a form of insurance. But, apart altogether from the question of the preservation of our life and liberty - viewing the matter only from the, stand-point of &#163; s. d. - where does the Minister find himself? According to Coghlan&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Statistical Account of Australia and New Zealand,</inline> for 1904, the total value of private property in Australia, in 1903, was no less than &#163;1,204,000,000. We may safely say that the value of our public buildings, parks, lands, and railways, is something like &#163;800,000,000, so that the total value of property in Australia is about &#163;2,000,000,000. But let us consider the matter in the light of the information given by <inline font-style="italic">Coghlan,</inline> that private property in Australia is valued at &#163;1,204,000,000. In round figures, inclusive of the subsidy to the Imperial Navy, we expend on defence less than &#163;1,000,000 a  year.  In other words, we are spending less than one-twelfth of 1 per cent., in insuring private property in Australia against possible assault. </para>

                        <para>- About that. If we take the value of public and private property in Australia, we are paying less than one-twentieth of 1 per cent, by way of insurance against assault and invasion. What is the remedy ? The remedy is to see that out insurance is adequate. When a man insures a building against loss by fire, he takes care to cover, not one-fourth or one-half, but the full value. The two cases are scarcely parallel, because, if we were conquered by an enemy, we should lose, perhaps, not only our property, but our liberty and our life. That being so, scarcely any insurance that we might be called upon to pay would be unjustifiable. That which we are now paying is a paltry one. Indeed, it is simply wasted, because it is neither adequate nor effective. My proposal is that we should have an effective insurance. Notwithstanding what the Minister has said with regard to the supply of arms and ammunition in Australia, the fact remains that in the event of war we should be unable to repair our disabled guns. The Minister suggested that we might have a two-penny-half -penny factory, where our rifles could be refitted with new barrels, tout where it would be impossible to manufacture a complete rifle. Such a factory would be unworthy of the Commonwealth. What we need is a factory wherein we could manufacture big guns, as well as small arms and ammunition. At the present time, if a. gun becomes disabled, we have to dismount it and send it to the other end of the world to be repaired. What chance should we have of doing that in time of war? Is it reasonable to suggest that we should sit down and allow the enemy to make door-mats of us while we are sending our guns away to be repaired? It is a monstrous idea. The Questions we have to consider are whether we are prepared to defend Australia, and to pay for that defence. The people of Australia are not only willing but anxious to place themselves in a position in which they will be able to repel any assault. I am sure we are prepared to pay, and the people who ought to bear this cost are those whose property we insure. </para>

                        <para>- That is a phase of the question which I shall not at present discuss. At the proper time I shall advocate that the men who are insured should be called upon to pay. At present I am simply urging that reasonable provision should be made to insure Australia against foreign attack - to enable us to successfully resist assault. Unless we can manufacture our own guns, and repair them - unless we can manufacture the ammunition we need, and replenish our existing supplies without having to send orders to the other end of the world, our defences are absolutely useless. The Minister says that it would not pay to establish such a factory as I have advocated. I hold that it does not pay us to go in for defence of any kind without such a necessary adjunct, because without that necessary adjunct, defence is useless. If such an argument as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> has used can be urged against the expenditure I have suggested, then it could be used in favour of wiping out the Defence Department, and wiping out the Minister&#39;s office. </para>

We have the machinery in the country to manufacture the cordite, and it could be erected to-morrow if necessary. If a war were to take place we would commence to manufacture it for ourselves. Are we not protected to an extent which is reasonable, and are we not saving money? We are getting the cordite at half the price at which we could manufacture it. We have the machinery, the raw material, and the men to manufacture the cordite if necessary. A company here has got the plant and everything ready to make the cordite at a moment&#39;s notice. </para>

                        <para>- The machinery belongs to a private company, over which we should have no control. Suppose that everything the Minister says is absolutely correct, what does it mean? It means that if a war were started, and we were to find ourselves running short of ammunition, we could make heroic efforts to get this machinery started. Then, notwithstanding all the disorganization incidental to starting a new factory, notwithstanding the fact that there might be a break-down with the machinery, and that we might not have men absolutely capable to carry out everything to the highest degree of perfection, we should have to quietly sit down without ammunition, while we were waiting for the factory to be organized. </para>

                        <para>- What I believe the people of Australia will insist upon is that we shall not rely upon machinery in the hands of private persons, who may or may not supply us with ammunition in time of danger. What the people require, and what I advocate, is that the Commonwealth should set up a factory, and be prepared to enter upon the work of manufacturing at any moment. Ammunition is only one item. What about the arms? The Minister had to admit that the Government has not even contemplated the establishment of a factory ,in which rifles could be manufactured. He said, &#34; We might set up some buildings where we could manufacture or repair the barrels.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- As a matter of fact, soma very small Powers manufacture their own arms and ammunition. The Minister also said that it would be ridiculous to set up a factory for the sake of employing a few men for some months in the year. It is not a question of employing a few men or a thousand men. It is a question of national defence. If the defence of our national existence is not worth paying for, why do we have Commonwealth Ministers? I venture to say that the people of Australia will condemn the present haphazard, slipshod way of dealing with the defences. One of the chief arguments in favour of Federation was that it would insure efficient defence. If the defence system is not going to be made efficient, then so far will Federation have failed to achieve its object, and so far will the people have a right to complain that they have been deceived. </para>

                        <para>- No, and to judge from their present policy I do not think that the Government propose to run the Department on ordinary common-sense lines. They are simply pottering with the defences without attempting to do anything worthy of the name. I am quite satisfied that it is the business of the Department to supply the war materiels which will be required for the manhood of the country should an emergency arise. All the raw material is to be found here. There is, perhaps, no finer country in the world for the production of iron than Australia. The only proposal which the Government have ever made for utilizing our rich heritage, and making Australia perhaps one of the greatest wealth-producing countries in the world, has been to pay away &#163;250,000 in the shape of iron bonuses. Why do they not propose to spend that sum in the starting of an iron industry, arsenals, and other iron works which are absolutely necessary for the defence of Australia? If we are going to pay away money for the establishment of industries in Australia, let us begin with the establishment of industries which will benefit its defences. Surely common sense dictates that that is the line upon which we ought to proceed. </para>

If we were to run these other branches of the industry, and so educate Australians to the art of making arms, we should have ample work to carry on an iron industry, and the cost, I am satisfied, would be no greater than the cost which we have to bear at the present time for our very unsatisfactory service. </para>

I have lately returned from a visit to the North West coast of Australia. One can see at a glance the menace which Australia has to face at almost every port on that coast. One can see the Asiatics outnumbering the whites by two to one, and Chinese carpenters erecting the only houses in Broome, Derby, and anywhere else where building is going on. The work is all done by Chinese carpenters. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot account for the number of Chinamen in Australia, but I know that there are more Asiatics in Western Australia, more particularly on the North West coast, to-day than there were prior to Federation. Undoubtedly the Japanese outnumber all the others. For instance, at Broome, 70 per cent, of the Asiatics are Japanese. But alongside the Japanese, Chinese carpenters are erecting the largest building which has yet been undertaken there. Not a white man is employed on the job. White men tendered for the work, but they were cut out. What show has a white man to tender successfully against Chinese? Again, at Derby the largest building is being constructed by Chinese carpenters. If one goes to the hotels he will find that they are being run with coloured labour. Some one laughed this morning when I referred to a remark made by a Japanese barman. When serving drinks in an hotel he said, &#34; In the late war it was not Russia that the Japanese were after at all. The Japanese &#39;had whipped the Russians, and were done with them for the time. What they were aiming at was London. That is their object.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- These indications show the way in which the wind is blowing. Just as the Russians have had to face the Japanese, so we may have to do sooner or later. I hope that that day will never come, but the danger of a Japanese invasion exists. In their hour of success, can we expect the Japanese to be superior to the Europeans? Has not success in arms always had one effect upon a nation? Europeans, whether French, German, or English, have always suffered from swelled head as the result of military achievements. Success in war will have the same effect upon the Asiatic imagination as upon the European imagination. Why should we shut our eyes to these dangers? I hold that if we are to have a defence system worthy of Australia, the present policy will have to be altered. To adhere to the present system is only to court disaster some day. The cadet system has been referred to. I am sorry that the same line of policy is being pursued here as in every other branch of the Defence Department. We see a pottering system introduced which bespeaks failure straight away. Why not put into operation at once the resolution which the Senate passed last session ? It suggests an inexpensive and very good way to arm Australians for the purpose of defence, but nothing practical is done. The same pottering policy is pursued with the cadets. These are matters in which the Government should take a more lively interest. Unless they do so, I am quite satisfied that Australia will be disgusted with the policy they are pursuing. </para>

                    <para>.- I intend to move an amendment, because I consider that the Government ought either to be prepared to bring before the Senate sufficient business to keep it occupied, or else should consent to an adjournment sufficiently long to enable all honorable senators to visit their homes. Last session, when three adjournments were proposed, I objected on every occasion, but I met with very little support, as <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> will show. The Minister invariably assured us that he anticipated that there would be enough work to do after the adjournment. But when we met again we found that the business occupied our attention only for a very short time, aird that then there had to be another adjournment. If the Government were really desirous of keeping us well supplied with work, there would be nothing to prevent them bringing before us a number of Bills which are awaiting consideration. In order that I and some other senators may go home we should have to leave Melbourne next Wednesday. We should not reach home for eight clays, and, even if we returned immediately, we should not arrive until three or four days after the Senate had met. If there is to be an adjournment, let it be sufficiently long to enable those senators who are situated as I am to go home. I move - </para>

We have a short session before us. We did not discuss the Address-in-Reply at length, because we desired to proceed with the immense programme of legislation outlined in the GovernorGeneral&#39;s&#39; speech. But now the Government tell us that they have nothing for us to do. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator STANIFORTH</inline>SMITH.Bills of absolutely no importance. They were simply non-contentious measures. We came here prepared to do the work of the country, and now we are told that we can go home again. That is the kind of leadership we have ! It is extraordinary that we should be asked to adjourn before we have considered any of the really important measures mentioned in the Governor-General&#39;s speech. This session must close in October or November. Towards the end an immense amount of ill-considered and ill-digested legislation will be rushed through, and some valuable proposals will be left over for a future occasion. The source of the trouble is that Ministers do not allocate their legislation fairly between the two Houses. The excuse given is, first, that&#39; many of the measures are money Bills, which must be introduced in the other House ; and, secondly, that the members of the House of Representatives are twice as numerous as we are, and, therefore, take twice as long to transact their business. That is partly true, but, at the same time, it must be remembered that the House of Representatives sits four days a week, whilst we sit only three. Further, excluding money Bills, there is no excuse for the Ministry not bringing other important legislation before us early in the session. The Senate is simply becoming a recording House. We are called together merely to assent to something which has been passed by the other House. Unless we make an effective protest against this treatment, the Senate will be put in exactly the same position as if it were the ordinary Upper House of a State Parliament. When the States made their compact, called the Constitution, it was understood that the Senate would have equal rights with the House of Representatives with respect to ordinary legislation. But what is the result? We have in the Cabinet nine Ministers, seven of whom are in the House of Representatives and two in the Senate. We have here only one Minister with a portfolio. That is a very unfair allocation. The distribution of portfolios is also unfair, because the portfolioed Minister in the Senate is generally placed at the head of a Department from which no proposed legislation emanates. We do not have an Amending Defence Bill more than once in two or three years. Therefore, that Minister usually has no departmental legislation of his own to submit. In the House of Representatives the Minister of Home Affairs, or the Minister of Trade and Customs, will introduce, perhaps, a dozen or half-a-dozen measures in a session. I entirely disagree with the policy which has been adopted that each Minister shall introduce the Bills affecting his own Department. It may be very nice for a Minister to introduce the Bills which emanate from his Department, but is he to place his own personal rights and interests before the interests of Parliament and the country ? The consequence of this policy is that the Ministers in the House of Representatives introduce their departmental measures, and. apparently, there is no protest from honorable senators, although we are dismissed, only to return when there is some Bill for us to assent to. For instance, the Bill for the protection of Australian industries is of extreme interest to the people of the Commonwealth. That Bill is being discussed fully and carefully in the House of Representatives, and, naturally enough, the newspapers devote considerable space to the debate. But when that Bill reaches the Senate the people at large are thoroughly tired of it, and have lost all interest, and. as no newspaper is foolish enough, to report a debate on a subject already fully dealt with on another occasion, the public scarcely know that the Senate exists. The effect of making the House of Representatives the initiatory House is that the Senate is relegated to the position of an ordinary Upper Chamber; and so long as I remain a member I shall protest against our occupying that position. I protest against the allocation of portfolios, and of the Bills for introduction, as absolutely unfair and opposed to the contract entered into by the various, Colonies when the Commonwealth was inaugurated. Another result of the policy is that this Senate, in the opinion of the public, becomes simply a recording Chamber; and the position and power of the Senate really depends on the opinion which the people have of the Chamber. Only the other day we had a Melbourne newspaper speaking of the House of Representatives as the people&#39;s House, and of the Senate as a sort of upper or recording Chamber. The absurdity of the position is evident to one who knows the facts, but it is not evident to the people who read the newspapers. Honorable senators are elected on exactly the same franchise, and by exactly the same individuals, the only difference being that our electorates, are States, while the electorates of the House of Representatives are districts. Yet the fact remains that under the system, which it is sought to introduce, this Chamber becomes merely a place for recording the decisions of another place. The Senate is not so much what the framers of the Constitution intended it to be as what honorable senators make it ; and if we submit to being dismissed in a very cavalier manner, on the ground that there are no Bills ready for us, although the Governor-General&#39;s Speech is clogged with measures, the prestige of the Senate is lowered. In the United States the Senate exercises greater power than does the House of Representatives. That is not the position given to the Senate by the United States Constitution : but there were strong men in that Senate, and they made it a strong House. If the Senate is allowed to sink into the position of a mere recording Chamber we shall not get the best men of the community to enter it; and the result will be that the spirit of the compact entered into by the Colonies will not be carried out; the Senate will not exercise the rights and powers intended by the Constitution, and the rights of the smaller States will be jeopardized. The very object, and intention of the bi-cameral system is that the smaller States shall be protected, and not out-voted by the larger States on great national questions - in other words, that the legitimate rights of the smaller States shall be conserved. Those rights are not conserved when we have Ministers who do not allow the Senate to exercise the powers which we undoubtedly possess. </para>

The Audit Bill, for instance, might well have been introduced here, and yet it is proposed that we be dismissed for some weeks. The Senate ought to protest against the allocation of measures, and insist that as many shall be introduced here as in another place, exclusive, of course, of money Bills. </para>

                        <para>- I make this protest, because I represent one of the smaller States, so far as population is concerned. I have no ill-will against this Ministry, any more than I had against any other Ministry, and I hope the present Ministers in this House will not think the contrary. I admit that adjournments are necessary from time to time, but I have always objected and protested when the other House has been dealing with measure after measure, while we have been told there were no Bills ready for us, or that, if Bills were ready, it was desired to introduce them elsewhere. In anything I have said there is nothing of a personal nature. If honorable senators care to take the trouble, they can refer to my speeches, arid they will see that, whenever an adjournment has been proposed, I have opposed it on the ground that the rights of the Senate ought to be preserved. </para>

                    <para>. - Just as&#39; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> yesterday evinced a lack of judicial faculty, so today, I think, he is showing a remarkable failure of appreciation of the practical facts with which we are face to face. I agree with every word <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> has said as to the unbusiness-like method in which the Government have apportioned the business between the two Houses. But how it can be regarded as a protest against the action of the Government, if we penalize honorable senators by bringing them together when there is no work to do, altogether passes my .comprehension. </para>

I should then be inclined to regard his protest as one entitled to our serious consideration. But the fact is that, from various causes - and here I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> - there is absolutely no business on our paper, nor can there be any worthy of serious thought for the next week or two. Are we to be brought from all parts of Australia, or kept waiting here, merely to meet you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> in the afternoon and then adjourn ? That is all very well for an amiable bachelor in the whirl of social engagements, who finds Melbourne an extremely pleasant place; but it is entirely different for those who have home ties, and appreciate them, and who have other business besides that of mere attention to public affairs. I do not think any honorable senator would hesitate to attend when there is work to do; but it is a monstrous proposition that we should be brought over week after week when there is no business. </para>

                        <para>- Those of us who have homes, and other business to attend to, do not desire to be kept here unnecessarily. The Minister of Defence, if he cared to be frank - if he were not under restraint owing to his Ministerial obligations - would, I think, agree with everything, that has been said as to the necessity for a fairer apportionment of the work ; and I hope that before the debate is concluded he will give us some assurance on the point. I am just as &#39; strong as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> or any one else - as my votes and utterances will show - in urging a recognition of the rights of the Senate, and I should be the last to do anything to undermine these rights. But I do not see that we conserve the rights or the dignity of the Senate if we punish a large number of honorable senators by bringing them here when there is nothing to do. For that reason I intend to vote for the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens.</inline> The extra week will give greater facilities to members from distant places, such, as Queensland and Western Australia, to visit their homes ; and, at the same time, the extra week can always, if necessity arises, be made up bv our sitting on Tuesdays. It is a business-like proposition that we should&#39; meet when there is work to do, and meet each .sitting day of the week, and that when there is no work we should adjourn and go home. </para>

                        <para>- If we lose our prestige, it will be due to the readiness with which we have agreed to lengthy adjournments. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> was wrong in attacking <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> as he did. Because that honorable senator happens to carry on his studies here surely he is not to be accused of something which might convey a very wrong impression to the public. When Parliament is not sitting this building has none of the comforts of a club. In such circumstances it is the most cheerless and dismal place one could enter. I sympathize with the desire of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> to return to Cairns, but I would point out that the journey to and fro would occupy sixteen out of the twenty-one days that would be available in the event of a three weeks&#39; adjournment. I also sympathize with the representatives of Western Australia. As for myself, I shall be employed fully as a member of the Tariff Commission. In one respect the suggested adjournment would be advantageous to the Commission, since it would enable it to secure the services of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff, and thereby save expense. I hope that those who support the amendment do not propose to follow the example of a certain honorable senator from New South Wales, who, it is reported&#39;, intends to avail himself of the opportunity to visit Queensland to prepare the way for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid&#39;s</inline> electioneering tour. </para>

                    <para>. - During the last five years I have frequently been asked to vote for special adjournments, on grounds that have generally prevailed with me, but on no occasion has there been such an adjournment as would enable the representatives of Western Australia to return to their homes. The present position is that the notice-paper, so far as Government business is concerned, is practically a blank, and it seems improbable that the Australian Industries Preservation Bill will be sent up from another place within the next fortnight. In these circumstances, as an adjournment seems to be inevitable, surely the representatives of Western Australia have a right to be considered. I am prepared to sit four, five, or six days a week when necessary to dispose of public business. Possibly the carrying of the amendment would teach the Government a useful lesson. It would show them that unless the Government are prepared to give the Senate some business to do, we may, so to speak, take the bit between our teeth, and when the Government are anxious to have a Bill speedily dealt with carry an adjournment against them. I shall vote for the amendment, and if it be rejected I shall vote against any adjournment such as is suggested by the Government. </para>

                    <para>. - Motions of the kind now before us invariably disclose that there is an idea in the minds of some honorable senators that unless this Chamber sits every week on which the House of Representatives does, an attack is being made upon its dignity and its rights. I would remind honorable senators that, whilst there are seventy-five members in the other House, the Senate has a membership of only thirty-six, and that if we apply ourselves to the discussion of all the business that comes before us in the same way as do Members of the House of Representatives, our sittings should only be half the number of those of that Chamber. I know, as other honor- able senators do, thai in the early days of the session the other House meets four days, whilst we sit only three days per week. But even in such circumstances it should be unnecessary for us to sit as many weeks as they do, assuming, of course, that we individually apply the same attention to the discussion- of the measures brought before us as they do. </para>

                        <para>- One very important measure, which evoked a great deal of discussion, was the Copyright Bill. When that Bill was in the early stage of its consideration in Committee, we had honorable senators) addressing themselves to a similar motion to this, and asserting that the Government had no business before the Senate. And yet the final stage in the &#39;consideration of &#39;that! Bill - . not reached for many an hour afterwards. The Government will always have charges of this kind hurled against it on such occasions as the present. We introduced this week in the Senate two Bills, one the Designs Bill, to perfect our legislation with regard to industrial property, and the other a Bill relating to the establishment of the Department of Meteorology. How was the Government to foretell the extent to which honorable senators would address themselves to either of those measures? We were not in the position of prophets, and could not be expected to anticipate that the Senate would deal with those Bill&#39;s so satisfactorily and expeditiously as it did. I congratulate honorable senators upon the attitude they took up with regard to those measures. We are glad that they have advanced these measures so far that they have been transmitted to the other House. But that House, for the reasons I stated, does not proceed so quickly with measures as we do. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> says that the Government is simply crowding the notice-paper of another place with business. But what do we find upon referring to its notice-paper for to-day ? The first order of the day is the resumption of the debate on the second reading of the Australian Industries Preservation Bill. </para>

                        <para>- That is only one Bill. The Senate has already dealt with three Bills. The second order of the day on the notice-paper of the other House for to-day is the second reading of the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Survey Bill. &#39;Honorable senators know that constitutionally it  could not be introduced here. The third order of the day is the consideration in Committee of the GovernorGeneral&#39;s Message relating to the Audit Bill, and the fourth order of the day is the second reading of that Bill. Really, those two orders of the day can, for present purposes, be taken together as practically one. The fifth and sixth orders of the day are Supply and Ways and Means, that is to say, further consideration in Committee. These orders of the day must be associated with the Supply Bill, which the other House has passed, and with which we dealt to-day. The Senate had on its notice-paper for to-day the Designs Bill, the Meteorology Bill, and the Supply Bill, while the other House has practically upon its notice-paper for to-day the Australian Industries Preservation Bill, the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Survey Bill, and the Audit Bill. </para>

                        <para>- So far as all these matters are concerned, the Government have not neglected the interests of the Senate. We have to remember the relative numerical strength of the two Houses when we come to consider whether the Senate should be always asked to sit for the simple and sole reason that the other House is sitting. That, it seems to me, is the underlying fallacious idea in the minds of some honorable senators who have spoken to this question of adjournment. </para>

                        <para>- My honorable colleague has moved the adjournment of the Senate to a certain date. I understood that long before this discussion began there was a common understanding on the part of honorable senators generally and my honorable colleague that an adjournment was to take place about this time, and that it was to be for a fortnight. Of course, if I was under a misapprehension in that respect I must suffer the consequences, but I merely rose for the purpose of pointing out that in determining whether the Senate&#39;s privileges and rights are being assailed we must bear in mind the fact that we have only half the numerical strength of the other House, and that in discussing public matters we are not disposed to enter into so much controversy, perhaps, as its members do on points which are not directly involved. </para>

                    <para>.- The question of adjourning is getting a very serious one, and upon the whole my sympathies are with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith.</inline> But I quite admit that there is no use in bringing honorable senators here if there is no business for them to do. I believe, however, that with a little more thought and arrangement there might have been, and I believe there is, business to be done next week. The session is bound to be exceedingly short. Every effort ought to be made to hold the elections early in November. It is quite likely, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> suggests, that at the end of the session we shall be slaughtering &#34;innocents&#34; because we have more measures than we can deal with. We ought to go on with work if we can get it, and take a holiday afterwards. I admit that it may be necessary to take a holiday occasionally owing to the fact that in ordinary circumstances we must sit much less frequently than the other House. But I contend that we ought to take our holiday later on when there is absolutely no work to do. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has the Eminent Domain Bill to proceed with next week, and I understand that there is a Quarantine Bill which he could have to go on with. I was astonished at the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> the other day that two Bills had been introduced into&#39; the other House which might have been introduced here, and that he was not aware that they were going to be originated there. I gathered from his remarks that not one moment&#39;s consideration had been given by the Cabinet to the question of how the work was to be alloted between the Houses. Honorable senators have a perfect right to complain thai more attention has not been given to this important matter. I would ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> whether he thinks it right and proper for the other House to commence its work with the consideration of the most contentious Bill of the session, and then for him to tell us that there is no work for the Senate? Next week the other House ought to drop the Australian Industries Preservation Bill for the time being and deal with the Statistician Bill and&#39; the High Court Judge Bill, so as to give us some work by the end of next week. I do not believe that the other House has ever paid the slightest attention to all our protests, and it seems determined to ignore us. The two Ministers I see before me are quite sufficient to protect the dignity and rights of the Senate if they would only act. Why do they not act? </para>

                        <para>- I do not think so. I recognise the folly of coming here if there is no work to be done, but I believe that there is work to be done next week. If the consideration of the Australian Industries Preservation Bill were delayed for a week there might be work provided for the Senate for the week afterwards, and then if we saw no work ahead for two or three weeks, we could adjourn. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> has practically, admitted that there has been no attempt to arrange the business so as to give the Senate work. The moment we assembled he began to talk about giving us a three weeks&#39; holiday. I have never left my business previously, in such inconvenient circumstances as I did. I put off matters of very great importance. I had to give them over to others in order to come here, merely to be told that I could have a three weeks&#39; holiday. If we had only ..received a circular saving that in the circumstances there would not be much work to be done for two or three months, we might have made different arrangements. I was rather astonished to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> say that if &#34;he cannot get an adjournment for three weeks he will oppose the proposal for any adjournment, and compel the Senate to meet, although he knows that there is no business to submit. I do not believe that he will do anything so unjust. As there is a difference between honorable senators, I think that the Government should adhere to their motion. </para>

                    <para>. - - I have no desire to interfere with the convenience of the Queensland and Western Australian senators, who have told us that a fortnight&#39;s adjournment would be useless to them. But I am opposed to all such adjournments, and should like to see the motion defeated. If, however, there is to be an adjournment, we may as well meet the convenience of as many honorable senators as we can. Trouble of this kind will constantly arise while successive Governments take up the same attitude towards the Senate as the present Government does. Until we have another portfolioed Minister in the Senate, we shall never be satisfactorily treated. While I have a high appreciation of the work of the two Ministers who are in charge of business here, I think that a proper share of legislative business is no!) being initiated in this Chamber, as would be the case if we had two Ministers with portfolios here. The Bill that is occupying the attention of another place to-day might just as well have been introduced in the Senate. Although we are told that there is a constitutional difficulty about initiating the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Survey Bill, I am not sure that that difficulty could not have been got over either by submitting a declaratory resolution or in some other way. </para>

                        <para>- B - But those measures were not contentious. The Amending Electoral Bill, for instance, cannot be said to have been a- contentious measure. Nothing like the same number of contentious measures have bean introduced into the Senate as were initiated here in the first . session of the first Parliament. I am opposed to an adjournment for any term. </para>

                    <para>- I see no necessity for the Senate to adjourn. A forecast appeared in the Australian newspapers prior to the commencement of this session, from which most of us were under the impression that there would be a considerable amount of work to do. We drew the inference that there would be sufficient to keep both Houses going. We have had only six meeting days, and we are now informed that there is practically nothing for us to do. If that is the way in which business is to be conducted, the ultimate effect will be that very few senators from distant parts of the Commonwealth will think it worth while to come to Melbourne until a month or two after Parliament has been called together. They will simply say, &#34; Judging from previous experience, it it of no use to go down to Melbourne for a week or two. There is bound to be an adjournment after a few days.&#34; The result will be that the Senate will be looked&#39; upon as a great deal worse than many Upper Houses are in the States. It is the fault of the Government, that we have not enough work to do. It is their business to furnish measures for us to discuss. I am well aware that there are only half as many senators as there are members of the House of Representatives, but it must be recollected that while: we sit only about seven hours per day, three days a week, the other place sits eight and ten hours, sometimes longer, four days a week. In spite of what has been said as to suiting the convenience of some honorable senators, it is quite outside the duty of this Senate to arrange its. business in accordance with the distance from Melbourne that some of us happen to. live. We are selected to do the work of the country. I can quite conceive of a senator from Western Australia living, perhaps at Broome, or somewhere in the far north. An adjournment for any time less than two months would not enable him to go home. It is not the duty of the Senate, in arranging its business, to consider where senators live. I shall vote against any adjournment. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know that the motion means so much, now that it has been amended, as it meant before. I could understand the arguments that are used by some honorable senators if they referred to land held in very small areas in places where an industry has been created by the rabbits as a commercial commodity. But, from the point of view of other States interested, the rabbit pest is a very large and important question. We are told that there are a number of men employed in the rabbit industry in New South Wales and Victoria, but in Queensland there is no industry in this connexion except that which is carried on by men altogether employed in the destruction of rabbits as a pest. No question of food supply arises in Queensland ; while millions of rabbits are destroyed in that State, not one goes into consumption as food or as a means of supplying skins or fur. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know that they are quite as poor as are the people in the State which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> represents. At any rate, at one time Queens land had the greatest debt per head in Australia, but that honour, I think, is now enjoyed by South Australia, which is to that extent poorer than any other State of the Union. The rabbit pest has come to Queensland, not from the coast, but from South Australia and New South Wales. Possibly the country over which the rabbits previously ran was so bad that they, like other animals, migrated to where they could obtain the best food supply. Anything that can be done to relieve our big primary industries from this plague would do a great deal of good to Australia as a whole, putting aside those employed in catching and preparing rabbits for export or consumption within the Commonwealth. Up to the present time Queensland has expended a very large amount in its efforts to cope with this pest. I have figures supplied in the annual report of the Queensland Department of Public Lands for 1904; and it appears that the estimated length of all rabbit-proof fences at the end of that year was: - Government border fences, 732 miles; Board fences, 5,250 miles; pastoral lessees&#39; fences, estimated, 7,825 miles; grazing selectors&#39; fences, estimated, 1,655 miles - a total of 15,462 miles. All this fencing has been erected with the object of coping with the pest, and, in addition, the keeping of the fencing in order has involved considerable expenditure. During the last few months there have been floods in that part of the country, and, in order to repair the breakaways, a number of men, in addition to the ordinary boundary riders employed by the Rabbit Boards, and others, have had to be engaged. These breakaways are a source of considerable danger, because they may leave it open to the rabbits to invade country which may be regarded as to some extent clean. According to the same report, the total cost of the measures taken against the rabbit pest in Queensland is, approximately, as follows: - Cost of border fences, &#163;199,424 ; loans to Boards, &#163;49,884 ; netting supplied to Boards, &#163;165,346 ; assessments on run -holders, &#163;427,250; interest paid by run-holders - on netting to the value of &#163;98,916 3s. 4d., supplied by the Government - and paid over to the Board, &#163;28,631 ; Central Board expenditure, &#163;90,536 ; cost of private fences over and above the cost of ordinary fences, estimated, &#163;335,000 - a total of &#163;1,296,071. </para>

                            <para>- That is so, and? not a penny-piece has been realized in Queensland from rabbits as a commercial commodity. This question was raised last year, and it was pointed out that in such country as that to which I refer, where land is held in very large areas, it is almost useless to attempt to cope with the pest until their is sub-division. It may be comparatively easy to deal with the pest in settled districts, where 5,000 acres is considered a large holding; but in southern Queensland, where one run may comprise 2,500 or 3,000 miles of country, considerable expenditure must be undertaken. We have experienced great difficulty in Queensland, and the cry of the damage caused by rabbits has frequently been raised by some persons with a view of getting their land from the Crown at a reduced rental. As the result of the drought, and the invasion of the State by rabbits, the rental value of land in Queensland has been reduced, and the revenue has suffered by the re-appraisement of land so visited. The havoc wrought by the rabbit pest, as well as by seasons of drought, has caused an area more than half the size of Victoria to be thrown up. I think it is reasonable to provide1 that, as long as the introduction of these microbes might prove inimical to human and other animal life in Australia, we should keep a firm hand on the. experiments ; but I am glad that the motion has been amended by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe.</inline> As it stands, it will enable steps to be taken to rid Australia of the rabbit pest, in She event of the experiments proving satisfactory, and I do not think any one who is familiar with the back country of the Commonwealth, would hesitate to say that every rabbit here should be destroyed, </para>

                            <para>; - - I have only to say in reply that I trust the motion will be carried. Those who have opposed it have done so only on the ground that we should not prevent the experiments being carried on outside the laboratory, as soon as it has been demonstrated to the satisfaction of all parties that experiments so conducted would be harmless. I think that the motion, as amended, ought to meet the views of these honorable senators. If the scientists appointed to watch the proceedings on behalf of the Government are satisfied that experiments conducted outside the laboratory would be harmless, the motion will not prevent the adoption of that course. </para>
