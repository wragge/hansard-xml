It has been thought that such use or operation would be difficult of proof, and accordingly the grounds of cancellation have now been made to relate to the actual subject-matter broadcast.

Under this amendment he is given an opportunity to warn wireless stations not to broadcast seditious matter. </para>

                <para>SenatorRAE (New South Wales) [3.41].  -  While the amendment moved in another place may have slightly improved the original provision, I cannot see that it affords any reasonable protection to these wireless stations. According to the bill, the Postmaster-General will decide whether matters are seditious or otherwise unlawful. </para>

                    <para>- But he can give his interpretation as to whether a statement over the air is seditious or otherwise, and being a member of the Ministry, his interpretation is likely to be one-sided. He may class an utterance as seditious, and before his decision can be upset, the opportunity to deliver the goods is gone. Day after day, this Government declaims against the political control of enterprise. Political interference in State enterprise is a small matter compared with the interference with the rights and liberty of the citizens by a partisan Minister. It is a deliberate breach of the fine spun theories of honorable senators opposite about the glorious liberties of the people. </para>

                        <para>- That is an improvement to a most barbarous provision, but it is still objectionable to leave it. to the discretion of a partisan Minister to say whether or not an utterance over the wireless should be the subject of a prosecution. When we were dealing with the Australian Broadcasting Commission Bill, we were told that <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> Postmaster-General would merely look after the technical side of broadcasting and that all other matters would be controlled by the commission. In other words, an impartial tribunal would decide such matters. This clause, however, provides that a Minister who must necessarily be partisan, may come to a biased decision with regard to the renewal of a licence. Why set up a broadcasting commission and deprive it of this function? </para>

                    COLEBATCH (Western Australia) [3.48].  -  I understand that if a wireless station broadcasts propaganda of an unlawful association, the Postmaster-General can cancel its  licence, but only after the association has been declared unlawful by the court. There we have the safeguard of the court stepping in. Undoubtedly, the broadcasting of seditious propaganda should be suppressed, but I want to he clear on the point as to whether the amendment cuts out the reference to the court and makes the Postmaster-General the final arbiter. If so, is there to be no appeal? Is it right to leave to the Postmaster-General unfettered discretion to decide whether certain matter is seditious or otherwise, and to cancel a licence? I should like to know whether the holder of a licence will have any chance of appealing against the decision of the Minister or whether he can have his case heard before a court?

Section 30a of the principal act led to a discussion between <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brennan</inline> and myself whether or not it operated as a definition section. That section sets out all the things which make an association unlawful. The House of Representatives has added a new paragraph to cover " any seditious matter". Seditious matter is defined by section 24a of the Crimes Act. Proposed new section 30fb, as it left this chamber, contained the words, " and where any licence so issued has expired, shall refuse to renew the licence ". That provision another place regards as too drastic. Honorable members there consider that it is sufficient that the Postmaster-General should first warn an offending station, and then, should heed not be paid to that warning, he is empowered to refuse to renew the licence. Should he refuse to renew a licence without a sufficient reason, the holder of the licence may have recourse to the common law, in which case the Postmaster-General would be responsible for his action. </para>

It may be that, during the temporary absence of the officer in charge of a broadcasting station, propaganda which is considered undesirable is broadcast ; and, although the authorities controlling the station might not be responsible, they would be liable to punishment under this legislation. </para>

                        <para>- I submit that the amendment proposed by the honorable senator is not relevant. Standing Order 224 provides that when a bill has been returned with amendments from another place, the discussion shall be confined to those amendments, and that any amendment proposed must be relevant to the amendment made by another place. In the committee stage of the bill the  Chairman  ruled that an amendment on exactly the same lines as that now suggested by the honorable senator could not be moved. I do not think that it is competent to discuss it now. </para>

If it is competent for the Senate to debate the motion for the adoption of the report, it must also be competent for it to reject it if a majority of the Senate should so desire. That being the case, surely the object in moving for the recommittal of the clause is to enable us to retrace our steps, and to give the Senate one more opportunity to consider a measure of vital importance. </para>

In these circumstances I cannot permit any discussion of the amendment : why it was brought before the committee or why it was ruled out of order.

Due consideration should be given to panic legislation of this . character, and I think it would be advantageous if the adoption of the report were postponed to give those interested an opportunity to peruse the arguments advanced for and against the measure and thus allay that feeling of alarm and panic that is in existence with respect to the action of the Government in rushing this legislation through.

The committee stage has passed, but if honorable senators wish to disagree with the motion for the adoption of the report they may do so. An honorable senator, however, is not entitled at this stage to submit an amendment of an amendment made by another place, nor can such an amendment now be discussed. The question before the Chair is " That the report be now adopted ", the essence of the motion being the word " now ". </para>

                            <para>- One of the underlying principles of parliamentary practice is that no member shall say or do anything that is offensive or objectionable to his fellow members. Guidance on this point is furnished by rulings of former Presidents of the Senate. At page 34, volume 1, of <inline font-style="italic">Rulings of the</inline> President <inline font-style="italic">of the Senate</inline><inline font-weight="bold">(Sir R. C. Baker),</inline> from 1903 to 1906, under the heading <inline font-style="italic">"Procedure. In Cases not provided for. President to stale procedure" ,</inline> I find the following: - 277. On the 18th May, 1904 (H., p. 1262- 1266), the Senate adopted, <inline font-style="italic">inter alia,</inline> the following recommendation of the Standing Orders Committee: - " That in any case which may arise which has not been provided for by the rules, or in which the rules appear insufficient or manifestly incorrect, the  President  shall state to the Senate (after mature consideration if possible), what, in his opinion, is the best procedure to adopt; in the event of no objection being taken by the Senate, this shall be the procedure until altered by the Senate." </para>
                        </talk.start>
                        <para class="block">As I have already said, an underlying principle of the conduct of honorable senators is that they shall not do or say anything that is offensive to their fellow senators. I intend to uphold that principle to the fullest possible extent. For that reason I ruled that, objection having been taken by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thompson</inline> to the presence in the Senate chamber of this work of art, on the ground that it was offensive to him, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline> was not in order in exhibiting such work of art on the desk in front of him, and that it must be removed. It is from that ruling that the honorable senator has moved to disagree. </para><division>

                    <para>The 1930 Cotton Industries Bounty Act provided for the following bounties until  the 30th September, 1932:- Seed cotton, 1Â½d. per lb. on high grades and \ d.' per lb. on low grades. Cotton yarn, <inline font-style="italic">$d.</inline> per count per lb. up to a maximum of ls. per lb. from count 41 upwards. Each year from the 1st October, 1932, these rates were to be progressively reduced by one-sixth of the full bounty, and all bounties were to cease after the 30th September, 1936. The Financial Emergency Act 1931, imposed a further reduction of 20 per cent, on these bounties. </para>
                    <para>The bill provides for the total abolition of the bounty on all cotton yarn delivered from a factory after the 30th June, 1932, for two reasons, namely: (1) To relieve the Commonwealth budget of the heavy and rapidly-increasing burden of yarn bounty payments, which rose from Â£30,001 in 1926-1927 to an estimate of Â£120,000 in 1931-1932; and (2) because it is a well-established practice to replace a bounty with a customs duty in cases, such as cotton yarn, where the local production is substantially meeting Australian requirements. The bounty on yarn has accordingly been replaced by equivalent customs duties under Item 392(a)  -  cotton yarns n.e.i. - which were tabled on the 3rd instant. The duties give to the manufacturer practically the same amount of protection that he enjoyed under the bounty. There is practically no difference between these proposals and the recommendation of the Tariff Board made in December, 1930, the assistance under the former amounting to 8.15d. per lb. compared with 8.84d. per lb. On the same price basis for count 16, the total assistance now proposed is much less than the Scullin Government's final policy; but, despite that fact, the Queensland Cotton Board and the various spinners have signified their satisfaction with it. The Scullin Government's final assistance, including primage, ad valorem duty, flat rate duty and bounty, amounted to 14.31d. per lb., whereas this proposal amounts to 9.05d. per lb. </para>
                    <para>The Government has arranged for the spinners to buy all the Queensland 1932 crop at a minimum of 7jd. per lb., plus grade and staple premiums - or only Jd. per lb. less than last year's minimum. </para>
                    <para>The Government has also arranged that the spinners shall not increase their present selling prices for yarns as from the 1st July, 1932, by more than the cancelled bounty on any count. Spinners who have not already reduced last year's prices by 10 per cent, will make such a reduction before adding the cancelled bounty. The spinners have undertaken (a) not to increase the new maximum selling prices unless the present costs of production are increased by circumstances beyond their control; and (6) to sell to outside customers at prices equivalent to those at which all yarns are charged to the spinners' own knitting or weaving departments. </para>

                    </para>
                    <para class="block">The items making up these sums are based on the appropriations passed by Parliament for the present year and represent approximately one-sixth of the appropriation with further provision to cover the first pay day in September. </para>
                    <para>In addition the usual provisions are made for refunds of revenue and advance to the Treasurer. The amount set down for refunds of revenue is Â£200,000, and for advance to the Treasurer, Â£1,000,000. This latter item is required mainly to cover exchange on remittances to London, and also to carry on uncompleted works in progress on the 30th June, 1932. </para>
                    <para>Before the expiration of the period of twomonths which is covered by this bill, it is anticipated that the budget and Estimates will be brought down to Parliament. Perhaps honorable senators will be interested to know what is the budget position, so far as we can forecast it, for the present year. When the budget was brought down on the 10th July, the estimated deficit was Â£5,176,000. At that time the Hoover moratorium was discussed, but had not finally been settled. The budget was accordingly based on the existing interest liabilities, but it was indicated that if the Hoover plan were brought into operation the relief would be Â£4,028,000, and the budget deficit would be reduced to Â£1,148,000. On the revenue side, so far as we can see at the present time, the indications are that there will be decreases in customs and excise,sales - tax, post office and railways revenue. 'On the other hand we expect increases in income tax revenue and in profits from the note issue. The arrears of income tax assessments brought forward into this year proved very much larger than anticipated and heavy collections were received in the first half of the year. A substantial increase on the budget estimate is assured. It is remarkable how the people have responded, and how resilient the country has proved, notwithstanding depressed conditions. The net loss of revenue will be offset by increases in other items. There will probably be an improvement on the revenue side of our account by a little over Â£1,000,000. </para>
                    <para>On the expenditure side there will be some increases which could not be foreseen when the budget was framed. Unemployment relief works, for which no provision was made in the budget, will account for Â£250,000. There will also be increases in old-age pensions, war pensions, road grants to States, and contributions to sinking fund. After allowing for some decreases, notably in the post office, the net increase in expenditure will he somewhere about Â£1,000,000. The present indications are, therefore, that we shall not exceed the budget deficit estimated to be Â£1,148,000, and may finish up the year a little better than that. </para>

I hope that in the amending bill to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene</inline> has referred, further provision will be made for them. </para>

When the matter was discussed at the last Premiers Conference, the raising of this sura was regarded merely as an interim measure, pending the development of a fuller scheme, which is to be debated at a conference to be held in Canberra on 21st June next. At that conference the whole question of unemployment will be dealt with in a more comprehensive way. The expenditure of Â£3,000,000 was merely intended to tide us over the winter. </para>

                    <para>Provision is never made in general appropriation bills for special grants to the States. These grants are always covered by special appropriations covering a term of years. It is true that the Western Australian grant expires on the 30th June next, but that is a matter which, in common with other matters affecting other States, I regret to say, must be considered carefully at the forthcoming Premiers Conference. If the financial circumstances of the Commonwealth permit it, provision will have to be made for all the States that find themselves in the same position as Western Australia. </para>

                    <para class="block">The object of this bill is to appropriate from the Consolidated Revenue Fund a further Â£10,000,000 for the payment of war pensions. The measure does not deal in any way with the rates of pensions, or the conditions governing the granting of pensions; it merely asks Parliament to make provision for the payment of those pensions which have been, or will be, granted under the Australian Soldiers Repatriation Act relating to war pensions. The last appropriation was made by Parliament in August, 1930, the amount then appropriated being Â£10.000,000. The balance of the appropriation unexpended at 30th April last was Â£1,483,795, which is insufficient to cover the payments that will become due while Parliament is in recess. </para>

She has a daughter, but the girl is unfit for work. When the department discovered that the mother had about Â£250 in the bank, it disallowed the pension which she drew in respect of her deceased sons. I do not know whether that is a matter with which I may deal now. </para>

                    <para class="block">This measure is identical with that which we have just passed, in that it seeks to provide from the Consolidated Revenue the sum of Â£10,000,000. In this case, however, the appropriation is for the payment of invalid and old-age pensions. The measure has nothing whatever to do with the rate of pensions or the conditions under which they are payable. The usual practice is for an appropriation of Â£10,000,000 to be made from the Consolidated Revenue Fund, and to be placed from time to time in the trust account from which the pensions are paid. The total appropriation for this purpose up to date is Â£131,250,000, of which Â£129,857,370, had actually been expended up to the 30th April, leaving a balance of Â£1,392,630. Since the rate of expenditure is now more than Â£11,000,000 a year, it will be seen that that balance will be insufficient to meet the payments which will become due to the end of June next. It is, therefore, necessary to appropriate a further amount of Â£10,000,000. 1 </para>

                    <para>. -  The first reading of this bill provides an opportunity to inquire whether the delegates to the Ottawa Conference have received, or will receive, any instructions in connexion with the Singapore Naval Base. If anything is to be said on this matter, I urge that the delegates be instructed to make it clear that, in the best interests of Australia, the work at the Singapore Naval Base should be proceeded with, and that if further money is required for its completion and equipment, Australia would assist, according to her ability to pay. The construction of a naval base at Singapore does not conflict . with the decisions of the Washington Conference. Owing to its geographical position, a naval base at Singapore affords a wonderful protection to Australia. Singapore is the converging point of a number of trade routes, and as on land -the nation which holds the point where a number of mountain passes converge can be said to hold the passes themselves, so a nation which controls the converging point of a number of searoutes can be said, practically to control those trade routes also. Should the subject come up for discussion at the conference, our delegates should make it known that Australia desires the work to be completed as early as possible, and to that end is willing to share in the cost, if necessary. The world position is not without its dangers. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George said recently that Europe is an armed camp. In that case, while doing all we can to strengthen the League of Nations with a view to bringing about world peace, we should prepare for possibilities. </para>

                <para>It appears that Parliament is to adjourn without any decision being arrived at in connexion with the Government's tariff proposals, although fiscal matters were prominent in the last election campaign. Six months have elapsed since the election took place. There should be no unnecessary delay in discussing the tariff schedule. The attitude of the previous Government in delaying consideration- of the tariff was strongly opposed by honorable senators on this side of the chamber, who now find that the Government they are supporting appears to be adopting a similar policy. As the public demand an easing of tariff burdens so that this country may make better economic and industrial progress, it is the duty of this Government to give Parliament an opportunity to go into the whole tariff in order to remove some of the heavy burdens at present being carried by certain industries. When an appeal was made to the people, they returned a government which had promised to preserve a better balance between those industries which in the past have had too much protection and certain other industries struggling under the burden of excessively high tariff duties. I trust that the Government will bring the tariff before this chamber at least before Christmas. If we continue to live on promises we shall be included in that class of despised politicians which we have condemned. Unless prompt action is taken we shall be told that our promises' have been dishonoured. I urge the Government to take stock of its position and introduce at the earliest possible moment a substantial instalment of the tariff, which will enable us to give effect, to some extent, to some of the undertakings we entered into prior to the last general election,. </para>

                    <para>[5.22].  -  I can assure the honorable senator that the Senate will have every opportunity to deal with the tariff before very long. The Government proposes to give full effect to its election promises, notwithstanding the rumours and insinuations to the contrary. If the honorable senator will look up the record of prohibitions in force when this Government took office, he will find that at least 50 have been removed. He should also realize that further reductions in customs duties, dating back to the 1928 tariff, have been made, owing to resolutions of the previous Government having lapsed.' These reductions, which are substantial, are not mentioned by our critics. In addition, the Government has considered every Tariff Board report that has come to hand, in accordance with the promises made to the electors, and further reports will soon be  available which will enable the Government to deal in a substantial manner with other tariff items. Before the end of this year the honorable senator will have no reason to believe that the Government and its supporters have not honoured their promises in the way they said they would be honoured. </para>

We are, however, fully seised of its importance, and if the opportunity occurs, our representatives will advocate its early completion. </para>

Quite recently the Reverend J. Burton, the retiring  President  of the New South Wales Methodist Conference, said, " Armaments are not protective but provocative, and therein lies the danger to civilization ". I trust that the delegates to the Ottawa conference will devote their attention to problems of, international trade and commerce, the means of relieving unemployment, and the cancellation of war debts instead of wasting their time on matters such as the Singapore Naval Base. </para>

                    <para class="block">This is a small measure, the purpose of which is to amend the act passed recently by the Senate. As honorable senators know, the object of that legislation was to raise the sum of Â£3,000,000 for expenditure under conditions that were laid down by the States and the Commonwealth. This proposal aims at the raising of money in some cases, and generally, at expenditure to the best advantage. The amount provided for under the act is to be neither increased nor diminished. Under the original proposal, the money was to be borrowed from, or through, the Commonwealth Bank on terms approved by the Loan Council in April last, principally by the issue of treasury-bills discounted at 4 per cent. Except in the case of New South Wales, it was to be expended by the Governments of the States, or granted or lent to local bodies to be expended by them on substantial works, preferably those of a reproductive character. </para>
                    <para>The scheme is to be amended by providing that, as far as possible, the money shall be raised by local governing bodies and other statutory authorities constituted under Commonwealth and State laws. Such borrowings are to be arranged by the statutory bodies directly from, or through, the Commonwealth Bank, and these bodies are to be responsible for the repayment of the principal amount. Where the local bodies cannot raise loans in that way, they may be assisted by the Government concerned by grants or by loans, or by both, the object being that the money shall be spent principally through the local bodies rather than through government departments. </para>
                    <para>Where moneys are borrowed directly by statutory bodies in New South Wales, the Commonwealth may contribute towards the interest to an extent not exceeding 4 per cent, per annum.' Where moneys are borrowed by statutory bodies in other States,- the Commonwealth and the State concerned may each contribute towards the interest to the extent of not more than 2 per cent, per annum. </para>
                    <para>As far as possible, expenditure under the scheme is to be on reproductive works, in a manner calculated to provide the greatest possible amount of employment. Works which may be recommended and approved will include the following: - </para>

                    <para>In any case where money is lent by the Commonwealth in New South Wales, any interest payable by the person or body to whom it is lent, and any repayments in respect of it are to be payable to the Commonwealth. </para>
                    <para>Where similar loans are made by a State out of Commonwealth moneys, any repayment of principal, or any payment of interest to the State, is to be repaid by the State to the Commonwealth. </para>
                    <para>Honorable senators will notice that this alteration of the 'law is advantageous in several ways. First, it enables the money to be raised directly by the authorities concerned, without adding in any way to the floating debt of the Commonwealth, and at the same time it gives to local governing bodies just as full facilities as though the money was raised by the Commonwealth and the States. In other words, the methods adopted under the original proposal are to be extended and improved. I feel sure that this will have the approval of every member of the Senate. </para>

                            <para>- The reason for that is obvious. New South Wales refused to come into the scheme, consequently the Commonwealth had to find the whole of the money to be expended in that State. In such a case this measure a.authorizes the Commonwealth to forego interest to the extent of 4 per cent. Where a State is finding half the money, it is authorized to contribute towards the interest to the extent of 2 per cent., the remaining 2 per cent, being borne by the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>. - This method of relieving unemployment can be considerably improved. In the past, relief expenditure was incurred where it was considered warranted. In this case, however, local governing bodies, or even individuals, may be entrusted with the expenditure so long as they absorb some of the unemployed. Under such conditions, we can hardly escape from the position that some local authorities, which have more push or, as the Americans call it, urge, will obtain a big lump of money from both the Commonwealth and the States, and a certain amount of improvement will be effected to their territory on very easy terms; whereas another local authority, whose affairs are managed by persons who are not able to push so strenuously, may be left out of account. </para>

                            <para>- That is unthinkable. There is not a local authority in Australia that does not want something. There may be 60 or 70 local bodies in suburban areas, and under this bill it will be manifestly impossible to give all of them what one may term even fractional or worth while support. Those whose affairs are managed by men who can impress on the employment council the value of their proposals, will succeed in having the work approved; whereas others will be left out in the cold and will not have a penny-piece spent within their areas. That is not even-handed justice. </para>

                    <para>The Minister has asked me to suggest what ought to be done. We must call upon those local authorities who benefit from the expenditure, to repay the money. The terms can be made as easy as possible. In addition to making available this sum of money, it is also proposed to share the interest burden, so that those local governing bodies which participate in the scheme will enjoy a double advantage. As the fundamental purpose of the measure is to provide relief for the unemployed, I suggest that the revenues derived from the works constructed under it, should after payment of interest charges, be set aside in a special fund to extend employment in other directions. If, for example, a local governing body in one of the suburbs of Sydney obtains an advance for the purpose of extending its sewerage system, the revenue from the scheme should be ear-marked for future useful works. The distribution of this money should be on a strictly business footing. </para>

If this Parliament makes available for local governing bodies funds for expenditure on local government work, it should also provide against the bodies concerned taking advantage of the economic distress of the manhood and womanhood of Australia. The " sweater " in industry should not be encouraged. If this Parliament stands for anything, it stands for the observance of a reasonable standard of living for the working people of this country. No body or individual should have access to public funds on such favorable terms except on the express undertaking that the rates of pay and the conditions of labour are those prescribed by arbitration courts or wages boards tribunals. </para>

This being so, we should not shut our eyes to the position that confronts us. We could not, if we would, alter the progress of events or prevent what is happening. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> is well aware that rationing has been applied in several Commonwealth and State public departments, with the result that the employees affected are not actually receiving award rates of pay. Even in the Australian Workers Union, of which the honorable senator is  president,  instructions were issued recently that the award rates, which in normal times are properly observed, need not be insisted upon,  for the simple reason that employers are not in a position to pay them. </para>

                            <para>- I am informed that instructions have been issued to the representatives of the Australian Workers Union in that State not to insist upon the observance of award rates and conditions. The honorable senator's amendment might be all right in normal times, but, unfortunately, we are now living in abnormal and most distressful times. The honorable gentleman is asking this committee to approve of what he would not do as a private individual. If he had money to disperse among the unemployed, he would not deal out the whole of it to the first of his friends whom he might meet. On the contrary, he would think that as, in all probability, he would later meet a number of others who were equally in need of assistance, it would be better to distribute this assistance evenly among the whole of them. That is what is intended under this proposal. As for the honorable gentleman's allegations against the " sweater " in industry, he must know that sweating is almost non-existent. Our duty is to face the facts and give the maximum of practical assistance to those in need of it. The  money  now proposed to be spent must not be shovelled out as it has been in the past, and no proper return got for it. In Western Australia 1 have seen men long past the age of usefulness getting 2s. an hour on road work. The farmers alongside could not afford to pay that rate for labour. The fair thing is to give a reasonable dividend to every man rather than pay inordinately high rates of wages to a few. If we insist on the payment of award rates in the expenditure of this money, a favoured few will share all the bounty while others starve. Does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> want that? </para>

                        <para>.- It is possibly right that this proposed expenditure should be spread over as wide a field as possible, but there are many people in this country who openly and brazenly advocate that men should work for just sufficient to keep them in tucker. I want to make sure that whatever money this Government is responsible for collecting from the taxpayers is not spent  in  that way. There was nearly  a  revolution in New Zealand the other day when the Dominion Government decided not to pay any dole and compel men to work for their tucker. I do not want Our Government to lead itself to anything of that nature. If rationing is necessary, all right. When I was Assistant Minister for Works  a  deputation of Canberra men waited on me and asked that they be rationed. They pointed out that there was not enough work going to keep all employed full time, and that there was nothing further afield if they left Canberra. Even if employment was offering outside the Territory they had not sufficient money to get away. I listened to their request and agreed  that  it was a fair one. I have no objection to any body of workmen  sharing their  crusts with their mates if they want to do so, but I will not be a party to allowing a free and open go to the sweating element of this country. I, therefore, hope that it will be provided in this bill that any municipal authority taking advantage of this expenditure will observe the rates of wages and labour conditions laid down by an Arbitration Court or Wages Board. I cannot understand why any member of this Parliament should object to such a proposal unless he is an open advocate of wiping out all the arbitration awards. </para>

                        <para>. -  I trust that the Government will see the wisdom of making some provision in this bill on the lines suggested in the amendment. In no circumstances should we countenance any authority utilizing this money and paying less than the basic wage or insisting on longer hours of labour than are set out in arbitration awards. Any authority anxious to avoid the observance of award conditions should apply to the Arbitration Court for a variation of the awards applying to the workers employed by it, thus giving to employees and their representatives an opportunity to state their case to the tribunal adjudicating on the claim. It is unreasonable to expect a man to give a week's work for 20s. and pay house rent and keep his family. The employment given as a result of this bill should not be on the basis of what is equivalent to the amount now paid by way of dole. It is all right for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> to talk the way he does, but if he had ever been a navvy he would know that 2s. an hour is not too much pay for the work that such a man does. How would the honorable senator stand up to eight hours a day navvying? No man now on the dole could do it. Starving people cannot give good service. If this Government wants good results from this expenditure it must pay the workers sufficient to enable them to purchase enough food to keep themselves fit. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> that if anything will lend itself to revolution, trouble and discontent in this country, it is the action of putting men to work for their tucker only. Honorable senators opposite know that the pastoralists have for years been advocating that the men on the land should have the right to employ workers for anything they choose to give them by way of wages. Some say that a man "would prefer to work for his tucker. and shelter rather than travel round the country looking in. vain for work. There will always be trouble between employers and employees while the employees are paid too little for their services, particularly when they earn practically nothing during lean times.
