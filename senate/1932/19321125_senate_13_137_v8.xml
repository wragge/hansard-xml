As the person charged with the interpretation of the Standing Orders, I have no option but to rule that, in asking questions, honorable senators may not expressopinions on the subjects dealt with therein. That is also the long established practice of the Senate. In describing an action of the Government as anti-federal, the honorable senator expressed an opinion, and therefore he transgressed the Standing Orders. </para>

                            <para>- It is not yet known what the remissions of land tax will aggregate in excess of the one-third in the rate of tax which is estimated to be ?600,000. The Government has not made any reduction in the rate of invalid and old-age pensions in over80 per cent. of the cases, and none in regard to pensions of sailors and soldiers. Where therehas been a reduction of invalid and old-age pensions it is owing to the fact that the pensioner has some other means of support. The Government believes that in present circumstances every effort should be made to curb expenditure so that from the available resources of the country as much as possible may be conserved for the relief of the unemployed who in many cases are worse off than pensioners. </para>

                    <para>This measure provides for the suspension of the Commonwealth Public Works Committee Act 1913-1921. The intention of the Government in this connexion was announced in the Governor-General's speech delivered at the opening of this Parliament. The urgent necessity for a reduction of parliamentary expenditure influenced the Ministry in arriving at its decision to recommend to Parliament the suspension of this committee's operations. In the past, this committee lias proved to be a useful institution. It was the  means  of saving a good deal of public morey, and was instrumental in preventing many unnecessary proposed works from being undertaken. But circumstances have changed. There is not a great deal of  public work on foot at present, so that there is practically nothing for the committee to do. In fact, it has not functioned since the dissolution of the last Parliament. It is estimated that the savings through the suspension of the mittee will amount to approximately £3,000 per annum. The expenditure for 1930-31, the last complete financial year during which the committee was in operation, was  £2,848,  made up as follows: - Fees of members,  £906  ; salaries of staff, £1,438; travelling expenses,  £449;  contingencies,  £55.  The expenditure has beena good deal heavier than in. some years when a considerable amount of travelling was necessary. Provision is made in the Bill for the lifting of the suspension  of  the act by a resolution of both Houses of Parliament. It may be mentioned that, if an inquiry is desired into any public work while the act is suspended, the Standing Orders of the Parliament provide for the constitution of a parliamentary select committee which could make the necessary investigation. </para>

                            <para>- A number of public works are to be embarked upon, and are to be financed out of the  £100,000  which has been made available for relief works. The Government is anxious to proceed with those works at once, and there are various other works provided for in the Estimates which should not be held up. But it is obvious that, with the limited amount of  £100,000  available, no works of an extensive character are possible. A number of works that are urgently necessary to provide relief for the unemployed are estimated to cost less than  £25,000,  and, therefore, they do not come within the ambit of the Public Works Committee Act. If occasion should arise, it will be within the power of the Parliament by resolution of both Houses, to bring the act again into operation. </para>

                    <para class="block">Minister was on rather uncertain ground when he said that the suspension of the operation of the act would result in the saving of approximately  £3,000.  He quoted figures to show the amount expended by the committee in the last financial year in which it operated. He mentioned fees for members of the committee amounting to  £906,  and travelling expenses totalling  £449.  As I understand the act, those fees were paid only when members were engaged on public inquiries, and, as the Minister has pointed out, that no important public work is likely to be proceeded with in the near future, owing to the present financial circumstances of the country, there is no necessity for inquiries by the committee. Therefore, the work of the committee would be virtually suspended without the passing of this measure. I recognize, of course, that the suspension of the act will enable the Government to make use of the staff which would otherwise have to be retained for committee work while the act was in operation. I claim that the greater part of the saving of  £3,000  mentioned by the Minister is due to the fact that no inquiries by the committee are now necessary. In my opinion, the committee has rendered valuable service to the Commonwealth. When a fairly extensive works programme was in progress, it conducted a number of important inquiries, and when the financial position improves, and important works are again put in band, the Government should certainly again avail itself of the committee's services. </para>

                        <para>. -  I regret that it has become necessary to suspend the operations of this important committee, whose work has resulted in considerable saving. In the case of the Canberra baths, there was a proposal, originally, to spend  £30,000  on the work, but as a result of the committee's inquiries, baths which are a credit to Canberra, and have given satisfaction to everybody concerned, were built for about  £11,000.  Thus a saving of nearly  £20,000  was effected. I could quote many other works in connexion with which the  committee's investigations resulted in the saving of large sums. I understand that tenders have been called for the construction of a new reservoir for Canberra, the cost of which is to be met out of the grant for the relief of the unemployed. I suggest that this work should be done by day labour, because it would be unfortunate if a relief work were carried om by contract, and private persons were allowed to make a lot of profit out of the job at the expense of those who are now -unemployed. I hope that the time will ;soon arrive when the resumption of the committee's operations, by resolution of 3 oth Houses, will be justified. </para>

                        <para>. - T question myself whether it is quite wise to do without the services of either the Public Works Committee or the Public Accounts Committee. Certainly, past experience gives us just cause to be thankful for the investigations carried out by the Public Works Committee. These have resulted in large savings to the Commonwealth, and private contractors have been prevented from obtaining undue profit. It is admitted that in the case of extensive works estimated to cost £25,000 or more, inquiries by the Public Works Committee are necessary, and the question is how long the committee's operations should be suspended. I disapprove of a suspension for any lengthy period which would practically amount, to the disbanding of the committee. T am strongly in favour of retaining the services of both the Public Works Committee and the Public Accounts Committee. </para>

                    <para>- Before proceeding with the discussion of clause 2 it is, I think, desirable that I should indicate to the committee, that, as the schedule to the bill is in the form of a complete document containing an agreement made between the Governments of the United Kingdom and of the Commonwealth of Australia, it is not competent for the committee to amend it, Parliament not being a party to the agreement. The bill is submitted for the approval by Parliament of the agreement. In my opinion, Parliament may do this, subject to certain conditions which may involve an alteration of the agreement, hut such conditions must be included in a clause of the bill by way of amendment of such clause. I make these observations in view of a statement made yesterday on the second reading of the bill by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brennan,</inline> as to the competency of the Senate to amend the agreement or any clause of the bill. </para>

                        <para>- In view of the statement which you have just made, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> I suggest that consideration of the clause be postponed until we have had an opportunity to consider the schedule, which contains all the vital provisions of the bill. Clause 2 simply implements the schedule, which contains 16 articles and a number of subsidiary schedules, all of which are definitely related to articles in the schedule. For example, article 1 refers to reservations and conditions set out in schedule A, and article 2 relates to conditions and implications to be found in schedule B. A number of other articles are, in the same ma n ner, related to other schedules in the agreement. We should not be asked to pass clause 2, which approves the whole of the conditions in the agreement and the schedules attached to it, before we are given the opportunity to consider in detail the respective articles. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brennan</inline> has just said that we discussed these articles on the second reading. It is true that on the second reading we had a general discussion upon the main principles of the bill, but we have not yet had an opportunity to examine the effect of the various provisions upon our primary and secondary industries. The Government has acted in a very high-handed manner in submitting to Parliament an agreement which, whether we like it or not, must be accepted in its entirety. We are expected to pass it without detailed examination of the various articles; without altering it even to the extent of crossing a "t" or dotting an "i". Already the agreement has been modified in some respects. For example, the provision relating to the British meat quota, which is covered by one of the schedules, was presumed to come into operation on the 1st January next, but we read in yesterday's <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> that the Government has issued a proclamation restricting the export of mutton and lamb from Australia during the months of November and December. </para>

                        <para>- The course which you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> have indicated, is the proper procedure. It does not limit the right of any honorable senator to discuss any portion of the schedule. It is obvious that the adoption of any amendments to the schedule would result in the rejection of the agreement. Clause 2 provides for the approval of the agreement, but if, for instance, an honorable senator objects to certain provisions in the schedule, and his objection is upheld by a majority of the committee, obviously the agreement would have to be rejected. If the committee decided to amend the schedule with respect, say, to meat, that would be as much a rejection of the agreement as if clause 2 were negatived. </para>

                        <para>- There is no need for me to explain the position further, as it was clearly set out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brennan</inline> yesterday. It is not intended that honorable senators shall be deprived of the right to discuss any portion of the schedule. Clause 2 provides for the approval of the agreement, and in discussing that clause, an honorable senator is entitled to move an amendment to any portion of the schedule, and at the same time give his reasons for so doing. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Halloran</inline> has already moved that clause 2 be postponed, which clearly indicates that the rights of honorable senators are not affected by the direction of the Chair. The rights of honorable senators to amend the schedule should be exercised under clause 2. </para>

                        <para>- There is more in the contention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Halloran</inline> than appears on the surface. The Minister said any honorable senator may, if he so desires, move to amend the schedule under clause 2, but he also said that if such an amendment were adopted by a majority of the committee it would mean the rejection of the agreement. If the schedule is considered before clause 2, and the Government sees a possibility of Great Britain agreeing to an amendment adopted by a majority of the committee, the Minister in charge of the bill could report progress when clause 2 is under consideration, and confer with Great Britain. I do not desire to see the rights of honorable senators whittled away, and I certainly refuse to support a schedule which the committee has not had an opportunity to consider, and which, under the direction given by the Chair, we shall not be permitted to debate until clause 2 is passed. I am more concerned with the procedure that it is proposed to adopt than I am with the agreement itself. Honorable senators should realize that when a ruling such as that given by the Chair is upheld, it becomes a precedent which on some future occasion may be used in a way that is not desired. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. Legislation may be under consideration in this chamber embodying an enabling provision, and I contend that an agreement or regulations which form a part of a bill should first be considered before the clause in which such agreement or regulations are approvedis considered. The Minister said that, under clause 2, honorable senators are entitled to amend the schedule, but I challenge even the ingenuity of my learned colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brennan,</inline> to frame an amendment, covering, say, article 9 of the agreement, which would be in conformity with the Standing Orders. The Minister, with that versatility of mind which he undoubtedly possesses, must realize that an amendment of the schedule cannot be moved in the way he suggests. Apparently it is the intention of the Government to dispose of this measure by 4 o'clock this afternoon, but that can be done only by applying the obnoxious closure, as was done last night. I realize the futility of arguing when the numbers are against me; but I strongly protest against the procedure which it is proposed to follow in this instance, and I wish my protest to be placed on record. </para>

If he reads articles 10 and 11, that will be made clear to him. Article 10 undertakes that the tariff shall be based on certain principles; and article 11 undertakes that a review of existing protective duties shall be made as soon as practicable by the Tariff Board, in accordance with the principles laid down in article 10. Article 12 deals with  new protective duties. Therefore, the whole field is covered. Existing protective duties are to be reviewed by the Tariff Board, and no new duties will be imposed in excess of those recommended by the board. </para>

                    COLEBATCH (Western Australia) [12.10]. - I direct ' the attention of honorable senators, and particularly of Ministers, to article 16, not simply as an article, but in regard to its general bearing on the agreement. According to it, the agreement "is to be regarded as coming into effect as from the date hereof "-the 20th August, 1932 - " subject to the necessary legislative or other action being taken as soon as may be practicable hereafter." That is to say, the agreement is to operate as from the 20th August last; but if there is any portion of it that cannot be brought into operation without legislative action, that action must be taken as soon as possible. To-day, I asked the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Customs the following question
                </para>
                <para>Has the Government instructed the Tariff Board that, ill all recommendations regarding tariffs against United Kingdom products, the protective duties shall not exceed such a level as will give United Kingdom producers full opportunity of reasonable competition on the basis laid down in the Ottawa agreement? </para>

                <quote>
                    <para>No. The United Kingdom and Australia Trade . Agreement Bill has not yet become law. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">I maintain that the giving of an instruction to the Tariff Board, as to the method to be adopted in making its inquiries, is not a matter for which legislative action is necessary. Although the Government says, " Because legislative action is necessary, we cannot instruct the Tariff Board in a way that may ultimately lead to the reduction of duties ", it has not waited for legislative action to be concluded before calling in aid the Ottawa agreement as an excuse for raising tariffs. Tariffs against the foreigner have been raised in pursuance of the agreement, without a shadow of legislative authority. Where it is a question of imposing additional burdens On the people, by making the tariff still higher, there is apparently no need to await legislative authoritythe Ottawa agreement enables it to be done - but where it is a question of giving an instruction to the Tariff Board that may at some future date lead to the reduction of duties, the attitude adopted is " Oh,no, we must not move until legislative sanction to the Ottawa agreement has been given by -Parliament." Yet in the face of action of that character, the Government expects the people of Australia to believe that it intends to give an honest interpretation to this agreement! What will be the result? The work done by the Tariff Board during the last three months will be useless. From the 20th August to date, the board, we fondly hoped, was working in accordance with the terms of the Ottawa agreement. Now, however, we are told that no instruction has been given to it; consequently, in preparing its reports, it has not considered the agreement. Thus the whole of its work since the signing of the agreement will have to be done Over again. The Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett)</inline> did not need parliamentary sanction to justify his instructing the hoard that it must not take into account primage and exchange; bill apparently, the formality of issuing instructions as to how the board shall conduct future inquiries cannot be given effect until this agreement is passed. I should like the Minister in charge of the bill to indicate what justification there is for the immediate raising of duties against foreigners, in pursuance of this agreement, thus imposing additional taxation on the people without legal sanction, and the withholding of instructionsuntil this bill has received the sanction of Parliament as to the manner in which the Tariff Board shall conduct its inquiries. </para>

                    PEARCE (Western Australia -Minister for Defence) [12.13]. - I suggest that, in criticizing the Government, it is not necessary to level at it the charge of dishonesty. I venture to assert that the reputation for honesty of the members of the Government compares favorably with that of
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch.</inline>
                    He does himself no credit when he makes such a charge, which imputes something that is base in the actions of the Government. He may have used the term in the political sense, but even So, it is most offensive. In this matter, the Government is acting in conformity not only with the ordinary procedure under the customs law, but also with this agreement. Although the policy of the Tariff Board in the past has been in conformity with the principles laid down in this agreement, the Government cannot assume that the board will act strictly in conformity with the articles of this agreement until they have been ratified by Parliament.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline>
                    sees some inconsistency in the action of the Government in raising duties so asto give effect to the margin of preference to Britain as against foreign countries, which is set out in the agreement. There is no inconsistency there, but the question of the protection of the revenue arises, as the State Ministerial experience of the honorable senator would indicate to him. One can readily understand that as soon as the articles in this agreement became public, importers would know that certain action would have to be taken to give effect to those margins. They would know moreover, that that action could be taken along one or other of two lines. There would have to be either a lowering of the duties on goods imported from Britain, or a raising of the duties on goods from foreign countries. As soon as the terms of these articles became known a shrewd importer could say, "It will take some time for Parliament to ratify the agreement. I will gamble on the thing. Parliament will raise the duties against the foreigner "-

                        <para>- The Government gave a pledge that before it interfered with the tariff it would seek the advice of the Tariff Board. The only course open to it was to raise the duties against the foreignerbecause they would come under review by the Tariff Board. The importer would be betting on a certainty, because he would know that the Tariff Board would report in accordance with the terms of the articles of this agreement, and that it would be to his advantage to import large quantities of goods before the duties were raised so that when the higher duties came into force he could make greater profits. It was in order to protect the revenue that the Government took action as soon as the terms of these articles were made public.I suggest that it is a question not of dishonest dealing, but of an honest difference of opinion as to whether it was wiser to raise the duties on foreign goods or to lower the duties on British goods. Were the honorable senator to advocate the latter course, the Government would not charge him with dishonesty ; and, I submit that it is only fair for him to attribute equally honest motives to the Government. Article 16 will come into force as soon as this bill becomes law, but action had to be taken before that time in order to safeguard the revenue. Any subsequent action will be taken by way of legislation. The Tariff Board will regard the passing of this legislation as an instruction as to the way in which it is to act in the future in dealing with the tariff. </para>

In my opinion, these articles are charged with menace to many of the growing industries of Australia. I understood the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> to say, in reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch,</inline> that the passing of this agreement would be equivalent to instructing the Tariff Board to observe the principles contained in articles 9 to 13 in  its  revision of the tariff. Assuming that there are any clearly defined principles underlying those articles, let us consider what those principles are. Article 9 is as follows :  - </para>

                <para>Under that article, Parliament hands over to the Tariff Board the right to determine what industries in Australia are reasonably assured of sound opportunities for success. I remind the Senate of the humble beginnings of many of our industries, both primary and secondary. Every time I travel between Melbourne and Adelaide, I sec at Sunshine, Victoria, a  hark hut., which is a replica of the original bark hut in which the present Sunshine Harvester and Implement Manufacturing Works began operations. In the Barossa Valley of South Australia at. Seppeltsfield, is one of the greatest wineries in the southern hemisphere. It was established many years ago by a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Seppelt</inline> whose son, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oscar</inline> Seppelt, is the  Chairman  of the Australian Chamber of Manufactures. The present owner of Seppeltsfield is never tired of referring to its humble beginning. He takes especial pride in the original chimney stank which his father built with his own hands. I suggest that had the Tariff Board been called upon in the early days of those industries to report on the possibility of success, it would not have afforded them the protection the granting of which has enabled them to reach such huge dimensions. I see grave dangers in article 9, particularly as there is some doubt as to its interpretation. Article 30 reads - </para>

                    <para>His Majesty's Government in the Commonwealth of Australia undertake that no new protective duty shall bo imposed and no existing duty shall bo increased on United Kingdom goods to an amount in excess of  the  recommendation of the tariff tribunal. we shall limit the power of this Parliament' for a term of five years. I submit that the tariffs of other countries must have some bearing on the tariff of Australia. There is also considerable doubt whether any increased importations of goods from Great Britain resulting from this agreement will really benefit the British manufacturer. We have read statements in the press that foreign manufacturers, because of the Ottawa agreement, are already seeking opportunities to establish branches of their industries in Great Britain.  I admit that their success in that direction would be beneficial to the British worker, because it would help to take him off the dole; but it might put the British manufacturer on the dole, through competition with foreigners, who may have adopted manufacturing methods with which he is unfamiliar. But it would be more likely to put the Australian worker on the dole, because there would be a dual blast of competition from old-established British and foreign industries. We might find industries that are domiciled in foreign countries, where very cheap labour is available, partly completing manufacturing processes in their own  country, and sending their goods to branch factories in Great Britain for the final stages of manufacture. There is no machinery in this agreement to prevent such products being admitted into Australia under preferential rates determined by the Tariff Board, and this Parliament will not be allowed to increase those duties. There are other vital arguments which render it imperative that some attempt should be made to secure at least a limitation of article 12. Take the point that I raised a few nights ago - the possible necessity to impose duties for purely revenue purposes, or, alternatively, to impose prohibitions or duties for the purpose of protecting our trade balance. I submit that the trend of the trade balance at the moment shows a distinct possibility that action of that kind may be imperative in the not very distant future. </para>

                        <para>-We have all obtained some satisfaction from the increase of bank credits in London; but I submit that that is entirely due to the action of the previous Government. It is only during the last two or three months that the full effect of the present Government's policy has become evident. The trade balance during this period discloses the fact that very soon our bank balance in London must dwindle again, because imports into Australia are increasing, and because we pledge ourselves under the agreement to limit the export from Australia of certain commodities. A proclamation was issued last week limiting the export of butter, mutton, and lamb. </para>

                    <para>[12.38] .   -  I shall strongly oppose the amendment submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Halloran,</inline> because it involves an attempt to strike out articles which I regard as the only provisions which can be of any great value to Australia, and certainly the only ones of value to Great Britain. The meaning of the amendment is that we should take everything we can get, and give nothing. I spoke about the effect of these articles a few moments ago. I have no desire to indulge in personal reflections; but I maintain that I am entitled to express my opinion that the action of the Government does not amount to an honest interpretation of these provisions. I claim that the interpretation of these articles should already have been the subject of an instruction to the Tariff Board. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> said that there was an obligation on the Government to protect the revenue, because everybody would anticipate that the agreement would result in the raising of duties. Why should people anticipate anything of the kind? Surely they would expect the result of the agreement to be a lowering of tariffs. There is not one Minister in this chamber who did not go from one end of his own State to the other, denouncing the tariff as too high, and as monstrous and absurd. It was so denounced even before it was buttressed by the additional primage and the additional exchange. Now we are told that to protect the revenue, because people would expect the Ottawa agreement to mean the raising of tariffs against the foreigner, and not the reduction of duties imposed against the Mother Country, it was necessary for the Government to rush in, and, without parliamentary sanction, impose additional burdens upon the people. Surely the whole spirit of Ottawa is a lowering, and not a raising of tariffs. It has been claimed by Great Britain that her object in imposing a tariff was to break down the tariff walls of other countries. The whole spirit of Ottawa was first to lower the tariff as between different parts of the Empire, and thus offer an example and an inducement to other countries to lower their tariffs. Yet the Leader of the Government in this chamber says that the Government may take the view that the right way to interpret the  agreement is to raise the duties against the foreigner, and nOt to lower them against Great Britain. Let that he published in London as an honest attempt to interpret the agreement! Let those who participated in the forming of this agreement get into their minds that the opinion of this Government is that this agreement can be implemented by increased duties against foreigners, and not by reducing the duties against the Mother Country. If the British consumer were called upon to pay increased duties on imports from foreign countries, it would be obviously disadvantageous to the Old Country. Is the agreement to be interpreted only in such a way that it will give Australia no disadvantages, but advantages from every point of view ? I am entitled to my opinion that that is not an honest interpretation of the agreement. These articles mean that the British manufacturer shall be given an opportunity to compete in the Australian markets that he did not previously enjoy, and, therefore, they imply that the tariffs against him must be brought down. I repeat that we cannot give an honest interpretation of this agreement merely by increasing duties against foreigners and imposing duties on British manufacturers on a scale which was denounced by every member of the Government except those who have come over from the Government which was originally responsible for the introduction of this tariff. </para>

What is to be the effect of striking out these articles, which, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> says, are really the only provisions in the agreement which give promise of any advantage whatever for the British people? We might as well take the short course, and have a division on the clause now before the committee, which provides that " the provisions of the agreement are hereby approved ". If we approve of them, we approve of them with the schedule attached. If we do not approve of them, we reject the whole agreement. But why not reject it honestly, by saying that wc do not approve of it? </para>

                        <para>- Yesterday, I expressed the opinion that we have to decide whether or not we shall accept the agreement as it stands. If we approve it, we cannot suggest certain alterations, because that would imply that it was like the curate's egg - good in parts, and not good in parts. To me it is so obvious that an agreement entered into between parties who cannot very well be brought together again, must be accepted as a whole, that I cannot understand how an attempt should now be made to alter &gt;t. If we reject it," the Government might have to consider its position, but I think it would still be bound to carry out the agreement. As has been pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch,</inline> the purpose of the amendment is to suggest the elimination of those articles which, it may be assumed, the British delegation considered necessary; but I am unable to understand how those who believe in the policy of protection can persuade themselves that that policy will be endangered by submitting tariff proposals to the review of a tribunal of experts instead of allowing Parliament to determine such matters. The amendment is merely an attempt to stave off the inevitable. The Senate having agreed to the second reading of the bill, will, I have no doubt, approve the details of the measure. I therefore ask my honorable friends Opposite, to consider whether it is worth while to delay the proceedings of the Senate by persisting with a series of amendments which, even if they are technically in order, can achieve no useful purpose. In view of the decision of the Senate last night, there can be only one result. </para>

The honorable senator accuses us of wasting time in a futile effort to amend an agreement which, he declares, cannot be varied without the consent of the parties, who conferred at Ottawa. I remind him that the agreement itself makes provision for the variation of any of its terms. The second paragraph of article 16 reads- </para>

                <para class="block">That proviso places no limitation of time upon negotiations for the variation of the agreement; they may be made within one month or three years of the ratification of the document by the two governments named. We on this side of the chamber submit that circumstances have already arisen which necessitate, a reconsideration of the provisions contained in articles 9 to 13, and we believe that this amendment is the only means at our disposal for expressing our opinion. In view of the vital effect which those articles' may have upon Australian industry, we ask that the provisions incorporated in the agreement for the variation of its terms be applied now. The Government should postpone further consideration of the bill until it has had an opportunity to confer with the British Government with a view to the removal of some of the obnoxious and onerous conditions which the agreement will impose upon Australian industries. </para>

                    <para>. - In the course of this debate we have heard a great deal about ourobligations to the Mother Country. Over and over again we have been enjoined to he not unmindful of what we owe to Britain. In order to attract outside capital for in vestment in Australian industries, special tariff protection was given by the Scullin Administration. As the direct consequence of that policy, 34 branches of British manufacturing firms were established in Australia with a capital investment of not less than £3,000,000. Now according to the terms of this agreement, United Kingdom producers are to have a full opportunity of reasonable competition with those British firms which established branches in this country and are observing Australian wage standards and conditions. Apparently some people who, in the past, encouraged outside firms to come to Australia, are not now concerned about what may happen to them under this agreement. Instead of improving industrial and trading relations between different parts of the Empire, the agreement will, I contend, cause friction and trouble. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brennan</inline> has admitted that certain of the articles are capable of different interpretations. We on this side of the chamber desire Empire unity, but we honestly believe that this agreement will cause disunity. The <inline font-style="italic">Manchester</inline> Guardian of the 14th of October, declared that whatever benefits British industry might gain as a result of the agreement, in the future it would have to fight its case with the Tariff Board. Are we to allow representatives of British manufacturers to appear before our Tariff Board when thatbody is considering items referred to it? If so, it is easy to visualize the constant friction that will be caused between rival sections in industry. Will Australian industries have an equal opportunity to place their claims before the British Tariff board, or any other tribunal which may be set up to consider tariff requests? </para>

                        <para>- Even if they are admitted free, action may be necessary to safeguard our interests, because foreign countries flood the British market with cheap-labour products. For example, Czechoslovakian manufacturers of boots and shoes can. produce at a price which defies competition in all countries which pay a reasonable standard of wages. Australian boot and shoe manufacturers, it is said, are at present over-capitalized, so manufacture for export is not possible, but it is conceivable that, in the future, they will be in a position to look to outside markets for the disposal of their surplus products ; so it should be possible for them to have representation before a British tribunal which will deal with any matters that might arise out of the British tariff. </para>

                <para>I see in this agreement a conspiracy on the part of those who, while they proclaim their desire to see the Empire completely unified, are prepared to go to the extent of destroying Australia's  independence as an economic unit. Those who are carrying out this propaganda for the development of Empire production do not realize the sacrifices involved. Honorable senators opposite do not tell the people about these sacrifices; they simply say that, when it is ratified, the people will be better off. According to the propaganda which has appeared in British newspapers, certain interests in Great Britain are contending that, all-round sacrifices are involved. The people of Great Britain <inline font-style="italic">wish</inline> us to provide them with raw  materials, to enable them to unload their manufactured products on Australia, and that will have a serious effect upon the development of our secondary industries. I. think that it will be found before long that the attitude of honorable senators opposed to this measure is right. As stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly,</inline> this is not an agreement, but a document which will lead to disagreement between Australia and the Old Country. If, will eventually cause considerable disagreement and engender political bitterness between the two countries. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not wish to be accused of unduly delaying the passage of this bill ; but., seeing that we are breaking new ground by entering into a reciprocal trade agreement between the United Kingdom and Australia, we are entitled to exercise our rights to the fullest extent, in order to show the people of Australia the disabilities with which they will be faced when this measure becomes operative. Apparently, we are not to be given the opportunity to discuss the schedule of the bill in detail, and consequently cannot be held responsible if the agreement is found to be unworkable. I have a recollection of a tariff schedule introduced into this Parliament by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne in 1908, and have painful memories of the time occupied in discussing it in every detail. The letters " n.e.i " - not elsewhere included - were so frequently referred to that they became almost n nightmare to me. That schedule was debated in every detail, not only in this chamber, hut also in another place, before Parliament finally decided the customs duties to be imposed on goods imported into this country. Why should we not be given similar opportunities in connexion with this schedule?  I regret that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brennan</inline> is temporarily absent from the chamber, because he asked yesterday what objection I had to the bill. Had the honorable senator listened to my second-reading speech, in which I clearly set out my main objection, he would know why I am opposed to it. I am not opposed to reciprocal Empire trade; but I intend to vote against certain articles in the agreement which deprive this Parliament of the right to determine what duties shall be imposed on imported goods.

The recommendations of the Tariff Board are to be accepted, and eventually those recommendations will have the force of law. I am opposing the bill, because we, as elected representatives of the people, are being compelled to entrust the Tariff Board with power which this Parliament should possess. I do not wish to impute motives; but I know from experience extending over a period of from 25 to 27 years the influence and intrigue which are used to achieve certain ends.

I think that we all sympathize with the right honorable gentleman who recently had to undergo a cruel legal lashing in Melbourne in connexion with a case in which disaffection in the Navy was alleged. </para>

                        <para>- Unfortunately, the Navy is not mentioned in the schedules, but in the absence of a navy, this agreement would be of little use, and, there fore, the reference should be relevant. How could our trade routes be kept open without the protection of the Navy? We have heard a good deal about the British Empire, the waving of flags, the thin red line, and all that political " mush " which is trotted out at various times. This schedule reminds me of a Scottish haggis, which, as we all know is a mixture of heart lungs and liver of a sheep, boiled with maw, suet and oatmeal. It is packed full of political livers and lights. The Empire statesmen were rushed together, and as a result an agreement was signed in a palatial hotel at Ottawa. It is true that they found time to present one another with large pieces of silver plate, and to indulge in a good deal of " back-scratching." </para>

                    <para class="block">I have received other communications, but shall not weary the Senate by reading them. A remarkable situation has been created, in that the Government proposes to make a complete change in the national policy of Australia. It now proposes that Australian workmen shall be faced with competition from the blackgrown products of other countries. Honorable senators will scarcely need to be reminded that our Australian arbitration laws protect Australian white workers against even the possibility of competition from our own Australian aborigines. It is equally well known to honorable senators that every State has its factory laws to protect the white workers of Australia against the products of Chinese residents within the Commonwealth. Yet, in spite of these measures of protection, we are asked to enact legislation which will have entirely the opposite effect and intent. We are now asked to subject the white banana-growers of Queensland and New South Wales to competition from blackgrown bananas from other countries. It is in no anti-British or unpatriotic sense that I say that it does not matter to the white workers of Australia whether the menace of coloured-labour competition comes from within or without the Empire. Some honorable senators opposite have not always viewed this situation from the angle from which they obviously view it now. But before I deal with that aspect of the question, I want to -remind the Senate that Professor Goddard, of the Queensland University, a highly-trained scientist, and one who, if he knows any politics at all, has never yet declared them, some time ago inquired into the serious menace of " bunchy top " disease in Queensland banana plantations. After spending much time and energy in research work, Professor Goddard came to certain conclusions, which he submitted to the banana-growers. At first, they were almost unanimously opposed to his views, but eventually, by demonstrations on their own farms, he convinced them that he had not only located the cause of the disease, but had also discovered a remedy for it. As the result of his research, and the united action of the banana-growers, the disease of " bunchy top " has been eradicated from the banana plantations of Queensland and northern New South Wales. Speaking at an immense meeting of banana-growers held in the City Hall, Brisbane, on the 13th October last - a  meeting  attended by Senators Brown, MacDonald and myself, as well as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford,</inline> but in which we did not participate, for fear that the meeting might be given a political significance - Professor Goddard said - </para>

                        <para>Many growers have been fearing for some time past that there will be over-production, and if their fears are realized then the problem will become a most serious one, with the admission of Fiji bananas on terms that will enable that product, grown under native-labour conditions, to compete with the Australian product on terms disadvantageous to the latter.' </para>

                    <para class="block">It is well to bear in mind that the present Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett)</inline> has stated that the Ottawa agreement " has been drawn in aid of the man on the land ". I shall submit a few figures in order to enable honorable senators to judge the correctness or otherwise of that statement. The average consumption of bananas in Australia is from 900,000 to 1,000,000 cases per annum. It is estimated that the crop this year will total 1,400,000 cases, or from 400,000 to 500,000 cases in excess of the average consumption. In that case, what possible justification can there be for the importation of further quantities of this fruit? The dumping of Fiji bananas to the extent of probably 100 eases a month - the quantity will vary according to the shipping service available - will have the effect of forcing down prices. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene</inline> will not accuse me of any disrespect in confronting him with his own words on a previous occasion when he was Minister for Trade and Customs. In <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of the 13th October, 1921, the honorable senator is reported to have said - </para>

                        <para>The obstacle with which they have to contend is not the number of bananas imported in the course of a year, but the fact that large shipments come to Australia at a given time, temporarily destroying entirely the market for the local article. Australian growers who send their bananas to the market at such a period - and bananas must be marketed when they are ready - strike an overloaded market, and get practically nothing for their fruit. If that were allowed to continue, it would not be long before the number of banana plantations would be reduced, and many men would bc driven off the' soil. </para>

I hope that Senators Crawford, Reid, and Foll will support us, and pay no heed to party consideration in this matter. We are merely asking that justice be done to the struggling growers, with hundreds of whom I am personally acquainted. They are putting up a battle against terrific odds, and they will win through if this dastardly blow does not fall upon them. </para>

                        <para>[3.19]. -  The Government cannot accept the amendment. If it were agreed to, the effect would be to destroy the agreement. I do not believe that the admission into Australian of  40,000  centals of bananas annually - a mere  2  per cent, of the Australian consumption, I understand - would inflict such injury on the banana industry that we should wreck an agreement which, as I have already pointed out, will result in a direct monetary benefit to Queensland of over  £1,000,000  a year. </para>

                        (Queensland)  [3.21  j. - It is a reflection upon the British Government to suggest that the whole of the agreement will be jeopardized if we object to the entry into Australia of  40,000  centals of black-grown bananas. Canada has reserved to itself the right to vary the agreement, and why should not Australia have a similar privilege? On the one hand, wo are told that the quantity of bananas proposed to be admitted is so small in comparison with the total consumption that the matter can be dismissed from consideration ; but, on the other hand, we are asked to believe that if the amendment were insisted upon the whole agreement would be wrecked. If our representatives at Ottawa had done the right thing, they would have reserved to the Government the right to make slight alterations in the agreement. According to the

                    <para class="block">Canada empowered her representatives to obtain certain conditions in the interests of that country, but we in Australia are so super-loyal to the Old Country that we are not a match for the astute British political leaders. The latter showed that they knew how to " put it over " our representatives. We on this side have demonstrated that imported bananas will be placed on the market at certain periods and in such a way as to have the effect of reducing the price to such an extent that the industry will become unprofitable to the Australian growers. The growers in Queensland know well enough how the agreement will affect them. A huge public meeting held in Brisbane was attended by  thousands, of growers, many of whom travelled long distances without food in order to protest against the admission of black-grown fruit. Yet we have had the spectacle of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson</inline> producing a couple of bananas which had been lying in his drawer for  several days, in order to justify the admission of bananas from Fiji. If these puerile exhibitions are to be continued, we will probably see <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene</inline> bringing into this chamber a case of corrugated iron, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> a stud ram, or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings</inline> sticks of sugar cane, to bolster up their arguments.

Products such as hams and bacon, biscuits and fish, and fresh fruit and vegetables, now imported free, must pay a 10 per cent. duty. In a word, Fiji residents will be greatly the losers by the Ottawa agreement. </para>

                    <para class="block">Why do we indulge in sentimental talk about the ties of Empire, if 40,000 centals of bananas are sufficient to destroy an agreement and if the growers in Fiji themselves do not desire this concession? Yet the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> insists that the agreement must not be altered, because we have given our word to the representatives of Great Britain that it will be adhered to. If bananas were grown in Tasmania, Western Australia, or some other State, honorable senators from those States would have been found fighting for the alteration of the agreement. There is not the slightest doubt about it. Personally I enter my emphatic protest against the way in which the banana industry of Queensland has been treated. </para>

                        <para>. - This matter is of so much importance to Queensland that I feel it necessary to register my strongest protest. Quite recently I attended a meeting of banana-growers in the City Hall, Brisbane, and I was very much impressed, not only by the enthusiasm of the speakers, but also by the strength of the arguments which they advanced. The speakers were nearly as numerous as are the letters in the alphabet, and almost without exception they fiercely denounced the Government for its action in sacrificing their interests to the banana-growers of Fiji. I feel sure that, if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> had been in attendance, he would have been obliged, from considerations of personal safety, to accede to their request to excise that portion of the agreement relating to the banana industry. I can assure honorable senators that we arc not now speaking in defence of the industry merely for the purpose of delaying the passage of this measure, but because we are convinced that, in its present form, the agreement will work serious harm to banana-growers, of Queensland and northern New South Wales. Yesterday the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> had a good deal to say about the advantages which, he declared, Queensland would enjoy under the agreement. The honorable gentleman emphasized particularly the benefits that would accrue, so he said, to the meat, industry in which Queensland is so largely interested^ and he invited us to " count our blessings one by one." I direct the attention of honorable senators to the following statement which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Queensland Producer,</inline> the official organ of the primary producers of Queensland, in its issue of the 36th November, 1932:- </para>

                        <para>This further serves to emphasize the truth of our claim that preferential trade agreements are of precious little value while their purpose can be so easily defeated by the market rigging and wholesale gambling on the commodity exchanges. Is it not rather a significant coincidence that ever since the Ottawa Conference the prices of wheat, butter, cheese, bacon, mutton, lamb, sugar, fruit, in fact, practically all primary products, with the exception of wool and cotton, whether in the form of raw materials or processed, have seen a decline in value equal to and sometimes exceeding the rate of preference V Take butter for example. Since the Ottawa Conference the" price has declined by more than 15s. per cwt., or 1 -Jd. per lb. How in the face of this recession in prices in- the British market can any one honestly maintain that the preferences have proved or are likely to prove of material benefit to the primary producers of Australia! </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">The same journal refers at great length to what it terms " the meat muddle " of the Ottawa agreement, and denies that Queensland will get any advantages from the meat arrangements. Because certain Queensland industries are supposed to benefit under the Ottawa agreement, we are asked to sacrifice the Queensland banana trade in favour of the black-grown commodity from Fiji. I am putting the case from the view-point of the people who are responsible for the presence in this chamber of Senators Reid, Crawford and Foll. I warn them that, if the primary producers of Queensland join hands with the workers and artisans, it will be useless for supporters of this Government to appeal to the people with any hope of success. Wehave every right to complain of the treatment meted out to Queensland primary producers, and particularly the banana growers. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott,</inline> a few days ago, supported the agreement in every detail. The honorable senator has good reason to be satisfied, because he is interested in a newspaper published in. Mildura, the centre of the dried fruits industry. As Britain takes 95 per cent. of our exports of dried fruits, naturally <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> is satisfied with the agreement. But if he were a representative of Queensland, and if he realized the extent to which the banana industry is threatened by this agreement, he would have been as vehement in his protestations as any of those who spoke at the meeting in the City Hall, Brisbane a few nights ago, and would be as eager as any of them to bring about the defeat of this Government. Much has been said about the British preferences with regard to sugar, but I submit that we have not got all that we are entitled to. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill,</inline> the other night, stated that Great Britain imported  annually about 2,100,000 tons of sugar. </para>

We do not enjoy one-quarter of that Empire trade, or one-twelfth of the British importations of sugar, but if <inline font-style="italic">we</inline> had reasonable encouragement we could obtain a larger share of it, because in Queensland, New South Wales, and other northern, areas of the continent we could produce much larger quantities of sugar. I consider that our primary producers have been treated most disgracefully, and 1 sympathize deeply with the banana-growers of Queensland and northern New South Wales, whose interests will be injured by the introduction of bananas from Fiji. I am, of course, aware that as the numbers are against us, we shall not be able to carry the amendment. </para>

                    <para>. - This morning, I endeavoured to ask a series of questions concerning a most important motion carried by the Federated Chambers of Commerce of Western Australia. I was not permitted to ask the questions in the form in which they were submitted and, as the  President  pointed out that there were other occasions on which I could bring them forward, I propose to avail myself of this opportunity to do so. The first question I desired to ask the Government was: - </para>

                        <para>Has the Prime Minister received the following resolution which was carried unanimously at the recent conference of the Federated Chambers of Commerce of Western Australia: - "That this conference protests against the unfair competition of the Commonwealth Railways against Western Australian Railways, in regard to the reduced railway rates offered by them which are seriously affecting the markets of our primary and secondary industries." </para>

I submitted my second question in the form in which I have just given it, because I regarded the action of the Government as anti-federal. I can make now a statement of the truth, which I was not permitted to make in a question, upon notice - that it is the most anti-federal action of which either this or any other Federal Government is capable. It can be described in no other way than as anti-federal, and I protest against it. It is contrary to the Constitution, and nothing could be more anti-federal than action which violates that instrument. </para>
                <para>There is established in Canberra a peculiar cult, which worships two josses, named respectively " Canberra " and " Federation." It is a sort of millions club. Its number is 13 ; and 13 has certainly been an unlucky number for the taxpayers of Australia, so far as Canberra is concerned, because £13,000,000 of their good money has, in large measure, been wasted here. This cult apparently exists for the purpose of securing the expenditure here of thirteen times £13,000,000. Its objects are, to ensure the continuance of the present waste and extravagance in Canberra, and the taxation of the rest of Australia to keep this city going on a basis of unification. The qualifications for membership of the cult are twofold, and they have reference to its two josses- - an applicant for membership must live in Canberra, and he must make a good thing out of federation. I do not know the identity of the members of the cult, but I believe that all the time influential recruits are being sought, and when they are obtained, they are generally squeezed for as much as can be got out of them. Members of the cult are recognized by the fact that in their temples the use of the word " anti-federal " is barred, except when applied by them to their opponents or to opponents of federal taxation and expenditure in Canberra. Any nonmember who, in their temple, uses that expression is liable to lose his head. </para>
                <para>All sorts of reasons are bandied about for the wonderful concessions that are given to wealthy eastern breweries, but are refused to Western Australian industries, including breweries, in connexion with the carriage of their products and their manufacturing requisites, as well as to the mining and pastoral industries. Surely, if any industries should be assisted by being given cheap freights over the trans-Australian railway, they are the mining and pastoral industries. The Commissioner for Commonwealth Railways sits in his department like a little czar, distributing largesse in the form of freight concessions as he thinks fit, and presenting remissions of freight charges amounting to tens of thousands of pounds to wealthy brewery companies with head-quarters in the eastern States. </para>

                        <para>- It is absolutely correct, and can be verified. If the Government will investigate the matter, it will find that the facts are as [ have stated - that while very heavy freights are charged for the carriage of the requirements of the pastoral industry and the great mining industry in the gold-fields districts, as well as the everyday requirements of the people who live in Kalgoorlie and Boulder, such as clothing and groceries, low freights are annually granted on a varying basis, and contrary to the Constitution, for the carriage from the eastern States of beer, which is a competitor of beer produced in Western Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I thank the Senate for its indulgence, which I did not expect. I say that the Commonwealth railway transports this one product at a freight which pays for little more than axle grease, and which certainly is not remunerative. Is it any wonder, then, that the trans-Australian railway loses tens of thousands of pounds ? It is not right that breweries in the eastern States should be permitted to make big profits and to distribute big dividends at the expense of the taxpayers of the Commonwealth, by having their product carried from Melbourne to Kalgoorlie, a distance of 1,794 miles, for £7 10s. a ton, and from Adelaide to Kalgoorlie, a distance of 1,311 miles, for £6 15s. a ton. The cut freight from Perth to Kalgoorlie, a distance of 375 miles, is £5 8s. 9d. a ton, on the Western Australian railways. The South Australian industry is not being treated justly, because it is being charged by the Commonwealth railways, a higher freight per mile than its competitor in Victoria. That is a distinctly anti-federal action, because the Constitution provides that there shall be no discrimination between the States. The Railways Commissioner discriminates by charging one rate per mile over the trans-Australian railway for beer manufactured in Melbourne, namely, £4 10s. Id. a ton for 1,051 miles, a higher rate per mile over that railway for beer manufactured in South Australia, namely, £5 10s. 9d. a ton for the same 1,051 miles, and a much higher rate over the same railway for the sugar and other raw material required for the manufacture of beer in Kalgoorlie. This practice is entirely wrong and, I believe, unconstitutional. </para>

                <para>I should not have made this speech today had I been permitted to draw attention to the matter by way of a question. The view that this action is anti-federal is not mine alone; it is expressed in the resolutions that I have read of the Federated Chambers of Commerce of Western Australia. They made their protest to the Government only after protests had been made in the other House by the honorable member for Kalgoorlie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. A. Green),</inline> and questions on the subject which I placed on the notice-paper of the </para>
                <para class="block">Senate, and articles in Western Australian newspapers had repeatedly proved ineffective in securing any alteration. I remind honorable senators of the Opposition that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. A.</inline> Green, who is a valiant defender of the interests of the gold-fields of Western Australia, and of the people of Kalgoorlie, has taken the very action that 1 endeavoured to take this morning to bring the matter under the notice of the Government. Protests have been made by the Commissioner of Railways in Western Australia, but without effect. In many quarters it is considered that there is a nasty odour about the whole thing. It is wrong that Commonwealth utilities should be used to destroy Western Australian industries. These industries find it sufficiently difficult to meet severe, but open competition from the eastern States, but when Commonwealth utilities are used to discriminate unfairly against them, they naturally protest. Beer from the eastern States is carried by passenger trains at lower freight rates than are charged for the requirements of the mining and pastoral industries forwarded by goods trains. While I have instanced beer, the protest of the Chambers of Commerce is a general one, covering products of both primary and secondary industries, to which my remarks also refer. I had hoped to bring forward in another way this protest from an influential body in Western Australia; but, as that was not possible, I now ask the Minister the following question, which I was prevented from asking this morning: - </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator strains his case when he says that the Western Australian breweries do not share in these concessions. Of course, they do not. That is because they send their beer not over the Commonwealth railways, but over the Western Australian railways. I see no reason why they should not be able to compete with Victorian beer,since they have to consign their product over only 400 miles of railway whereas the product of their eastern competitors travels much farther. </para>

                    PEARCE.The reason may be that brewing interests in Western Australia object to competition. I promise the honorable senator to bring his remarks under the notice of the Minister for the Interior.

                <para>When moving the motion for the adjournment of the Senate, I overlooked one important matter. I think that I can speak on behalf of honorable senators opposite as well as supporters of the Government in referring with regret to the pending retirement of the. parliamentary housekeeper, Mr.F. Sparkes, whose services date back to the beginning of federation. I am sureI am voicing the opinion of every honorable senator who knows him, when I say that he has proved a most, capable and conscientious officer in the discharge of his duties. He has earned the respect. of us all, and we regret that inexorable time has brought about his retirement. We appreciate the loyal service that he has rendered, the courtesy that he has always extended to us, and the way in which he has attended to our needs. </para>

                    <para>-I desire to add a word to the remarks of the Leader of the Government regarding the retirement of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sparkes.</inline> Meetings and partings are a common feature of everyday life, but it is always unpleasant to be culled upon to part with a conscientious and faithful officer such as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sparkes</inline> has proved himself to be. I have known him ever since I entered this Senate. He has been in public employment for 43 years.For 10 years he was in the service of the Victorian Government, and he has been a Commonwealth public servant for 31 years. He entered the Commonwealth service at the inception of federation, and, therefore, there could not be an older Commonwealth public servant. Although <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sparkes</inline> has been called upon to sever his connexion with the Service,because he has reacheda certain age, he possesses a vastamount of unexpended energy, and if he decides to follow another occupation, his future employers will be fortunate in having the services of such a trustworthy and faithful officer. I hope that he will enjoy many more years of life, and I wish him well. </para>
