                        <para>. - Prior to the adjournment last evening, in the few preliminary observations which I was able to make, I referred to. the unfortunate position of the sugar industry. Owing to its remoteness from the principal centres of population, and also because sugar is produced chiefly in one State, the industry is more vulnerable to attack that it would be if it were carried on in several States. For some unexplained reason the production of sugar in many countries outside Australia has always been more subject to attack than any other industry. About three-quarters of a century ago Disraeli said of it - " Strange that a manufacture which charms infancy and soothes old age should so frequently occasion political disaster."1' Ever since federation the industry in Australia has been so often called upon to meet attacks from various quarters that there might be applied to it the words spoken of those engaged in rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem - they have been working with a trowel in one hand and a sword in the other. I suppose we may congratulate ourselves that, in spite of the strength of enemy forces arrayed against us, we have been fairly successful, and that the people now recognize, through their governments, our claim for sympathetic consideration. . So far as the industry  itself is concerned, the head and front of its offending has been the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. But why this should Ite so I am at a loss to understand. Possibly it is because a certain type of mind cannot view, with equanimity, success in others. We have been told, that dogs do '' bay the moon ". That appears to explain the attitude of some people towards the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. I was a member of a royal commission which made a most exhaustive investigation into every branch of the industry about twenty years ago, and as a result of that inquiry which was, in a large measure, directed against the operations of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, I wrote the following in my minority report: - </para>

                    <quote>
                        <para>The evidence reveals that the Colonial Sugar Helming Company occupies a commanding position in the industry, secured by steadily pursuing, for a long course of years, a policy which has won for it the confidence and good will of practically the whole of those with whom it has had business dealings. There is nothing to indicate that any of the company's transactions have been in the slightest degree of a predatory character. Amicable relations subsist between the company on the one hand, and the manufacturers of raw sugar and the purchasers of refined on the other. That the company earns large profits both within and without the Commonwealth, appears to be entirely due to the volume of its business, the command of - adequate capital, the complete utilization of by-products, thorough organization,  able  administration, and high efficiency in every department. </para>
                        <para class="block">What I then stated has not since been successfully challenged 'from any quarter. I remember some years ago hearing a free lance journalist say that whenever he was hardpressed  for a " fiver all he had to do was to send to one of the newspapers one of his diatribes against the 'Colonial Sugar Refining Company. ' These ebullitions have not appeared so frequently of late because the columns of our reputable newspapers are not, I believe, so open for the publication of misrepresentation and vilification of one of ' the most successful industrial and commercial concerns in the Commonwealth. One reason why so many attacks have been made against the company is that it has not been its policy to make reply to them. But that policy has been departed from to a slight extent of late, and I commend to honorable senators an article appearing in <inline font-style="italic">Current Problems</inline> of a recent date, and written by P. H. Goldfinch, General Manager of the Company. In that article he makes a passing reference to the way in which the Company has become possessed in recent years of its large funds. He says that during the early post-war years, the Company sold its Fiji sugar on the world's markets, and got world prices. How high those were may be indicated  by reminding honorable senators that in 1920, Great Britain paid to sugar producers in Mauritius £90 a ton for 200,000 tons, representing a payment of £18,000,000. As a consequence of those high prices, millions of money poured into the countries, such as Cuba and Java, which were producing sugar for the world's markets. During the war, there was a distinct shortage of sugar in the world. Beet sugar production in Europe was greatly reduced in volume, and, to supply the deficiency thus created, every effort was made in cane-sugar countries such as Java, Cuba, Hawaii and Porto' Rico, to produce to the utmost extent. Consequently, during the war years, there was a very great increase in the production of cane sugar, and an increase occurred in Australia to some extent. It was said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> yesterday that the production of sugar in Queensland was very low in 1920, when an arrangement was made between the industry and the GovGovernment of the Commonwealth to increase the price to £30 6s. 8d. a ton. In 1917, the quantity produced in Australia was 324,260 tons. The estimate for 1918 was 3«5,000 tons, but then two most devastating cyclones, followed by floods and droughts, took place in Queensland, and instead of the anticipated 365,000 tons, only 209,000 tons were produced. During the war, and particularly in the later years of it, the industry was carried on in Australia under very great difficulties, partly climatic, but largely owing to labour difficulties. Practically all the farmers' sons eligible for war service were at the war, and so were the best of the wage-earners. There was a distinct shortage of efficient labour, and the best the industry could do was to mark time. A great many of our growers, and many of our millers, too, carried on at considerable loss, but having made arrangements with the Government t.o supply sugar at £21 a ton, we stood by the agreement, and did our best to give effect to it. </para>

                    <para>I make no complaint against the action of the present Federal  Government  in asking for a review of the agreement entered into between the Government of Queensland, on behalf of the sugar producers in that State, and the Commonwealth. Yet it was most unfortunate, I think, that the announcement was made in such regrettable terms. When we sat in conference with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> in Brisbane, and later, with the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> in Canberra, we were met in a very fair and reasonable way. After considering debits and credits in connexion with the proposed alteration of the price, we agreed to accept a reduction of ½d.  per lb., on the condition that that price was fixed for a term beyond that for which the price was to run under the previous agreement. Of course, when an agreement is entered into, one cannot expect all the advantages to be on one side. This agreement involves a loss to the industry of £1,300,000 a year, and how that loss is to be met I do not know. But it was impressed upon us that, in view of the unfortunate position of some of the other big primary producing industries, we should., as far as possible, fall into line with them. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan,</inline> in Brisbane, assembled the representatives of the industry as a hen gathers her chickens, yet, at the same time he rifled the pockets of the industry to the extent of £1,300,000. So urbane was he, so persuasive, so exhortative, that I cannot help thinking what a great ecclesiastic was lost to the church when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> decided to study the law instead of the prophets. After our prolonged conference with the Prime Minister, I had a better opinion of him than I had previously held. </para>
                    <para>I shall refer to the nature of some of the propaganda which has been published in opposition to the sugar industry. I have before me an article which appeared in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> a few years ago. It .has what is called a banner heading going almost across the page, and in it are some extraordinary statements. </para>

                    <para>Surely <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> M. Fowler is wrong in affirming that the Commonwealth Government paid to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company £2,000,000 per annum as a management charge and over a third as much in addition for distribution or selling charge. As the Commonwealth Government allowed £1 per ton of refined sugar as a capital and management charge and 7s. per ton of refined sugar as a selling charge, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fowler's</inline> . figures would require two millions of tons of sugar to be refined annually, which is obviously absurd. Speaking from memory, the tonnage refined in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fowler's</inline> time was somewhere about 250,000 tons by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and 20,000 tons by the Millaquin Company. Further, his wish to know the cost of refining sugar could easily have been gratified by referring to the Commonwealth Auditor's reports. The Colonial Sugar Henning Company was allowed the actual cost of refining, provided it did not exceed a specific amount per ton. I hare " vouched " every debit to refining costs, leading to much controversy as to the admission or rejection of certain debits. I believe I gave this fact in evidence before <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fowler's</inline> committee. I am in no way financially interested in the sugar industry (I wish I" wore), only as a consumer. I merely desire to point out what  appear to be errors in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fowler's</inline> article. .

                            <para>- Do not we all? Is that not the reason why there is so much envy of a prosperous company? But what would be the position of Australia, or any other country, if it had no prosperous citizens and no prosperous companies? This particular company now has between 3,000 and 4,000 shareholders. Something has been said about the profits of those engaged in the industry. I regret that the growers and the millers, too, are not so prosperous as somewho wish to reduce the price of sugar endeavour to lead the public to believe them to be. The majority of those who are engaged in the production of sugar cane in Queensland have to be financed from year to year by the banks, the mills, or the storekeepers, just as have the majority of those engaged in other land industries. At the present time, very few indeed of the growers can be said to be in a sound financial position. Yesterday,allusion was made to the great change that has taken place in some of the newer areas. Changes must necessarily take place, because a very large area of land has to be planted with cane in order to supply the requirements of a modern sugar mill, and that involves the expenditure of much money and the employment of a great deal of labour. In addition to those who are directly employed in the production of sugar, there are others who have to serve their needs in various ways; thus a number of businesses naturally spring up wherever a sugar mill is established. The Tully mill was given as an example. I suppose that this is one of the finest mills in the world. To a large extent that remark applies to practically every sugar mill in Queensland. I am acquainted with the results obtained by sugar mills in Java, Hawaii, Cuba and South Africa, and can say that theefficiency of the Queensland mills is not in any way inferior to them. But in spite of the efficiency of the industry in other countries, every one to-day who produces for export is in a very bad way. In Hawaii, which as honorable senators know is a territory of the United States of America, and where the sugar industry enjoys a protection of between £11 and £12a ton, not one half of the companies paid a dividend last year, although they employ very cheap coloured labour. It is ridiculous forSenator Colebatch to say, as he did last night, that the coloured labour employed in cane-producing countries is not cheaper than the white labour employed in Queensland. </para>

                            <para>- I cannot see any difference between that and what I have said. I have employed coloured labour, and can say that it is very much cheaper than white labour. I believe, however, that the sugar industry of Queensland employs as good a class of labour as is employed in any other industry in Australia. I have no complaint to make, and never have had, concerning the character of the labour employed in that industry. I, for one, welcomed the change-over from coloured to white labour - an industrial transformation which I believe is without parallel in any other country or any other industry. </para>

There was also a shortage for a brief period, not because the sugar was not available in Australia, but' because its distribution <inline font-style="italic">was</inline> held up by a dislocation of shipping services. At no time, however, was there anything approaching the inconvenience and loss which occurred in other countries. </para>

As a rule, such sales are made on a walk-in, walk-but basis; therefore, the whole of the equipment, including perhaps costly tractors, passes to the new owner. In many cases, also, the purchaser obtains a number of paid-up shares in a farmers' co-operative mill. </para>

                            <para>- I should say that a fair average to make the land ready for the plough would be about £25 an acre, although I have had land prepared at a higher cost than that. If we add the value of fencing, necessary buildings, farm- equipment, crops, and shares in a farmers' co-operative mill, the price received is probably less than the original cost. I believe that some farms have changed hands at more than their economic value. Probably <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> will admit that that has occurred also in connexion with wool and wheat lands, and that it is not a disability peculiar to the sugar industry. Nearly everything cost more in previous years than it is worth to-day. I know from my own experience, however, that farmers who are not handicapped by the high price of land, and who are able to carry on wi,th little borrowed money, are not making unreasonable profits; and in unfavorable seasons some of them are sustaining serious losses. </para>

                            <para>- I am well aware of that. In Monday's Melbourne newspapers the 20s. shares of the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> were quoted at 55s. buyers and 56s. 6d. sellers, so that the premium in the case of the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> shares is just as great as it is in the case of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company's £20 shares. The company does not derive all its profits in Australia. For instance I read in the newspapers a few days ago, that the output from the company's ' Fijian sugar mills this season will total 130,000 tons, and Upon that quantity the company is getting a preference in the British and Canadian markets of £5 a ton, which is considerably more than the preference afforded Australian sugar. </para>

                        said that under the new agreement the fruit-growers will lose by the reduction in the concession to fruit processors of from £315,000 to £200,000. Apparently the honorable senator is mistaken as to the effect &lt;of the provisions of the agreement. Fruit processors previously .obtained sugar at £36 lis. 9d. less a rebate of £6 5s. id. a ton. They thus paid £30 "6s. 8d. a ton for their sugar. Under the new agreement they will pay in the first instance £32 10s. 9d. and obtain a rebate of £2 4s. a- ton, making the price so far as they are concerned, £30 6s. 9d. a ton.

                            <para>- Account has, however, to be taken of the statement of the Assistant Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Greene)</inline> that £30,000 has already been approved as a further rebate, equal to £1 a ton, and that if the agreement is adopted the jam manufacturers and canners will obtain their sugar this season- at approximately £29 6s. 9d. a ton. I have taken from the Launceston <inline font-style="italic">Examiner,</inline> of the 24th November of this year, a report which contains the opinion of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Feil,</inline> a fruit-grower and a representative of the growers on the Fruit Concessions Committee. That report reads - " The adoption by Parliament of a new sugar agreement is of the greatest importance to the fruit-growers pf Australia," said <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Feil,</inline> a director of the Port Huon Fruit-growers Co-operative Association, who has been attending a meeting of the Sugar Concessions Committee at Canberra. " Especially may I stress its importance to the berry fruit-growers of Tasmania, as it ensures the continuance of the special concessions in the price of sugar to the fruit industry." </para>

                    <para>As an illustration of the value of these concessions, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Feil</inline> cited last year's bounty of f 10 a ton on berry pulps exported overseas. This permitted from 500 to 700 tons of otherwise unsaleable pulp to be exported, thus clearing the' local market of embarrassing surplus stocks. </para>
                    <para>Under the sugar agreement, growers are protected by the Fruit Industry Concessions Committee fixing reasonable minimum prices paid by factories. In the last annual report of the Port Huon Co-operative Association, issued a few weeks ago, the directors ' said, " Fixing the minimum price- to growers is the best step ever taken to assist the fruit industry *'. " This company," <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Feil</inline> added, " is one of the leading fruit organizations in Australia. It represents SO per cent, of the berry-growers of Tasmania, as well as many stone fruit growers ". He concluded by stating that opinion amongst fruit-growers was now practically unanimous in favour of the new sugar agreement. </para>
                    <para>That represents the opinion of the Tasmanian fruit-growers and also that of those engaged in the production of fruit in the Goulburn Valley and in the Leeton irrigation area. </para>

                        also referred to the Maffra Beet Sugar Factory, but in that reference he was unfortunate. He surely knows that the fruit concessions, the payment of freight to Western Australia, and export concessions are not paid by the Maffra concern. The Victorian Government and the Irrigation Commission are heavily involved at Ardmona, yet the Maffra factory leaves the cane-sugar industry to grant concessions to the fruit-growers in the Ardmona and Shepparton areas, in Victoria, and at Leeton, in New South Wales. The honorable senator also referred to the British preference of £4 5s. a ton enjoyed by the Australian industry, which, he said, amounted to about £1,000,000 annually. That is not correct. The preference on raw sugar is now approximately £3 lis. 6d. a ton, and the average amount received on Australian sugar entering Great Britain during the last couple of years was under £600,000 per annum. This year the preference will again be under that amount. The sugar industry is, therefore, not enjoying such a high British preferential rate as the honorable senator believes.

                        also expressed the opinion that the sugar-producers should have consented to a reduction, equivalent to 22^ per cent.; but I would point out that sugar prices did not reach the peak prices paid for other foodstuffs. Sugar prices have always been limited by the agreement entered into between the Commonwealth Government and the Queensland Government. The price which the sugar producers will receive this year will be fully 40 per cent, below that which they received when the price of sugar was fixed at £30 6s. Sd. a ton. I admit that that is due to some extent to export considerations ; but, in' primary industries, production cannot be so arranged as to avoid any surplus. Particularly is this the case in the sugar industry, the operations of which extend over 1,200 miles of coast line, and iti which 8,000 producers are engaged. It is impracticable to produce only sufficient to meet the local demand. What is wrong in the world to-day? Overproduction.

According to the last figures, we are buying annually nearly £2,000,000 worth of tea, which is sold in Australia as China tea. It has been said that the cost of sugar consumed in Australia, as compared with the price at which it could be purchased from other countries, represents an amount of £7,000,000. Professor Giblin estimated it at £5,000,000 and Professor Bridgen at £4,000,000. It would be reasonable to assume that the cost, is somewhere between those two amounts. By purchasing Australian sugar, instead of running to the bargain counters of the world to obtain it, the people of Australia are paying for the sugar they consume probably £4,500,000 per annum more than they would if they imported their requirements. </para>

Queensland purchases from the other States goods to the value of £11,300,000 per annum, which it is only fair to assume could be imported at a much lower cost.

I have always understood Australia's fiscal policy to be based, not on the cost of production in other countries, but on the reasonable cost of efficient production in this country in industries which it is thought desirable should be established here.

                            <para>- There are some persons in Australia who would like the " niggers " to grow more than tomatoes. Unfortunately, Australia is weakening on the White Australia policy and that weakening, if not checked, will lead to disaster. I speak to-day, not in support of any theoretical political idea, but in the interests of scores of thousands of persons in Queensland and other parts of Australia. Economists agree that, for every person directly employed in the production of wealth, two or three others are indirectly employed. If the thousands employed in the sugar industry are thrown out of employment, and the trade is diverted to coloured labour countries, the inevitable result will be that many more thousands of our people who are now supplying the requirements of the sugar producers will be unemployed. Some honorable senators may agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> that, in the event of restrictions being placed on the sugar-growing' industry, those who are now engaged growing sugar could find employment, in some other form of primary production. In what primary industry in Australia today could production be increased without injury to those already engaged in it? That danger is recognized by the wheat-growers and the wool-growers of Australia, as well as by the fruit-growers, who are vitally concerned" with the success of the sugar industry. The Minister said that the only alternative to this measure was the continuance of the old agreement. The Commonwealth Government has promised to stand by that agreement if this measure is rejected, and the Senate will readily understand that, in that event, the Queensland Government, as well as the sugar producers of that State, will do the same. </para>

                            <para>- I have never given evidence before the Tariff Board,and I cannot remember that a duty on sugar was ever mentioned by a representative of the sugar industry, or that the Tariff Board made any inquiry into that industry. It is true that the board made a report on sugar ; but it did not conduct an inquiry into the sugar industry. Its report was prepared in Perth. At one time, the duty on sugar entering South Africa was £14 a ten, but recently, the South African Government increased the duty by £3 17s. 6d. a ton. Its action in this respect is all the more significant when we reflect that South Africa has probably the cheapest coloured labour in the world. </para>

The sugar refined in New Zealand and consumed there in recent years has come chiefly from Cuba and Java. Fijian sugar is disposed of principally in Canada and Great Britain, where it enjoys a measure of preference, which now is greater than that given to Australian sugar. Surely, it is worth something to Australia to have its sugar requirements produced in this country. Taking the price of sugar in New Zealand at 21/2d. per lb., is it unreasonable to ask the people of Australia to pay an additional1d. per lb. to have their sugar produced in their own country, and another1/2d. per lb. for the sake of the great White Australia ideal? </para><interjection>

                            <para>- I agree with the honorable senator. I think that I was the only member on this side of the chamber to advocate a special price for wheat consumed in Australia. I do not ask for the sugar industry anything that I would not give to other primary industries. Australia must stand by her primary industries if she is to find employment for her people. If this bill is defeated, and the sugar industry destroyed, many thousands of workers will be thrown out of employment, and the economic position, already grave, will be aggravated. I hope that honorable senators will give this bill their careful and sympathetic consideration, and that when the measure is put to the vote, very few, other than the avowed freetraders, will vote against it. </para>

                        <para>. - I have, on a number of other occasions in this chamber, expressed my entire opposition to the existing embargo against the importation into Australia of sugar from other countries, and have also protested against the excessive prices which people in the southern States have been called upon to pay for Australian sugar in the interests of Queensland. This new agreement between the Commonwealth and Queensland Governments does not give adequate relief to the people in the southern States. Their demand is for cheaper sugar, particularly during this period of depression ; I regret to state that this bill will prevent them from getting it for at least four years. The reduction proposed in the price of sugar represents only 11 per cent. as against the221/2 per cent. demanded, under recent legislation, of other industries. Under the Premiers plan public servants and bondholders have been forced to accept a reduction of 221/2 per cent. in their salary payments and interest returns, hut the sugar industry is escaping with a reduction of only 11 per cent. </para>

This Parliament should have an effective control over the tariff proposals of any government, so that, if a majority approved of an alteration of the sugar duties, sugar could be imported and sold to the Australian people at a reasonable price. This would permit States like Western Australia to engage in reciprocal trading with foreign communities close to their doors. </para>

                            <para>- In Java there is an excellent market for many commodities produced in the southwestern portion of Western Australia, and in South Australia also, but because of embargoes and excessively high tariffs we are not permitted to take advantage of that natural market. We are not allowed, for example, to obtain cheap sugar produced there, in exchange for our horses, our apples, and other fruits, our biscuits, our wheat products, and many other commodities which we produce in abundance.For many years, Western Australia did a thriving trade with Mauritius, importing sugar, and sending away, in return, horses, timber, fruit and other products. In those days we were not ashamed to use the excellent brown sugar which we obtained from Mauritius. One of the things that I object to in this agreement is that it contains no provision for the marketing of brown sugar which, besides being excellent in quality - I was brought up on it - is also cheaper. All this, I remind the Senate, is done in the interests of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. Under the agreement, the price of sugar is reduced by only1/2d. per lb., from41/2d. to 4d. per lb. </para>

                            <para>- I know quite well that the growers, who do most of the work in producing sugar, are getting the least advantage out of this agreement. One of my main objections to its ratification is that it imposes onerous industrial conditions upon the growers; all employees in the industry are to be paid rates of wages out of all proportion to the wages paid in other industries, although climatic conditions are not, on the whole, more trying in the sugar districts of Queensland than they are in some other parts of that State and of Australia where farming, mining and pastoral operations are carried on. </para>

                    <para>I admit that work in the canefields is arduous, and I agree that the men engaged there should be paid adequately; but mypoint is that, for some portion of the time, at all events, the climatic conditions for cane cutting are comparatively favorable. The same cannot be said of harvesting operations. The best work is done during the hottest days, and, if a cool spell comes in the middle ofsummer, men engaged on a harvester have to cease work for the time being. </para>
                    <para>Under this agreement the price of sugar will remain constant until August, 1936, whereas under the did agreement it was to be reviewed in August, 1934, when there was good reason to expect there would be a reduction of Id. or 2d. per lb. in the retail price of sugar. There would be a greater reduction if the embargo were removed. Clearly, the object of the bill is to prevent, before 1936, any alteration of the price in a downward direction. </para>
                    <para>It is quite a mistake to suppose that this agreement finds general acceptance throughout the Commonwealth. Strong objections have already been made to it in every State except Queensland, and it does seem strange that it should have been signed by a Nationalist Prime Minister, and that the bill giving effect to it should be introduced in another place by a Tasmanian Minister, in the person of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Guy.</inline> At a later stage I hope to be able to quote briefly from speeches made a few months ago by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Guy,</inline> who then held views quite different from those lately expressed by him upon this important subject. In J July  last, an important interstate conference was held in Adelaide for the purpose of considering this agreement. All the States except Queensland were represented at that gathering, and the following resolutions were carried unanimously : - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>That, in the opinion of this conference of interstate organizations representing sugarconsuming interests, the sugar embargo, entailing a levy of approximately £7,000,000 annually, imposed an undue, unwarranted, and oppressive burden upon the people of Australia, and should be immediately removed. </para>
                        <para>That as, in the opinion of competent authorities, the sugar agreement is a violation of the provisions of section 99 of the Constitution, this meeting respectfully requests, in view of the remarks of the Chief Justice of Australia in the case of <inline font-style="italic">Anderson</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth,</inline> that the Premiers of the States most vitally interested in the question take steps to test, by legal action, the validity of the agreement. </para>

While realizing the benefits which the present embargo confers upon at least one section of the Australian community, it is felt that these are greatly outweighed by the disadvantages which the high prices place upon householders in the Commonwealth. It can be truly said that, in giving this assistance to an industry in one State, the whole of the people in the remainder of the States are having their conditions made more difficult in the process. </para>

I contend that it has done nothing of the sort. I say that the sugar industry has battened, not only on the fruit industry, but also on the wheat, wool, mining, and other industries. Then it gives the community a small dole out of its huge profits. The Commonwealth Auditor-General has estimated that the assistance granted to the industry represents a tax on the people amounting to £7,000,000 a year. </para>

In that State we have lots of soft fruits which cannot be utilized, and this is due entirely to the excessive cost of sugar. If sugar were cheap in Western Australia and other States, housewives and small orchardists would convert large quantities of surplus fruit into jam. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene</inline> told us that the sugar industry supports the fruit industry; but the Premier of Western Australia, on the other hand, has pointed out that, if the embargo were removed, cheaper sugar would result in closer settlement, intense cultivation, and, particularly, the fostering of the fruit industry. </para>

                    <para>I draw the attention of honorable senators to the Minister's inconsistency in fathering the present bill, which gives preferential treatment to the sugar industry, while refusing similar treatment to the wheat industry by providing for a bounty on wheat by means of the imposition of a sales tax on the local consumption of wheat and flour. I am in complete agreement with the opinion expressed last year  by the Minister that the special preference given <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> the sugar industry, if it is not an absolute breach of the Constitution, at least strains it to the utmost limit. Then the Minister made a strong attack on the finances of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. I have not time to read his remarks in that connexion, but they are to be found in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> The Minister also said - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>Another anomaly is that the Colonial Sugar Refinery quotes A.l sugar in New Zealand at £16 10s. a ton, while in Australia the very same sugar is quoted at £37 6s. 8d. a ton, more than double the price. That is regarded as exploitation of the worst kind by many persons outside this Parliament. It has been said in defence of the embargo that it enables Northern Queensland to support a white population, and tends to preserve our racial purity. Surely that contention has been exploded long ago. It is surprising that Australians have for so long been blind to the falsity of such a claim. It is altogether misleading. There is no reason why white people, even without an embargo, should not carry on the sugar industry just as they are carrying on other industries in Queensland. The mining industry at such places as Mount Morgan, Charters Towers and Gympie, has for years been carried on by white persons, without any special pampering such as is given to the sugar industry by means of the embargo. I think that it will be agreed that the bogy of coloured labour, with which the people of Australia have been constantly threatened, has cost them many millions of pounds. This money has been extracted from them on the pretence that it is a necessary charge to keep Australia white. That contention can no longer be supported. </para>

                            <para>- Certainly. That action was forced on me because the deletion of the provision would have meant the loss of the bill. If the right honorable gentleman was pre- pared to risk such a contingency rather than to consent to those conditions remaining in the measure, especially as they were already operating on the goldfields of Western Australia, I was not. </para>

The south-western portion of that State is just as capable of producing fruit as any other part of Australia. No better fruit is grown in the world. Although a main objection to the agreement is that it includes these nasty industrial conditions, my opposition to it is strengthened by the fact that Western Australia is excluded from any benefits that may accrue from it. We have all the disadvantages of the embargo, and no share of the crumbs from the rich man's table. </para>

The whole of the. concessions are to be enjoyed by the wealthy manufacturers or the people in a big way of business. The same principle applies  in  connexion with the tariff.

His  remarks, which are unbiased and irrefutable, prove conclusively the accuracy of everything that the critics of the industry have urged in condemnation of the embargo, under which alone the people of Australia have been exploited to the extent of - I quote the Auditor-General's own figures- about £7,000,000 per annum. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cerutty</inline> is disinterested in this matter, and no one in Australia can do other than accept the opinion of an authority of his standing and ability. </para><para class="block">He said - </para><quote>
                        <para>In regard to the sugar industry in Australia, concerning which there are many debatable features, it is unquestionable that the arrangement made for financing it imposes on the community an enormous additional cost, adding to the expense of the home of rich and poor alike. World's prices of sugar to-day in Java and Cuba are about £(&gt; per ton. Australian prices are about £30 per ton. On a local consumption of 300,000 tons, and after making various allowances, the cost of the industry upon the community is probably £7,000,000 a year. Whether such a charge can be justified on economic grounds must be seriously questioned, particularly in regard to the surplus sugar grown and exported at world's prices and at such a heavy loss. As about 30,000 workers are employed in the industry, they cost the community over £200 each annually. To import the sugar required for Australia would cost about £2,000,000, which would have to be paid for by the export of other con.modities. If the 30,000 . workers were employed in another form of productive effort, they would need to produce an average of only £70 worth of exportable goods each in order to balance the account. The average production in Australia per worker, however, is , not less than £300 per annum, and it is clear, therefore, that economically the sugar industry is a poor one, and a burden, rather than an advantage, to Australia. In other words, the sugar industry, and no doubt other industries receiving Government aid, provide unremunerative employment in a national or economic sense. Moreover, the general support given by means of the sugar agreement, taken in conjunction with the conditions and restrictions which that support has brought about, has artificially inflated, unduly and unsoundly, the price of land suitable for sugar-growing. It <inline font-style="italic">is,</inline> of course, recognized that at the present time the transfer to other occupations of those engaged in the sugar industry would be an exceedingly difficult matter, but the figures quoted indicate that a radical change in the existing conditions of the industry should be made to relieve the community of a very oppressive charge. In this connexion, it is difficult to refrain from comment on the great success achieved by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company Limited, which, from a capital of £2,425,000, paid up in cash, has, out of profits, built up a business in paid up capital of £5,850,000 besides reserves, after allowing for depreciation, of over £8,500,000. During many years, large dividends have been paid, besides a return to the shareholders of £3,900,000 in cash out of capital provided by bonuses. Although profits have slightly declined, those disclosed are still ample to pay a dividend of121/2 per cent. on the existing paid up capita], even in this time of depression, and when special arrangements have been made to raisethe price of sugar artificially. There can be no doubt that this company has attained its present prosperous and monopolistic position as a result of the high price which the consumers of Australia have paid, and are continuing to pay, for sugar. </para>
                    </quote><para>In summing up the position with respect to the sugar industry, the Auditor-General directs attention to the burden that it has been upon the working people of Australia, and also upon those engaged in other primary industries. If I spoke for a week on this subject, I could not put the position more effectively than it has been put by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cerutty,</inline> in his commendable report from which I have quoted. The Commonwealth is fortunate in having an Auditor-General, who, having a proper conception of his duties, reviews not only the finances of the Commonwealth but also matters vitally affecting the Commonwealth as he has rightly done in his report. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- Decidedly not. I am pledged to the maintenance of the White Australia policy, and I am second to none in my advocacy of that policy. I have quoted <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Guy's</inline> comprehensive statement proving that the abolition of the embargo is consistent with the maintenance of a White Australia policy, which is the foremost plank in the platform of the Country party. </para>

                    </continue><para>I now wish to refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings'</inline> reference to the fine shops, banks and other buildings in the towns in the sugar districts. The honorable senator is quite correct. He could also have referred to the fine type of persons to , be found in those towns and also in the sugar districts generally; there are no better types of citizens. But those engaged in primary industries, and the working people of Australia generally, are paying to the extent of £7,000,000 annually for the favoured conditions which are enjoyed in the sugar districts. The price of sugar is so high that in many Australian homes children do not receive sufficient sugar to nourish them adequately. The unemployed and also the pensioners are in a similarly unfortunate position. </para><para>I am opposing the agreement because it provides for a continuation of the present restriction on the planting of sugar cane in those fertile districts north of Mackay, and right through to Cairns, which comprise the richest land in Australia. The people in that locality wish to grow more sugar cane; the only complaint that I have heard from them was that many could not obtain an assignment or permit for their land on which to produce sugar. This agreement endorses the restrictions which prevent further white settlement in the sugar districts of northern Queensland. A casual inspection of the magnificent sugar cane produced in the Mackay district and northwards as far as Cairns, and which, I believe, is better still at Mossman, which I have not visited, shows that the sugar crops in those localities are much superior to those in and around Grafton and adjacent parts of New South Wales. The cane in the north is also superior as it contains a higher sugar content. There is, however, something radically wrong with the economic conditions of Australia, when under the sugar agreement, which is supported by the Government, the people in northern Queensland are prevented from planting sugar cane on land that is infinitely better than that in which it is produced in New South Wales. I understand that the sugar crops in northern Queensland reach maturity within a shorter period than do the crops in northern New South Wales. I wish to endorse the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford</inline> with respect to the efficiency displayed in every branch of the sugar industry, particularly in northern Queensland. It is a valuable industry ; but unfortunately it has to be heavily subsidized by settlers conducting their operations on poorer, higher, and drier soil, and under much less favorable monetary conditions in the southern parts of Australia. </para><interjection>

The Government is not opening up these rich tropical lands for settlement by this agreement; on the contrary, it is actually closing them against -development. </para><para>The richest portions of the tropical coastal lands in North Queensland are actually locked up against further settlement, because of the present system of restricting planting to areas now allotted and cropped; new lands will not now be assigned for sugar plantations, and no new settler can receive a " permit " to grow sugar, except by buying out an existing planter. </para><para>It is only the artificial assistance provided by the embargo that enables the sugar industry of northern New South Wales to survive in face of the competition of the more fertile areas of North Queensland. This Parliament should reject the bill and the agreement, and determine upon a policy which will encourage further settlement of North Queensland without harassing restrictions, in the interests of the industry, and those residents of North Queensland who desire to extend it. If, however, this measure is agreed to, I feel sure that the high price of Australian sugar will continue, with the result that the sugar beet industry in southern Australia will receive a new stimulus. Early this year, I visited Maffra? in Victoria, in company with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch.</inline> We found there a beet sugar mill with obsolete machinery working at a considerable disadvantage because of State management and control, and yet it was able to make an annual profit of £50,000. Large areas of Tasmania and in the southwestern portion of Western Australia are admirably suited to the cultivation of sugar beet, and if this measure becomes law, I believe that the beet sugar mills will be established there and in other parts of Australia. Nevertheless rather than establish such mills, it would be better for the people of Australia to be permitted to import cheap sugar, and for the natural industries of each State to have a chance to develop. Only to-day I have received from the Pastoralists Association of Western Australia a telegram dealing with this subject, reading as follows : - </para><quote>
                        <para>This association emphatically opposed to ratification of sugar agreement, and urges abolition of embargoes at earliest opportunity, thus enabling this State, particularly northwest, to develop' its natural trade with the Near East. </para>

                            <para>- I favour the importation of sugar and bananas from Java in exchange for our natural products. Western Australia buys from the eastern States each year goods to the value of £10,000,000, and in return those States buy from Western Australia goods valued at £1,000,000. Because of the big production per head of population, Western Australia has to find outside markets for its products. It desires to develop commercial relations with the East - J ava, the Malay States, China, and Japan - by selling to them the things it produces, and buying their products in return. </para>

                            <para>-I would let them develop naturally, as the Tariff Board recommended on the only occasion on which it had opportunity to express its views. Its findings were so unpalatable to the sugar interests of Queensland that effect has not been given to them. The board has never been given a further opportunity to express its views on the subject. It is true that committees have been appointed, but they have, for the most part, consisted of interested parties, who have travelled about the country taking evidence, which, however, was not given on oath. Even now the Government has a clear and simple duty. It should adjourn the discussion of this bill until the Senate meets next year, and, in the meantime, refer the bill to the Tariff Board, with a view to obtaining its recommendations as to the protection which should be afforded to this industry. </para>

Although its report was presented in 1922, it is remarkable how adaptable it is to present-day conditions, notwithstanding that the price of sugar outside Australia has since fallen to about one-half the price it was when the report was presented. </para>

                        <para>The Tariff Board is forced to the conclusion that the sugar industry is on somewhat of an anomalous basis. In Queensland, where nearly all the sugar is produced, the . State Government - through its instrumentalities- fixes the wages and conditions of the industry, whilst the Federal Government is called upon to protect a position it has had no hand in creating. Speaking generally, this does not appear to be a proper economical position, for in the future it might happen that the granting of a certain protection, if made necessary through special conditions imposed by any State, might not be long sufficient if the State authorities concerned decided to impose additional conditions. Such divided control does not appear to be satisfactory, and it seems reasonable  to  suggest that, should any State desire un usual conditions in one of its staple industries, it should specially contribute towards such conditions, and not penalize the whole of the Commonwealth to maintain any special conditions desired. </para>

                        <para>As soon as an agreement is made the general question is what is to happen at the conclusion of the period. Is the agreement to be continued on the same terms or reduced, or what is to happen? The producer has no real security which would lead him to invest his savings in an industry not on a secure basis. It should not be forgotten that while the present agreement has meant very much more money to the producers, it has not meant that the natural increase in the production of sugar has been very much augmented. The good seasons recently prevailing have helped the agreement. On the other hand, a protective duty is a permanent assurance on which the public may rely when considering the investment of their money and time. </para>

Oakley, Brookes and Leitch, and it represents the views of an independent tribunal, which made an investigation into the sugar industry. The report may be out of date, but successive governments could have remedied that by referring this important subject again to the Tariff Board. I conclude by repeating that the people of Australia desire cheaper sugar for household and other purposes, and that I am opposed to the agreement, because, for a period of four years, it will prevent them from getting it. </para>

                        <para>. - The speeches by the freetrade twins from Western Australia force one to the conclusion that it is impossible for persons holding strong views with regard to State interests to overcome their prejudices, and consider this important subject from a national view-point. The sugar industry is essentially national in importance, because its development is so closely related to the life of the people throughout Australia. Personally, I regard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> as a discredited witness. We all know that, in our law courts, the evidence of a discredited witness is ignored by the judge and jury. </para>

                        has endeavoured to establish the case for freetrade in sugar. Doubtless, the economics of industry in his State justify his attitude, just as they induced the people of Great Britain to remain loyal, for so long, to the policy of freetrade. For that reason, I have a certain amount of sympathy with the honorable senator; but I do not think he was quite fair in quoting the opinion of the Auditor-General, because it has been proved conclusively that that official was wrong.

                            <para>- Usually, when a man has a poor case, he quotes authorities, hoping, perhaps, to persuade his hearers that he is right. But I always feel a bit sceptical when a man relies wholly on figures and authorities to prove his case. Our case for the sugar industry rests on the truth, regardless of what the Auditor-General may say about it. He stated that we could import all our requirements in sugar for a total cost of £2,000,000, or £6 13s. 4d. a ton, whereas the official committee which investigated the position declared that to land Czechoslovakian refined sugar would cost £13 7s. 6d. a ton free of duty, and that to land Java raw sugar, and pay- all refining expenses, would cost £14 13s. 2d. a ton, free of duty. Thus the cost of 300,000 tons of imported refined sugar, duty free, would be £4,000,000; but it would co3t £4,300,000 to land that quantity of Java raw sugar free of duty and refine it in Australia. There has been a duty of £9 6s. 8d. a ton on raw sugar, and a duty of £14 a ton on other sugar. To, land 300,000 tons of Java- raws under statutory conditions, would cost £5,700,000, and to that must be added the refining cost of £1,250,000, while the same quantity of imported refined sugar would cost £8,200,000. The Auditor-General referred to raw sugar. The importation of 300,000 tons of raw sugar, duty free, to meet Australia's requirements,, would cost £2,900,000, or £900,000 more than the Auditor-General said it would cost. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> contends that under freetrade there would be a general cheapening of commodities. </para>

                            <para>- Australia is experiencing abnormal times owing, to economic conditions prevailing both in Australia and beyond its shores. The price of wheat has fallen throughout the world on account of immense overproduction. We understand that the overproduction in all countries will total this year 388,000,000 bushels. When dealing with wheat, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> has regard to present day conditions; but in discussing sugar he looks forward to the time when freetrade will prevail. I remind him that we must deal with the facts as we find them, and that if his attitude were adopted generally, the Australian sugar industry would, be destroyed. If the honorable senator supports a bounty on wheat, to be logical he must support political interference - if that term must be used - in order to protect those engaged in the sugar industry. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston,</inline> there is nothing uneconomic about a gold bounty, and he does not believe in freetrade in the matter of the sale of Melbourne beer in Perth. He is in favour of gold and wheat bounties; but he is irrevocably opposed to governmental interference in regard to bounties in other directions. </para>

                    <para>I always listen to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> with a great deal of interest, because he is u logical debater. He admits that during the war the sugar industry rendered a service to Australia. He says that nobody wishes to damage the industry. "We are all friends of the industry", he assures us. I arn reminded of a Minister of a government in Queensland who once said to me " We are all socialists, and we all believe in the brotherhood of man ", yet I was put inside a gaol for <inline font-style="italic">two</inline> months by that Minister's government because, on one occasion, I spoke on socialism without permission. This was  fi.  peculiar way of demonstrating fraternal relationship. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> reminds me of a cartoon I once saw, depicting "labour" and "capital" drinking together from a loving cup. Each had one hand on the cup, and the other behind his back holding a huge waddy. I am. afraid that some of those who claim to be friends of the sugar industry are holding a big stick behind their backs with which to give it a crack. However, I feel sure that the majority of honorable senators will vote in support of this agreement, because, as reasonable men, they will recognize that, in the present conditions of Australia, the industry would suffer if the Parliament did not stand solidly behind the agreement. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> further stated that a restriction on the production of sugar would not assist the White Australia policy. I ask the honorable gentleman if it would help that policy if production were not restricted. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> considers that Australia should produce as much sugar as possible. I point out to both honorable senators that, if production is not controlled, the position of the industry will be harder than ever. In every country in the world, whether its policy be freetrade or protection, there is a movement to restrict production. </para>

                            <para>- I propose to show that the honorable senator's ideas are archaic. He is going back 40 or 50 years. Under present economic conditions, a certain line of action is demanded, and it is entirely different from that taken a generation ago. Throughout the world, the policy of freetrade has had to go by the board, because of the evolutionary development of economic conditions. A pious wish to put back the hands of the clock will not do away with the fact that the economic conditions are such that in every country efforts are being made by those in control of industry to limit production. </para>

I contend that the time of the Senate might well be occupied in first considering fundamental things; after that, we could proceed to discuss details. Instead of doing that, we too often pay close attention to the pettifogging interests of individuals and of separate States. The unrestricted production of sugar would be detrimental to Australia. </para>

                            <para>- We are dealing with present-day conditions, and with people whose mentality is such that they do not at present favour the nationalization of the industry. Next to nationalization, I contend that the first duty of the controllers of industry is to organize in such a way as to  get the best possible return for all concerned. It has been definitely shown in many countries in the last few years that failure to exercise control of industries has resulted in tremendous waste. Everywhere throughout the world to-day wo see the result of the <inline font-style="italic">laissezfaire</inline> policy; how through lack of proper control, there are millions of unemployed and many other economic troubles in the world. I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> would break down all the barriers that exist between countries, and live in the hope of once more restoring the conditions that obtained 20, 30, 40 or 50 years ago. In that space of time, however, the world has made such progress that it is now impossible to apply old principles, or revert to freetrade conditions. Due cognizance must be taken of the facts, and every country must do its utmost to organize industry along the. lines adopted iri the sugar industry, so that best possible returns may be obtained. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> asserted that the sugar industry had exploited the consumer by means of political interference. In my early days, when I had more enthusiasm than brains, and because of my reading of Marxian philosophy, I used to argue concerning the exploitation of the consumers.. In the main, the consumers are the workers.. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> read an account of a meeting of alleged consumers which was not attended by one representative of the workers, the great bulk of whom constitute the people of Australia. I make bold-to say that if the question were put as to whether the Australian sugar,industry should continue, or whether we should import blackgrown sugar, and retail it at a cheaper price, the great majority of the Australian consumers, about whom our freetrade friends speak so often, would vote in favour of the continuance of present conditions. This matter has been discussed from the point of view of the growers and from the fanatical freetrade point of view of "Western Australia. Let us now consider it from the point of view of the workers. With. in a very short period of any reduction in the cost of living throughout Australia, strong efforts are made to reduce the wages of the workers. </para>

                            <para>- Under Federal Arbitration Court awards, in many cases, they are reduced automatically ; but apart from those awards, the controllers of industry, through their henchmen, immediately, seek to effect a reduction. Those who follow the line of reasoning adopted by Senators Colebatch and Johnston believe in an " open go " for the employer, in regard to both wages and working conditions. The philosophical anarchist believes in. freedom in all things. Senators Colebatch and Johnston, and those who think as they do, want complete freedom in all things except those that affect their own material interests. The great majority of men and women who constitute the workers of this country, from manager to office boy, are practically unaware that .there is any differentiation in the price of sugar; and if they are aware of it, they are not concerned about it. The only people who are concerned are a few  busybodies,  who have been assisted in their propaganda by certain vested interests. I have visited several of the States, and conversed with many people, within recent months, and have found few who know the first thing about the sugar industry. They are not anxious for the reduction of price that our friends propose should be made, and certainly do not desire this country to enter into economic relationships with black labour countries, the consequence of which would be the reduction of the prices of our commodities. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> went on to say that economic fact is superior to geographical influence. He has left the chamber for the moment. If he were here I should ask him to realize the truth of his own statement, and to apply it to himself. Economic facts are paramount and outstanding, and we cannot ignore them. Senators Crawford, Collings and others, have placed before the Senate the facts relating to the sugar industry; we cannot brush them on one side, but must act in conformity with them. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> also alleged that Australian sugar is being, dumped in other countries. I interjected that we are not dumping our sugar in England; and he retorted that its sale at a price lower than is being paid in Australia constitutes dumping. The way in which I view r.he matter is, that if we send sugar or any other commodity to another country, and sell it at a lower price than is being paid for similar products from competing countries, that is dumping. As a people we believe in the White Australia policy. Consequently we must support any industry which stands up to White Australia conditions. The sugar industry, undoubtedly, by the exclusion of Kanaka labour and the payment of award rates to white people, has earned the respect of all good Australians. It is performing a splendid service, and we should support it in every way. It is argued by freetraders that the entry into Australia of sugar grown by black labour in Java, Cuba or any other country, does not represent in any way h breaking down of the White Australia policy. We who sit on this side are opposed to those whose colour is different from ours, and' object to the admission of their products, only on economic grounds. -We realize the economic influences that they would have on the standard of living that has been established in this country. But I also point out to those who are students of economics and modern capitalism, that the different countries of the world have reached, in their development, the stage which enables goods to be produced so prolifically that every effort is made to prevent the free interchange of commodities between one country and another. It is not that the idea has suddenly become dominant that , a different policy from what has been followed in the past must be adopted. The very force of development has compelled the various countries to apply safeguards, the effect of which is to interfere with the free interchange of commodities. That is the point which I wish strongly to stress. In the Old Country the freetrade policy that has operated for centuries has had to be thrust aside, because of the march of events and the force of economic circumstances. If it be true that values exchange for values and goods for goods, and we are prepared to accept goods that are cheaply produced, we must pay for them in certain* values, and the goods with which we pay must go to those countries from which are obtained other goods the production value of which is low. It is demonstrable - and I hope that honorable senators who follow me will deal with the point - that under modern conditions it is bad for the community when there is what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Forgan</inline> Smith terms a poverty competition - that is to say, each country seeking to find a market for its goods by underselling and wishing to purchase in the cheapest market. As the acceptance of goods for goods is the basis of all exchange, there will be countries, just as there are traders, who are prepared to sell for less, and as time goes on that must have an effect on the living standards of the community. Under modern conditions the tendency is to lower the standard of living. Had I the time at my disposal, I should illustrate that. If we enter into freer trade relations with those countries that are economically backward, and whose standard of living is lower than ours, the reaction must be to the detriment of our people. If we pursue the policy of admitting to Australia black-grown sugar, bananas, wheat, wool or any other commodity, in the long run our general standard ' of living will be reduced, unemployment will increase, and our people will be either on the dole or flunkeys to those who happen to be the ruling class in this country. For -many years that was demonstrated in "the- Old Country; thousands of men could be employed only as flunkeys to others who had money. We do not want to see that state of affairs in Australia; we want to find honorable work for our people. Every action that closes the - avenues of employment is bad for Australia. I contend that the  opponents of the sugar industry are- seeking to establish conditions under which cheaper labour will be utilized to the detriment of our own people, who will be forced more and more on the dole. I put it to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> who is deeply interested in the wool industry, that it is a step in the right direction to organize our industries. The facts demonstrate clearly the mistakes that have been made as a consequence of lack of organization. We who sit on this side would go a long way further than some of our friends opposite, in stabilizing prices internally. If definite and courageous action were taken by the governments of Australia, it would be possible so to organize our industries that working hours could be reduced, labour could be utilized to the fullest extent, and all the needs of this country could be produced. Any surplus could be exported to help in meeting our overseas obligations. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> admits that the sugar industry is efficient. Our friends opposite have always argued that efficiency warrants recognition, and that it is grossly unfair for any person or industry to be deprived of thu proceeds of what he or it produces. It has been drilled into me ever since I was a boy, that the capitalist must be given a fair return for his industry, and that, if he becomes more and more efficient, his return should be correspondingly increased.. The sugar industry, notwithstanding what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> may say, undoubtedly has increased its efficiency and has helped Australia substantially by improving its productive capacity. Consequently, it should be rewarded. But the activity of the enemies of the industry has led to a reduction of the price of sugar. After all, that was inevitable. It must not be thought, however, that it is regarded as absolutely fair by the industry itself. A good deal is made by its opponents of overproduction in the industry. I point out, however, that during the years that we have been exporting sugar,, practically £14,000,000 worth has been sent abroad, and that has certainly helped Australia. "Within the last few years especially, there has been constant trouble concerning our credits in the Old Country, and at times governments have been at their wits' end to discharge our obligations. The sugar industry has played a most important part in Australia's development, and has also been of great assistance in helping Australia's financial position in London. By its exports, no less than £14,000,000 has been available overseas, which has assisted Australia in meeting its obligations. If the sugar industry has been working at its highest capacity by utilizing the labour, land, mills and refineries to the fullest extent, it is only reasonable to assume that it will produce more than, is required for local purposes, and must naturally have a surplus for export. In America, and in other countries when industrial plants have been working to their fullest capacity, surplus production has resulted, and this has been disposed of in other countries. By economical methods it has been possible for the Australian sugar industry to assist the Commonwealth by exporting approximately £14,000,000 worth of sugar. Every effort should be made, which I regret was not done at Ottawa, to encourage the development of Australian industries that play such an important part in our industrial life. In the matter of exports the sugar industry has played its part. The surplus production of sugar in Australia has never been a burden upon the consumer, as some suggest, because the increased production has not resulted in an increased cost to the consumers. Under the new agreement, prices will be stabilized for a period of four years. From time to time, we have heard the cry that an effort should be made to stabilize prices in order to assist primary producers, but . in this instance some representatives of the primary producers in this chamber are opposing stabilized prices. Possibly, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> will have something to say on that point when the bill is in committee. There are many who make stupid charges with respect to the sugar industry. It is a pity that those who make them do not follow the example of the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLachlan)</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch,</inline> and visit the sugar districts to see for themselves the actual conditions under which the industry is being carried on. I understand that although <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> was in the north for three weeks, he spent two weeks of the time on the Barrier Reef, where, of course, sugar is not grown. We cannot condemn him for that, because I think that every one who can do so should take an opportunity to view the phenomena and natural beauties of the reef. As I have said, stupid charges are made from time to time; but these have been answered by another honorable senator who also said that they are usually made with the object of misleading ignorant people. For instance, it has been stated that £100 an acre is paid for the land on which sugar is grown, and that the profits made by some growers enable them to take a trip to the Old Country. That has been dealt with by other honorable senators. I have received a letter from a friend of mine in the Bundaberg district, and I hope that those who are opposed to this measure will listen to what this gentleman has to say. There are, of course, some who believe that the sugar districts of northern Queensland are an Eldorado, and that all a man has to do is to find a few hundred pounds with which to buy a sugar farm, and practically all his difficulties are at an end. The letter which I have received from Bundaberg. deals with the industry from the view-point, not only of sugar producers, but also of the workers. It states - </para>

No doubt the district suffered a severe blow financially, and the loss to the district, that is, to the growers and workers, is considerable, and it isestimated that at least the loss would be £725,000. Of course, consideration has got to be given to the drought which is prevailing, which has resulted in the small crop in this area. The reduction in the price of sugar,1/2d. per lb., will undoubtedly affect the growers and workers, because the grower, in the first place, will not be able to employ the necessary labour to harvest the crop, and, consequently a lesser number of workers will be engaged in the industry, and a big possibility of the growers going to the court and seeking a variation of the sugar industry award, with a view to lowering the wages of the workers. </para>

The letter which I have quoted clearly shows that in. portions of northern Queensland there is an absence of prosperity, and that the sugar-growing country is by no means an Eldorado. A few months ago a trader in Bundaberg told me that a number of sugar-growers who were in distress had asked him to carry them over for that season. Honorable senators should bear that in mind when dealing with this subject. It is said by some that the sugar industry is uneconomical, and that we, as intelligent people, should not allow it to continue, but should absorb those now engaged in it in other directions. Even if it were decided to wipe out the sugar industry, we could not possibly find employment for those now engaged in it in other branches of primary production. I remind honorable senators that there is over-production in the wheat industry; that the price of wool is lowerthan it has ever been; that the price of meat is still going down- </para>

                    <para class="block">With due deference to the economic knowledge of those opposed to the views I am expressing, I contend that it would be impossible, even if we were to import sugar from Java or from Cuba, and thus destroy the Australian sugar industry, to find employment for those now engaged in that industry in other forms of primary production. I commend these remarks to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brennan,</inline> who, as a lawyer, is quite capable of analysing my statement. To-day we are producing huge quantities on a falling market, and the position would be accentuated if further thousands of persons were thrown out of this industry and forced to seek work in other forms of primary production. To adopt  such a course would mean that the prices of these products would be further decreased, and instead of Australia being better off as a result of the destruction of this so-called uneconomic industry, it would be infinitely worse. I understand that a livelihood can be obtained from working 40 acres of sugar land. A dairy farmer requires at least 160 acres, while a wheat farmer needs about 1,000 acres; but with wheat at its present price he would require about 10,000 acres, and might then be worse off than he is to-day. From one acre of planted cane 30 tons of cane, or 4-^ tons of sugar are produced. With an average price of 5s. a bushel for wheat, and a return of 15 bushels to the acre, a wheat farmer would receive £3 15s. an acre. With sugar at £10 a ton, and a crop of 2£ tons to the acre, the return to the sugar-grower would be £25, compared with £3 15s. from a wheat farm. In these circumstances 300,000' acres under sugar are equal to 2,000,000 acres under wheat. There is, therefore, more in this industry than is suggested by those who favour the importation of sugar from Java or Cuba at a cheaper rate than that at which sugar can be produced in Australia. To me those figures are very significant, and show that the industry provides a better return in actual value than some of its opponents suggest is possible. Some contend that it is not a natural industry; that it is one that should be  worked  by black labour. Our people in the north are doing their work well. They are producing sugar in such a way that they can be favorably compared with those of other countries. Australia extracts more sugar from one ton of cane than does any other country. Moreover, the persons engaged in the industry compare more than favorably with many in the cities. It can readily be shown that it is in every sense a natural industry, particularly as those engaged in it are healthy and are rearing healthy families who are living in reasonable comfort. Sugar can be produced in Queensland by white labour as successfully as it can.be produced in other countries. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings</inline> referred to the efficient manner in which the industry is conducted. There is a popular delusion that the Queensland industry is carried on in an extravagant manner. For the information of honorable senators I quote the opinion of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wickens,</inline> consulting engineer to Auelett and Company Limited, sugar refiners, in Natal, who some time ago visited Queensland.

                        said that the incomes of those engaged in the sugar  industry have not suffered the 22£ per cent, reduction which other sections of the community have been called upon to bear. I remind him that in 1923, during the regime of the Hughes Government, the price of sugar was reduced from £30 6s. 8d. to £27 a ton. Later, under the Scullin agreement, the price for home consumption was still further reduced to £23 - a reduction of 14 per cent. Because of overproduction, the actual price to the sugar-growers was only £20 a ton over a period of five years, making the average reduction 25 per cent. As during the war years, and subsequently, the average world price of sugar was £46 a ton, it will be seen that many millions of pounds were lost by the Queensland sugar industry because it was unable to obtain world's prices for its product.

I am reminded of a man who is employed in the Brisbane Eight Hours Day procession, and, once a year, is paid £2 for his services. He, jokingly, claims to be in receipt of a salary at the rate of £600 per annum; and there are people stupid enough to 'believe  that  these cane cutters receive throughout the year the rates set down in the award. The enemies of the sugar industry continually misrepresent it before the people. </para>

                            <para>- Any man who advocates the importation of black-grown sugar at a lower price is an enemy of the Australian sugar industry. There are people in Australia who would entirely eliminate the industry, and throw open the land for dairying or tomato-growing. Can they be described other than as enemies of the sugar industry? The Commonwealth Government pays about £40 a- year extra to its officers who are employed in the tropics. A good deal of the work connected with the growing of sugar is performed in tropical areas, where the conditions are such that the men deserve more than they get. It is all very well for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator- McLachlan</inline> to visit Queensland in the winter, when conditions are congenial, hut those who know the conditions at other times agree that the men are not overpaid. I have never taken action to reduce the wages of any workers. I stand firmly for a direct change of our economic system which will enable the workers in both primary and secondary industries to obtain better conditions. It is a poor argument to say that, because the workers in North Queensland receive si little more than ether workers are paid, there is something wrong with the industry. Any ' injury done to the sugar industry must undoubtedly have an adverse effect on other industries. For instance, considerable quantities of South Australian wine are consumed in Queensland. If the Queensland sugar industry is destroyed will the kanakas provide a market for that wine ? So long as the workers of Queensland receive reasonable wages they will be able to purchase the products of the other States. Any action taken to destroy their purchasing power will militate against all other industries in this country. That is one of the lessons which this depression should have taught -us. We must alter the conditions under which we labour so that the purchasing power of the workers is increased. </para>

                    </continue><para>I hold no brief for the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, but I submit that a lot of stupid things have been said about it by the opponents of the sugar industry, in order to prejudice people against other sections of the industry. The Labour movement has had occasion to fight the Colonial Sugar Refining Company in the past, and I imagine that it will have to do so again in the future. In that case, we hope to obtain better results than in the past, because of our better organization. Why is it that- those who attack the Colonial Sugar Refining Company do not attack other companies which make big dividends? If it is wrong for one company to make profits and to pay dividends, it is wrong for other companies to do the same. I favour the control of dividends, but the system should apply all round, and not to this company only. Even those who are most bitterly opposed to the capitalistic system must admit that, during the last century, it has, because of its reaching out after profits, increased the productivity of the earth and raised the standard of living. We, on this side, say that the system has passed its zenith and is now in process of disintegration, and that there is need for a fundamental economic change. It is most unfair to launch an attack against the workers in the sugar industry merely because this particular company has paid out large amounts in dividends. </para><interjection>

                        <para>.- I am surprised that there should be any hostility at all to this bill. For some time, both inside Parliament and among the people in the southern States, there has been an agitation for a reduction of the price of sugar. Queensland representatives in this Parliament naturally expected that, when the sugar industry yielded to that agitation and reduced the price of sugar, those who had clamoured most would have recognized its,voluntary sacrifice and, instead of criticizing it, commended the industry. </para>

                            <para>- The industry heeded the clamour for a reduction of the price of sugar even though it knew that the agitation was the work of certain persons who sought popularity. The sugar industry recognized that other sections of the community, including the workers, had made sacrifices, and it was prepared to accept its share of that sacrifice. Yet, there are some who continue to condemn it, notwithstanding that it has made a present of about £1,250,000 per annum to its customers. The average grower can ill afford the sacrifice of £d. per lb. required of him under the new agreement, because for some years now the average returns for raw sugar have been getting less and less. One would imagine, to hear the comments of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> and others who are opposed to the agreement, that the growers are all prospering - some critics describe them as " sugar barons " - when, as a matter of fact, their returns are nothing like the prices fixed under the original agreement.

                    <para class="block">Premiers plan. To-day, very few producers in Queensland or northern New South Wales are getting anything like an adequate return on the capital invested in the industry, and as a reward for the labour involved in sugar production. Much of the criticism of the new agreement and of the industry generally is most unfair, notwithstanding that it voluntarily surrendered revenue to the amount of £1,250,000 to its customers. Apparently, the objective is not a reduction of the price of sugar, but the destruction of the industry in Queensland. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> has complained that, in return for the reduced price of sugar, the period of the agreement has been extended. I consider that, as the industry could ill afford to make any sacrifice whatever, an extension of the agreement was merely some recompense for concessions made in 'the interests of the people of Australia. </para>

He spoke of the concessions made to the fruit industry in Tasmania, and endeavoured to make it appear that the fruit-growers in that State were demanding that their representatives in this chamber should support the views which he was enunciating. I believe, however, that the fruit-growers of Tasmania and Victoria know their own business quite as well as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> does. They have urged their representatives in this Parliament to support the new agreement because it contains provisions for the assistance of the fruit-growing industry. Their associations are, I imagine, fully alive to the benefits that will accrue to them under this new agreement; .so it is unnecessary for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch,</inline> by a manipulation of figures, to endeavour to make it appear that some injustice is being done to the fruit-growers under this agreement. </para>

                        this afternoon, emphasized the insistent demand that was being made in all countries for an increase of the price levels of primary products as a first step towards the economic rehabilitation of the world. We regard this course as an essential condition in the sugar industry, in which one-third of the people of Queensland are so vitally concerned; but some critics of the bill, and I include
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline>
                        in the, number, believe, apparently, that while there should be an increase of the price levels for wheat and wool, sugar should be sold for 2d. a lb. If an increase of the price levels of such commodities as wheat and wool are necessary for the recovery of Australia, the same may be said of the sugar industry, which, under the agreement, has consented to lower the price of sugar to the Australian consumers who this year will take 60 per cent, of the total production. Although the  reduction means so much to the growers it means little or nothing in the budget of the average family.
                    </para>
                    <para>I wish now to deal with a few of the mis-statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> last night. The honorable senator said that in 1920 the sugar producers asked that the then existing price of £21 a ton be increased to £23 10s. a ton, that the Piddington' Commission recommended £22 a ton, and that the Hughes Government fixed the price at £30 6s. Sd. a ton. On the surface, that statement might appear to require answering, but the recital of the facts by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch,</inline> and the inference which he deduced from the figures, were entirely misleading. Briefly the position was as follows : - The sugar producers did ask for £23 10s. a ton, but that was about one year earlier than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> said, and that higher price was required to meet higher costs' 'all round. The Piddington Commission's recommendation of £22 was based on the 1919 sugar wage, which was ls. 7d. an 'hour. In 1920 the producers asked for £30 6s. 8d. partly to rehabilitate their industry which had suffered through rising costs, and partly to meet a large wage increase then due because of the great advance in the cost of living index figures, the rate of wage being fixed by the ordinary arbitration process at 2s. an hour, the then current Australian parity. The consequential adjustment of the Piddington price of £22 was £26 5s. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> granted the industry £39 6s. Sd. or £4 more than the equivalent of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Piddington's</inline> recommendation, at a time when the Commonwealth Government had been forced to import 230,000 tons of foreign raw sugar within eighteen months at an average price of over £50 a ton, and when the world's price was actually over £90 a ton. But he required a pledge from the Australian sugar producers that they would meet Australian requirements at the earliest possible moment. The extra £4 a ton was given to induce them to comply rapidly with the last-named condition. But there was a still more important point. The Government laid it down definitely that there should be no export of sugar by Australian producers. Had they been permitted to take advantage of world's parity at that time, instead of selling their sugar in Australia for £30 6s. 8d. a ton, they could have sent it to London where the ruling price was £90 a ton. I was pleased to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> admit that the industry had rendered some service to the people of Australia at that particular time. Very few people realize what world's parity then would have meant to the sugar industry in this country. Had the industry been permitted to follow the lead of other primary industries, it could have obtained huge additional profits in the London market. </para>

                            <para>- That is so; but the Australian industry rendered a distinct service to the people of this country by accepting £306s. 8d. a ton in the local market. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> also said that, of the £9 7s. a ton received last year on exported raw sugar, £4 5s. 7d. was due to British preference. I point out that the honorable senator was five years out of date in quoting that amount of nominal preference. The old nominal rate was reduced to £4 a ton in 1926, and the effective value of the preference since then has amounted to only £3 12s. a ton in actual monetary return. It seems to me to be absurd for the critics of the industry to suggest that the export surplus is of no benefit. I admit that it is not of benefit to the Australian sugar-grower, because it brings down the home price consider-' ably; but sugar sold at London parity is of great benefit to the nation. Surely Senators Johnston and Colebatch, who never tire of telling us of the value of our exports in building up credits overseas, to enable us to meetour financial commitments there, will recognize the tremendous advantage that will accrue to the nation as a whole from exporting 150,000 tons this year to Great Britain, and selling it at world parity. </para>

                            <para>- I may inform the honorable senator that our exports to the United Kingdom this year are worth something like £570,000. The average value since 1925 has been £614,000 per annum, which will be approximately the future normal value. The exports this year will amount, approximately, to 40 per cent. of the total crop, or about 150,000 tons. </para>

                        also referred to the value of sugar lands. If land values in Queensland have been soaring, this tendencyis not confined to the sugar industry, for in practically every part of Australia, we are told that the reason why many of our wheat-growers, graziers, and others are in difficulties is the high price paid for land during the boom period. Why select one primary industry in particular, and hold it up as a striking example of the effects of soaring land values? Sugar lands vary in exactly the same way as do wheat, dairying, and other lands, according to the quality of the soil, and its capacity for production. The honorable senator and I together visited the Proserpine district. Will he contend that the land values there are exorbitant? Can he point to one farmer in the whole of that district who is making even a fair living, having regard to the amount of capital invested in his undertaking? The value of £100 an acre mentioned by the honorable senator probably includes the cost of a farm as a going concern. There might be a standing crop on it worth a considerable sum of money, and plant, horses and all equipment might also be included in the value. I frankly admit that, in practically every industry, the land values are too high. Many men engaged in wheat-farming, dairying and other industries are now in difficulties because their land was purchased at too high a price.

                            <para>- Such land is naturally more valuable than other land. I do not like the assignment principle in the growing of sugar cane, wheat or any other commodity. To my mind, it is unfortunate that in a young country like Australia, which needs to be developed, that system has been adopted; but I should be glad if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch,</inline> with his wide knowledge and great ability, could tell us what other method could be adopted in place of the assignment principle. If a go-as-you-please policy were put into operation, the growers would find themselves with more sugar on their hands than could be coped with by the existing mills, and the-* surplus production would be so large that the prices obtained would be entirely unprofitable. The assignment system has been adopted reluctantly, because at the present time no better method is known. We hope that, as the world price of sugar improves, it will be possible in years to come to put many more acres of our sugar land under  crop. </para>

                            <para>- Even if the honorable senator spent a week there, he may not know whether the machinery is new or old. I am prepared to substantiate my own statements, and the honorable senator can disprove them if he chooses to do so. Under this new agreement, the profits of the Maffra mill will automatically fall by £20,000 per annum; but one of the chief reasons for its large profits is that it contributes nothing to the fruit industry, although it is a Victorian Government factory, and government-aided fruit canneries and governmentirrigation group settlements in Victoria received last year nearly £100,000 from the cane sugar industry. The mill receives the Australian price for all its output, instead of for only 60 per cent, of it, as does cane sugar. Moreover, it is actually able to sell its output in the neighbourhood of the factory at from £1 to £" a ton more than the cane sugar Australian price; because of the transport charges which it avoids, but which the competing cane sugar-growers would have to pay. Maffra sugar takes all the benefits of the embargo, but bears none of the responsibilities. If it shared the latter on equal terms with cane sugar, its profits would disappear completely. </para>

                            <para>- In that district the crops are not so heavy as those , obtained in the far north. But' are we therefore to say that the growers in the less fertile southern districts, many of whom are pioneers in the industry, should be driven out of it? What would you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> say, if, because you are growing wheat in Western Australia on light soil, where the props are not so heavy as those obtained from farms more favorably situated, you were asked to go out of the industry altogether, to enable other farmers on richer land to grow more wheat than they do at present? Have we npt heard  speaker  after  speaker  in this chamber applaud those farmers who pioneered the light dry soils, and, with the aid superphosphates, proved that theywouldbe cultivated to advantage?Hvewe not applauded the men who have gone into those areas, and said that they are doing something for their country? If that applies to wheat, why should it not apply al so to sugar? </para>

                            <para>- It is of no use for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> to try to throw dust in my eyes. I am awake to all the little tricks that he may attempt to employ. I am dealing with the principle that, because a man grows a crop in a light area, he should be put out of business in order that the man who is more fortunatelysituated in an area with a heavier soil and better rainfall should have the sole right to products. We applaud men who grow wheat in dry country. Why then should weobject to the production of sugar cane in the Northern Rivers district of New South Wales, because it takes a little longer to reach maturity and the crop is not so heavy as in the more fortunately situated sugar areas of North Queensland? </para>

                            <para>- During the honorable senator's absence from the chamber, I dealt with that point. The assignment principle is merely a temporary arrangement. I do notbelieve in it as a principle; but although a young country needs development, and any one who will grow any sort of crop should bo encouraged to do so, the withdrawal of the present arrangement in the. existing circumstances relating to costs, production, and accumulations of sugar in the storehouses of the world would seriously injure the industry. I wish to see this agreement pur, into operation. Had the industry stated its intention to adhere to the old agreement, I should have stood behind it, irrespective of what consequences might ensue. But the industry seeks this new agreement. </para>

Even in these days of depression, when every wheat-farmer in Western Australia is said to be faced with ruin, the 25s. shares of that concern are able to retain their position at about 60s. on the stock exchange lists. I take full responsibility for saying that hundreds of persons who are growing sugar in Australia to-day owe their start in life to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. That company's charges have not been increased for years ; and, furthermore, the company has had to finance the whole of the crop- a considerable undertaking, because the farmers have to get their money before the crop is sold. </para>

When I interjected that a public meeting held in Adelaide had expressed strong views in favour of the sugar embargo and the present sugar agreement, he appeared to doubt the accuracy of my statement. I have a press cutting which contains the report of a meeting, attended by between 150 and 200 persons, and held in Adelaide about two years ago. lt was addressed by representatives of the Queensland sugar industry, and the following resolution was carried with three dissentients : - </para>

                    <para class="block">That, however, is not the meeting which I had in mind when I made the interjection.

                    <para class="block">To my mind, much of the agitation for a reduction of the price of sugar has been over-estimated a good deal by many of those who are connected with the industry, and much of it has been fomented for political purposes by persons who seize every opportunity that offers to address public meetings and have their names mentioned in the press. I do not believe that the small farmer, the worker, the artisan, or the average man about town has ever been  desirous of pulling down the price of sugar. One can organize a meeting on practically any subject, and secure the adoption of almost any resolution. The industry itself has made a sacrifice, at a time when Queensland is suffering very materially as a consequence of the fall in the prices of primary products. During the depression, when the returns from wool, wheat, meat, butter, mixed farming and other primary products have declined, the sugar industry has kept our people employed and our finances in circulation. Notwithstanding its difficulties, it has voluntarily surrendered to its customers a total of £1,250,000 per annum. The representatives of other States should accord recognition to what the industry has done towards assisting in the general rehabilitation of Australia. For that reason I hope that the agreement will speedily become law. </para>

                        <para>. - I shall not detain the Senate very long, because from the end of July last I have been, metaphorically, chewing sugar-cane and now feel that if the process continues much longer I shall probably suffer from political diabetes. Excursions into the history of the industry from the economic standpoint, the lashings that have been meted out because of the mistakes that have been made, and the accusations of false economy that have been levelled against different governments, are beside the question which the Senate is asked to consider to-day. "We are asked to discuss the question whether we shall ratify an agreement negotiated between the Government of Queensland and the Commonwealth Government, so as to secure to the people of this country, from the 5th January next, a reduction of <inline font-style="italic">i'd.</inline> per lb. in the retail price of sugar. Whatever may be the mistakes of the past; however false the doctrines espoused, and however uneconomic the action taken, the fact remains that this Government was faced with an agreement executed by its predecessor, which the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> had undertaken to honour unless it was voluntarily reviewed. I do not consider that this Government had any moral right to repudiate that agreement; consequently, the only course open to it was to negotiate' for a variation of the agreement. The prices that obtained are relevant to the debate only insofar as they affect the question whether the reduction proposed is sufficient or not. That, is the one question which has exercised the public mind, and the one matter to which the Government devoted its attention when it endeavoured to come to an arrangement with the representatives of the industry. 'The stand taken by it was that the agreement was to be accepted in its entirety, but that an effort should be made to secure a reduction of the price. In the reduction that has been made, we may possibly not have paid sufficient regard to the happenings of the past, and on that score the Government may be open to criticism. I have never had an interest in maintaining the price of sugar at a higher rate than I conscientiously and honestly think ought to be charged, having regard to all the circumstances and the happenings of the past. On the contrary, the interests of the State that I represent, and tosome extent my own predilections, lean against giving to the sugar industry the price that it has hitherto enjoyedHaving regard to what had happened in the past, the fact which had frequently been brought under the notice of the Senate that the sugar industry had been penalized during a certain period through not being allowed to extract the tribute that, on the basis of the world's market prices, it was entitled to extract, I felt that I had to approach this question with changed views with respect to the price that had been fixed. Honorable senators should remember that from 1915 to 1922 the price of Australian sugar was not allowed to be increased above pre-war prices to the extent which applied to most other commodities. At one stage when the peak price was 6d. per lb. in Australia, the price of sugar outside Australia varied from1s. 2d. to1s. 6d. per lb. In 1922 the price of 6d. per lb., which was then prevailing in Australia, was reduced by the Commonwealth Government by1d. per lb., bringing it down to 5d. per lb. Subsequently, while other industries were still allowed to obtain the benefit of the higher prices that were available and good markets, the then Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> in <inline font-style="italic">1923</inline> reduced the price of sugar by1/2d. per lb., thus bringing it down to41/2d.perlb. That was not the only reduction that was made ; but I am afraid that in the welter of debate that point has to some extent been overlooked. The sugar committee was referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> as a body that apparently was incapable of dealingwiththesubjectfromajudicial view-point; but whatever jurisdiction it had, it succeeded in embodying in the agreement accepted by the Scullin Government a rebate to the fruit producers and the fruit-processing industry of £315,000. Notwithstanding the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> that rebate is still preserved to an extent to the industry. The honorable senator loses sight of the fact that, while the rebate is reduced by £115,000, the price of sugar has also reduced by1d. per lb, that reduction being commensurate with the £115,000 reduction of the rebate. There is, however, £200,000 still available to the fruit producers of Australia, and that represents a concession of, I think, about 2/3d. per lb. When we talk of reducing the price of sugar by221/2per cent., we must pay some regard to the actual facts. In the first place the price of sugar in Australia was never allowed to soar to the giddy heights it reached in other countries. Sugar was never allowed the freedom that pertained to wool, wheat, and other products. I do not think that we need pay too much attention to the peak price of 6d. per lb., because, in order to maintain sufficient supplies in this country, sugar had to be imported at a price higher than that fixed for the local article. The reduction of1/2d. on a price, of 5d. was equivalent to a 10 per cent. cut. We have now inflicted another cut of 11 per cent., and in addition to that there is a concession of2/3d. per lb. to those engaged in the fruit-processing industry. I venture to say that if some honorable senators feel that a reduction of 22£ per cent. should have been made, based on the Premiers plan, it will be found that the reduction if calculated on the same basis, as in connexion with </para>

                    <para>In the first place, I contend that the sugar industry has faced up to the requirements of the Premiers plan. and. that if it were called upon to stand very much more at the moment, it would receive such a shock that there would be a definite repercussion, not only in Queens- land, but in other parts of the Commonwealth as well, that would not be beneficial to the Australian body politic. Although I was anxious that the benefit of any reduction of price should go to the consumers of sugar, not only families, but also large charitable institutions which feel the pinch when making their supplies of jam, I felt that any fraction of a penny less than -Jd. would have very little effect; in other words, any benefit to the consumer would be lost in the process of distribution. If honorable senators care to examine the cost of living figures upon which wages are based, they will find that sugar is well into line with those other commodities the price, of which has been reduced. It is not my intention to repeat statements which have already been made, but- I should like honorable senators to bear in mind what is actually happening before coming to a conclusion in this matter. The Assistant Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Greene)</inline> referred to the fact that the British Government purchased 250,000 tons of sugar from Mauritius at £90 a ton, and that from 1915 to 1922, the world's parity for sugar was at its highest. It varied from £20 to £137 10s. throughout that period, and for a considerable time was about £100 a ton. It is not my intention to refer to the subject of preferences which was dealt with by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch,</inline> and replied to very effectively by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll.</inline> I should, however, like to say a word or two with respect to that portion of the agreement which preserves the concession to fruit processors. I have already pointed out that we have preserved to them the benefits which the\ enjoy under the previous agreement, but owing to the fact that the price of sugar bus been reduced, that benefit has been preserved in a slightly different way. The concession has been reduced by £115.000, but £200,000 is still available for the use of the committee. Some unwarranted references were made last night with respect to the personnel of the concession committee. That committee consists of one nominee of the Federal Government, one nominee of the Queensland Government, and four gentlemen nominated by various branches of the fruit industry. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Feil</inline> represents the growers of jam fruits, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Young</inline> the growers of canning fruits, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Palfreyman</inline> the proprietary manufacturers of fruit products, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fairley</inline> the cooperative and State manufacturers of fruit products, lt will therefore be seen that every section of the industry is represented. It was the duty of this committee to conduct an investigation, and report to the Minister as it did on the 4th of November last. The committeeprepared a balance-sheet which was duly audited, and then proceeded to give such advice as it thought necessary with respect  to an industry which was receiving £315,000 for the purpose of encouraging fruit-processing. The sugar used by those engaged in fruit-processing provides an outlet for a portion of the product of the sugar industry. The sugar industry looks for an expansion of its activities, and for increased markets for its product. On the other hand, those engaged in the fruit industry, while they do not wish to see the sugar industry injured, are anxious that sugar shall be produced under the best possible conditions, so that it may continue to obtain the supplies it requires at the lowest pos'sible cost. On page 9 of the report, the result of the committee's operations for last year is given. There is a summary of the minimum fruit prices for 1932. This is one of the industries which was consulted regarding the extent of the sacrifice being made by the sugar interests, and asked whether it could justify giving them a <inline font-style="italic">quid pro quo</inline> in the shape of an extended period. The following table shows the prices it was able to secure: - </para>

                            <para>-The recent rates are, I am informed, slightly higher. The report then deals with the prices of various classes of fruit, after which it sets out the difficulties encountered in administration. Then follow the statistics relating to domestic rebates from which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> quoted last night. It is true that Western Australia received only about £1,337, whereas South Australia received £17,000, Queensland £19,000, Victoria, £72,000, New South Wales, £34,000, and Tasmania, £26,000. The  smaller amount received by Western Australia is due to the fact that the industry had not developed to any great extent in that State. If Western Australia wants to get into the ring, and obtain these benefits, it should go in for fruit processing, for which I understand there is a good opening in the State. The honorable senator quoted statistics from paragraph 47 in relation to export rebates. Western Australia received £1 8s. 6d. - a small amount, it is true, but all that the State was entitled to receive. Its industry will have to be developed if more is to be received from that source. I do not think that the reflections made on these gentlemen yesterday were justified. They acted all through in a businesslike manner, in the interest of the industry. Unfortunately, there has been too much haphazard development in connexion with some Australian industries. An economic survey is necessary from time to time, in order to enable us to understand our position. Had economic conditions been taken into consideration at the beginning, we should not to-day be discussing a sugar agreement. The agreement is the responsibility, not of the sugar industry, but of this Parliament. The severe criticism levelled against the industry last night should have been directed against this Parliament, because the first step towards the agreement was taken here. The sugar industry cannot be blamed for having taken advantage of the opportunity presented to it. I have a good deal of sympathy with the industry, because of the criticism unjustly directed against it. </para>

                    <para>A good deal of criticism was directed against the penultimate clause of the report which, in paragraph86, sounded a warning about expecting too much from Ottawa. Those responsible for the report desired to assist the industry by establishing it on sound lines. Yet, what they have done has been described as a piece of official impertinence. I deprecate such remarks. Surely those who have handled this business are in the best position to judge of the advice that ought to be given ! The berry-fruit industry, and other fruit-processing industries, have expressed their satisfaction that the Government has been able to make such satisfactory terms. Is it not fair that some security should be given to the sugar industry for a reduction of1/2d. per lb. in the retail price of sugar? It must be remembered that the industry was protected by an embargo on the importation of sugar for the remainder of the term of the old agreement. I suggest that even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> would not have reduced the price of sugar by more than 1d. a lb. in 1934, so that by reducing the price by1/2d. a lb. now we have done as much as would have been accomplished then. The agreement is fair to both the consumers of sugar and those who produce it. It is impossible to determine these things accurately to decimals of a penny. I submit that the agreement is only fair to those people who have acted in the belief that the Commonwealth Parliament will continue to deal fairly with the industry. This national industry has been well advised to get its position stabilized. One sharp-minded gentleman who travelled with me put the position clearly when he said, " Here is an industry in .which £30,000,000 has been invested, but which, nevertheless, is like an inverted obelisk in that it does not rest on a sound foundation ". Particularly in a time of crisis, it was the duty of the Government to establish this industry on a sound foundation in the interests, not only of the industry itself, but also of Australia as a whole. </para>
                    <para>Statements have been made regarding the charges levied by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. I am not personally concerned with the business of this company, and should not have spoken on this subject but for the fact that the committee which inquired into this question some time ago reported that the earnings of the company on its operations in Australia were only per cent, on the capital invested, after income tax had been taken into consideration and there had been a considerable writing down of values. The gross earnings of that company were found to be 7J per cent. Although the net profits were, as I have stated, 5 J per cent, on the company's Australian operations, they were higher on the business done outside Australia. Since 1915, the company has not increased its charge for refining sugar. In my treatment of this question, I have endeavoured to get to the bottom of things. I know how popular it is to make huge concerns like the Colonial Sugar Refining Company a "cock-shy". I desire to pay my tribute to the management of the company. That it has been able to make a profit, albeit a small one, on its undertaking, is, so far as Australia is concerned, evidence of its business ability. </para>

                            <para>- No. The complaint about watered stock was investigated by the committee appointed by the Government of which the honorable gentleman was a member, and it was shown that there was no truth in it. Actually it does not matter very much if a company issues bonus shares, as happened in the case of the Swan brewery, or as might have been done by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, because bonus shares represent profits which should have gone into the pockets of the shareholders, but are retained to increase the share capital of a company without calling up more money from shareholders. Instead of receiving a dividend as his share of the profits, the shareholder get3 it in the form of bonus shares. It would appear that criticism of the agreement is really an attack on the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. I believe, however, that, in making this new agreement, the Government has done its duty by the industry, and that the industry has done its duty by the Australian consumers. The proviso relating to arbitration is not contrary to the law, nor is it foreign to the industry. It has merely been inserted- to provide for certain eventualities. My purpose in arranging the conference with those connected with the industry was to get a reduction of the price of sugar, and I was obliged to accept certain provisions that are contained in the agreement. But I put it to the Senate that it is for the industry itself to sec that the laws of this country are observed, and that the wages paid are in line with our accepted ideas of Australian conditions. I recognize, of course, that, trouble might arise if employers and employees acted in collusion, as was the case, some years ago, in connexion with another industry in which Queensland was not interested; but such a condition of affairs is not possible under this agreement. I therefore commend it to honorable senators as an amicable result of the conference between the Government and the sugar interests. It has been accepted by the Government of Queensland, and I hope that the bill will be carried, because it will give some relief to consumers, and because I believe it is also in the interests of the sugar industry. </para>

                            <para>- I am willing to support any proposal for the assistance of the wheat industry that the honorable senator is game to bring forward. But, while I intend to vote for the bill, I am not very enthusiastic about the agreement. After listening carefully to all that has been said by honorable senators on both sides, I have come to the conclusion that much of the criticism has been of a destructive character; that no attempt has been made to suggest some other method which would secure the results that are expected to flow from the ratification of this agreement. It is as well to bear in mind that probably from 80 per cent, to 85 per cent, of the people in this country, and I think the same may be said of most other communities, are wage-earners - when they can get jobs to do - and that wages go up and down with the rise and fall in the cost of living. In recent times, unfortunately, the movement has been in a downward direction. I therefore contend that a reduction of <inline font-style="italic">id.</inline> per lb. in the price of sugar will mean that the wages of those employed in the industry will be reduced proportionately, and possibly to a greater extent. Under our present capitalistic system, the wages fall more rapidly than the cost of living figures, and conversely they lag behind any rise in the index figures. The Arbitration Court nowadays merely helps in the process. At the present time an appeal to the Arbitration Court is really an invitation to get a slap in the eye, because on every occasion during the last couple of years the Arbitration Court has acted as a wage-reducing tribunal, and it is likely to continue to so act for some time to come. </para>

                            <para>- I am referring to the principle. As to how it would work out in actual practice would depend upon circumstances over which we have no control. It has also been contended that the agreements hitherto made between the Commonwealth Government and the sugar industry are a violation of, if not the letter ? at all events the spirit, of the Constitution. I was not aware that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Guy,</inline> the Assistant Minister who moved the second reading of the bill in another place, was a constitutional authority; but he is reported to have declared that the earlier agreements were a violation of the Constitution. I assume he has 'in mind those constitutional provisions which stipulate that no law shall be valid if it benefits one State only. I am not aware that there has' ever been an attempt to give legal force to any proposal for preferential treatment to one particular State. If we enact a law or impose a duty which confers a benefit on, say, pineapple-growers, the fact that it may benefit Queensland only does not prove that it violates the Constitution, because Queensland is the only State where pineapples may be grown on a commercial basis. It follows, therefore, that if such a law or duty were a violation of the Constitution it might, with equal force, be argued that because galvanized iron is, so I am told, manufactured by only one firm in Australia, a tariff on galvanized iron would be a violation of the Constitution. Of course this would not be to state the position correctly, because manufacturers in any other State could, at any time, begin the manufacture of galvanized iron, so it could not be argued that the duties were really in the nature of differential treatment for one State. </para>

                    <para>The other point to which I desire to refer is the limitation of production under this agreement. It is a fact that, because of certain restrictive provisions in the agreement, the sugar industry cannot be further developed, even in areas  most suitable for the production of sugar cane, because to do that would cause a glut in the market, thereby lowering the average prices to the growers. This is a condition of affairs for which neither the Government nor the sugar industry can be held responsible. It is merely another of those anomalies that arise under the capitalistic system and are causing so much trouble in various countries. In the newspapers of yesterday or the day before there appeared a statement that the Government of Brazil had absolutely prohibited the planting of any more coffee trees, the intention being to limit future production, because last year, so it was stated, over  4,000  tons of coffee had to be destroyed in order to keep up the price for the remainder of the crop. Some years ago there was an attempt to restrict supplies by using the surplus coffee as fuel; but as this arrangement interfered with the business of fuel merchants, the surplus stocks were then dumped in the sea. Two or three years ago, because of the extraordinarily heavy crop of cotton in the southern States of the United States of America, the growers decided to destroy every third row in their cotton plantations. Certain planters who, for some years, had been getting poor returns, and who, then, had better crops, declined to fall in with the proposal. Consequently, the majority of planters organized night raids and destroyed not only the crops, but also in many cases the dwellings of those planters who objected to the plan. More recently the British Government had to come to some arrangement to limit the production of cotton in the Soudan, and I understand that the authorities in Egypt have taken similar action.Actually, so much wealth is being produced in all countries that the problem now confronting governments is to prevent the glutting of markets, in order to keep up commodity prices. </para>

I support the agreement on the ground that it deals in' an orderly way with an industry which, except, for an agreement of this kind, would be plunged into chaos, to the detriment of the people of Australia. I do not look with contempt upon any race, whatever its colour or degree of civilization; but, in all cases in which the white race has obtained power, it has attempted to use, and has mostly succeeded in using, the. coloured races to provide cheap labour in order to break down the conditions of the white workers. </para>

                            <para>- There seems to be disagreement among honorable senators from Queensland upon that point. I was interested to hear the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> about the attitude of the Government towards the Customs Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes</inline> endeavoured to ascertain when that bill would be brought before the Senate, but he could obtain no satisfactory information on the matter. That measure was placed at the bottom of the notice-paper in May last, and there it remains. The Government does not appear to take the Senate much into its confidence when it is necessary for us to rely on press statements, even those appearing in the sugar journal, for information as to why the Customs bill has been placed in the back ground. I can well understand the anxiety of the Government and of Queenslanders regarding the legality of the agreement. In view of the numerous decisions of the High Court, it must have been worrying to the Government to be told that any agreement regarding sugar might be upset if action were taken by a State Government or by others to test its validity. I ask for leave to continue my remarks later. </para>

                <para class="block">Honorable senators will remember that some time ago the Parliament agreed to a bill for an amendment of the War Service Homes Act to enable certain relief to be given to tenants under that act, as a result of an inquiry made into their circumstances. When the Government came to give effect to that measure, it had to approach the State Savings Bank of Victoria which was under an agreement administering war service  homes in that State, but owing to certain differences the Commonwealth Government and the State Government have amicably decided to alter the arrangement for the control of these homes in Victoria. It was necessary that a bill be passed immediately to give effect to the proposed alteration, and a bill was prepared and introduced in another place providing that it should take effect by proclamation. Owing, however, to various interesting events that intervened, this matter has been somewhat overlooked, and it is now apparent that the revised agreement must take effect from to-day; otherwise the tenants will not get the benefit of it until some time in January next. It has been ascertained that the proclamation cannot be made retrospective. The Victorian Government has, therefore, agreed to pass a bill through all its stages in the State Parliament to-day, and by arrangement with all parties similar action has already been taken in the House of Representatives. I am now asking the Senate to agree to the suspension of the Standing Orders so that the bill may be passed through all stages in this chamber without delay. </para>

                    <para>The Leader of the Government has explained the urgency of this measure. Prior to the passing of the War Service Homes Act 1927, the State Savings Bank of Victoria had acted in that State as agent on behalf of the War Service Homes Commission. By Act No. 33 of 1927, and at the request of the Victorian State Savings Bank, the homes which that body had provided as agents for the Commission were transferred to its control, and its relationship was changed from that of agent to that of principal. Honorable senators will remember that recently a committee appointed by the Commonwealth Government inquired into the administration of the War Service Homes Act, and the relief that should be afforded to purchasers ofhomes  under it. In the main, the recommendations of that committee were accepted by the Government, and operated by the department. The Victorian State Savings Bank Commissioners were asked to extend similar concessions to the occupants of war service homes with whom they were dealing as principals. There are 3,600 of those persons in Victoria, and the Commonwealth Government considered that they should enjoy the concessions extended to the purchasers of war service homes in other parts of Australia. The bank, however, felt that such action would lead to its having to extend the concessions to returned soldiers who are purchasing homes from it under other terms, and that the resultant loss would be too great. It, therefore, asked to be relieved of its administration under the agreement. Negotiations were conducted with the bank over a considerable period, with the object of formulating proposals that would enable the War Service Homes Commissioner to discharge the obligations formerly discharged by the bank as principal for the Commonwealth Government. The arrangement arrived at is the subject of the agreement which is attached to the bill. </para>

                            <para>- No. To-day the bank is the principal, and, except by moral suasion, we could not compel it to give these concessions to the 3,600 purchasers of homes to whom I have referred. The position in South Australia is slightly different from that which exists in Victoria. This is simply an effort to extend to returned soldiers who have entered into contracts with the Victorian State Savings Bank, the concessions that have been given to those who have purchased from the Commissioner of War Service Homes. It was finally arranged that there should be a payment of £184,000 by the bank to the Commissioner. The department estimates that there will be a saving in administration of £10,000 a year, because the payment to the bank of 13s. per cent, upon loan balances will be terminated. As the passage of the bill will enable us to give the concessions that I have mentioned, I ask honorable senators to agree to it. </para>

                        <para>. - I was about to dissect the statistics of the Queensland Sugar Board, and to seek information concerning the sum that is required to finance and sell the product of the sugar industry. The efficiency of the industry is not disputed. We all agree that it is most efficiently managed. But in the accounts of the board huge amounts appear on the expenditure side, and it would be interesting to obtain information concerning some of them. I would not expect to succeed in that quest. I notice that last year £427,000 was provided for managing and financing, and a further £109,000 for the selling of the product. Those are considerable amounts. Looking at the advertisements concerning the industry that are circulated throughout Australia, and estimating roughly what they cost, it is apparent that considerable provision must be made under sonic heading. Probably, it is included in one of thesetwo sums to which I have drawn attention. But the whole of it has to come out of the industry and, through it, from the consumers within Australia. It certainly does not come from overseas consumers, because Australian sugar is sold abroad at probably half the cost of production Although the industry may be very efficiently managed there is another very large sum appearing in the interns of expenditure. I refer to the amount of £315,000 paid last year to the fruit processors and which I contend can be regarded only as a sop to the fruit industry, although it was very acceptable to that industry and should be continued at that amount instead of being reduced to £200,000. </para>

                            <para>- I think that I should be entitled to make my speech in my own way. I do not intend to refrain from answering interjections, but if they are made too frequently I shall have little opportunity to express my ideas on the bill now before the Senate. It has been said that those honorable senators who are opposing the agreement are in favour of the employment of coloured labour. I give that statement an emphatic denial. I am sure that no honorable senator on this side of the chamber believes in the introduction of coloured labour. On the other hand, I am somewhat concerned about the labour actually employed on the Queensland sugar-fields. According to the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Sugar Journal</inline> of the 3rd November, 1932, large numbers of aliens are employed on the Queensland sugar-fields. Frequent reference has been made to the utterances of Professor Brigden, particularly by those who support the views which he has expressed. This is what that gentleman said concerning the naturalization of the workers in the Queensland sugar industry- </para>

                            Australian Workers Union * fully organizes the employees in the industry, and it is in close association with the organizations of the employers. A comprehensive State award regulates the conditions of employment; but subordinate agreements are made with the intention of limiting the employment of foreigners. The so-called - " alien influx " has been a troublesome question in the northern district, and some 43 per cent. of the cutters and 34 per cent, of thu field workers are of foreign birth and unnaturalized.

It is rather peculiar that there should be such wonderful unanimity between the workers in the industry and their employers, particularly as to the way in which this huge monopolistic concern is carried on. When the industry can afford to give away so much, it is only natural that its policy should be supported by its employees. </para>

                            <para>- Certainly not, but the industry is able to pay higher rates because of the advantages which it enjoys in many directions, and there are ways in which concessions can be given without suggesting bribery. Because of the high price it receives for the refining of sugar, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company is able to grant privileges which otherwise would not be warranted. It cannot be denied that during the years in which the company has been in operation it has taken millions of pounds from some one. It has been said that these amounts were profits which could have been returned to the shareholders instead of being used for capitalization purposes. These profits had to come from somewhere, and must have been made out of the industry. It is remarkable to find the  chairman  of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company stating at its annual meeting year after year that it has been passing through troublous times and has just managed to make sufficient to ' pay a dividend. As a rule he also said that the outlook and the prospects of the coming season were uncertain. During the present unprecedented depression this company has not had to reduce its dividends. It is practically the only big Australian company which has not had to do so. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think the Minister's information is correct. Within the last few months there have been shortages of sugar at Hobart, and merchants there have had to borrow from one another. In any case, I cannot see why there should not be a sugar depot at Hobart, as well as in the other capital cities. I admit that the position is not so serious as it was in previous years, when practically every summer the dislocationof the shipping service in Tasmania caused a shortage of supplies. Nevertheless, there are still shortages. </para>

If there were a depot at Hobart any one could obtain half a ton of sugar on the spot without difficulty, and supplies would always be available. The position should be looked into by the Government, with a view to placing Hobart on the same footing as the other capital cities.

                            <para>- The Sugar Inquiry Committee, which was partly responsible for the drafting of this agreement, made it clear that the number of Italian cane-growers is only 10 per cent. of the total, but, as I have explained, they are in the majority in the Ingham and Tully districts. The honorable senator also misled the Senate with regard to the nationality of the cane-cutting gangs. As the result of negotiations between the rival nationalities in the industry, there is now in operation what is known as a gentlemen's agreement under which the canecutting gangs are to be constituted of 75 per cent. British and 25 per cent. Italian. </para>

Perhaps he is unaware that all cane-cutting is piece-work, and as the men have become experts at the business, they are able to make in some cases £10 a week working under conditions prescribed by the Arbitration Court. But this is not their net return. Out of their wages they have to provide for a cook and to meet other expenses in connexion with the general mess. </para>

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> also spoke of the profits earned by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. I remind him that in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> of the 16th instant, there appeared a statement of accounts in connexion with Henry Jones Co-operative Limited, fruit-eanners, for the year ended the 31st October, 1932. This showed that in 1931, on a capital of £1,430,173, the net income was £91,554 and the amount paid to reserve was £2,168.For this year, the net income was £171,066, and the amount placed to reserve was £45,926. This highly satisfactory financial position is, I contend, due to the efficiency of the company in question, and the same may be said of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. I regret that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> should have spoken iu such an offhand, if not sneering manner, concerning the Italians living and working in the sugar areas of Queensland. It is as well to remind him that, as they were admitted under our immigration laws, and, as the great majority of them have become naturalized citizens of Australia, they are entitled to full citizenship rights. I might add that it ill becomes any British subject to speak sneeringly of Italian citizens, because the British race is merely an offshoot of the Romans, who invaded Britain and settled in that country. This being so, it would not bo wide of the truth to say that the Italians now settled in Australia are, perhaps, somewhat remotely, I admit, our brothers and sisters, and, as such, should be treated with the respect due to the direct descendants of a worthy nation. "When I was in Northern Queensland recently, I made it my business to inquire of police magistrates, sergeants of police, and inspectors exactly what was the official opinion regarding the Italians settled in the suga.r-growing areas, and, without exception, they all spoke most highly of them. I have also had personal experience of Italian migrants, and I must admit that, judged from the physical stand-point, the great majority of them would make a very good blend with native-born Australian citizens. I therefore hope that we shall hear no more of these objections to Italians engaged in farming or employed on sugar-growing lands in Queensland. I felt it my duty to remove the false impression which, I fear, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant's</inline> remarks had made on honorable senators; but I do him the credit of believing that he spoke in ignorance of the facts. I hope that the bill will be carried. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not intend to occupy more than a few minutes in stating my reasons for opposing the second reading of the bill. Had the measure been framed in a different manner, and had it been capable of amendment, probably I should not have offered opposition to it. But the same tactics have been followed with respect to it, as were followed, and with less justification, in the case of the bill giving effect to the Ottawa agreement. "1 admit that a rearrangement of the subjects dealt with in that measure would have been very difficult, because of considerations of time and distance; but those difficulties do not present themselves in connexion with this bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan,</inline> who is to a great extent responsible for the measure, and who, doubtless, worked hard and disinterestedly in framing the sugar agreement, stated that the sugar industry has been under parliamentary  control. I am sure the honorable gentleman did not mean what he said; because it has been pretty obvious for many years that the relations between the sugar industry and the rest of Australia have not been within the control of Parliament ; nor are they under this bill. In my opinion, it would have been better if the conditions agreed upon at the conference had been embodied iri a bill, because Parliament would then have had full opportunity to criticize, and, if necessary, amend them. But that was not done, and we are now asked to pass the bill approving the agreement, knowing full well that we cannot alter it. That is not giving to Parliament the full control which it should have. For that reason, and also because I think that the terms of the agreement as it stands at present are not fair and equitable to the State that I represent, I am opposing the second reading. If it had been decided to submit the terms of the agreement to Parliament, and if the agreement were capable of amendment, the task would have been simpler. . The process might have taken longer, but let me say that this portion of the present period is not the right time to bring a bill for an act such as this before the Parliament. That this is an intensely complicated measure is easily seen from the fact that, with four exceptions, all speakers have differed from one another. The honorable senators who constitute the four exceptions have said practically the same thing. I congratulate the Government on having brought down a bill which has produced such complete amity among hitherto warring sections in Parliament. On this side we have alleged tories, and on the other side, advanced gentlemen from Queensland - in the Senate new arrivals - agreeing to the horrible principle of piecework. There is hope in that for both parties. We have also heard them praising in unstinted terms a company which has done admirably well, and which, I understand, a few years ago was anathema to the party opposite. It is delightful to see brothers dwelling in amity together. </para>

I can understand these gentlemen, who have believed all their lives in the socialization of industry, watching this great company grow fatter and fatter, and saying like Blucher, when he first saw London, " Oh, what a city to loot ". I can imagine them looking at this company, and exclaiming to one another, "What a good thing to socialize". I am wondering _ whether the industry will be socialized, or the gentlemen opposite civilized. </para>

                    <para>I wish to disclaim any enmity whatever towards the sugar industry, for I have not seen much of it. It is not my custom to go into a district for about ten minutes, and then to think that I know all about it. I went into what is alleged to be the best sugar district of Queensland - that around Innisfail - and by the courtesy of those in authority there, I had ari excellent opportunity to observe the circumstances under which the industry is being conducted. It was very pleasing indeed to see this. People have talked vaguely in the past about the inefficiency of the industry, but, so far as I could see, nothing but the highest efficiency obtained there. I saw the three big mills at South Johnstone, Mourilyan, and Goondi. I was given every opportunity to go through those mills, and as an old mining man, I discovered great similarity between an ore treatment plant and a sugar mill. I could see sufficient to realize to what a high state of efficiency the gentlemen in control of those mills had brought them. I was struck by the friendly relations between the rival millers themselves. One noticed a gadget invented in connexion with one plant in order to produce greater efficiency, and when going to another plant, one noticed a different improvement. Yet the millers were living in the greatest amity with one another, because they have a great deal at stake. I found them in agreement with one another in all matters except in regard to the excellence of their respective gadgets. It was very pleasing to note that friendly rivalry. There is nothing like the two extremes - extreme prosperity or extreme poverty - to bring people together. In this case I am glad to say that it was extreme prosperity. They have been living, and they hope to continue to live, in a sort of golden era. They are satisfied that the closer they get together, and the more they cooperate with the workers, the more powerful they will be. There seemed to have been formed in North Queensland a powerful alliance between the two sections of industry. </para>

That honorable senator has a wide knowledge of the industry, and though I regard the matter from quite a different angle from that from which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford</inline> views it, I congratulate him on his speech. It is true that he accused me of being a dog, and of " baying the moon ", but I presume that he was referring only to a figurative moon. I suppose, in the first place, that the moon is represented by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. Yet there is no moonshine about that concern. It is not an extinct planet, but a live body inhabited by extremely efficient men, who found a field ready ploughed to their hands. They have cultivated that field to the greatest possible advantage, and 1 congratulatethem upon the success they have attained. It is not given to everybody to find such a field from which inch wonderful harvests can be reaped. </para>

                        made a statement about the division of the sugar districts, which, I think, is the only assertion that has not been contradicted in this debate. Like Gaul, Queensland is divided into three districts, the southern, the central and the northern, and so far as I can learn, the bulk of the sugar and the bulk of the interests are in the northern division. The southern and central divisions are apt to suffer from the vagaries of the climate. When I visited Queensland I could sec the effects of frosts and drought, and it occurs to me that it would be a good thing if the Queensland Government took steps to establish some other industry in place of sugar-growing in those districts. Of course the Commonwealth Government could not do it; it makes enough attempts at interfering with State affairs, sometimes with, and sometimes without conspicuous success. But if the people of those areas could be induced by the Government of Queensland, and by the force of circumstances, to turn their attention to some other means of livelihood, I think that it would pay them quite as well as the growing of sugar.
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline>
                        was accused of having said that they ought to grow tomatoes, but I do not believe that he made that statement; it. sounds like a remark torn from its context. There are several other industries, however, the prospects of which have been wonderfully enhanced by the Ottawa agreement. I have in mind such an industry as the intense fattening of cattle. That, I believe, could be established. If a number of small holders of sugar lands, each with an area that could be well looked after, could be induced to cultivate suitable fodders for the fattening of stock - almost anything can be grown in those districts - so long as enough store stock were made available, the farmers could not only grow baby beef, but also beef that would be killed where it had been fattened. I have no doubt about a market being obtainable for such beef. That has all been made possible under the Ottawa agreement. 1 think that
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline>
                        said that Queensland stood to gain an additional £1,000,000 out of the demand for Australian meat. If the quality of the meat is improved, and the age at which the stock is killed is reduced, there is no limit to the possibility of building up a prosperous industry in this direction. The growers could adopt the same system as that followed in Canada and the United States of America, where the cattle are bred on the ranges and are fattened inspecial districts. The only difficulty is transport, but that could, I think, be arranged. If the Queensland Government could be brought to realize the possibility of establishing a large, new and what promises to be a very prosperous industry, I have no doubt that the necessary financial arrangements could be made. Many of the areas on which sugar is now grown are large and fertile, but they do not, as a rule, possess that regular and sufficient rainfall that is undoubtedly required for the successful cultivation of sugar. If the areas that are suitable for cattle-raising - and there are immense tracts of this country along the rivers and in other places - I am sure this industry under methods which are new to Queensland, could be put intosuccessful operation.

                            <para>- Quite so; and, strangely enough, we passed this afternoon a bill embodying another agreement to which a similar condition applied. In its case, and in the case of the Ottawa agreement, that was inevitable; but it is not inevitable in this case. It could easily be arranged that Parliament should have the only effective means of criticizing the bill; that is, by making or endeavouring to make certain amendments to it in committee. We might then fix a period of years during which the price could be varied, and make it possible to effect savings by keeping as low as possible the exportable surplus that is necessary for the prosperity of the industry. The last thing that I desire is that the sugar industry of Australia shall be affected adversely in the slightest degree. We have chosen to cut Australia off from the sugar supplies of the rest of the world. That is the will of Australia, and it must prevail. But let us act sensibly, by improving the industry to as great an extent as possible, in the direction of avoiding the quite avoidable surplus production. I realize, of course, that there must be a margin; but the export figure has gone beyond a reasonable margin, and it is a question of " the tail wagging the dog". Those who live in areas that are more happily situated than others for sugar-growing, must see  that  it is nothing but a mistaken pride which prevents their adoption of the method that, in the embryonic stage, I have placed before the Senate. A good deal may be done in regard to beef, as well as with what the Ottawa agreement euphoniously terms " pig meats ", and in the production of eggs - which, during the depression, came to the rescue of New South Wales to a most marked and wonderful degree. </para>

If it is, I shall certainly vote for any amendment which would remove the embargo on the importation of foreign-grown sugar. </para>

I am rather amazed at the attitude towards the sugar embargo that has been adopted in this, the States' House. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown's</inline> reference to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston's</inline> attitude to the transport of beer from Melbourne and Adelaide to Western Australia may have appeared on the surface to be merely jocose; but, viewed from whatever angle <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> may choose, his was, nevertheless, an attempt to raise a tariff wall against competition by other States with a Western Australian manufacture. </para>

                    <para>I come now to the attitude of honorable senators from Tasmania. In their opinion, of course, Queensland industries get all the protection that they seek. It appears to me that Tasmanian senators have very short memories. The last Government, which was castigated hy <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant,</inline> saved &gt;the hop industry of Tasmania, 'by reducing the output and by  entering into ian arrangement with the manufacturers of Guinness' stout which enabled that stout to be imported and to compete with stout manufactured in Victoria and South Australia. Was any complaint made when that assistance was granted ? Then, again, although Australia was in rather sore straits financially, the Scullin Government saved the berrygrowers of Tasmania, by distributing among them the sum of £5,000. The Queensland sugar producer paid his portion of that amount. Yet Queensland is now told that its industries should be placed in such a state of efficiency that they should not need any protection from the Commonwealth. I point out that </para>

                            <para>- Who but the Scullin Government presented the child to Parliament? I did not notice any anxiety on the part of Western Australian senators to disclaim relationship with that child. They unanimously invited us to become its foster parents. The very government which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> helped to put into power disowned the child «nd said "We will not kill it, but will put it in an orphanage." It probably believes that at the age of ten years it will die in the orphanage. The point that I want honorable senators to realize is, that the attitude of the Scullin Government towards the sugar industry of Queensland is condemned by those who praised the Government for its attitude towards other measures. I recall wheat bounties that were introduced. I admit that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> made a mistake when he voted against the proposal of the Scullin Government to pay a wheat bounty of 4s. a bushel. </para>

But when I used the expression "consistent" I did so in the sense in which I understand the Standing Orders compel me to use it in this debate. Any honorable senator who believes in the principle of paying a wheat bounty cannot deny the claims of the sugar-growers to some form of assistance. 1 fail to see how we can grant assistance to those engaged in the wheat and other industries unless we maintain our production. </para>

                            <para>- Perhaps it would. We told the people that if a Labour Government were returned to power, we would eventually solve the sugar problem. But; the people of Australia placed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyons</inline> in power, and the Government which he formed sent one of its Ministers to Queensland to confer with the parties interested in the production of sugar. As a result this agreement was adopted. Personally, I should prefer the old agreement to remain iu operation ; but I am very anxious that nothing shall be done to interfere with the production of sugar in Queensland by white labour. It is easy to make inconsistent statements as to the necessity for opening up fresh fields in northern Queensland and, at the same time, to suggest that the embargo on importation should be removed. It is also easy to speak about the importation of Javanese sugar and to say that we should be prepared to treat the products of coloured races on 'a fair basis. The real point is that there are approximately 30j000 persons directly associated with the Queensland industry. If 30,000 more persons were placed on the dole, we should not have enough money to pay the £2,000,000 or more which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> suggests should be 0 appropriated for paying a bounty on wheat. We have to keep our men employed and the present is not an opportune time to tinker with the industries that are firmly established. Even if we felt that a change was necessary, we should not make any alteration at this critical period. If, as we have been told, wo are in mid-air, we should not meddle with the engine of the aeroplane. We should alight safely and then get to work to clear away some of the anomalies, the responsibility for which rests on this Government, and possibly on previous Governments. I trust that the second reading of the bill will be carried and that the speeches will be brief. I think that we know sufficient about sugar to enable us to dispose of the bill expeditiously, and thereby give the sugar producers some assurance for the future. </para>

                        <para>.- I regret very much the attitude adopted by certain honorable senators towards those who clare to criticize the sugar agreement. When I am assailed, as I have been during this debate, with being opposed to the Queensland sugar industry, I naturally resent it. I am not opposed to the industry. There is no undertaking in Australia with which I have more sympathy than the Queensland sugar industry; but, if I am of the opinion that an industry is not conducted on sound lines, surely I am entitled to criticize it ! I have taken a keen interest in the sugar industry since 1903, when I first visited the Queensland sugar-fields. Since then I have always kept in touch with its development, and I know probably as much about it as any one who is not a resident of Queensland. I have visited that State dozens of times since I made my first visit. One of the most important points we have to consider, and which should have been considered long ago, is that this industry has grown beyond all reasonable bounds. It is costing us too much to maintain it. </para>

                            <para>- I shall show the honorable senator that it is not. Last year an important committee made an exhaustive examination into the industry, and made certain recommendations to the Government. According to the report of that committee, the percentage of exports to the total production has been as follow: - </para>

                    </continue>
                    <para class="block">
                        <graphic href="137332193211301_53_2.jpg" />
                    </para>
                    <para class="block">For the years 1925-28 inclusive, the production costs were £20 10s. a ton. The average price realized for sugar exported was £11 5s. a ton, leaving a net loss of £9 5s. a ton on the total exported.' This represented the enormous loss of £6,058,990 for the four years, which had to be made up by the consumers of sugar in Australia. In 1.930, the quantity of sugar exported was 219,41S tons, the total loss on which was £2,029,616 for that year. That was the heaviest loss that has been sustained in any one year as a result of exports. In 1931, it was estimated that the cost of production would be reduced to £18 12s. 9d., as against £20 10s., or £1 17s. less than for the years 1925-28. It was estimated that, on the 45 per cent, of production to be exported, only £S a ton would be realized, thus incurring a loss of approximately £2,500,000 for the year. How long is this to continue? Is this to be a perpetual burden upon the people of Australia? Surely there is a means to remove this incubus eventually. Any sane individual conducting a commercial undertaking would avoid producing at a loss for an indefinite period. He would have to do so if he desired to remain solvent. The difference between an individual or a company and the Sugar Producers Association is that the Government is standing behind _ the association, and saying that that loss, whatever it may be, can be made up by the price charged to Australian consumers. Notwithstanding the fact that suggestions were made years ago by persons who had carefully studied the subject, no attempt has been made to give effect to the proposals then submitted. In 1917-18 there were 114,295 productive acres of sugar lands in Queensland. In 1.921-22 the area had increased to 128,356 acres'. In 1925-26 there was a further increase to 198,363 acres, and in 1927-28 the area was 212,304" acres. The latest figures that I can quote are for 1929-30, when the productive acreage had increased to 222,847, or an increase of almost 100 per cent., compared with 1917-18. Years ago those particularly interested in keeping the industry financially prosperous could., without imposing undue, burdens on the people of Australia, have formulated <inline font-style="italic">some</inline> scheme by which the continued increase in the area under production could have been avoided. I do not suggest that such a scheme could be brought into full operation at once. It would have to be spread over a period of years in order to reduce to a minimum the hardships and dislocation which may result. lt is' imperative that such a scheme be established in order that this unnecessary burden may be removed within a reasonable period. </para>

                            <para>- There is no justification for continuing to ignore warnings. I could turn up <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and prove that years ago men who were just as keenly interested in Australia as are honorable senators opposite made similar suggestions; but at the time they were not thought worthy of consideration, although, eventually, they will have to be taken into account, because this kind of thing cannot continue. I know the difficulties which the sugar industry has had to meet, and no one has appreciated more than I have the way in which those difficulties have been tackled. No one was more delighted than I that the industry was established on a sound footing; but, unfortunately, it did not stop there. Instead, it expanded until losses amounting to £6,000,000 were incurred in four years through overproduction, an amount which the consumers had to make up. The continuation of that policy cannot be justified. T shall avail myself of every opportunity to press that point home, because I regard it as of paramount importance. </para>

                            <para>- According to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll,</inline> it is anticipated that 150,000 tons of sugar will be exported this year. In that case, the loss, based on the average loss for several years, will be about £1,500,000. A burden of this magnitude may be borne with more or less equanimity for a time, but not indefinitely. I advise the people of Queensland to confer with those connected with the Sugar-Growers' Association with a view to the preparation of a well-thought-out scheme for reducing gradually the area under sugar cane. </para>

                            <para>- I admit that the sugar industry of Queensland is well managed. We have heard of the heavy losses which this agreement will mean to those engaged in the sugar industry. I had thought that the growers of sugar, as well as the mill-owners and refiners, would necessarily reap smaller profits because of a reduction of £d. per lb. in the price of sugar, and that they would bear an equal proportion of the loss; but I was surprised to find that shares in the Millaquin company, instead of falling, have risen materially since the agreement was entered into. Does that mean that the cane-growers are to bear all the burden ? Are not the mill-owners and the refining companies to bear their share of it? </para>

                            <para>- Coming now to the bill itself, I shall probably support the second reading, first because it will reduce the price of sugar to consumers throughout Australia. Even -Jd. a lb. means something to them, although I should like to see a greater reduction. I have no desire to interfere with this small measure of relief being given to the users of sugar throughout Australia. There is a general feeling among the people of Australia other than those in Queensland in favour of a reduction of the price of sugar. Many anticipated a reduction of more than £d. per lb., and I hope that this small reduction is only the beginning of further' reductions until the price of sugar becomes more reasonable. Another section of the community in whom I have great interest, is that section which produces 65 per cent, of the berry fruits and other small fruits of Australia. These people are located in Tasmania. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> smiles, and, therefore, I remind him that this important section of the people of Australia is worthy of some assistance, because without them the people on the mainland would be deprived of the only wholesale production of small fruit of good quality grown in Australia. </para>

                        <para>Unfortunately, the public and the growers do not quite understand just what this organization means to them. A bounty of £10 per ton was granted for the export of berry pulps overseas. This permitted at least 500 to 700 tons to be exported from Australia, and so reduced the quantity in Australia that the minimum price fixed by the Sugar Concession Committee was exceeded, to the benefit of the growers. This also insured that no old stocks will 1ms on hand at the commencement of the next fruit season. The fixing of the minimum price to growers is the best step that has ever been taken to protect the industry, as if no minimum price were fixed, purchasers would endeavour to get fruit at the lowest price possible to prevent competition against them. It must be understood that jam manufacturers and other manufacturers cannot get the rebate on their sugar .unless they produce a declaration or evidence that the growers received the minimum price for the fruit. </para>

                    <para class="block">I am glad to say that the' small fruit growers of Tasmania will get a higher price for their product this year than they have received for many years. That happy result has been made possible by the hearty co-operation between the manufacturing interests in Tasmania and the Fruit Industry Sugar Concession Committee, and the small berry-growers of Tasmania are this year looking forward with confidence to better prices than they have received for many years. I hope that what I have said will convince those honorable senators who have been rather free in their criticism of Tasmanian members, that we have approached the discussion of this sub1ject in a spirit of absolute friendliness to Queensland sugar-growers, and that, our one desire is to see the industry placed upon a sound and satisfactory oasis. </para>

                        <para>. - The question before the Senate appears to be whether or. not we shall ratify the agreement contained in this bill, or whether the industry will be carried on under the old agreement. If that agreement had not been in existence, there would have been very little doubt about my attitude to the bill. This agreement contains some very objectionable provisions, but they are to be found also in the old agreement, so that, if .by any chance the Senate rejected this bill, the old agreement would operate, and it provides that the retail price of sugar for the next two years shall be 4£d. 'per lb. I am not clear as to the meaning of the provision relating to the review of the agreement; it may mean anything or nothing. Under this proposal, the retail price of sugar is fixed at 4d. per lb. until August, 1936. It is somewhat difficult to say which is the better proposal, but probably the people pf Australia will appreciate the immediate reduction of -Jd. per lb. and decide that this is the better scheme. No one will deny that for many years the price of sugar in Australia has been too high. Many meetings of protest have been held in the southern -States. Economists, to whom this subject has been referred on many occasions, agree that the sugar agreement costs the consuming public of Australia anything between £6,000,000 and £7,000,000 a year. They also admit that at 4d. per lb., the cost to Australia will still be very high. I have always been opposed to the sugar embargo. This is the first time that Parliament has had an opportunity to consider that proposal, and it is my intention to vote against it. A reasonably protective duty should be an ample safeguard for the industry against the importation of sugar produced by low-grade labour. As has been pointed out by other honorable senators, the whole trouble seems to be due to the fact that Queensland is producing too much sugar. Growers have to sell, overseas 40 per cent, of their production at a tremendous loss. If that loss could be averted by limiting production, as is done in other primary industries, it would not be necessary to charge the people of Australia such a high price for their sugar. Some honorable senators have instanced the hop industry. That may be cited as a case in point. Two or three years ago, Australia was using about 12,000 bales of hops. To-day, our requirements are met by between 6,000 and 7,000 bales. Like the sugar industry, the hop industry in Tasmania is highly efficient, and when difficulties due to over-production became pronounced, the growers were forced to dig up considerable areas under cultivation for hops. I do not suggest that Queensland growers should follow that example and dig up any of their best sugar lands, but it is well known that certain areas are, not producing sugar on a competitive basis, and it is believed that these could be diverted to other forms of production. Although I have every sympathy with the sugar-growers of Queensland., I believe they should make their just contribution, equally with other industries, towards the rehabilitation of Australia. </para>

Under the Premiers plan, the Federal and State Governments aimed at a reduction of221/2 per cent. in all adjustable expenditure. Accordingly, Public Service salaries were reduced by from 221/2 per cent. upwards, bondholders made a similar contribution, and, as we have good reason to know, all our primary industries, with the exception of sugar have, for some years, been feeling the effect of depressed prices. Although the figures in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> may not be absolutely accurate, they fairly indicate the trend of prices for Australian primary commodities. Wool prices to-day are 50 per cent. below those ruling four years ago. </para>

                            <para>- The wheat industry has certainly received some assistance in the form of a bounty, but prices are still from 30 per cent. to 40 per cent. lower to-day than they were four years ago. According to a statement made the other day by the  chairman  of the Graziers Association, the price of fat lambs, which is an important industry in Australia, is 65 per cent. below the rate ruling four years ago. Butter is down anything from 45 per cent. to 50 per cent. It is true that our dairymen are getting some relief under the Paterson scheme, but present-day prices are the lowest recorded for many years, and if the employees in the dairying industry were paid anything like the rates ruling in the sugar industry it would not be possible to produce butter in Australia at a cost of less than 3s. per lb. Potatoes this year are unpayable, prices being down' anything from 50 per cent. to 60 per cent. compared with the rates ruling four years ago. Timber also has declined in value by from 25 per cent. to 30 per cent. Tin is down 35 per cent. and copper 50 per cent. Although the people engaged in all these industries are suffering severely from the effects of the depression, they have to make their contribution towards the Queensland sugar industry which, under this new agreement, is making a price concession of only 11 per cent. </para>

                        come now to the agreement itself. In my opinion it is not so valuable as some honorable senators would have us believe it is. I admit that, for the time being, the small fruits industry is getting a bounty which will absorb between £20,000 and £30,000, and enable growers to tide over present bad times; but if honorable senators will study the bill they will find that the rebate on sugar to be given to the manufacturers of jam and processors of fruit is reduced from £6 5s. Id. to £2 4s. per ton. I believe a contribution from some other fund will increase this rebate to £3 4s. per ton. This additional assistance very properly carries with it, first, the obligation to purchase the growers5 fruit at fair jiri ces, to be determined by the concessions committee. The actual rebate, however, is brought down to £2 4s. per ton, and there is a distinct danger that fruit processors and small jam manufacturers may decide to sacrifice the rebate altogether, and by buying their sugar in the open market at 4d. per lb., be able to fix their own prices for fruit purchased from the small growers, who may be forced to accept ruinous rates. I am sure that the rebate of £6 5s. per ton, which was high enough to make the fruit processors value it, was the safer proposal and more in the interests of the small growers. Moreover, to enjoy the rebate, the sugar-growers and the small fruit-growers are, under this agreement, required to pay wages to be fixed by the Arbitration Court. Hitherto industrial award conditions have  not been applied to land industries. I do not believe in the Arbitration Court or any of its works. It has never yet given a man a clay's work; on the contrary, it has put between 400,000 and 500,000 men out of work in this country. For this reason I regret that Arbitration Court awards are to be applied to those of our small land industries that seek to benefit from this bill.

                    <para>Another matter mentioned by my friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant,</inline> was the desirability of establishing a sugar depot in Hobart. For many years we have been agitating for such a depot, because we are wholly dependent upon the sea carriage of our products and because what has happened so often in the past, inter- ferenco with our shipping services, may again result in a shortage of sugar. Whenever that happens merchants in Hobart and elsewhere are obliged to apply to other merchants for supplies to tide them over a temporary shortage. Within the last few days, we Tasmanian members have received telegrams from about twenty organizations asking us to do what we can in the direction of having a depot established in Hobart. </para>

Because of the high price of the Australian article, the people of Australia have to pay for sugar hundreds of thousands per annum more than is justified. The reduction of ^d. per lb. provided for under the agreement is long overdue and will be welcomed ; but I have always opposed the sugar embargo, and I shall exercise my right in committee to vote against it, and against any other objectionable clauses in the bill. </para>

                        <para>. - I congratulate Queensland senators on the eloquence with which they have presented the case on behalf of the great sugar industry. We all agree, no doubt, that it is a great industry, and but for its successful development, the north-east coast of Queensland, one of the richest belts of country in the world, would not have been so profitably occupied. The success of this industry is desirable from both a production and a defence point of view. Whatever some honorable senators opposite may accuse us of at election time, we on this side, all believe in the White Australia policy. But efficient as this industry undoubtedly is in all its ramifications, the questions we have to: ask ourselves to-day are: What is it costing the people of Australia, and is the cost worth while? Personally, I think that it is. Honorable senators who have advocated this agreement have pointed out that there are 8,000 sugar-growers in Queensland; but according to the Auditor-General's report, in order to keep them profitably employed  on the Queensland coast, and in a small portion of New South Wales, the consumers of sugar in Australia are penalized to the extent of £7,000,000 a year. </para>

If the 89,000 wool-growers and the 63,000 wheat-growers in Australia were granted similar assistance to that given by the people of Australia to the wealthy and sheltered sugar industry, what would be said? There has been much talk this afternoon about the large amount of capital employed in the sugar industry, the number of men engaged, and the quantity of fencing wire used. I do not believe the yarn that was told about strawberries and tomatoes, nor what was said about the possibility of fattening baby beef on land now used in southern Queensland for the production of sugar. Where would one get the young animals, and how would one get them there? The quantity of fencing wire required for the sugar industry would probably be less than that required on a single sheep station such as Alexandria, which comprises 10,000 square miles on the eastern portion of the Barkly Tableland. The quantity of fencing wire required by the sugar industry is infinitesimal. </para>

                            <para>- It is most amusing to note the attitude to this bill of such honorable senators as the gentleman who has just interjected. He and his friends from Queensland are found linked arm in arm with that great capitalistic concern, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and both agree on the subject of piece-work, which is usually regarded as anathema to Labour. This is one of the most unholy alliances ever witnessed in the Senate. The inconsistency of it is quite Gilbertian. We find honorable senators opposite who have always been opposed even to Britishers entering -Australia under the migra tion scheme now embracing Italians as brothers. Italians who have not become naturalized Australians are found working and owning sugar land in Queensland! I am wondering if this brotherly love has resulted from the huge consumption of South Australian wines, which an' honorable senator told us was one of the features of the sugar industry on the thirsty north-east coast. </para>

                    <para>As a Victorian, I find myself, with the great majority of the people whom I help to represent in this Parliament, against the agreement. They have always complained of the tremendous tax placed upon them through having to pay an artificial price for sugar. But I am in great difficulty in regard to the agreement, because the Minister has definitely said that if it is not ratified, obnoxious as it is to the people of Victoria and to me, the people will be compelled to go on paying the exorbitant price of 4£d. per lb. Therefore, I am forced to choose the lesser of two evils. This agreement provides for a reduction of the price by <inline font-style="italic">id.</inline> per lb.; but it also legalizes a total embargo against the importation of sugar for four years. To that I object, and in committee I shall vote against it. I have never supported an embargo on anything; but, on this occasion, I am forced, as I have said, by the pronouncement of the Minister, to support a bill, which while it provides for a slight reduction of price, also provides for an embargo. I do not like spoonfed industries; but all secondary industries in this country have been spoonfed, and some of the primary industries are to be similarly treated. I presume that honorable senators will be consistent. That is all that I ask of my Queensland friends. If they expect to receive this huge sum of money for the maintenance of the great sugar industry, I ask them to extend the same treatment to other and far more important industries such as the wheat and the wool industries. </para>

If the 8,000 sugar-growers are to receive a concession amounting to between £4,000,000 and £5,000,000 a year, the 89,000 wool-growers, if similarly treated, would be given a bounty of £55,000,000, and equality of treatment to the 63,000 wheat-growers, who are quite as worthy of assistance as are the sugar-growers, and who are in far more necessitous circumstances than those men and the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, would make it necessary to find £40,000,000 a year. We shall have an opportunity before long of testing the sincerity of honorable senators in regard to the wheat industry. It is very doubtful whether they will grant it £4,000,000, let alone £40,000,000 a year. </para>

If we were considering a product of white labour, particularly British white, labour, ' 1 should not express myself so forcibly; but it is well known that the sugar which would be imported were the embargo to be abolished would come from Java, a country that produces about 3,000,000 tons annually, and could easily destroy our industry. Its people live under a different flag from ours, and I dare say are exploited by the Dutch. Such a suggestion is even worse than the proposal to admit Fijian bananas into </para>

                    <para class="block">Australia, because Java is not under the British flag and the wages and conditions are such that if Ave submitted to them we  should  be degraded to the living standard of coolies. The literature that has been circulated among honorable senators contains a little about every phase of sugar. One document that ha/ been sent to me makes the statement that sugar cane was discovered first in India by the soldiers of Alexander the Great, in 337 B.C. If the matter were traced further back, even to the beginning of time, a number of other discoveries might bc made concerning it. During the last twenty years, many senators from other States have visited Queensland and made discoveries. One of these was discussed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne,</inline> when he suggested that Australia is growing too much sugar, and that, because of over-production, loss is being occasioned. A senator from "Western Australia, on the other hand, complains that, in order to prevent over-production, the Queensland Government has limited the right to the use of land that is suitable for the growing of cane. He discovered the very interesting fact that the restriction on the use of land for sugar-growing should be removed, and that Queensland should go full-steam ahead in the development of every inch of sugar land that the State possesses. Other discoveries also have been made by visitors to Queensland. I am reminded of the discovery of a very highly respected and conservative New South "Wales statesman, that sugar grew on sugar bushes. He was subsequently disillusioned. Another visitor on one occasion spoke of the planting of ratoons. </para>
                    <para>I compliment Senators Greene and McLachlan on the very fair case that they have put to the Senate from the Australian viewpoint. Other honorable senators also have supplied most interesting information. I am not a bitter partisan of the sugar industry, nor a straightout supporter of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. Although I have criticized that company in this Senate, I  am not one-eyed. Everybody who wishes to promote the interests of the sugar industry must admit that in its management and refining the company has -raised its operations to a very high pitch. So long back as 1912, a commission was appointed to inquire into the sugar industry, and upon it was a Labour member in the person of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Albert</inline> Hinchcliff. Greatly to the surprise of some good Labour supporters, that gentleman reported against any withdrawal of control from the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, his investigations having convinced him that the company had reduced the cost of refining to the lowest possible point. In the propaganda that has been circulated, I find that the remuneration to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company for refining worked out in 1932 at .082. In 1915, the figure was .083. Consequently, the company has not increased its charges on the sugar industry. If it is a monopolistic company, and has been imposing an enormous exaction on the consumers and the manufacturers of jams and confectionery, surely the Government' of this country, which, since 1916, with the exception of two years, has been in the hands of our honorable friends opposite, should have dealt with the matter instead of allowing it to continue until we had reached the stage of discussing an agreement which barely gives justice to the sugar-growers. If any honorable senator opposite feels aggrieved, he can endeavour to induce the Government to make a careful investigation, so as to obtain an exact statement of the position in regard to the profits of the company, and, if necessary, to introduce legislation to deal with the matter, as was done in Queensland in certain cases. As a Labour representative, I would not oppose such action. My economic doctrine is, that those who have greater gifts than others for management and superintendence should be suitably remunerated, and that those who take risks in- capitalistic enterprises are entitled to a better reward than others. But we certainly should prevent the making of anything like extortionate profits, which are damning both to the man who receives them and to those from whom they are taken. The Labour party in Queensland is not attempting to form an unholy alliance with' capitalism. "We know that capitalism must exist, and that it will continue until we arrive* at a higher "state of society. But we shall certainly not allow our capitalistic enterprises^ be kicked to pieces, or unfairly criticized, by our friends opposite, who make no comment on their own capitalistic concerns, some of which are making twice as much and are as monopolistic as any concern in Queensland. Prior to the general elections held in 1931 consideration was given to the fact that Queensland was becoming more and more a primary-producing State, and that the opportunity for Labour representatives to be returned to the State Parliament seemed somewhat remote. I am surprised at the indifference displayed by certain honorable senators opposite who claim to be the representatives of primary producers towards a great primary industry in that State. One honorable senator representing Western Australia, who is a member of the Country party, seems to delight in attacking the sugar industry, but he should remember that the State which he represents, and also the State of Queensland, depend largely upon primary production, and not upon secondary industries. When I considered the possibility of Labour being represented in the Senate, I found that the primary producers of Queensland had increased during recent years by 6,000, which .meant an increase in the anti-Labour vote. Moreover, mining had declined to a large extent, and that was responsible for a reduction of the Labour vote. In the matter of secondary production, Queensland has remained stationary for the last seven years. I take this opportunity to place in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> some interesting figures with respect- to the number of hands employed in secondary industries in the various States. They are taken from the official statistics, and are therefore authentic. For the financial' 'year 1928-29, which is the latest for which figures are available, the number of hands employed in secondary industries in the  various  States was as follow: - </para>
                    <para class="block">
                        <graphic href="137332193211301_62_3.jpg" />
                    </para>
                    <para class="block">Honorable senators will' doubtless say' that, as the population in New South </para>
                    <para class="block">Wales and Victoria is much larger than in any of the other States, the number of factory hands in those States should also be larger. The number is larger by 137,000. But an analysis of the figures shows that on a proportionate basis New ^ South Wales has 65,000 more factory employees than she should have compared with Queensland; Victoria, which is also a manufacturing State, with a smaller population than New South Wales, has 60,000 more ; and South Australia, which is next in importance in the matter of manufactures, has 15,000 more. Western Australia is on the same basis as Queensland. Even Tasmania has 7,000 more than Queensland or Western Australia. On a pro rata basis the total for the whole of Australia is 147,000 more than Queensland. It will be seen from these figures that those engaged in secondary industries in the other States are doing secondary production work for the Queensland people. If the total number of employees engaged in secondary production were divided on the basis of Queensland having oneseventh of the population of the Commonwealth, that State should have 21,000 more factory employees than it has to-day. As that number of operatives is not engaged in. secondary production in Queensland, the other States are evidently doing its work and,  therefore,  the northern State -  should  receive a <inline font-style="italic">quid pro quo.</inline> Surely it is not unreasonable to ask the. other States to assist Queensland in protecting what is a God-given right to produce tropical commodities. There is a good deal of tropical territory in the northern portion of Western Australia, but unfortunately the land in that locality is comparatively poor and is, therefore, used principally for grazing cattle. That is unfortunate for Western Australia, but Queensland, also, has disadvantages, particularly as the temperatures in the northern parts are exceedingly high for the greater portion of the year, which necessarily reduces the producing capacity of the people. Moreover, Queensland does not receive any great benefit from the tourist traffic from other States, which considerably increases the revenue of some of the other States. The Queensland people who are able to travel visit New </para>
                    <para class="block">South Wales, and also Victoria, and the money which they spend is of benefit to the States which they visit. That should be taken into consideration when considering the comparatively small benefits which Queensland enjoys in other respects. </para>
                    <para>In view of the extent to which primary production is increasing in Queensland, and the fact that manufacturing is almost stationary, I thought -that it would be fruitless for me to contest the last Senate election. I decided, however, to enter the contest, because I thought that I might have a chance of success. Some ten years ago, when the Commonwealth Parliament was meeting .in Melbourne, and when it was suggested that the embargo should bc removed, I participated in the debate. A portion of my speech is recorded as follows: - </para>

                        <para>While the cost of living in Melbourne is practically double what it was in pre-war days, we cannot reasonably expect the retail price of sugar to be 3d. per lb., as it was some years ago. Having given a little study to the reasons which have necessitated the great increase in prices throughout the world, I have come to thu conclusion that . . . when economic stabilization is readied, prices and wages will be probably 50 per cent, higher than before the war. High prices are sure to remain when we consider that the war cost the world £40,000,000,000, and that the interest on that expenditure has to be met. Sugar is never likely to be at the pre-war retail rate of 3d. per lb. </para>

                        B. Hayes suggested that the sugar industry, in common with many others, should submit to a reduction of 22£ per cent., in accordance with the Premiers plan; but the Vice-President of the Executive Council
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLachlan)</inline>
                        showed that the industry has submitted to so many reductions, and has made so many concessions, that it is practically on the same basis as other similar undertakings. - The pre-war price of sugar was 3d.  per lb.; it was eventually increased to 6d., and in 1923 reduced to 4£d. The present proposal is to bring about a further reduction, and, in view of all the circumstances, it is unfair to say that the industry has submitted to a reduction of only 11 per cent. Reference has already been made to the great benefit which the sugar industry was to Australia during the war period, when sugar was selling at ls. 6d. per lb. in England, as against 6d. in Australia. That benefit has been variously estimated at a sum ranging from £10,000,000 to £30,000,000. A former Minister for Trade and Customs said that it was approximately £16,000,000 ; but I do not think it would be incorrect to set it down as £20,000,000. What would be the position in the event of another war? If the sugar industry were not adequately protected, Australia would have to depend upon supplies from other countries, which might not be readily obtainable, and for which the consumers would have to pay excessive prices. One honorable senator suggested that British preferences represent £1,000,000; but I understand that the average is £650,000 and this year it will be under . that amount. If the embargo is removed, large quantities of land would go out of cultivation, and it would be impossible profitably .to use sugar land for any other purpose. We have also to remember that rum . is manufactured in Queensland, and that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company is also producing that beverage in Sydney. The production of. power alcohol mixed with Shell oil, and marketed under the trade' name of "  Shellkol,"  is also being undertaken in Queensland. Power alcohol is said to have many advantages over the pure spirit, and experts have expressed the belief that it will be possible to develop the power alcohol industry and thus reduce Australia's bill for imported oil. Australia receives £2,000,000 per annum for the sugar it sells overseas, and that .amount goes towards meeting our national indebtedness. I shall not speak of the value of the treacle and syrup which Australia would have to import if it were mot for the sugar industry, except to remind honorable senators that in. the outback parts of Australia, golden syrup - more commonly known as " cockies' delight " - is found most useful. If we lost the sugar industry, we should have to send good Australian money out of this country to buy these and other things.
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene</inline>
                        said that the sugar industry ran a risk if it did not take the advice of the Government. The frequent reductions of the price of sugar have caused dismay in Queensland because growers there have not known where the reductions would stop. Some honorable senators advocate freetrade, while others suggest a duty of only £6 a ton on sugar. In either case, the Australian sugar industry would bc ruined. As I have already stated there have been considerable reductions of the price of sugar. If we reduce wages and prices still further, the burden on our people will be so heavy that the country will not be able to 'bear it. During the war, the workers received about £5 a week. If now their wages are reduced to £2 a week, and the prices of our export commodities fall, our interest burden will be relatively heavier, and Australia will become bankrupt. In view of our enormous war debt, it would not be safe for Australia to reduce wages and prices more than 50 per cent, below war time rates. I submit that 4£d. per lb. is about as low a price for sugar, as the industry can stand. Compared with the pre-war price of 3d. per lb. it is about equal to the general increased price level of commodities and services. For instance, a hair-cut which in pre-war days costs 6d. now costs ls. 6d. in Canberra. Well-established newspapers, such as the

                        which, in the days 'before the war cost Id., went up to 2d., and are now  1½d.  Leading newspapers of Brisbane still cost 2d. each. Many  similar  instances could be given. I say now what I said in 1922, that it is only fair that the sugar industry should be given' a full measure of protection. During this debate, Statements have been made in this chamber which indicate that the fears of the people of Queensland in relation to the sugar industry have not been without foundation. The growers of sugar recognized the need for greater stability in the industry, and consequently they consented to a compromise which was in reality the repudiation of an agreement solemnly entered into.

All Queensland senators, irrespective of party, support the agreement and the embargo. They realize that without an embargo the way will be open for tha introduction into Australia of the products of sweated labour countries to com- ' pete with the product of white labour in this, country. If that were permitted the standard of the people of Australia would be forced down to the level of the black races, where men receive about ls. and women and children a few pence a day for their services. . </para>

                        referred to the prosperity of certain towns in the sugar-growing districts of Queensland. If any one were to ask me whether Queensland was prospering, I would reply that, in view of the times, the State enjoyed a fair measure of prosperity. That is not to say that conditions in Queensland to-day are what they were in the years when prosperity was at its peak. I, personally, had not only suffered a reduction of salary, but at the time that I entered this chamber I had, under the operation of the Premiers plan, lost a considerable portion of my savings. Nevertheless, Queensland is a good place in which to live. It is a. :*11ate with wonderful natural resources. Even if deprived of a market for its tropical products, Queensland would still have its wool, butter and cattle. Queensland is a primary producing State, which buys most of its manufactured goods from Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide.
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings</inline>
                        will agree with me that Queensland, is not so prosperous as it was in 1926-29. The honorable senator's remarks have been challenged, and he has been charged with having painted a bright picture of conditions in Queensland. On that ground it has been contended that the sugar industry can stand the reductions proposed. That is an illogical argument.

                            <para>- That makes no difference to my argument. I remember a convention carrying a motion dealing with income tax only to rescind it a little later when the Premier of the State came in hurriedly and said that it would mean a loss of 25 per cent. of the State's revenue from that source. About ten years ago I was invited to address a meeting in the Bijou Theatre, Melbourne, on the sugar industry, and because of the antagonism which, I understand, had been aroused in the southern States as a result of misstatements concerning the industry; I was somewhat concerned as to what might happen to me if I attempted to defend the sugar industry from the attacks which had been made upon it, especially as the retail price then was 6d. per lb. But having accepted the invitation of the Victorian Australian Labour Party, I did my best. I put the case as straightforwardly as possible, and to myintense satisfaction there was not a singleinterjection from an audience of nearly 2,000 persons. I was convinced from my experience at that meeting, that, after all, the great bulk of the consumers in the southern States were not much concerned about the price of sugar. I feel sure now they will not worry much about the present proposal. If, however, theagreement affected the price of meat or bread, I have no doubt that the people generally would be greatlyconcerned because of the much bigger amounts involved. </para>

Our dairymen are benefiting to the extent of between £4,000,000 and £6,000,000 and probably we shall this year assist the wheat industry to the extent of £4,000,000. The people of Queensland will cheerfully accept their portion of that burden. </para>

                        told us this afternoon that he intended to support the agreement, but would vote against the embargo. I am wondering what will happen to the agreement if the embargo is rejected. I was under the impression that, like the Ottawa trade agreement, this bill containing the sugar agreement had to be accepted in its entirety. I, therefore, regret that, at this late hour, there are suggestions of opposition to the embargo, because sugar is selling at only1d. per lb. over pre-war prices although the cost of living is now 50 per cent. higher. I hope that

                        will not persist in his opposition to the embargo. May I remind him that for many years there was an embargo against correspondence being carried through the post to the institution known as Tattersall's Consultation in Hobart. Personally I did not believe in that prohibition, and I was in good company, as thousands of people in all States mades regular contributions to the Tasmanian revenue, which must have benefited to the extent of many millions of pounds. The Prime Minister

                        himself a good Tasmanian, was responsible for having that embargo lifted.

                    <para>Oneof our Tasmanian friends- commented, this afternoon, on the fact that although the agreement contains provisions with regard to wages and conditions of labour in the sugar industry, nothing is said about the growers. For their information I may state that the Cane Prices Board, which has been operating for many years, fixes the price to be paid for sugar cane, with a result that the growers receive fair treatment from the mills. </para>

                    <para>I support the bill, not because it represents an act of justice to the Queensland growers, but for fear that, if it is not accepted, something worse may happen to them. The idea that all representatives in this chamber from Queensland are a happy family when proposals affecting the sugar industry are under discussion is not quite correct. I have on other occasions condemned the Colonial Sugar Refining Company for certain actions, and, doubtless, I shall do so in the future, but I believe that all criticisms directed againstthat company should bc absolutely fair. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company is no more a monopolistic concern than are many other industrial activities in the southern States. Queensland growers have benefited to the extent of approximately £2,000,000 as the direct result of the operation of the Sugar Cane Prices Act passed by the State Government in 1915. </para>
                    <para>One or two mis-statements were made by some honorable senators this afternoon. I refer particularly to exaggerated reports about the number of Italians engaged in or employed by the industry.  As one who has been studying and writing about the sugar industry for the last twenty years, I know that in certain districts like Ingham and Innisfail, the proportion of Italians who, after all are good Europeans, is large.  In some  districts where the farms are entirely -in the hands of Italians, the cane-cutting gangs are composed practically- of Italian labourers; but viewing the industry as a whole, the percentage of Italians engaged in it is not so large as some honorable senators would have us believe it is, and the intention is to work back to a percentage of at least from 80 to 85 per cent, of British workers, in the canefields. </para>
                    <para>If this agreement is not adopted the industry will, as the Assistant Treasurer said, in moving the second reading, be thrown to the wolves. It will be forced to continue under the old agreement, with all the possibilities for trouble and disturbance throughout Australia. The sugar industry is of national importance, and its continuance on the present scale is essential in the interests of the southern States. It would not be wide of the truth to say that in tourist traffic and in general trade advantages they get from £5,000,000 to £10,000,000 a year from Queensland. I hope that the bill will be carried. </para>

                        <para>ne of the reasons why I feel compelled to take up the attitude that I do adopt with regard to the bill. It is rather curious that such a sweet subject as sugar should lead to so much acridity in debate. I see no reason for it, and I hope that I shall get through what I have to say without' exciting hostile interjections, even from those with whom I disagree. One of the peculiarities of the debate so far is the rather remarkable alinement of parties that it has revealed, as has ,-,-been mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie.</inline> '"We find, for instance, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings</inline> side by side with senators who sit 'behind the Government as supporters of the bill, and we have Senators Daly and Dunn <inline font-style="italic">vis-a-vis</inline> with Senators Poll and Crawford in their support of the measure. When one sees that remarkable combination, one is tempted to ask, especially when one notes the absolute unanimity of senators from Queensland, whether Queensland is conscious of the fact that she is getting out of this agreement rather a good thing. We have been told almost <inline font-style="italic">ad nauseam</inline> of the insidious propaganda from the southern States and of the tirades of abuse with which the great industry has been overwhelmed. It has been suggested, and stated, indeed, openly, again and again,, that there is some hostility to the sugar industry of Queensland. That assertion has been repel1 ed by many honorable senators who have spoken. I merely join with them and say that we have no dislike, jealousy, or ill feeling whatever towards the great sugar industry of Queensland. But so far as propaganda is concerned, I am astonished that anybody could have accused those who are opposed to the concessions which Queensland has been granted, with having flooded the country with propaganda, when the fact is of course, that, whenever the sugar question comes up, one cannot open one of the leading newspapers of Australia without finding large sections of even the newscolumns containing very extensive advertisements, requiring not only artists to create them but also vast sums of money to pay for them. That propaganda has now had the very opposite effect to what was intended, because it has naturally excited the inquiry: "Where is all this money coming from? If an industry can afford to spend all this money in propaganda, it must really have something that is worth holding on to ". </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that " Comrade " Clapp pays for any of this, nor does he take part in the compilation of the advertisements. Another fallacious line of argument adopted, in particular by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collingsin</inline> his very exhaustive speech, is that of mentioning the tremendous amount of money that is directly and indirectly involved in this industry. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings</inline> referred to the wines and dried fruits of South Australia consumed by those engaged in the industry; to the apples and potatoes purchased from Tasmania; to the boots, clothing, and hats that have to be worn by those engaged in the industry,' and generally to the amount of capital sunk in it. That is an argument based on the assumption that thealternative to the agreement is that the region now devoted to sugar-growing will revert to a wilderness. Of course, that is not the alternative at all. Nobody suggests that this area, which has been described as one of the richest areas for its size in the world, and which, I suppose, is larger than many European countries, will revert to a wilderness, whatever happens to it. But nobody suggests, as I understand the position, that this region should be closed to the sugar industry at all. When we are told of all these things, they do not supply an answer to the question, "Notwithstanding that this is a greatindustry, is it worth the amount of coddling that it gets from the people of Australia ? " That is the question, as: <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> put it, that must be answered, and strangely enough, notone of the many speakers who have supported the present agreement, and, in particular, not one of the speakers from Queensland, has faced up to that question. </para>

Is the industry successful because of the support that it has received from the people of Australia? If that is so, its success is nothing to boast about. Or is it successful apart from the support that it is getting? If so, the answer is that there is no need for the special treatment that it now receives. That is the point which should be settled. What is the reason why this industry should stand apart from the other primary industries on the one hand, or apart from the secondary industries on the other ? </para>

                            <para>- It has had to do so by reason of these very things. Another form that the debate has taken has been in the direction of extravagant language. We have been informed that those of us who venture to criticize the agreement are in favour of bringing back black-labour into Australia. We have been told that we are freetraders, and that none but freetraders, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford</inline> put it,would vote for the bill. May I say that in this matter, the subject of protection or freetrade does not arise. There is no question of a low tariff as against a high tariff. There is only one question and that is as between a high tariffand a very high tariff or prohibition. Just at present, what the industry has is prohibition. When we find an honorable senator who has borne  His  Majesty's commission, saying that there were faked figures in the Tariff Board's report that was signed toy Messrs. Oakley, Herbert Brookes, and Walter Leitch, I think that we get a rather distressing exhibition of in tempera teness of language. It is not that the figures cited by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> were wrong, erroneous, misleading or mistaken, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford</inline> went to the full length of describing them as having been " faked ". </para>

                        was moderate and calm in his remarks, but, at the same time, he said that we could not bring about any changes in the sugar industry without bringing down our standard of living. Why should that result from treating the sugar industry as other industries of Australia are treated? What evil results necessarily follow from even the importation of sugar? We get both our tea and our coffee, which are responsible for a large part of our consumption of sugar, from countries where, it may be, black-labour is employed, and although wo might like to grow them if we could, we cannot do so.The importationofthose commodities does not have the slightest tendency to bring down our standard of living. On the contrary the means we employ to bring them in helps to raise that standard.

                        also said that the working people had made no complaint about the agreement, and

                        I think, remarked that not 1 per cent. of the people of Australia had made any complaint regarding it. I do not accept either of those, two statements in their entirety, but supposing it were so, that affords a very strong reason it appears to me Why we, in this chamber, and others in the other branch of the Legislature should keep a very watchful eye on privileges which are granted to any section of the community. The great mass of the public are, as it has been truly said, not very active in their insistence to injustice, even if it falls upon them. You,
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline>
                        I venture to say, and possibly some other honorable senators, will remember the opening passages in one of Henry George's books in which he describes the predicament of a tethered bull that goes round and round a pole until it cannot move. It does not know what has happened to it, or how it can escape from its plight. The writer likened that animal to the great mass of the people who knew that something was pressing upon them, but who did not exactly realize what it was. That is very often the position which is set up when privileges are allowed to any section of the community; because the mass of the people is inert and inactive; what is everybody's business is nobody's business. But when it comes to upholding the sugar industry or any other form of privilege, we always find that it is the minority that is active, and puts forward the propaganda such as that which enabled
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Poll,</inline>
                        from arguments contained in documents handed to him, to make a very fine speech in reply to the criticism of the sugar industry.

Clause 2 sets out that " the agreement made between His Majesty's Government of the Commonwealth of Australia and His Majesty's Government of the State of Queensland ... is approved". If I voted for that, I should signify my approval of it, and that would not be correct, because I simply cannot approve of an agreement of this sort. In the first place, as a matter of general principle, 1 am always opposed to the extension of government activities. I ask myself and this Senate, what arguments are left to any of us who belong to the individualistic side in politics - who arc anti-socialistic - if we support an agreement of this sort? </para>

The wages paid in the industry are to be fixed, if necessary, as well as the prices to be charged for certain kinds of fruit. The tentacles of government control arespread right over Australia. I find it very hard to give positive assent to a measure that enacts such things. </para>

                    <para>I desire to refer to two points. One is the difference between this agreement and the agreement which last week we were asked to assent to. Honorable senators will remember that I held strongly the view that we were bound to either accept or reject that agreement <inline font-style="italic">in toto;</inline> that we could not amend it. We are in the same position in regard to this agreement. It is impossible for any third party, even though it be a legislature, to amend an agreement that has been entered into by two other parties. In this case, however, the position is different from that of the Ottawa agreement. This is a domestic agreement, and, if necessary, the parties to it could be brought together without any difficulty. Consequently, those who want to modify it may do so by amending clause 2 of the bill, which expresses approval of it. What particular form that amendment should take, I must leave to those who think it ought to be made. Therefore, the difference between this agreement and the Ottawa agreement is that in this case, although we may not directly amend the agreement, we can offer suggestions as to why it should be amended - which we could not with propriety do in the case of the Ottawa agreement. </para>
                    <para>The second point that I wish to raise, and it has not so far been touched upon, concerns the. constitutional aspect of this agreement. T ask the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator</inline></para>
                    <para class="block">McLachlan.) : where does the Government find in the Constitution any power to enter into an agreement such as this? Although the parties to it are the right honorable the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Forgan</inline> Smith, the Premier of Queensland, each of those gentlemen signed it on behalf of his Government, and with no intention <inline font-style="italic">of</inline> binding himself personally. I should think that the whole trend of cases upon this subject is against the validity of any such agreement being made by the Government. I hesitate very much to offer an opinion, knowing, as I do, the standing as a constitutional lawyer of the honorable gentleman who occupies the position of Attorney-General; but I cannot help expressing the view that there is not in the Constitution any power to enter into an agreement such as this; and if the power is not given in the Constitution it cannot be done. There are several cases which approach very closely to the matter and I have no doubt that the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr-</inline> Latham) is acquainted with them. It also appears to me that the agreement is obnoxious to the provisions of section 99 of the Constitution. That section says that the Commonwealth shall not, by any law or regulation of trade, commerce or revenue, give preference to one State or any part thereof over any other State or part thereof. Here is a long agreement, in which only two States are mentioned. One might almost say that it is entered into solely between the Commonwealth Government and the Queensland Government. Assuming no mention of New South Wales in it, how can it be said that the Commonwealth is entitled to enter into some commercial arrangement with Queensland, which does not apply to any other State in the Commonwealth? Another reason why I think this agreement is invalid is because of the inclusion in it of clause 12, which says that the Commonwealth Government shall, subject to compliance with clauses 3 to 11 inclusive, continue to prohibit the importation of sugar until the 31st August, 1936, with certain exceptions that are immaterial. -The Prime Minister, therefore, pledged the -Parliament of Australia that the prohibition of the importation of sugar should continue. The term of the agreement carries it beyond the term of the present Commonwealth Parliament. If the position is that the agreement is entered into by the Queensland Government because of the existence of that provisionand I venture to affirm that lacking such a provision it would not have been entered into - the Queensland Government has been induced to become a party to a contract by reason of a clause that has no validity, and which it is beyond the powers of the Prime Minister or the Government - one might almost say the Parliament - to make. In my humble view, that provision in itself is sufficient to invalidate the agreement. I offer this opinion with deference, but with some confidence that there is a good deal in it. I feel that I must vote against the bill as a whole, whatever be the result. Much is said concerning the crack of the party whip, and that sort of thing. Those who find criticism so cheap, may criticize. I find no difficulty in saying that loyalty to anybody, whether it be to a party, a government, or a friend, cannot be altogether a bad quality; and in these extremely troublous times I should be very loth to do anything that might embarrass the Government; but in view of the attitude that I have always taken in connexion with the Queensland sugar industry, I feel that there is no course open to me other than to vote against the second reading of the bill. </para>

                    <para>Having listened to the speeches of Senators Brennan, Colebatch, and Johnston, one can understand the reference of the first-named gentleman to the bull, which is mentioned in one of the opening chapters of a work by Henry George. After hearing senators opposed to the bill, I am satisfied that the bull is  in this chamber. I understand and appreciate the criticism offered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch,</inline> whose arguments are ably supported by the "Insane Democracy League " of New South Wales, and would receive the plaudits of the- Millions Club, which stands for any sort of cheap labour,  coloured or otherwise. On this, as on other occasions in this chamber, the honorable senator has shown clearly where he stands in relation to the growth of sugar cane and the manufacture of sugar, tie is not greatly concerned with whether it is manufactured by white or coloured labour. In fact, if it were possible to give the people of Western Australia the benefit of black-grown Java sugar, he would tlo so. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> supported the policy outlined by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> who believes in the importation of s'ugar produced by black labour. Apparently honorable senators representing Western Australia believe in opposing any assistance to the Queensland sugar industry, but, at the same time, they favour a bounty of 4^d. a bushel on wheat. Tasmania has also received a good deal of assistance from the Com.monwealth Government, and the only complaint of the representative of that State appears to be based on the fact that there is no sugar depot in Hobart. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brennan</inline> has apparently expressed the views of the members of the Housewives Association in Victoria whose support he received at the last general election. I suppose that he will tell the members of that organization what he has done to protect their interests. It is not my desire to detain the Senate by further discussing a measure that has already been fully debated; but I sincerely trust that the bill will receive the support of a majority of honorable senators. </para>

                        <para>. - I have listened to this debate with a good deal more attention than usual, because I have not been at all sure as to the proper course which 1 should adopt with respect to this particular matter. Some honorable senators are fortunate in having their minds made tip before they enter the chamber, and I arn usually in that position myself; but I have not felt certain in regard to this, us it appears to me, somewhat difficult subject, particularly as some of the clauses of the agreement are in direct opposition to my general views. I refer more particularly to the very undesirable-from my" view-point quite undesirable - provisions in regard to embargoes. I dislike embargoes. I think they are bad for the people, and, consequently, for the country, i would sooner have a high tariff, even a prohibitive tariff. An embargo is bad for every one concerned, bad for the country to which it applies, and particularly dangerous, at this time above all times, as applied to trading relations with other countries. Other things being equal, a high protective tariff is more! desirable than an embargo. I do not claim to approach this subject with that broadnational outlook which. I hope, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings</inline> had when making That I considered to be the best speech I have heard him deliver in this chamber. When I was a member of another place we always thought that the possession of a broad national outlook indicated some particular interest in a State at the particular moment. I may mention in passing, that this bill is not a very redoubtable instance of the brotherhood of man in full operation. I do not think that I need emphasize that point to any extent. We have recently had the brotherhood of man preached to us, but this measure cannot be regarded as a striking instance of that brotherhood in full working order. </para>

                    <para>I do not propose to detain the Senate very long, but I should like to S:V a word or two about the old agreement which was never ratified by Parliament. It has been suggested that this Government had no " moral right " to repudiate that agreement. I cannot accept that view. It was the duty I take it, of the previous Government to bring the old agreement before Parliament, and until it was ratified by Parliament it was not, in fact, an effective or legal document. We cannot have all sorts of legal presumptions and moral rights set up when the law was really established for the purposes of defining what rights are. I can quite understand that those supporting the present Government may possibly have indicated to the  people  * ' Queensland during the last election campaign that if returned they would not discard the old agreement without entering into another voluntary agreement with the Queensland Government on behalf of those engaged in the sugar industry. Whether that is sb or not I do not know ; but I' cannot accept the view that, if ah agreement "is made 'and for whatever reason - and in some instances it may be for a deliberate reason. - that agreement is not brought before Parliament, any future government is morally bound by it although it has not been legally and properly completed. To accept that view would permit all sorts of agreements being made which would never be submitted to Parliament or would simply be brought in and dropped owing to the knowledge that they would not be passed. </para>
                    <para>A good deal has been said as to the relative claims of different primary producing industries. I do not make any apology for referring briefly to that aspect of the matter. I do not quite agree with what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brennan</inline> said on the subject. I believe that there is a certain amount of jealousy on the part of the other States owing to the favorable position which Queensland has occupied, not only with respect to sugar, but also with respect to a number of other products. Very little has been said in this debate from the viewpoint of South Australia; but the fact cannot be questioned that there is a general feeling in that State that Queensland has done exceedingly well out 'of sugar. </para>

                            <para>- At the moment, I am discussing sugar. The feeling in South Australia is that Queensland has done very well out of sugar, and that the industry is sheltered compared with other great industries in other States not nearly so richly endowed. Wheat and wool, our two really basic products, are sold in the world's markets, and at present, the wheat and wool industries are faced with extraordinary difficulties. I am quite prepared to admit that a bounty on wheat was paid last year, but it may be argued that that was only a set-off for one year against the amount which our tariff policy has cost the wheat producers. In any case, it was for only one year. What has been done for wool? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene</inline> claimed that something had been done for the wool industry. Some provision has been made whereby a wool-producer who has become insolvent,, or has not any income,'' can- apply for. exemption from the payment of the tax on land from which he is not obtaining anything. That does not seem to me to be of any great value. I do not wish to emphasize the jealousy aspect ; but after all, these things are all a matter of proportion. We have to consider how our industries are being treated by the central Government. For  a long time there has been a general feeling in South Australia that this great sugar industry is in a more fortunate and sheltered position than any other industry. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know whether that is or is not so ; I am stating what 1 believe are the facts. The feeling of antagonism is widespread. lt is not a feeling of antagonism to Queensland as a State, or to the sugar industry as an industry, but_ it is a feeling that the greater primary producing industries, which are really carrying the country, have not received, and have not really demanded, very much consideration, and that, by contrast with them, the sugar industry has been very fortunate. I have admitted the efficiency of the sugar industry. I think it is generally agreed that it is efficient; but I do not think that all primary producing industries in Queensland are equally efficient. Judging by the bananas we purchase, either the banana industry is inefficient, or the climate is unsuitable. I admit that the Queensland sugar industry rendered assistance to Australia during the war, but, with others, I agree that, generally speaking, since the termination of the war, it has done well under the altogether too generous agreement entered into by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes.</inline> Queensland has not hestitated  .to' take advantage of the excellent  terms offeredto  it, and hence has arisen some reaction, against sugar elsewhere. I think' that the Queensland sugar interests have now been wise - I do not think that they took the original step ; I believe that that was taken by the Government - to make terms which, from their viewpoint, have been very good. They certainly have no reason to object, to the terms of the agreement. </para>

                    <para>I think that I have made my position as tor' sugar clear, and 'T now come to the crux of the matter: what is to be clone with the agreement? We are told that if it is accepted, it must be accepted <inline font-style="italic">in toto</inline> or rejected. If the latter course is followed, it may throw us back to a worse agreement. But there seems to be a general belief that the old agreement is defective, and could be upset by the High Court. What then would be the position, supposing the Senate rejected the agreement? We should revert to a position in which the whole of the industry would be unsettled, and we should have Ministers doing what the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLachlan)</inline> has recently been doing - rushing from one end of Australia to the other trying to get in touch with various interests, and bring them into line. I cannot see that any useful purpose would be served by re-opening the question, particularly as some agreement would have to be come to ultimately. In the meantime, there, would be unsettled conditions in the industry, and the problem of unemployment would be made increasingly difficult. Under present conditions, I cannot agree that that would be a sound course to adopt. Rather do I suggest that the proper course, and the one generally adopted in other cases, is _ to have a gradual scaling down. The scaling down, in this instance, is not so great as I would desire, but it represents a definite reduction, which means something to the consumers. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch,</inline> in an excellent speech, expressed surprise that no one stood for the consumers. I am not surprised, because I have always found that there are so many interests to be considered that the consumers, although the largest section of the community, arc left out, 'because they are not organized. At this stage, especially, I do not believe in taking drastic steps. I do not think that this is a proper time either to upset or to retard unduly any agreement, if more or less reasonable. Having considered the matter carefully, I think that the proper thing for me to do is to vote for the bill as it stands, in the interests of the country as a whole. The position with regard to the embargo was put forcibly by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant,</inline> and at first I was inclined,. to agree with him. .' Paragraph 1.2 of the agreement provides that no sugar shall be imported into'- Australia while adequate supplies are produced in the Commonwealth. Rather than have that embargo, I would prefer a prohibitive tariff. But, after all, it is largely a matter of words. An adequate prohibitive tariff is, in fact, the equivalent of an embargo. The only point in favour of a prohibitive tariff, as against an embargo, is that it avoids the objectionable word " embargo." I am, however,; not so interested in words as in facts. If the result is the same, I do not see why I should object to the word " embargo," and insist on another word which would have precisely the same result. </para>

                            <para>- I agree with the honorable senator on that side, and express surprise that the Government put the position in this way. I do not like the embargo, and would have preferred a prohibitive tariff; but I see no justification for refusing to vote for clause 3. If that clause is defeated, the bill will be left in an extraordinary position. Paragraph 12 will have been agreed to because of the passing of clause 2 of the bill, and that paragraph agrees to continue the prohibition against the importation of sugar. If clause 3 is then defeated, and the embargo thereby discontinued, a state of confusion will arise. The whole agreement will then have broken down, and the sugar interests will probably be entitled to say that the contract has been broken. </para>

                        <para>. - No Australian industry has been more freely discussed of late than has the sugar industry. Queensland senators have regarded all criticism of that industry -as an attack, not only on the industry itself, hut also on Queensland, as well as on the White Australia policy. Any honorable senator who has expressed disapproval of the way in which the industry has been carried on, and has suggested an alteration, has immediately been assailed either as an advocate of the introduction of black-grown sugar into Australia, or as one who is in favour of the breaking down of the White Australia policy, in order that black labour may again be introduced into Australia. When Queensland was a separate colony, the sugar industry was an industry of Queensland. But when Queensland joined the federation, the sugar industry belonged to the whole of the Commonwealth. Honorable senators from the northern State are deserving of credit for their enthusiasm for this industry, but I submit they should not allow their enthusiasm to overcome their discretion to such an extent that they resent any criticism of this bill. </para>

                    <para class="block">Some of the other States he would see that other Australian industries are just as efficient as is the sugar industry. I have no desire' to harm the sugar industry, merely because other industries are not prosperous ; but I point out that it enjoys better conditions than any other primary industry in Australia. The trouble with the sugar industry is that it now produces more sugar than the Australian public can consume. In that respect it. is not unlike some of our secondary industries which find it difficult to export their surplus production overseas. Those other industries are, however, not in the fortunate position of being able to force up the price of their product and to make the people of Australia pay for the losses incurred on the surplus production exported overseas. The sugar industry has developed because .the legislation of this Parliament gave it such a measure of protection, that it became attractive. As in the case of .{he dried fruit industry, many persons were induced to engage in sugar-growing, and it was not long before the whole of Australia's sugar requirements were produced' in this country. During the boom years, when Australia appeared to be prosperous, because of borrowed money and high prices for our export products, the people did not mind paying high prices for sugar. Why has this industry been so much under public notice during the last two or three years, and why have meetings of protest been held so often in the southern States? Is it not because of the feeling of resentment on the part of the people against the continuance of the agreement? </para>

                            <para>- Why should that charge -be levelled against any body of persons who protest against certain items in Government policy? Why should it be suggested that, because there have been protests against the sugar agreement, those responsible for the agitation have been actuated by ulterior motives? Is it not the right of every citizen to protest against any government action which, in his opinion, is likely to injure him or the people collectively? It is the undoubted right of the people to make themselves heard in such circumstances. The sugar industry and those associated with it would have been wise to take cognizance of these continued protests from the southern States against the continuance of the agreement. We had every right to expect this of such a great national industry which, for so many years, has been working under the shelter of agreements and embargoes imposed by successive governments. I assure supporters of the bill and our Queensland friends that representatives of Tasmania and the people of that State are just as anxious as are the people in any other State to see this great industry prospering. I remind them that all the patriots in Australia are not domiciled in Queensland. If we criticize the agreement or the industry it is not because we have any desire to drag it down. The people engaged in the sugar industry have had ample,, time, to come forward voluntarily and offer some  contribution  towards the sacrifices .demanded of other sections of the community in  order to rehabilitate this country. It may lie said that they are now doing this by reducing the retail price of sugar by -id. per lb. But that reduction does not represent a real sacrifice, and certainly it is not comparable with sacrifices made by other primary industries in Australia. As working costs and cost of living figures have come down during the last year or two, what the industry may lose "by a reduction of the price of sugar will, I suggest, be made up by savings in working costs and other items of expenditure. I have said that other primary industries have suffered to a much greater extent than the sugar industry is likely to suffer under this agreement. I am a farmer. Everything that we as farmers produce is down at least  50  per cent, compared with prices ruling five years ago, but our working costs have come down only to the same extent as working costs have declined in the sugar industry, which has agreed to a reduction of only  11  per cent, in the price of its product. It has been said that it is suffering under disabilities due to Commonwealth legislation. If that be so, it is the duty of the Government to submit proposals to remove some of the handicaps that may have been placed upon the industry. It is being carried on under awards made, not by the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, but by the State Arbitration Court. Consequently it has to pay higher wages and give more favorable working conditions than are applied to any other primary industry in the Commonwealth. If the industry is suffering in consequence, it is strange that those connected with, it have not, up to the present, attempted to bring it under the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. </para>

Awards for waterside workers, railway servants, and employees in many other industries throughout the Commonwealth have 'also been reduced as part of the p!an for the rehabilitation of Australia, and the people generally have looked to the sugar producers to make their contribution. It is my intention , to support the second reading nf the bill, but I. am opposed 'to the embargo. I am at a loss to understand why the Government proposes to continue the embargo, because while high protection may hamper trade with other countries, embargoes are provocative of hostility, and not infrequently give rise to international difficulties. I, therefore, hope that the Government will not persist with the embargo. </para>

                        <para>. -  I have no intention of detaining the Senate at this late hour, but I should like to make one or two observations before the vote is taken on the motion for the second reading of the bill. Those honorable senators who have had an opportunity to visit the sugar-growing areas of Queensland and have obtained first-hand information concerning the industry will, I am sure, be reluctant to do anything that might damage it. About six years ago, it was my privilege to spend three or four weeks among the sugar-growers in Queensland, and I have no hesitation in saying that the industry, in all its phases, is highly efficient. But as other industries have been suffering sever e'y in recent years, it is only fair that some portion of the burden should be borne by this great primary industry in Queensland. I listened attentively to the speech of the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Greene)</inline> in introducing the bill, and also to the observations of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch,</inline> who, as usual, excelled himself in concise destructive criticism. I regret that the honorable gentleman did not offer some alternative to the agreement. It is true that he mentioned" the possibility of sugar production from beet in "Western Australia and Tasmania, but that was not a very helpful proposal, because about nine years ago, we thoroughly investigated the prospect of the sugar beet industry in Tasmania and came to the conclusion that a sugar beet mill would not be an economical proposition. We realized that it would be practical^ impossible to ' compete against cane sugar produced under ideal climatic conditions in Queensland. </para>

                    <para>In this agreement, like all others, there is a <inline font-style="italic">quid pro quo.</inline> Some parts of the proposal appeal to honorable senators, others do not. The agreement will mean a  saving to the sugar consumers of Australia of over £1,000,000 a year, for a fixed term of years. Quite a number of my colleagues object to this, but I consider itonly fair that those connected with the sugar industry should know where they stand, and should have some reasonable assurance of tenure. It would be unreasonable if the proposal could be upset from year to year. Conditions in the industry would then be chaotic. </para>

If I rejected the new agreement I should be unable to justifymy action in refusing to accept a reduction of the retail price from 41/2d. to 4d. per lb. All honorable senators, I understand, have been bombarded with telegrams- for and against the agreement. </para>
                    <para>A much-debated subjectin Tasmania is the establishment of a sugar depot in Hobart. Clause 11 of the agreement sets out what is to be done in the matter. The Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Guy)</inline> has directed that frequent and periodical stocktakings shall be made by the Collector of Customs in Hobart of the merchants' sugar stocks there, to ensure that merchants maintain adequate reserves. The penalty for failure to do that will be the. establishment of a depot, and naturally this will provide a, strong incentive to the merchants to "play the game". I think that Tasmanians can rest assured , that there will always be adequate reserve stocks of sugar in the capital city. </para>
                    <para>The subject of the sugar agreement has been discussed on many previous occasions in this chamber, and I do not intend at this stage to go into detail regarding it. Although we have not obtained all that is desirable, I can see no justification for rejecting this voluntary offer on the part of the industry. The offer was made voluntarily, for the Government did not hold a pistol at the head of the industry. The partisans on both sides have been inclined to discuss this subject with some heat, and to use extravagant language, instead of keeping strictly to the facts. I have in mind a circular that I received last week from certain interests in Melbourne. The letter was signed by a gentleman named Hagelthorn, and it was said that the consumers in the Commonwealth were charged three times as much for their sugar as consumers in Britain were paying, but that statement is quite inaccurate. We should consider this matter calmly, and, in my opinion, a step is being taken in the right direction. The agreement will considerably help the berry fruit-growers of Tasmania, than whom there is not a finer or more hard-working body of men on the land. From investigations made by me in 1926, and since, I believe that the sugar-growers of Queensland work hard and for long hours, but they are not making a great deal out of the industry. The growers of small fruits in Tasmania are a hard-working and frugal section of the primary producers, and they deserve all the help that this agreement will confer upon them. The consumers generally will benefit to the extent of something over £1,000,000 a year, and that advantage is not to be lightly thrown aside. For these reasons, and for many others, I support the second reading of the bill. </para>

                        <para>- I refer honorable senators to the ruling that I gaveon a similar point in connexion with the United Kingdom and Australia Trade Agreement Bill. The same principles apply in the consideration of this measure. It is quite competent, and would be clearly in order, for any honorable senator to discuss the schedule or any part thereof. But the agreement, which is the schedule to the bill, is an agreement entered into between the Commonwealth Government and the Queensland Government, and this Parliament has no power to alter it. An amendment of the agreement can be brought about only by way of an amendment of a clause of the bill. </para>

I maintain that die schedule is a part of the bill, and that, therefore, it is competent for honorable senators to move an amendment to any portion of it, so long as the amendment be relevant to the subject-matter of the bill, and be otherwise in conformity with the rules and orders of the Senate. My second objection to the Chairman's ruling is that it restricts the constitutional powers of the Senate to amend bills of this character. Section 53 of the Constitution, after setting out certain limitations on the power of the Senate in regard to money bills - and this obviously is not a bill which falls within that  category  - concludes - </para>

Provided that an amendment is relevant to the subject-matter of a bill, it can be moved when clause 2 is under discussion. The ruling of the  Chairman  of Committees' does. not take away any of the privileges of honorable senators, ' and is in accordance with the proper procedure by which this bill can be amended. I submit that the ruling is in strict conformity with Standing Order No. 201. </para>

                            <para>- I am inclined to agree with 'the ruling of the  Chairman  of Committees, but the principal difficulty underlying an amendment of the agreement i3 that if it is amended, it is not then an agreement between  His  Majesty's Government of the Commonwealth of Australia and  His  Majesty's Government of the State of Queensland. It would, therefore, be ineffectual, and nOt an amendment, which, in my opinion, and according to <inline font-style="italic">May,</inline> would be effective. I do not think that the right to amend this schedule is in any way affected at this stage. The procedure that I would recommend to the committee is to postpone clause 2 until after the consideration of clause 3. Clause 2 involves the approval of the agreement, and once that clause is passed, it cannot, unless recommitted, be further considered. Clause 3 suggests the possibility of the schedule being amended and in a way which I cannot understand, because a clause in the bill is also embodied in the agreement. </para>

                            <para>- In- -view of what transpired in this chamber on Friday last, I approach the consideration of this matter with some diffidence. An exactly similar situation arose when we were determining the procedure to be adopted in connexion with a bill to implement the Ottawa agreement and the schedule attached thereto. On behalf of the Labour party I then made the suggestion which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> has made to-night, that the vital clause in the bill should be postponed until after the schedule has been considered. I do not know what procedure has been adopted in the Senate in the past, but I do know the procedure in the South Australian House of Assembly, of which I was a member for some years. In every instance in which a bill embodying a schedule which formed an agreement between the Government and another party was under consideration, the procedure followed was that the clauses of the bill ratifying the agreement were postponed until  after the schedule had b.een agreed to. <inline font-style="italic">.The</inline> South Australian Parliament has existed for about 70 years, whereas this Parliament has functioned for only a little over 31 years. </para>

                            <para>- If the procedure now suggested by the Government is to be a standing rule for the guidance of the Senate it .will be useless for us to consider these bills at all. If we are to accept agreements signed by the Prime Minister, or other Minister, without having any' right to amend them, this Parliament might as well close its doors so far as government by agreements is concerned. In view of the . attitude adopted the other night the only course to adopt is to agree to a ruling similar to that which was then given. I suggest that the deliberate act of the Government in trying to flout Parliament is placing the presiding officer in an invidious position. The Government must withdraw from its attitude and adopt a proper procedure in relation to measures of this kind, otherwise we shall have chaos, and an unworthy precedent, which will give rise to confusion in the future, will be established. </para>

                            <para>- It is constantly done in documents. The operative part of this measure is  abuse  2 of the bill. If the Senate were Sole to alter any of the provisions of the agreement, the whole bill would fall to the ground, because we cannot agree to something which has not been agreed to by the two parties to the agreement. If we alter one word or letter, we approve of something which the other party to the agreement has not agreed to. There must be two parties in agreement before there can be any agreement. There has been no flouting of Parliament, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Halloran</inline> has suggested. To use the words of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes,</inline> if clause 2 is carried, it settles the race. We cannot touch an agreement which two parties have signed; but we may do what we like with clause 2. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill</inline> said that if we alter clause 2 we may render .the whole bill ineffective. I suggest- that it would be well to have the practice settled, since our decision this morning may 'govern the procedure of the Senate for the future. </para>

Under the authority which the honorable senator has just quoted, we could enact, as in clause 2, that the agreement made between  His  Majesty's Government of the Commonwealth and  His  Majesty's Government in the State of Queensland, "a copy of which has been circulated amongst members, is approved ". That would be a perfectly proper way to give honorable senators an opportunity to see what was in the agreement. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> argues that, under the bill as it stands, it is competent for the committee to alter the agreement. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly, and, as has been pointed out by the Leader of the Senate and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan,</inline> Ave can, under the ruling of the  Chairman  of Committees, suggest amendments in clause 2. To me the position as explained in <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> is so clear that it should not be misunderstood by any honorable senator. The whole trouble has arisen because there is no provision in our Standing Orders for what has occurred. It is an omitted case as we would say in the law. If we accept literally the viewpoint of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch,</inline> we should observe the procedure laid down in Standing Order No. 199, but- in -Standing Order No. 201 there is provision for amendments to be made to any part of the bill, provided they are relevant to its subject matter, and otherwise are in conformity with the rules and orders of the Senate. No provision is made, apparently, in our Standing Orders for the point that is dealt with in the passage from <inline font-style="italic">May,</inline> read by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> and indicated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Halloran,</inline> that a distinction must be drawn between a. schedule which embodies an agreement and -an ordinary schedule to a bill. Clearly, it is not competent for the committee to interpolate amendments in an agreement made between two parties. </para>

"We have not the original document before us, and if, by an amendment, we interpolated something into the document before the parties to it had attached their signatures, technically, we should be guilty of forgery. The Government submits, as a schedule to the bill, an agreement which is strictly valid, but for greater caution has asked Parliament for its ratification. </para>

I have not the time to study the whole of the Statutes, but I invite the honorable senator to look at Act No. 31 of 1923. If he does so, he will find that it validated a whole series of agreements, and excepts from the operation of the act another series of agreements, not one of which appears in the schedule to the bill. </para>

                            <para>- I would again direct attention to the constitutional aspect of this question. It has not been denied by any member that the course adopted by the House of Representatives in regard to a similar bill prevented honorable members from considering the clauses of the schedule, and submitting amendments to it. . I am in entire accord with the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene,</inline> but I agree that it would have been competent for the Government to submit this bill without including the agreement in the schedule at all, but if that had been done it would have been obvious that the schedule was not part of the bill and therefore could not be amended; the Government would have taken its chance of getting the bill through without including the agreement in the schedule. As the Government, however, has included the agreement as a schedule to the bill, it is, I submit, part of the measure and, under our Standing Orders, the committee has the right to amend that part of the bill. . </para>

                    <para>The <inline font-weight="bold">PRESIDENT (Senator the Hon. P. J.</inline> Lynch). - The case before the Chair seems to be that when this bill was in committee and when clause  2  was being considered, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> suggested its postponement until the schedule had been dealt with. The Minister in charge of the measure took an objection and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> then asked the  Chairman  of Committees whether it would be competent, when the schedule came before the committee, for an amendment to be made in the schedule, whereupon the  Chairman  ruled against the honorable senator. Following the usual procedure, when a clause of a bill is put to the committee, it is open to amendment. In this case an amendment to clause  2  might mean an amendment would be made in the agreement which appears as a schedule to the bill. It would really seem that the contending parties are almost at one with each other, the only difference being one as to procedure. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has directed attention to the practice of the House of Commons when dealing with bills to confirm agreements as set out in <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> at page  406.  Clearly, under that procedure, the rights of this chamber are preserved. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> contends that the agreement in the schedule to this bill can be altered by direct amendment to the agreement itself, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> argues that its alteration may be brought about by amending the enabling provisions of the bill. Obviously, to be strictly in order, amendments should be made only in the manner indicated by <inline font-style="italic">May,</inline> the highest of all authorities, which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> quoted. </para>

                        apparently relies upon the Senate procedure as laid down in Standing Order No.  201,  which provides that an amendment may be made to any part of a bill provided it is relevant to the subject-matter of the bill and is otherwise in conformity with Senate procedure.

                        <para>- If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> would turnto the next page and find out what is done in the case of a bill which contains an agreement he would find that the word " exactly " would not fit in. As has been mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brennan,</inline> these Standing Orders do not provide specifically for this case. There is no standing order that fits the case the same as this authority does. But I have a recollection that when a contract was being entered into with the Orient Company some years ago for the carriage of mails between Australia and Great Britain an effort was made to amend the agreement, and it was held that such an amendment could not be entertained on the ground that the agreement could not be amended, but that an amendment of the preceding motion, if the Senate thought it desirable, could be effected. With that sole precedent before me, and as the Standing Orders are silent on the matter, I have only to rule that the Minister in charge of the bill was right in proposing that the clause should be proceeded with. And if the  Chairman  upheld that view, I have no ground to stand on except that which has never been challenged - that clause  2  can be amended, and by that means an alteration may be brought about in the agreement; hut where the schedule to a bill consists of an agreement the practice is that such schedule is not open to amendment. Therefore, I uphold the ruling of the  Chairman. </para>

                            <para>- I am assuming, of course, that the old agreement was valid, and that it was possible for it to be implemented until the end of its term. The sugar interests had that agreement for what it was worth. The Commonwealth Government had signed it, and, as I have already said, it believed that in the event of not being able to get a voluntary adjustment of the agreement, it was bound to implement it to the best of its power throughout its currency. The sugar interests, in entering into this voluntary agreement, said, " You are taking away the right we had under the old agreement for the price of 41/2d. per lb. to the end of 1934. If we now give up this1/2d. per lb., is it not fair, that you should give us continuity until the end of the term?" . These are matters of compromise, and the Government endeavoured to hold the scales as evenly as possible between the parties. It was considered that in view of the fact that the growers were giving up what were their undoubted rights under the old agreement, there was no certainty that in the review of the price we should get any reduction, and as the sugar industry was prepared to take a reduction for four years, it was considered to be a fair <inline font-style="italic">quid pro quo.</inline> I think that it was, and in view of that, the Government cannot accept <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch's</inline> amendment. He desires to limit the price of 4d. per lb. to two years, and at the end of that period to endeavour to get it down again. In view of all the circumstances, I do not consider that that would be fair to the sugar industry. One of the things which the agreement is designed to secure is stability, not only to the sugar industry, but also to all the related industries. Under this agreement they will all know where they are for four years ahead, and they can make their arrangements accordingly. Therefore, the Government cannot accept the amendment. </para>

                        <para>. - I intend to support the amendment,not because of its virtues, but because, if carried, it will effect thepurpose which we failed to achieve on the second reading. It is, so to speak, a destructive agent, and is therefore germane. It further goes to prove the truth of my contention on the second reading, that the only fair way of dealing with this matter is that the parties should agree on terms, and that these should be made the subject of a bill, which should be passed, in this case by this Parliament and by the Queensland Parliament. </para>

It isa contract, the terms of which are arranged, but which, before being signed, has to be approved, in this case by the Parliament of the Commonwealth and the Parliament of Queensland. That is the only fair course to take, because it is seen from numerous instances that this method of putting an agreement in as a schedule to a bill involves its acceptance or rejection, and cannot possibly permit of an amendment of the agreement. </para>

That is entirely opposed to the principle of the concession, which was supposed to be an equivalent of the reduction of221/2 per cent. made by bondholders and every one else. My contention is that those who made the concession have no right to any new privilege in return for it.

            <para class="block">The effect of the amendment would be to restore the provision of the original agreement in regard to the amount that the sugar industry is required to provide for the assistance of the fruit industries. The Scullin agreement provided that for three years, as from the 1st September, 1931, the amount of £315,000 per annum should be provided for the purpose of payments being made for the benefit of the Australian fruit industry. The agreement that we are now considering reduces that amount to £200,000, and as a result it has been found necessary so to reduce the rebate given by the manufacturers of sugar for home consumption that the manufacturers of jam for  home consumption will have to pay the same price as they paid under the old agreement. The advantage that they should have enjoyed has been taken from them. </para>

I recall to the honorable senator's mind the first annual report, dated the 4th November, 1932, of the Fruit Industry Concession Committee, set up under the Scullin agreement. That report was tabled in the Senate only last week, and the honorable senator might find it profitable to study its contents. The concluding paragraph points out how inadequate even the sum of £315,000would be, if any increased production had to be dealt with. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable senator will turn to the original agreement, he will find that the sum of £315,000, as 'a firm amount, applied only to the first three years, and that during the last two years it was liable to be reduced to the extent of any reduction made in the then price. Assuming that the agreement was altered in regard to price at the end of 1934, this amount of £315,000 was to be reduced to the extent of the reduction. As the reduction has been ante-dated by two years, all that has been done is to apply the provisions of the old agreement to the present occasion. As a matter of fact, the fruit processing industry has lost nothing. It has the 1/2d. per lb. reduction in common with the rest of the sugar users in Australia, and also gets the £200,000. </para>

But what is perfectly clear is that the old agreement provided that the sum of £315,000 should be reduced in the event of a reduction of the price. That is the point which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> did not touch. In view of it, the Government cannot accept the amendment. Every one knows that the sole object of these amendments is to break down the agreement, and that once it is altered in any particular it goes by the board. </para>

Be the figure what it may, the taxation is excessive and we might very well complain that Parliament was not consulted before the Government decided to renew the agreement and re-impose the embargo. Under this arrangement the sugar industry is a taxing machine. Whether the amount which it levies is 15s. or £1 per head, is beside the point. What I and other honorable senators complain about is that the Government should have committed itself before giving Parliament an opportunity to express an' opinion on the subject. It is no answer to say that this administration merely followed the procedure of previous governments. Our economic circumstances were entirely different when previous administrations entered into these arrangements. In our present circumstances no government should have inflicted this further burden upon the people without consulting Parliament. </para>

                    <para>. - I am delighted to have an opportunity to explain the position. As the representative of the Government it was my responsibility to negotiate with the representativesofthe sugar industry, and in these negotiations I ascertained that the representatives of the industry were prepared to agree to a reduction of price and to give certain other concessions provided that the Government agreed to the imposition of an embargo, and the retention of certain other provisions which were in the old agreement. During the course of those negotiations Ifrankly confessed that I preferred the imposition of a protective duty to an embargo. I still hold that view, but I had to deal with the conditions as I found them, and to bear in mind that the industry was well established and efficiently conducted. . The sugar producers said that if they agreed to a reduction of the price of sugar, there were certain provisions in the old agreement, including an embargo, which they wished to preserve. They said that they required some security with respect' to the future, and looking at the matter from all its viewpoints, the proposals they made were considered to be fair. They said that the arrangement was voluntary, and that in view of all the circumstances, their proposal in this respect should be agreed to. Some of the provisions which they wished to preserve have already been attacked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> in the amendments he has moved, and which have been rejected by the committee. The Government felt that it had either to include this provision or leave the position as it then stood. The representatives of the industry having agreed to a reduction of price, the Government consented to provide for the prohibition of imports. </para>

                    <para>. - I spoke against this clause in my second-reading speech, and I shall oppose it now. I do not think that all honorable senators have grasped the importance of this provision. The agreement refers to" such sections? of the Australian fruit industry as receive benefits". In order that the berry fruit-growers may receive benefits under this agreement, industrial arbitration conditions must be introduced into the working of the berry fruit plantations. If that is done, the industry will be destroyed, because employees engaged in it will be entitled to wages and conditions which the owners of the properties and their families do not enjoy. I shall support the amendment. </para>

If honorable senators will read it, they will see that the members of the committee say that this is the most difficult problem which they have had to face, but that they are making a complete investigation with a view to finding out those who are entitled to the benefits under this agreement; also that they intend to fix prices all over Australia. It seems to me that it would be inconsistent to carry out that portion of the agreement which relates to price fixing without also fixingthe wages to be paid in the industries concerned.

                    <para>. - I intend to support the amend- ment.This matter has never before been under review by the Senate. Although it is quite extraneous to the subject-matter of the agreement, it has been interpolated, and now forms part of the agreement. The remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly's</inline> interjections indicate that the danger, to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> has directed attention, exists. This was also suggested in the report to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> has alluded. Clearly if the agreement is passed with this provision remaining in it, certain persons and influences may get into the little Eden of the fruit-growers in Tasmania and prove to be a very discordant element. </para>
