                    <para class="block">This is a short bill to make provision for two or three matters arising out of the  Commonwealth's responsibilities under the Financial Agreements and the general loan conversion operations of last August. A.s honorable senators are aware, under the financial agreements all securities for moneys borrowed by or on behalf of the </para>
                    <para class="block">States must be Commonwealth securities. Under the Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Act power is conferred for the issue of Commonwealth Government inscribed stock and treasury bonds only. "We have no power to issue any other form of security. "When the Commonwealth Debt Conversion Act 1931 was passed, power was taken to convert all these securities and State securities into Australian consolidated inscribed stock and Australian consolidated treasury bonds, debentures and such other securities as might be prescribed, but the issue of securities of these designations was limited to those issued under the Debt Conversion Act. </para>
                    <para>At the Loan Council meeting on the 12th September^ 1931, it was decided that the various governments should make counter sales of Commonwealth securities bearing the same rate of interest, and subject to the same conditions as regards income taxation as the 4 per cent, consolidated securities issued under the Conversion Act. It is, of course, obvious that those are the only conditions under which it is possible to make counter sales1, because if the conditions attaching to counter sales are other or less favourable than the conditions attaching to the sale of . converted securities it will not be possible to make any counter sales at all. This decision of the Loan Council made it necessary that the securities issued should also be known as consolidated securities, thus indicating at once to the holders the limits of taxation which may be imposed on the interest from the securities. This requires an amendment of the .Stock Act to enable the issue of consolidated stock and consolidated treasury bonds. Honorable senators will observe that the bill contains a provision, making its operation retrospective to the date of the resolution passed by the Loan Council. </para>
                    <para>It should, perhaps, be stated that the issue of these consolidated securities on the same terms as securities issued under the Conversion Act was only adopted as a temporary measure until market conditions became more settled and the market price for securities showed that it was desirable that other terms should be fixed by the Loan Council. The terms and conditions under which any loans can now be  raised in Australia have to be settled by the Loan Council before the prospectus is issued. As a matter of fact up to date a very large proportion of the new securities issued under the Loan Council's decision of September last, have been taken up by superannuation funds and similar bodies. </para>
                    <para>The last clause of the bill makes specific provision with regard to income tax on these securities, and sets out that interest on the securities shall be free from Commonwealth income tax to the same extent as securities referred to in section 20 of the Debt Conversion Act. The securities are free from all income tax under State law, as were securities under the Debt Conversion Act. </para>
                    <para>As some investors in Commonwealth securities show a preference for other kinds of securities than stock or bonds, power is also being taken to issue such securities, such as debentures or some other kind of securities still, if so desired, and as may be prescribed from time to time. </para>

                <para>It is a most pathetic circumstance that, only last evening, at the conclusion of a gathering of honorable- senators that was held to say farewell - which, I hope, will be only a temporary one - to some of our colleagues, who will not be members of this chamber after the end of June, the right honorable the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> prior to his departure for Sydney, should have been asked to convey by telegram to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Newlands an expression of the good wishes of those who were there assembled. </para>
                <para>I feel very keenly the loss of our deceased friend, because I knew him intimately for more years than one cares to contemplate. I knew him in his private, his public, and his business life, and I have never been associated with  one whose character so strongly impressed me as that of a kindly, honest man. I need make no mention of his capacity, because that is well known to honorable senators. In the  office of <inline font-weight="bold">President</inline> of the Senate, he discharged his functions  with distinction to himself, and satisfaction to honorable senators. He was impartial in all his dealings and the world is the poorer for his passing. The deceased gentleman leaves behind him the record of a clean, honest, and disinterested life. He always desired to serve Australia by the best and most honorable means. Politically, his thoughts did not always harmonize with mine; but whether as an opponent or a colleague, I learned to admire and to esteem him as a straightgoer, and as one whose only wish was to give of his best to his country. It may  be  some comfort to his splendid helpmate, Lady Newlands, and to his family - who, I believe, will prove themselves worthy of the name of  Newlands -  to learn that the Senate has marked its regret at his passing, and its admiration and respect for his many admirable qualities, by suspending its sitting for a few hours. </para>
                <para>I speak with a good deal of feeling, because I knew <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> personally for many years, and highly respected him.

                    Newlands had a distinguished career, spread over many years, in both the State and the Federal sphere. He was first a loyal member - in fact, loyalty was one of his most pronounced characteristics - of the old Labour party. The test came to him, as it came to many, during the war, when he left his former party and joined the other side. Two of his sons served in the Great War. Every one must feel grateful to him, and to others like him, for what they did to help those of us who were on the other side of the world. Subsequently he rose to the highest office in the gift of the Senate.
                </para>
                <para>For some time, as has been said, he had been in indifferent health, but during the last election, in spite of this, and notwithstanding that he was not a candidate, he was on the platform at a great public meeting held at Glenelg, which was addressed by the present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons),</inline> to assist those of us who were. That was typical of the man. </para>
                <para>Just before I last left South Australia, I visited the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newlands,</inline> who was then in hospital, and he asked me to give his kindest regards to all his friends over here, mentioning specially his old friend, the Acting Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLachlan).</inline> In saying that, I am sure he did not mean to convey his good wishes only to members of the Senate and another place, but to all his friends in Canberra. </para>
                <para>I grieve at the passing of this loyal Australian, who was truealso to the country from which he sprang, and I join in the Senate's expression of sympathy and regret to Lady Newlands, who has been his helper in sickness and in health, and to the members of his family. </para>

I have had every opportunity to estimate the thoroughness of the work which he did while  President  of the Senate, and I place on record my opinion that the two prominent features of his career as the holder of that high office were his sense of fairness, almost judicial in its thoroughness, and his conscientious discharge of duty, even at the great price that it involved.

                        <para>, - I endeavoured to point out last night that the first portion of this bill is designed to protect trade unionists and their organizations against the tyranny of the employer. Honorable senators need only look at the initial provision to realize that that clearly is what is aimed at. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The second branch of the measure has been discussed by honorable senators on the assumption that we are dealing with ordinary circumstances. Already, under the law, any association or organization that is affiliated with the red element is an unlawful body. The difficulty with which we are confronted, however, is that of proving such affiliation; and it is because of that fact that the methods provided for in the bill are to be adopted. Affiliation is very difficult to establish by evidence in this country. The affiliation is with an organization whose headquarters and operations are overseas. It therefore becomes necessary to use somewhat wide language - language that perhaps offends the susceptibilities of those who are familiar with the principles of British justice. But the averment provision is not a new one ; it is to be found in the Crimes Act, as well as in a great deal of other legislation that this chamber has passed from time to time. It is necessary to make such provision because  of the difficulties of the situation, and the practical impossibility of taking action unless the onus of proving his innocence is thrown upon the person charged. There are no more subtle bodies known ' to the Department of the Attorney-General than those which are associated with the Communist element. They exhibit remarkable agility in jumping from limb to limb. How can the Crown, in the interests of the general public, prove affiliation when that affiliation is with a body that has its head-quarters in Moscow or elsewhere ? Honorable senators may think that I speak somewhat fervently on the matter. My excuse is that the menace is a real one. The daily press furnishes manifestations of this reality in the neighbouring dominion of New Zealand. There, a man who for twelve years had conducted an ordinary business was discovered marching through Government House grounds with a powerful live bomb in his possession.  His  premises were searched, and the discovery was made of three other bombs, as well as plans of several important public buildings. This 13 the sort of thing that happens inside the circle of those from association with whom we wish to save the trade unions. Why should we sanction the registration in our courts of organizations which affiliate or mix themselves up in any way with bodies that have in mind the objective that is aimed at by these people? No court would deregister a union without absolute justification. Some executive with lunatic tendencies, or a feeling of ill-will towards the community, might associate itself by affiliation with some of these bodies. If the members of the organization disapproved of such action they could put themselves right by changing their executive and removing the justification for deregistration. There is the additional protection that no Attorney-General would exercise this power in a tyrannous manner. This legislation has been introduced merely with a view to strengthening the arm of the law. It is not so long since a certain organization definitely decided to affiliate with the Red International. A desperate dispute arose, and I am glad to say that those who stood for moderation and the best traditions of trade unionism, in an encounter with the executive, by 48 votes to 20, declared that the affiliation should end. Is not that all to the good, in the interests of the decent men in the union, as well as of the body politic? But, forsooth, they were threatened with violence, because they had determined to do the right thing by complying with the law and dissociating themselves from this menace, which the heads of every organization, all our religious bodies, and every Parliament in Australia, realizes is a danger to the life of Australia and to civilization throughout the world. Why should we not take steps to cleanse the register of our Arbitration Court by cancelling the registration of bodies which carry on in that way? </para>
                    <para>I apologize for my absence from this chamber yesterday afternoon while _ the debate on the measure was proceeding; it was absolutely essential in the public interest. I observe that objection was voiced to retrospective legislation. I shall deal with that in committee. But, emerging from it, another point was taken: that is, that no legal association has to be proved. That is the very thing that we want and that .we have to meet. We know that the association exists in fact ; we have information to that effect ; but we cannot secure the necessary proof, on account of the fact to which I have already referred - that the body with which the affiliation takes place has its head-quarters outside of Australia. Therefore, it is not the ordinary prosecution of a man for some felony or misdemeanour that is involved; but the highest function that Parliament can perform - the protection of the public life of the country. One could attack this legislation by abstract reasoning. But this is not an abstract question. I appreciate the views that are held by my learned friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brennan.</inline> I admit that this principle is held dear by the profession to which he and I, in common, belong. I know that it will be suggested that we are violating the best traditions of British justice. But I am not going to have British justice prostituted, and its good name traduced, because the arm of the law is paralysed, and because men or bodies are registered who are affiliated with the organization to which I have referred. The present position is not singular to the administration of Commonwealth law. Under various statutes, State and Commonwealth, the difficulty of proving illegal transactions in various walks of life had become so great, and the subtlety of the people engaged in illicit transactions so deep, that the law was becoming a by-word. Methods have had to be adopted that, in ordinary circumstances, would not be contemplated. Charges are not made lightly, but only after the fullest consideration. Is it suggested that the Attorney-General would launch a prosecution without real reason? The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Barnes)</inline> should know full well that the very existence itself of  his own powerful organization was challenged not many days ago, and that the attempt was made to drive its members into other bodies which, apparently, are not so respectful of the law as is the organization which he leads so well. The morning press of Sydney to-day publishes a statement concerning what was about to happen, and what I believe did happen in some cases, to members of the Australian Workers Union. That was simply an attempt to drive those men out of a law-abiding union into an organization extreme in character, and that we may yet find is associated with the red element. The principle that a person must be held to be innocent until  he is proved guilty is excellent up to a point; but, as I have already said, it is incapable of application in cases such as this. </para>
                    <para>This measure is analogous to the legislation that the Senate enacted the other night, and is designed to assist the Attorney-General and his officers to deal with the menace that threatens us whereever they may find it. We know that these organizations have employed disruptive tactics in derogation of the power of the court, and to its injury. As I understand the position, this country stands for the regulation of wages, hours, and conditions of labour, under the system of arbitration. But those who seek the advantages of arbitration must go into the court with clean hands. That is the principle which applies to every suitor in equity. If they do that, they will be dealt with honestly and fairly. </para>
                    <para>It has been suggested that deregistration would deprive the members of unions of the advantages of the law. It will do nothing of the kind. Registration is fol lowed by certain consequences. This can have reference only to the conditions  that  prevail under Commonwealth law.  It has  no relation to the actual existence  of  the union, but concerns only its existence  as  a registered body under the Federal Arbitration Act. We go to the limit  in  that regard. Whatever government is  in  power must be trusted to see that this privilege is not abused, to the detriment of innocent persons. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brennan,</inline> who criticized this portion of  the  bill would be the last to suggest that it would be used to the detriment of an innocent person by any Attorney-General.  The  honorable senator answered his own criticism by saying that in this class of cases the onus of proof rests with the accused. That is the position under this measure. The onus of proof in the matter of affiliation should rest upon the organization. </para>

                    <para>.- Section 9 of the principal act provides that in certain circumstances protection shall be afforded to members of registered organizations. Under this proposed new sub-section similar privileges are to be extended to others who are not members of an organization, and who have not had to submit to the industrial laws of this country. That is grossly unfair, and such a provision should not be embodied in our arbitration legislation. It is somewhat difficult to understand the type of person this proposed sub-section seeks to protect. Good work has been done by the old soldiers in the Labour movement, and the benefits obtained for themselves and their fellow men should be shared only by those who have helped to secure them. This provision is aimed at genuine industrial organizations, the members of which have paid their fees, and fought to obtain the benefits they enjoy. </para>

                        <para>- I believe in equality of treatment to those who have made equal sacrifices to obtain industrial benefits. This provision will make it possible for the industrial  scally-wag,  who belongs to no industrial organization, who has no ties, no spirit, and no manhood, to take his place alongside the man who has always supported his union. It seeks to confer the benefits of the arbitration system on these scraps of industrial flotsam who obtain employment only when the boss wants them to do a dirty job. It is not possible to amend a clause which provides for that sort of thing. The only possible course is to treat it like a cancer, and cut it right away. In this measure the Government is sowing the seed of industrial strife. Most honorable senators who support the Government have never been through the industrial mill, and know nothing of the conditions obtaining in the industrial world. The workers have had to band themselves together, and fight for their protection like an army. We, on this side, every man of us, have been through it, and know what it means. Through their organizations, the workers have won benefits for themselves, and now the Government proposes to make them share those benefits with men who are commonly called " scabs ". I do not like using that term ; I do not think it is half vile enough for the people it describes. If the Government were actuated by a Christian spirit, and were assisting those people in the same way as it might befriend and feed a leper, there might be something to be said for its action, but we know that its real purpose is to destroy legitimate trade unionism. </para>

                        <para>- The proposal is, that whether a man be registered or not, he shall be entitled to all the benefits conferred by an Arbitration Court award. The Government is seeking in this subtle way to destroy the industrial organizations of Australia, those organizations which constitute the only protection of the workers against the rapacity of bad employers. For a long time now, a campaign has been carried on by the press and by commercial organizations against the workers' wages. It has been said that costs of production are too high, that we must get rid of the Arbitration Court, suspend awards, and bring down wages. The idea, apparently, is that the worker, having been robbed of the protection of the court, or other industrial tribunal, will, when he can suffer hunger no longer, accept the wage that is offered to him. The Arbitration Court is supposed to consist of judges who have no personal feelings on the matters which come before them, and whose judgments are founded entirely on the evidence offered. That protection, should not be removed, because it is unreasonable that the workers of this country should not have between them and the rapacious sweater a tribunal to insure that justice is done. </para>

                    <para>. - While the Leader of the Opposition was speaking, I was reminded of the old saying that " There is none so blind as they that won't see." The honorable senator, with the object of hitting all round, simulated a misunderstanding of this clause, which was entirely unworthy of him.  His  remarks will not hurt any one who is out to do his best in the interests, not only of the unionists, but also of the community generally. Either the honorable senator has not read the measure, or he has misconstrued it, for when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brennan</inline> asked him to give an example to illustrate his point he refused to do so. Section 9 of the principal act provides that- </para>

                <para class="block">Since the section, as proposed to be amended, provides for the protection of the employee the honorable senator in opposing this clause is opposing an attempt to give the employee a fair deal. I remind him that " organization " is defined as an organization registered under the act. Had the honorable senator been studying the newspapers recently, he would know that an attempt is being made to drive men out of organizations, which either are registered or are capable of being registered, into some other organization, which is subject to the control of the petty tyrant, who, for the time being, is in power. The Government seeks to protect employees from that tyranny. The legislation now before us will not allow the employer - whether he be the head of a large industrial establishment, the railways commissioner, or even the Premier of a State - to dictate the organization which an employee shall join. It will be for the employee himself to select the organization to which he desires to belong, and if the boss attempts to force him into another organization, the employee is amply protected by this legislation. The Government claims that this bill is in the interests of freedom - freedom of conscience, and freedom to refuse to join an organization to whose objects an employee objects. Probably that is the reason for the opposition to this measure. </para>

We must not lose sight of the significance of the words " of any other organization or association of employees " in the proposed amendment to paragraph <inline font-style="italic">d</inline> of sub-section 1 of section 9 of the principal act; it is in them that the sting lies. Sitting with the Minister are honorable senators who, in the days of the Fisher Administration, favoured a policy of preference to trade unionists. </para>

Clause 2 does all that clause 5 was intended to do. In his policy speech <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> definitely declared that if he is returned to power his Government will re-establish preference to unionists, and that those who are not at present in recognized trade unions will have to join up. We know that, among other things, the Financial Emergency legislation, introduced by this Government, and which is now lying in cold storage, was intended to drive the wedge between the Australian Railways Union and those organizations named in clause 5, and to empower the latter to collect the revenues of the State. </para>
