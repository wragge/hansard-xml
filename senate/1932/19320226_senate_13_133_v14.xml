                <para>I submit this amendment because the clause as it stands prejudicially affects the representatives of Lloyds in Australia. There are three firms of Lloyds brokers in Sydney, each representing the name of a group of underwriters in one person. If wo used the word " one " each of these persons would be mulct iri a heavy deposit, which is not, I presume, the intention. The desire of the Government, I understand, is that Lloyds shall pay one deposit, which may be the maximum. I have discussed this matter with the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLachlan),</inline> and I trust that he will accept my amendment. </para>

                        <para>- They are not representatives in the true sense. They accept business in Australia. One group represented in the various States by an incorporated company sends its business through ari individual broker in London. There are also other persons who accept business for Lloyds and send it through other individuals in London. One broker in London does not represent all of them. The provisions as it stands, therefore, might penalize them to the extent that each would have to find a separate deposit of £50,000,000, whereas -there is no need for them to do so so long as they act in association. If they are associated in Australia and allow the business to go through an individual broker in London, they will have to provide only one £50,000,000 instead of three sums of that amount, which would be rather a hardship, because all their business  is to go through London eventually. I am prepared to accept, the amendment moved by the honorable senator. </para>

                    <para>. - It would appear that there is no necessity for the amendment moved by the honorable senator as the sub-clause in its present form refers to an association, and not to certain individuals in London. I think that the honorable senator's purpose would be better served by leaving the sub-clause in its present form. It is regarded as business carried on by one person, which makes the association liable for only one deposit. In the interests of those whom the honorable senator desires to protect the sub-clause should be left as it is. </para>

Provision is made in sub-section 1 for a deposit of £5,000, the payment of which would be evidence of good faith on the part of a company. The Government has no desire to restrict the development of new mutual life insurance companies, some of which. I understand, are in course of formation. In order to lighten the burden of such companies I propose to amend sub-clause 2 by leaving out the word "five" with a view to insert in lieu thereof the word " one ". I regret that I cannot accept an amendment in the form submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott,</inline> as it, would not harmonize with the drafting of the bill. The honorable senator suggested the payment of a deposit based on the premium income, but I think that in actual practice it will be found that the proposal which I now submit will not be detrimental to new companies.

                    <para>. - The amendment moved by the Minister relates more particularly to new companies in whose interests it has been submitted. It is also closely related to old established companies at present carrying on business, to which I referred when the measure was under consideration yesterday; but you, sir, in the exercise of your prerogative, ruled that my reference to them was not in order. The point upon which I wish to centre ministerial attention is, that the deposits which are about to be transferred to the Commonwealth authority must, in the case of old-established businesses, be given very careful consideration. For example, Western Australia - and for that matter other States - years ago took steps to ensure that the insurance companies carrying on business within their borders conducted their operations in a proper manner, by requiring from them the deposit of securities such as this bill contemplates. Those deposits have been in the care of the Governments of the States for years ; and meanwhile, from a variety of causes, they have shrunk in value. I should like an assurance from the Minister that those States who thus forestalled the federation will be given a fair deal, and that they will not be penalized by the taking over of these securities at a depreciated value. Boiled clown the position is, that unless provision is made to protect the States who so acted in the interests of policy-holders, the Commonwealth may - I do not say that it will - take over those securities at a value far below that which they enjoyed years ago. </para>

                    <para>.- On the first point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> I point out that in an insurance measure which reached a certain stage in this chamber on one occasion, and was passed through all stages on another, it was provided that new companies should deposit £2,000 annually until the sum of £20,000 had been deposited. As we are striving for something higher in the direction of safeguarding policy-holders, the committee might well accept the amendment, even though it may appear to honorable senators to give to new insurance companies an undue length of time to get on their feet. In the history of insurance, however, particularly in the case of well managed concerns, 40 or 50 years is merely a fraction of time. </para>

                <para>The responsibility of maintaining the value of the securities that will be lodged with the Commonwealth will not rest with the States, but with the companies which are now required to deposit them with the States. The States will merely have to hand over to the Commonwealth what they now hold, and any deficiency will have to be made good by the insurance companies concerned, up to the amount which they are liable to deposit. No injustice of any kind is contemplated in that or any other direction, so far as the States are concerned. </para>

                        <para>- A State cannot be mulct in any damages nor interfered with in any way. The securities are accepted by it at their face value. If their value has depreciated, that is not its fault. Should the Treasurer find, when they are handed over to the Commonwealth, that their value is insufficient to make up the amount which a company has to deposit, he will make a request for a further deposit. The only responsibility of the States will be to hand back what they have received. Whether the value is equal to, less than, or greater than what it was in the first place, will not affect the liability of the States in any shape or form. </para>

                    COLEBATCH (Western Australia) [11.38]. - Instead of amending the clause in the direction suggested, the Minister ought to move for the addition of a proviso covering the case of mutual companies. I quite see the force of
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott's</inline>
                    argument. Mutual companies, possessing only the money that is paid into them, cannot put up large deposits. But I cannot see any reason why companies that are promoted for private profit should not be compelled to put up deposits as substantial as those suggested in the bill. A good deal of harm has been clone in the not very remote past, as a result of the operations of life insurance companies which have been formed chiefly for the purpose of making a profit for the persons who promoted them. We shall take the risk of that sort of thing continuing if we fix the annual deposit at a sum which is purely nominal, such as £1,000. No hardship would be caused if the promoters of companies whose principal object is the making of profits were called upon to lodge substantial deposits. I consider that even the preliminary £5,000 is too small an amount in cases of that kind; and I certainly object to its being whittled down in this fashion. If the Minister will allow the clause to stand, with the insertion of a proviso that will lighten the burden in the case of purely mutual companies, I shall be pleased to support it.

I have had strong recommendations made to me concerning one or two small insurance companies- local State concerns - that will probably come into being. On the other hand, however, I have no objection to the suggested proviso if it meets the point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott;</inline> but I am not quite certain, from what he said yesterday, whether it would cover that class of company which he visualized, or some other company. Another distinguished gentleman named Elliott, who does not grace this chamber with his presence, has informed me that the application of this provision to mutual companies would practically mean the destruction of any possibility of further mutual companies coming into existence in this country; and he is no mean authority on insurance. Having regard to the provisions enacted elsewhere, I do not think we should insist upon the retention of the amount of £5,000; but if it is the wish of the committee, I shall have a proviso drafted along the lines indicated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch.</inline></para>

                    HAL COLEBATCH  (Western Australia) [11.43]. - I do not think it is a question of establishing monopolies. Mutual  companies  should be helped. But if any person commences the business of life insurance with the object of making a profit out of it, there ought to be the utmost limit of security for the policyholders. I go so far as to say that I would welcome the greatest possible difficulty being placed in the way of private profit being made at any time out of life insurance. No person should be allowed to establish a life insurance company for the sake of making private profit, without putting up such a deposit as would absolutely guarantee the insurer against the loss of his policy. We know that within the last few years people who have taken out life policies have lost them because of the instability of the company with which they were insured. It would impose no hardship on any combination of persons who desired to commence the business of life insurance for private profit, to compel them to put up a deposit of this kind. I hope that the Minister will not reduce the amount.

The very existence of a co-operative company alongside a privately-owned company keeps the latter up to the scratch, and induces it to give a fairer deal than it otherwise might give. Years ago I spent some considerable time on the gold-fields of Western Australia, and the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> will bear me out when I say that the premiums charged in those days by the people who carried on insurance there were simply outrageous. When at length the public became incensed and raised an outcry, the insurance companies reduced their premiums to something approaching reasonable figures. I remember when the rate on the gold-fields was 50s. per £100. Had co-operative concerns such as are contemplated by this amendment then existed the public would have had its choice of patronage. </para>

                        <para>- The conditions did not warrant the extraordinary high rates that were charged. When the outcry was made, the rates were reduced to 15s. or 18s. per £100 for the same class of risk on which 50s. was charged previously. They had been making a harvest beyond the dreams of avarice. I am a living witness of those times, as I had to pay the high rates for which the public was mulcted. It is time that the public interest was safeguarded against such cormorant companies, which are not satisfied with their pound of flesh, but want the whole animal. An amendment such as that suggested would give the needed encouragement to the establishment of co-operative concerns. You, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> know the advantage of a cooperative wheat pool, which is  on  all-fours with co-operative insurance company. I do not suggest that private concerns should be wiped out. It has been my fixed policy to have the two doors open, so that the public may make its choice.

                    <para>.- I sincerely hope that the Minister will take notice of the representations made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> with regard to life insurance companies. I place life insurance in a different category from fire, accident, marine, and other forms of insurance, for a person who takes out a policy on his life does so in the belief that when he passes over the Great Divide the amount assured will be paid to his dependants, to provide for their needs. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> pointed out, the position regarding life insurance companies has been very lax in New South Wales. There have been numerous instances where a person or a group of persons has rented an office, had a title painted on the windows, furnished the office with tables and chairs, and then set out to insure lives. They had no adequate reserve capital and, inevitably, the crash came. It is against that state of affairs that we must protect the people of the Commonwealth generally. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> claimed that he is a living witness of the extortionate rates charged by fire insurance companies on the gold-fields of Western Australia in the early days. 1 am a living witness of the methods of mushroom companies. With others, I took out a policy in such a concern. The crash came, and policy-holders did not receive 6d., although some of them had paid premiums on industrial policies for 30 years. I urge that we should not countenance any laxity with regard to the deposits that must be lodged by insurance companies. The regulations should be tightened as much as possible. I am against the diminution of the deposits as the years pass. It is essential that insurance companies should have the necessary assets to meet their obligations when policies mature. We must guard against what has so frequently happened in New South Wales. I urge the Minister not to recede one inch from his intention to specify an adequate deposit being lodged with the Government. </para>

                        <para>. - The criticism levelled against the proposals of the Government is of a very meagre type. It has been suggested that the Government is open to attack for the means adopted during the election campaign to secure the return of members of the United Australia party. Reference has been made to slogans and placards, and other efforts by various parties to draw the. attention of the voters to the fact that an election was in progress, and that certain parties were advocating certain principles, whilst other parties were advocating other principles. The present does not seem to me to be the time for that sort' of carping criticism, nor for recriminations. I should exceed the time allowed to me under the Standing Orders if I were to comment upon the promises that were made when the Scullin Government was swept into office on a wave of popularity and misplaced enthusiasm a little over two years ago. Such things are incidental to any appeal to a democracy. I feel, however, that at the last election the people generally were more in earnest about the future of their country. They seemed to have come to a realization of the position into which Australia had' been allowed tq drift through the lack of proper guidance by those in control of the parliamentary machine. It seemed to the great majority of the electors that the then Government was hopelessly afraid to meet the emergencies that had arisen. I venture to say that many of them were afraid to meet their own constituents. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>It has been suggested during the course of this debate that Ministers are erring in proposing to have a short session. One of the worst things in the interests of the country that the last Government did was to have long sessions of Parliament. It meant a neglect of administration. At no other time in the history of Australia has it been so necessary to exercise care in administration to bring about savings in public expenditure, to eliminate waste, and to harmonize the functions of Commonwealth and State Departments as it is to-day. Had the late Government devoted itself more intensely than it did. to such requirements, instead of skirmishing for political advantage, or inciting warfare between political parties, it would have served its country better. </para>
                    <para>The problems to be confronted to-day are of amazing importance. That this  i3  realized by some honorable senators who have spoken on the other side of the chamber is apparent. Nevertheless they seem to think that the parliamentary machine can function ; that Ministers can play their parts on this particular stage, and at the -same time carry on effective administration in the interests of the country. In my opinion Australia would be better served if, having got rid of such legislation as is urgent in the interests of sound finance and more effective administration, and after .having produced a balanced customs tariff, we went into recess. There -is a great deal more to- be  done outside the walls of this building. For instance the requirements of Empire unity and Empire trade are sufficient to absorb the time of all Ministers with commercial leanings or instincts. </para>

                            <para>- We shall get the first instalment of it, and if the honorable senator will possess his soul in patience he will get the balance. Ministers have not rushed in with a new schedule, which requires immediate alteration, as our predecessors did on more than one occasion. We believe that in its own interests the tariff requires the fullest consideration from many aspects. Certain things have arisen through the operation of the tariff. Before the Government can come to a decision, many features of the tariff must be examined in the light of the economic position of Australia. </para>

                    <para>During the regime of the late Government, honorable senators opposite felt that they were safer at Canberra than among their constituents, having regard to the fact that, during the election, they had been so lavish in their promises, which they must have known at the time they could not fulfil. The present Government promised nothing during the elections, except sane and honest administration, and an endeavour to rectify the unfortunate financial and economic position of the country. </para>
                    <para>With his usual geniality the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Barnes),</inline> said in effect that all that the Government's policy amounted to was to closeParliament as soon as possible. When the necessary legislation is passed, making the adjustments which are needed in the tariff, and enforcing the will of the honest majority of the people upon a minority who does not propose to be honest, the Government will be acting in the best interest of Australia if it devotes itself to two important issues, the holding of the Ottawa Conference, from which I hope not only Australia, but also the Empire will derive some benefit, and an endeavour to restore a measure of employment, which has been absent so long in this country. My friends opposite say that we should adopt the policy of the Labour party. To-day there is no logical ground for the existence of a Labour party. There are only two parties in Australia to-day which count, those that stand for some principle, and those who are distinguished by lack of principle. I do not class my friends of the so-called Labour party among the latter; but they or their predecessors of another party have given to the people a relief in the shape of social amelioration of their conditions, which is perhaps more than the country can at present afford. They have provided tribunals which have raised wages to an extent which it is very doubtful the country can afford to pay. If we have shared in this we must bear the blame with our friends opposite. That is why I say thequa-Labour party has no logical place in our legislatures  to-day. That is manifest from its decimated ranks, and from the limited support which it is getting from the constituencies. I have seen this coming. </para>
                    <para>My honorable' friends of the Labour party may be buttressed here and there by some measure of support in some particular State, but before long they will cease to exist as a party. The portcullis will fall behind them. Their only hope to secure themselves passed, when they failed to resist the intrusion of the red element in their midst. To-day the only party in Opposition with a policy, if it can be called such, is one led, bullied or bluffed by a politician who does not function in the Federal arena. It is a party which stands for dishonesty - at any rate that is its first plank - and its chief ally is Russia. The majority of its members preach the gospel of Russia, the dreary doctrines of Karl Marx. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> pointed out in his very eloquent speech the other day, the political doctrines so much favoured by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae,</inline> and those who think with him, represent merely an advanced system of chaos which, at varying periods in the history of the world has been tried and found wanting. At the present time this communistic scheme is in the crucible in Russia, and, I venture to say, even there it will fail eventually. We have heard much in recent years about the Russian five-year plan for the industrialization of that vast country. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> last week told us something of the appalling conditions under which its people are now living. A not inconsiderable proportion of the population is in a state of semi-starvation. A friend of mine, who recently travelled through Russian country, also told me a sad story. He endorsed all that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has said about the appalling distress which prevails on every hand, and remarked that while in that country he never saw a human being smile. Downtrodden as they might have been under the long regime of the Czars, life then was a joyous thing compared with the conditions of tyranny which they are. called upon to endure to-day. "Russia," he added, "is the saddest country in the world." </para>
                    <para>This revolutionary change in the social order has the public support of some honorable members opposite, but I am confident that if the others were to speak from their hearts, and it is time they did, they would be standing shoulder to shoulder with the party in office in this country and, in association with the Country party, by helping the Government to stem the tide of anarchy that threatens to overwhelm our civilization. The time will soon come when, from the already decimated ranks of Labour, some with greater courage than others, will step out into the open and declare, with us, that they stand for the right, that they are  opposed to a policy of lying and dishonesty which is abhorrent to every right thinking man and woman in the community and awakens a feeling of revulsion in every decent human being. </para>
                    <para>The task before us is an important one. First, we must put our economic house in order.  On this point I was much impressed with the remarks of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Dooley),</inline> who, apparently, now realizes that something is wrong; that all the talk that has been indulged in for nearly a generation about the rising standard of living, due to the payment of higher wages in industry, is so much thin air, and that after all, wages are only worth what they will buy. But there is no economic light in the mind of the honorable senator; he has not yet discovered the cause of the economic blizzard which is devastating Australia, in common with other countries. Had he done so, the honorable senator, like some of his colleagues, who have had longer experience in relation to finance, would have abandoned those of his Labour friends who have a kindly interest in communistic ideals. But it is not his habit to abandon any one. The honorable senator, to use his own language, I believe would prefer to stick to his " cobbers " right or wrong. One appreciates that admirable trait in his character, but <inline font-style="italic">.1</inline> remind him that there is such a thing as one's duty to one's country, and to civilization, and that if we are to restore the Commonwealth to a sound financial position, the honorable senator and his friends should come into line with the Government and its supporters. </para>
                    <para>This much desired co-operation of political parties is reported in many other countries where there is a genuine desire to avert the economic disasters that threaten the world. After every great upheaval, such as the Great War, there has been a corresponding fall in commodity values leading eventually to an economic and political crisis. If we care to delve into the history of civilization, and go as far back as historical records take us, we shall find that even in times when the world was much smaller titan it is to-day when trade and commerce was not developed to anything like the same extent, the people of all countries suffered, just as we are suffering, after every prolonged struggle - even after wars that were small compared with the tremendous convulsion in Europe a little more than a decade ago. We shall find that within a period of approximately ten years following such conflicts the world suffered economic and financial collapse not unlike that in which we now find ourselves. My honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly,</inline> will remember the Overend  and Gurney banking crisis in Great Britain which proved to be the forerunner of the financial earthquake which was felt a little later in the Mother Country. </para>
                    <para>The reason for these crises is not far to seek. War, as we have very good reason to know, apart from the destruction of human life, is most wasteful and destructive of the economic resources of  any country. Its sole purpose is destruction, annihilation. In. pursuit of it, warring nations use every weapon in their power, subject to the conditions imposed upon them by international convention, to destroy their foes. Finance is one of the principal weapons. So in the Great War, the Mother Country, to provide finance, indulged in inflation to such an extent that, in common with all the belligerent nations, it is suffering extraordinary hardships to-day. Money was obtained from any and every source; the whole of the nation's credit resources was utilized to provide money to carry the conflict to a victorious conclusion. Australia adopted the same methods. And now the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, forsooth, would cure the financial and economic ills from which we are suffering and which, as I have explained, are the effects of war-time inflation, by administering another dose of what he is pleased to term controlled inflation. That would inevitably lead to the economic destruction of this country. I invite honorable senators to study carefully the speeches and writings of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chas.</inline> Schwabb, the eminent multi-millionaire of, the United States of America, who, in 1919 and 1920, warned the people of America about what would happen as the result of the long drawn out conflict in Europe, and the policy of inflation which all belligerent nations had adopted. </para>

I do not know how much <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Schwabb</inline> made out of the war, but I have read his writings and his speeches. They are of absorbing interest. He was a multimillionaire before the outbreak of the war, and if he did make a million or so out of it, that is neither here nor there ; it is as nothing compared with the wisdom and foresight which he displayed in his addresses to brother' Americans and bankers concerning the position as he saw it a little more than a decade ago. The American bankers would not listen to his words of wisdom, nor would they heed the advice of British bankers, or any of the commercial leaders pf their own country. Instead, they went merrily on their way, inducing still further inflation of credit, and plunging countries deeper into the financial morass. Some countries have already taken steps to put their finances in order, but others, which have not been so prudent or wise, are endeavouring to circumvent this sane movement. The present world position is due to an over-expansion of credit during the war years, and to the non realization of the fact that the altered circumstances following the war demanded a changed financial policy. </para>

                    <para>The Economic Conference to be held at Ottawa in a few months' time will be one of the greatest gestures that could be made by the British Commonwealth of Nations. It is a gesture in which we should cooperate to the full in order to give a certain amount of relief at all events to the people of the British Empire. It is  a  movement to which all our energies, to the exclusion of everything, with the sole exception of urgent matters of finance, should be directed. In the decisions of that conference, we may find- an element of hope not only for Australia but for other portions of the Empire. We should approach the subjects to be dealt with at that important gathering, as I am sure we shall, with an open mind in an endeavour to advance the cause of civilization within the Empire, and also, with a view to assisting the wider interests throughout the world in the years to come. This is not going to he an easy matter. It is not to be the work of a day or of a year; but having regard to the economic conditions we have built up, should result in great benefit to the Motherland and to the dominions.

                            <para>- The adoption of such a plan would result in the ruin of Australia. As I see it the Lang plan is the plan of a " welsher ". It is the plan of a man who says that he is not going to pay, who intends to dishonour his obligations, and who violates every moral and legal edict. It is a plan that would lead this country to destruction and isolate it from those countries which believe in adopting an honest policy. Much has been said of the so-called Lang plan ; but no one appears to know exactly what that plan is. I do not think that even those who support it know what it means. I appeal to men with intelligence to ask themselves what the result would be if full effect were given to the so-called plan of the Lang party in New South Wales. . The Governments of the Australian States should deal with their creditors as honest men deal one with another. If the honorable senator who interjected owed me £5, I am sure that he would not say that as he was "hard up" he intended to pay me only £4 10s. He would pay up the full amount like a man. If honest individuals do that, governments should act in the same way. Why should not the Leader of the Government in New South Wales meet the position in an honorable way? If he did so, he would confer greater benefits upon those people whom be claims to be helping than he alleges to be doing by submitting proposals such as those embodied in his so-called plan of repudiation. </para>

                    <para>I have dealt with what I conceive to be some of the remedies for restoring financial stability in this country. There are others which could be applied. It is pitiful to see the conditions which exist throughout the Commonwealth. In travelling recently through the State which I represent - and I am glad to say with good results - I hoard of thousands of young persons going out into the world with no prospects whatever of securing employment. Are we to have a repetition of what has occurred in Great Britain? I say with bated breath that the payment of the dole in Great Britain has been one of the most soul-destroying acts ever undertaken. Are the young people in this country to be brought up in a similar atmosphere? Measures of relief must be afforded; let us face them fairly and frankly. Let me give honorable senators a true illustration of what is happening throughout the Commonwealth. I called on a banker whom I shall not name - he is not my personal banker - a few weeks ago, and in discussing my business, I asked him what were the possibilities of providing employment in the institution he is controlling. He said that he was  innundated  with requests from mothers and relatives of boys who had just left school. I informed him that he ought to be able to find employment for some of them. He assured 111 e that the institution of which he was the manager, and which was the smallest of its kind in that State, could employ twenty youths, but added " There is one thing I cannot do, I should have to pay these boys, just fresh from school, £75 a year to commence and their remuneration would have to be increased annually until they receive £252 a year." He said that he did not. mind employing the youths but he could not afford to pay them at the rate of £75 a year at the outset. He further said that, as youths who had just left school, they knew nothing of the duties they were expected to perform in. Quite naturally they had the minds of schoolboys. They had never had any commercial training. At the end of twelve months, he said, he would probably be able to retain the services of ten or twelve at the outside. He contended that he did not mind that number being retained at the rates mentioned, but the conditions of employment made it impossible. In that city alone, something like 400 youths could be taken from a state of idleness and given profitable employment, but for our arbitration laws which are far too rigid. The insurance companies are in a similar position. I read in a letter recently that at the end of the third year of service youths employed by insurance companies have to be paid £250 per annum. Can the economic conditions of this country stand that? I ask honorable senators opposite if it is not better for such youths to commence employment at £40 or £50 a year than to idle away their time, get into mischief and destroy their morale. </para>

                            <para>- After serving only three years in an insurance office a youth cannot possibly have a thorough knowledge of the intricacies of the business. Many of them are employed in writing up cash books, ledgers, journals or policy registers. Companies cannot afford to pay the salaries I have mentioned for work of that character. Such conditions have been brought under my notice within the la3t few days. It is the duty of governments to grapple with the situation. No one has supported arbitration more consistently than I have. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. It is one for which I have stood for 30 years. The action of honorable senators opposite and those with whom they are associated will inevitably destroy the groundwork of arbitration. Paid  claquers  are making jobs for themselves by agitating and bringing men before the court, instead of encouraging a system of conciliation between employer and employee. They are engines of destruction spreading such doctrines as the annihilation of private interests. It is well that we should know where we stand. We must shoulder our responsibilities, in order to relieve civilization, instead of giving any encouragement to those whose sole object is the destruction of property and capital. That system has already been tried with disastrous results. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> recently gave a dissertation upon the subject which should be beneficial to us all. </para>

                            <para>- While I stand, and always have stood, for the principle of arbitration, I desire to stress again the fact that various administrations in both the State and Federal sphere have been responsible for  tieing  up the economic position in such a way as to make it very difficult for the system of wage fixation in force in Australia to react to the benefit of the community, and particularly the unemployed members of it. In addition, those who have abused what I call the great principle of trade unionism have adopted methods that have not brought out what is best in arbitration. A considerable measure of relief could be given if there were some more elastic provision which would enable action to be taken speedily, such as is to be found in the judicial proceedings of the different courts of justice. It has been clearly demonstrated that the absence of this factor is preventing the employment of men at a wage which may be regarded as low but which, after all, is the only rate that can be -paid in this country to-day. I regard it as a sad commentary on our civilization and our methods that men should be wandering about this country, and be provided with the means of existence by the various State Governments or territorial authorities, when throughout the length and breadth of Australia there is scope for considerable improvement in a great deal of the cream of the countryside. There should be a little give and take, a little more of the spirit of com promise, conciliation and common sense, and a little less agitation on the part of the union organizer, who loses sight of the fact that h"e is not serving the best interests of the class he is paid to represent by insisting on conditions that cannot be conceded. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so. Take the country districts of Australia to-day. Where is the farmer or the grazier who can afford to pay the basic wage? Under the conditions that prevailed until the last few weeks, the payment of such a wage would have been, entirely uneconomic. Numbers of men are falling out of the ranks of trade unions and are free to make such contracts as they think fit. I suggest to the heads of trade unionism in this country, the big organizations, over one of which the Leader of the  Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Barnes)</inline> presides, that they should see to it that these conditions are relaxed, and that men are enabled to eke out an existence for themselves instead of living upon what a number of them object to strongly and were ashamed in the first place to take - the dole from the State or territorial authorities. </para>

                            <para>- There is room for them to-day in many of the country districts of South Australia. A little while ago men were afraid to advertise for labour because of the number of unemployed who sought engagement. During the recent harvest, however, that condition was for the time being absent, proving that there is economic employment available. Does the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Dooley)</inline> suggest that the countryside along the route from Melbourne to Albury is in a condition to give of its best in the way of production to those who hold it? Would it not be better if the Victorian Government, whose particular responsibility it is to look after these men, employed a number of them in the removal of fallen timber and the clearing of the dead timber that is still standing?. Would not that' ultimately benefit Australia? Even though the farmers were not able to contribute the full amount paid by the Government to these men, would it not be better for them to be employed at this work than to continue in idleness? </para>

                            <para>- It is not a question of what they can afford to pay. They may be able to pay very little. It is costing the governments of Australia something like £12,000,000 per annum to maintain the unemployed. I suggest, however, that we have to consider not only the amount of money spent in that way but also the absolute undermining of the morale of these people. Would it not be better for them to be employed at work of the description I have mentioned, even though they got only a bare living from it? Those who adopt the narrow view expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> might object that individual farmers would reap an advantage by having their land cleared for £1 an acre, and paying to the Government only 3s. or 4s. an acre. Even if that were so, would it not be of advantage to the country to have its productivity increased? </para>

                            <para>- There will always be a' market for what we produce, so long as we sell at the right price. The question is wholly one of price. I have known worse markets for some primary products than those that exist to-day. It is true that this country was not then burdened with a national debt of £1,150,000,000. I have seen wheat sold for less than it has brought during the present depression. I have seen full mouthed ewes without a broken tooth in their heads, and with five months wool, sold in the Burra yards for 9d. apiece. I have seen cattle sold for less than they are being sold to-day. This country surmounted those difficulties, and it will win through again if we only put our backs into our task. There was no preaching then of the doctrine of class hatred and the waging of war by one class on another ; the spirit of the times was co-operation, thrift, and the doing of everything possible to improve the condition of every class in the  community </para>

The organization of some movement to relieve the unemployed in the congested areas is called for very clamantly. We must get these men to work even if they only do something in the nature of what I have indicated. I believe that there is an element in this country which is prepared to assist in that direction. There will be cavilling, fighting, and quarrelling in certain activities, as there is in an activity with which I have to deal to-day, in which the men were told plainly that they must produce more or the activity would have to close. It is a moment of impetuosity, in language which I shall not repeat for fear that it might offend sensitive ears, they  expressed their determination not to continue their operations under those conditions, and walked out; but better counsels ultimately prevailed, and they walked back ; and they are now producing a quantity that for the moment is satisfactory to those who are in charge of the work. </para><interjection>

I am not altogether convinced that it is not in existence to a- certain extent to-day. Acts of Parliament will not feed' the people nor restore employment. There must be organization and an examination of the economics of this country. Action must be taken at Ottawa 'which will make markets available, even though the  prices  obtained for our surplus production may be low.

If we refrain from preaching against and denouncing those who lend -us money, and who in the past have enabled us to construct bridges, railways, and waterways and to improve the countryside in every direction, we might be able to obtain a certain amount of relief. But who overseas will provide that relief when they realize what doctrines are being preached and practised ? Who would say to New South Wales, " We will reduce your interest," when in that State nothing but hatred and malice are preached against those who have anything? It ought to be our solemn obligation to pay what we owe. I do not believe that the lender will prove to be a hard taskmaster when the time of renewal arrives, provided we comport ourselves with decency and honesty. The Government should seriously consider by what means the unemployed may be organized. It is not the work of a day or a month. Sporadic attacks were made upon the problem by the Scullin Government during its tenure of office. It spent a few pounds here and a few pounds there. There can be no real relief in that sort of thing; the problem must be tackled in an organized way throughout Australia. I have failed to find in the policy put forward by the late Government any basis upon which it attempted to deal with the unemployed. It ladled out a small amount at Cockatoo Island and on the coal-fields and shale oil-fields. </para><interjection>

I have first-hand knowledge of those conditions, and I know what it would mean if they were adopted in Australia.

                            <para>- My honorable friend is ever in a hurry. At one time I regarded him as being of a placid disposition. Perhaps we should take it as a compliment when he expects the successors of the Scullin Government to do in six weeks what that administration failed to do in two years. That Government staggered along, plugging a leak here, and plugging a leak there. I know that it had its difficulties internally, and I am inclined to forgive its members, because they know not what they do. They blundered along in a most ineffectual manner, doing nothing to solve the problems that confronted the nation. Their one. great effort was the Canadian treaty - -'and I believe that a Scotsman was responsible for that. </para>

The Government is dealing with the problem on a principle, and not leaving it to tie individual whim of a Minister or anybody else. The Tariff Board has been charged with certain duties, and I cannot accept the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carroll</inline> that that board should be substituted by another more comprehensive body, which would determine, instead of Parliament, the fiscal policy of the country. The reports of the Tariff Board will be examined and respected, and, should the necessity for further investigation arise, they will be referred back to that body. The policy of the Government has been clearly defined, and the first step taken towards carrying it to fruition. I commend the two schedules that were tabled yesterday to those honorable senators who seem to have made a somewhat wild forecast in some respects and a more accurate one in other respects. </para><interjection>

It has endeavoured to deal with the vexed problem of our railways. I know, from a conversation that I had with the ex-Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> that his Government had been seriously considering taking some move in this direction. Our railways represent one of the biggest economic problems with which we are confronted. For the year ended the BOth June last, our various systems showed an accumulated deficit amounting to £10,500,000. That cannot go on much longer, as the leakage endangers all of our social benefits. There are other activities besides our railways that are losing money, but the latter represent a particularly great leakage, and the hole must be at least partially stopped. I myself was rebuked by ex-Senator Needham when I expressed  the belief that it would have been better for the country if the railways had been privately owned. Those in the service of our railways, both Commonwealth and State, are living in dread of the future; they do not know what is going to happen. They know that the present condition of affairs cannot continue. A number have been rationed; many have been reduced and others dismissed. For the moment, there may be temporary relief in some States because the harvest has been above the average, but the problem demands immediate attention. </para><interjection>

There is work to be done by this Parliament, but let it be got over and let the Government get down to the solution of some of the problems confronting it. One thing more than another which made for the undoing of the Scullin Administration was the fact that it kept Parliament here too long. It never permitted itself to get down to any real administrative work. </para>

It is true that there is legislation to be passed, and it will be passed. But the discussions at Ottawa, with their repercussions, transcend in importance anything we may do in this country, and for those we should be prepared from every angle. The Ottawa Conference will be discussing, not only the relations between Great Britain and Australia, but also those between every unit of the Empire, including the Crown colonies. Its task will be a difficult one, hut never before has there been a better opportunity to lay the foundations of a successful and prosperous Empire. We should see to it that those foundations are well laid. </para>

I do not know how long their " hear, hears !" will continue, because I have no intention of promising what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> promised in his opening remarks. He said that he rose to carry on the debate without any feeling of partisanship and without discrimination. When he was saying it there came into my mind the picture of a man with the Eastertide spirit, who carried a Christian palm in the one hand and a brick or a bottle in the other. The honorable senator certainly laid aside the palm in the course of his speech and finished up by flinging verbal bricks all over the place. If he had continued, he would have felt like drawing a sword. He certainly advanced sound arguments from his own point of view and no doubt he is fully armed with every argument that serves the interests of the party he has represented in this chamber for so many years. </para>

                    <para>During the course of my remarks, I wish to deal with the situation, not only as we see it in New South Wales, but also from an Australian viewpoint. In my outlook I do not stop at the banks of the river Murray, although I was elected to this chamber as a representative of New South Wales. </para>
                    <para>I was rather intrigued by the few words with which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> admonished <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brennan,</inline> an eminent senator and a K.C. to boot, and the newly elected honorable senator from South Australia, my friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator DuncanHughes,</inline> with whom I am prepared to lock arms at any time, and upon whose views I should attempt to exercise no censorship. In moving the adoption of the Address-in-Reply, those honorable senators had chosen to find fault with the late Government's adoption of the principal of appointing an Australian as Governor-General. I was among the Scullin Government followers who sent to  His  Majesty the King a recommendation that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Isaac</inline> Isaacs should be chosen by him as Governor-General. I am not Australian born, but I have been in this country since I was fifteen years of age, and I see nothing against an Australian filling the position of Governor-General. The Scullin Government sent to  His  Majesty the King the recommendation that it had a man ready to fill the high and distinguished position of Governor-General in the person of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Isaac</inline> Isaacs, one of the greatest constitutional lawyers Australia has known, and I therefore appreciated the little political rap on the knuckles which the Vice-President of the Executive Council gave to my friends on the Government benches, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brenn</inline> an, K.C., and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes.</inline> I feel sure that the new senator from South Australia will take the lesson to heart. So far as the wisdom of appointing distinguished Australians to the position of Governor-General is concerned, I see nothing wrong with the policy of the past Government in that respect. </para>

                    <para>That is a laudable sentiment. One of the first steps taken by the new Ministers to bring about the economic rehabilitation of Australia has been to bring clown a long list of tariff amendments. It will react upon them. </para>
                    <para>During the election campaign we were told that if the United Australia party was returned to power it would provide a solution of our unemployment problem. At one time I was a follower of the Scullin Government in this chamber, and occupied the position of Government Whip. Later, because, with certain other honorable senators, I was prepared to put up a fight on behalf of the workers, I was expelled from the party. I now regret very much indeed that I was identified with a party that supported an administration which proved to be the most vacillating government that has ever occupied the treasury bench in this Parliament in the name of Labour. The Scullin Government, in furtherance of its policy to balance the budget dismissed no fewer than 8,000 employees of the Commonwealth, and cut down the social services of the nation. In fact the Scullin Government did the work of the previous government. I say without fear of contradiction that this Administration will take further similar action in the near future. I find my warrant for this statement in some remarks which fell from the lips of the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLachlan)</inline> only a few minutes ago. The honorable gentleman hinted that, in order to adhere to the rehabilitation plan, the social services of the Commonwealth would have to be re-examined. </para>
                    <para>The Speech also indicates that the Government contemplates another attack on the wages and conditions of the workers. I know that the Minister in charge of the Senate for the time being <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Greene)</inline> will not intimate, by way of interjection, what is in the Government's mind - he is too wily a politician to be taken unawares - but I invite him to do so. The Scullin Government, acting largely upon recommendations made by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Otto</inline> Niemeyer and Professor Gregory, two eminent representatives of the Bank of England, adopted the rehabilitation plan and made a number of drastic economies, including cuts in invalid and old-age and war pensions. During the war a man was provided with clothing, and was given a rifle and 250 rounds of ammunition with which to defend himself. Those who are in the firing line to-day in the greater economic war which is being waged on every hand have absolutely nothing with which to defend themselves, so they are powerless to withstand any demands for greater sacrifices which this Government may make. These additional sacrifices may take the form of a further reduction of our social services, or increased taxation, but as trade and commerce are strongly entrenched in this chamber there is little hope of the latter course being adopted. There are in the ranks of Ministers some members who are on the directorates of various large companies, while among its supporters are others who are closely identified with the pastoral industry. Accordingly we may assume that the Commonwealth will fall into line with other countries, and in its rehabilitation scheme, will make an attack upon the wages and conditions of the workers. </para>
                    <para>Recently the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> in an appeal to the people of Australia urged them to "tune in" with England, to follow Britain. That was a very laudable sentiment but since it was uttered, the British Government, under the leadership of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ramsay</inline> MacDonald, has become hopelessly divided on the tariff issue, "and England, with its vast army of 4,000,000 unemployed persons, is a sorry spectacle. I am convinced that when the people of Australia rejected the Scullin ministry they did so not so much because of their belief in the promises made on behalf of the United Australia party and the Country party, hut because they were determined to rid themselves of a government which had broken practically every definite pledge which it had made a year or two earlier. </para>
                    <para>I have said that this Government intends to cut down our social services in order to balance the budget. Its intention to do this was indicated by the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLachlan),</inline> who referred to the urgent need to bring about a reduction in costs, and incidentally he made an attack upon the judges of the Arbitration Court. When I was Government Whip, and attempted to criticize  His  Honour Judge Lukin, of the Bankruptcy Court, you, sir, quite properly called me to order. To-day the Vice-President of the Executive Council made a bitter attack upon the four arbitration judges. Apparently the arbitration system is to be subjected to an extensive overhaul by the present Cabinet. I feel sure that when the whip is cracked over the heads of Government supporters there will be something doing in this direction. </para>
                    <para>New South Wales is passing through a period of severe depression, but I am glad to say that we are still in a fighting position. Up to the present time, there has been no serious reduction in the basic wage nor has there been an increase in the hours of labour, and its social services are being maintained. To me it is extraordinary that honorable senators from other States who enjoy the social services provided by the Government of New South Wales are so ready to " knock " that State when they return to their own States. I have paid visits to other States and having enjoyed the social services provided by their Governments, have never stooped so low as to attempt to " knock " them upon my return to my own State. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mooney,</inline> who is now my colleague in this chamber, is with me in the determination to protect, so far as is within our limited power, the State of New South Wales from these interstate " knockers many of whom represent the mendicant States of Western Australia, Tasmania, and South Australia. Those States often appear before the Loan Council with, figuratively speaking, contribution plates attached to their breasts, pleading for financial assistance from the Commonwealth. </para>

It is to the solution of these two fundamental problems that you will be asked to direct your energies largely during the coming mouths. </para>

                            <para>- We should be represented, but preferably by a departmental officer fully conversant with the nature of the work to be undertaken. Could not Australia have been ably represented at the Disarmament Conference by the High Commissioner for Australia? The present occupant , of that position once represented the constituency of Warringah in another place, and as he was a distinguished general in the Australian Imperial Force, he should be more conversant with matters to be dealt with at such a conference than the Attorney-General whose knowledge of constitutional and legal matters will not be of great assistance to him. </para>

The Assistant Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> is also to make a visit to Ottawa, and later, to act as. Resident Minister in London. I do not know what duties he is expected to perform. The appointment of a Resident Minister in London is quite unnecessary. </para>

                    <para class="block">In what way have favorable results been achieved? Prior to the last general election, the members of the present Government said that if returned to power men would be placed in industry. How many men have been found employment since this Government assumed office? In a flamboyant article the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> writes " Thousands of boys are leaving school. What does Labour offer? More jobs will be available as soon as Labour is out of office. When Britain recently elected a United party Government there was an immediate and substantial increase in employment." That is not true. That story was written up by the section of the press which supports the United Australia party in this country. We have been informed that one of the first actions of the present British Government was to take 300,000 persons off the dole. By doing so, it placed them in a state of destitution, and they arc now depending upon charity. There is something wrong in the statement that " What Britain can do Australia can do ". </para>
                    <para>The Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett)</inline> has submitted a list of goods in respect of which prohibition of importations has been repealed. Included in this list are such items as manufactured tobacco, cigarettes, cigars, &amp;c. It would appear from the action of the Government in this respect that the policy of the previous Government has been repealed. What will be the attitude of the Country party, of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> B. Johnston is a member, and which was associated with the United Australia party during the elections, towards the Government's tariff proposals? </para>

                            <para>- Farmers who have been engaged in preparing land for the production of tobacco for over twelve months, now find, in consequence of the Government's tariff proposals, that their position is hopeless. Moreover, those engaged in the production of hops will now be compelled, to exercise their energies in other directions. When the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley)</inline> and I visited Tasmania a few weeks ago on a short holiday, we found that the firm of Henry Jones Limited, and others, were doing everything possible to encourage the cultivation of tobacco. At its own -expense that firm obtained the services of an expert from Victoria, who arranged for the distribution of tobacco plants to farmers in the Derwent Valley. The result of the action of the Government is that all that has to go. </para>

                            <para>- That may be so. The previous Government afforded the growers complete protection. I should like to know the attitude that honorable senators from Tasmania propose to adopt. At different times they castigated the last Government for doing what they considered was not the right thing in the interests of the farmers. We now have a so-called farmers' government in power ; it holds  office by  virtue of the support which it receives from the Country party; yet its first action is to stab in the back every tobacco-grower in Australia generally, and in Tasmania particularly. The firm of Henry Jones and Company has repeatedly proved a very good friend to the small orchardist and farmer in Tasmania, including the hop grower. By one vicious act of administration, the Government has declared war, not only on the tobacco-growing industry, but also upon the farmers of Tasmania, who are engaged in that occupation. Shame on it, I say. I do not wish to make any accusation; but there must be something wrong when it is left to me to fight for the rights of the farmers of a small State which is not represented by me, without receiving any support from those honorable senators who are sent here t'o look after their interests. My friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson,</inline> has charged me with having an evil mind. Does he regard as the product of an evil mind the statement that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beading,</inline> one of the directors of the Commonwealth Bank Board, is also a principal director of the British- Australasian Tobacco Company? I ask leave to continue my remarks at a later date. * </para>

                    <para>. - During my temporary absence from the chamber on official business, I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline> suggested that in the course of my speech on the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply. I attacked the judges of the Arbitration Court. The honorable senator either must have spoken in the heat of the moment, or did not express himself quite plainly; or he misunderstood what I said. You, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> would not allow such an attack to be made by me ; and I did not intend to, nor did I, make it. What  I  said was that the arbitration system had become so tangled that it was difficult for any government to make it function in such a way as to enable speedy relief from existing conditions to be given. Nothing was further from my mind than to make an attack on the judges of the Arbitration Court. If  I  left that impression on the minds of honorable senators,  I  regret it. </para>

                    <para>. - I welcome the assurance that has been given by the Minister. I felt certain at the time that he did not mean to attack the judges of the Arbitration Court, hut if he will read the proof of his speech, he will find that there is some justification for the interpretation placed upon his remarks. He certainly left on the minds of honorable senators on this aide of the chamber, the impression that, through the action of the judges of the Arbitration Court, industry had been imperilled. He quoted the example of an arbitration award having provided a wage of  £252  a year for a youth. The principles of wage fixation are enunciated by the judiciary. </para>

                        <para>- That is not so. The Minister is absolutely in error in that assumption. This Parliament has no power to fix a basic wage, or to prescribe any wage, or lay down any conditions. All that we have is the right to set up a tribunal, which in turn lays down principles, upon which basic and other wages are fixed. Calling in question the fixation of a basic wage of  £252  is criticism of the particular body responsible for the fixation of that wage. I am certain that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> would be one of the  last  men to criticize the judiciary. I am convinced that what he had in mind was the whole system, and not any portion of it. </para>
