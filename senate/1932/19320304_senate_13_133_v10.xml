A conference is now being held in Melbourne between the representatives of the States of South Australia and Victoria on this subject, and I am informed that a representative of Western Australia is also on his way to attend the conference, with a view to drafting uniform State legislation which, while not going as far as the honorable senator has indicated, will give protection under State laws. The recommendations of the conference  will be forwarded to me before the amending bankruptcy bill leaves this chamber. </para>

            </quote>
            <para class="block">The Government appreciates the significance of those qualifications. If a State fails to meet its obligations, the Commonwealth is absolved from the performance of its undertaking. That is to say, the liability of the Commonwealth is a contingent liability. With respect to the moneys lent by bondholders to the States, the right of the bondholders is to look to the borrowing States for payment. Such bondholders have no right of action against the Commonwealth. </para>
            <para>Now that one State has defaulted in its obligations, the credit of the whole of the Commonwealth has been imperilled. This bill is designed to repair the damage to our national good name, and I hope, therefore, that every honorable senator will support it. Under the provisions of this measure the Commonwealth, which, as I have stated, is under a contingent liability with respect to certain State debts, assumes an absolute liability in that respect. The bill specifically declares that any bondholder shall have the right to sue the Commonwealth in the High Court in respect of any payment due under a bond. It places the bondholder, whose faith has been so rudely shaken by the default of New South Wales, in an unassailable position. In addition to the right which he has always had - that of looking to the States for payment - he is given the additional security of this Commonwealth statute, under which the Commonwealth undertakes the full responsibility for payment. The necessity for the restoration of financial confidence has been repeated many times. In -this bill definite action to restore that confidence is taken. I commend the measure to the Senate, and I feel sure that it has the full approbation of the people of Australia. </para>

                    <para class="block">Most honorable senators are familiar with the history of the proposed standing orders. They originated from a select committee which was appointed by the Senate to ascertain how the Senate could best adapt its procedure and its committees so that it would have some means of keeping a check upon the regulations and ordinances which are promulgated from time to time. The standing orders which are now proposed are the result of the labours of that select committee, and the subsequent consideration of its recommendations by the Senate and the Standing Orders Committee of the Senate. The committee will notice that this standing order suggests a method of choosing the seven senators who will constitute the committee. It is proposed that the Leader of the Government in the Senate shall, within four sitting days after the commencement of the session, nominate four senators to he members of the committee. </para>
                    <para class="block">As there are on the Government side of the House members of two political parties, who usually support the Government - the United Australia party and the Country party - I assume that the Leader of the Government would see that both parties were represented on the committee. Similarly there are also two sections sitting in opposition; and I assume that the Leader of the Opposition would, in making his nominations, see that each of them was represented on the committee. In appointing sessional committees that procedure has generally been adopted ; we have attempted to recognize the various sections of the political parties as they are represented in this chamber. The proposed new standing order provides that nominations shall be submitted within four sitting days after the commencement of the session. Obviously, that cannot be done this session, because we have already sat more than four days. I assume that it would be a compliance with the standing order if the nominations were made within four days of the adoption of this new standing order. It will be an innovation in the Federal Parliament, and the result will be watched with interest. There is scope for much useful work to be performed by the committee. I commend the new standing order to honorable senators. </para>

All that he said was correct,  more especially his remarks relating to the allocation among the various parties of positions on the committee. The proposal has much to recommend it; indeed, much time and argument would have been saved had such a standing order been in operation in past years. I hope that the proposed new standing order will receive the unanimous endorsement of honorable senators. The task now before the committee automatically divides itself into three parts. First, there is the consideration of the rules guiding the appointment of a standing committee, and the provision for the appointment of other standing committees, if deemed desirable. Secondly, there is the consideration of regulations; and, thirdly, the method of referring bills to select committees or standing committees. I cordially endorse the remarks of the Loader of the Government, and I hope that the Senate will be unanimously in favour of the motion. </para>

                    <para class="block">It would appear that no difficulty is likely to arise in the appointment of the committee iu the future; but, as already more than four sitting days have elapsed since this session commenced, the Senate will be debarred from appointing such a committee this session unless the proposed new standing order is amended. The position may be covered by some standing order already in operation with which I am unacquainted, but I think that the paragraph should be amended to read : " The Leader of the Government in the Senate shall, within four sitting days after the first adoption of this standing order, and on all subsequent occasions within four sitting days after the commencement of the session nominate in writing, addressed to the  President,  four senators to be members of the Committee ". The paragraph in its present form would, as I have said, appear to debar the appointment of such a committee during this session. </para>

The Senate, which is master in its own house, can, either by leave, or more properly, by motion, under the new standing order when, it is adopted, act in the manner desired. The difficulty, if there is one, can easily and properly be overcome in that way. </para>

                        (Western Australia) [11.36  1.  - Honorable senators are aware that the object of the proposed new standing order is to arm the Senate with the power to review regulations which are tabled from time to time, frequently in very large numbers. When the?  chairman  of the select committee appointed to inquire into thes subject was explaining the substance of the committee's report,  he pointed to the practice of legislation by regulation which has grown up in Great Britain, and to which public attention has been directed by the Lord Chief Justice of England, Lord Hewart, in his work entitled

                        "Whether we shall arrive at the. same state of affairs remains to be seen. It has been mentioned from time to time that the power of Parliament has gradually been taken away under the authority given to governments in the matter of making regulations. In some instances measures have been passed in a skeleton form, and the regulations framed under them have never been properly considered by Parliament. This proposal is an endeavour to give to Parliament an opportunity to more closely study the regulations which, after all, are an integral part of the legislation passed by Parliament. The new standing order provides that the Leader of the Government in the Senate shall, within four sitting days after the commencement of the session, nominate four senators to be members of the committee. It is customary for such committees to be appointed at the commencement of a session. Usually, the work of a parliament is divided into three sessions; but, as honorable senators are aware, one of our sessions covered 27 months. I think that the paragraph should be amended to read, "at the commencement of each Parliament," or that we should insert some such words to more precisely determine the period intended.

                    <para>Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> provides that the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate shall, within four sitting days after the commencement of a session, nominate three senators to be members of the committee. When this report was drafted, the committee had in mind that, following traditional practice, there would be only one party in opposition. To-day there are two parties in opposition in this chamber, and we have not yet been informed who is actually the leader of one of them, or of the political differences which separate them. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> is recognized as the leader of one party in opposition; but, up to the present, we have not been told who leads the other party. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn,</inline> whom I find it difficult to follow owing to his polished Oxford accent, may have announced at some time, that he leads that party. If he has, I feel sure that he will pardon me for having overlooked the fact. When this report was tabled the Opposition comprised only one party, but now it consists of two.. How are we to designate the second party in opposition? </para>

Perhaps the difficulty could be overcome by inserting in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> the words, " the several leaders of the Opposition in the Senate ".. Two years ago no one dreamed that there would now be two parties in opposition, and it is quite possible that, before long, there may be a third party, the members of which will still call each other comrades.

This matter concerns all parties, including that of which he is a member. I want him to tell us how we may overcome the difficulty with which we are confronted. The Senate has always been remarkable for its special ability to surmount difficulties. Here we have a little difficulty that will tax the ingenuity and ability of the several parties in opposition. I am awaiting a clarification of this very difficult problem. The necessary talent is present, and honorable senators want to see it put to this useful purpose. I apologize if it is thought I am wasting the time of honorable senators; but I considered it was necessary to point a way out of the difficulty. We are in a maze, and cannot see the light. We are at a dead end. We do not want a report to be published throughout Australia that this chamber cannot manage a little difficulty of this sort. Judging by the nature of the language that the two branches of the present Opposition have used towards each other in the past, the Chino-Japanese war may be only a small circumstance compared with what might happen if they came to close grips. For the present I shall subside and await a manifestation of the higher intelligence of the gentleman whom I have named. </para>

                            <para>- The Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> who by a turn of the political wheel, has again been elected to represent the State of Western Australia in this chamber, has just given an assurance to honorable senators that the various political groups in this chamber will be accorded their due recognition. It is known that there are four distinct political groups in the Senate. One, the United Australia party, has control of the treasury bench. Then there are the Country party and the two Labour groups which sit in opposition. It is true, as the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Dooley)</inline> has asserted by way of interjection, that I and those who sit with me are break-away from the party to which he belongs. We make no apology on that account. The New South Wales section of the Federal Labour party could no longer follow that party. </para>

                        <para>. -  The committee should not adopt the proviso without mature consideration. During the last Parliament certain difficulties arose because of the attempt by the Opposition to thwart the Government with regard to the making of certain regulations. Any similar difficulty in future will be overcome by the appointment of the proposed standing orders committee. That body will be properly representative of the Senate, and following the usual practice the Government representatives on it will be in the majority. If it functions as expected, it will overcome any difficulty such as that which occurred during the last Parliament, and possibly it will obviate the need for this proviso. The standing order enunciates a principle which should be maintained by this Parliament, namely, that questions once having been finally disposed of shall not be raised again and again in the same session. The proposed standing orders committee will take the consideration of all regulations and ordinances out of the hands of the Senate, because I cannot visualize this chamber disallowing regulations or ordinances that have received the endorsement of the proposed committee, and, on the other hand, I cannot visualize the Senate approving of regulations or ordinances which are disapproved by the committee. The adoption of the proviso may weaken an otherwise vital and valuable principle enunciated in the standing order. </para>

                        <para>. -  I hope the committee will adopt the suggested proviso, and that the new standing order will be enforced until its place is taken by direct legislation, either by an amendment of the Acts Interpretation Act, or in some other way. The position which arose during the last Parliament could not have been foreseen by the framers of our laws, otherwise there is no doubt whatever that they would have made provision for it. There is very good reason why the amendment should he adopted, because, after all, it is only a standing order, and if there is any possibility - I do not think there is - of a recurrence of the regrettable incidents of last session, action can be taken under it pending the passage of direct legislation. </para>

                        PEARCE (Western Australia - Minister for Defence) [12.22].  -  I do not feel satisfied with the form in which those proposed new Standing Orders, 195a and 195b, have been presented. I have had them submitted to the draftsmen, and I think it is possible to express the intention in simpler language.
                    </para>
                    <para class="block">I, therefore, suggest that the following new standing orders be substituted for the two recommended by the committee : -  195a. A bill having been read a second time shall, unless otherwise ordered, be considered in a committee of the whole Senate. 195b. Notice of motion that the second reading of a bill be <inline font-style="italic">pro forma,</inline> in order that the bill may stand referred to a specified select committee or standing committee, shall be given either at the time of fixing the date for the second reading of the bill or not less than two clear sitting days before that date. 195c.

                    <para class="block">There is no ambiguity in the language of these proposals. If the Government brings forward a bill and it is not desired to refer it to a select committee, the Minister may proceed with his second-reading speech. Under the committee's proposal the Minister is assumed to know what is in the minds of honorable senators, but actually, he may not know of a desire to have a bill referred to a select committee. I believe the recommendations submitted by the Standing Orders Committee will be found to be unworkable. I do not care to move for the substitution of the proposals which I have indicated, but if some honorable senator will move the adoption of the recommendation of the Standing Orders Committee, I shall move an amendment to omit all the words after " shall " in proposed new Standing Order 195a, with a view to insert the words " unless otherwise ordered be considered in a committee of the whole Senate." If that amendment is carried, I shall move to omit proposed new Standing Order 195b, with a view to inserting the proposed new standing orders which I have read. </para>

                        <para>. -  This proposed new standing order has been working satisfactorily for many years in New Zealand. While it may not be expressed in the best form, it would only have been courteous if the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> had referred his proposals to  the Standing Orders Committee, and given that body an opportunity to consider and compare them with its recommendations. There is no doubt whatever that in certain circumstances, Senate procedure may be seriously hindered under our existing Standing Orders. Honorable senators may not be aware of it, but during the second reading of the Central Reserve Bank Bill, there occurred a hiatus which had to be provided for in a manner not laid down in our Standing Orders, to permit the Senate to return to the discussion of the bill on the second reading. The intention of these proposed standing orders is to prevent the practice of moving that a bill be referred to a select committee or a standing committee until the second reading has passed, either <inline font-style="italic">pro forma</inline> or in some other way. Then there is another difficulty. It has arisen because of the abolition from the Standing Orders of the Senate, of one stage of a bill which exists, so far as I know, in the majority of English speaking Parliaments. Immediately the second reading of a bill is concluded in either House, a motion is made by the Minister in charge of the measure, that the  President,  or  Speaker,  as the case may be, do now leave the Chair, and that the House do now resolve itself into a committee of the whole for the consideration of the bill. That is the proper stage for moving that it be referred to a select committee or a standing committee. Under our present Standing Orders, the only stage at which this may be done is on the second reading, which is absurd. I am unable at the moment to grasp the full meaning of the. right honorable gentleman's proposed amendment. I suggest that we report progress, and ask leave to resume the debate on the next day of sitting, so that in the meantime I, as  Chairman  of the Standings 'Orders Committee, and other honorable senators, may have an opportunity to consider his proposal. </para>

For the guidance of the committee, I point out that if we adopt the proposed Standing Order 195b, we shall find it unworkable, whatever its intention may be. When a government introduces a bill it may have no knowledge of 'any intention on the part of a section of the Senate to refer it to a select committee. The proposed standing order proceeds on the assumption that every one knows of the intention to refer the bill to a select committee, or not to do so. It provides that " the second reading may be moved <inline font-style="italic">pro forma."</inline> I take it that that provision is made to meet cases in which it is known that it is intended to refer the bill to a select committee. But what is the position if that intention is not known? Where that intention is known, the proposed standing order provides that there shall be no speech by the mover arid no debate. There is a proviso that " notice of intention to move <inline font-style="italic">pro forma</inline> must be given either at the time of fixing the date for second reading, or not less than two clear sitting days before the date fixed foi- second reading, the same to be notified on the notice-paper." That can only mean that a bill is introduced one day with the intention of the second reading being moved the following day. Honorable senators may not see the bill until its introduction, yet they have to give r.wo clear sitting days' notice if they desire to refer it to a select committee. They cannot give notice of their intention until the following day. The proposed new standing order would prove unworkable in practice. Is the mere giving of notice sufficient to make the second reading of a bill <inline font-style="italic">pro forma</inline> If that is to be the position, what a splendid weapon will be placed in the hands of an alert Opposition; merely by giving notice, it will make the second reading of a bill <inline font-style="italic">pro forma</inline> ! Why cannot we say, in plain English, what we intend? F am not concerned with what has been done in New Zealand or elsewhere. It may be the practice adopted in New Zealand rather than the wording of their Standing Orders which is satisfactory. If the practice there is sound, by all means let us follow it; but why not express what we mean in plain English? In order to enable the Standing Orders Committee to consider this matter in the light of the suggestions that have been made, I suggest that we now report progress. </para>

                    <para class="block">I propose briefly to sketch the history leading up to the position in which we find ourselves in regard to the very important subject of the financial relationship of the Commonwealth and the States. First of all, the Financial Agreement, dealing with the transfer of debts, the creation of sinking funds, future borrowing, and incidental matters was agreed to by the Governments of the Commonwealth and the six States in 1927. Subsequently, the Commonwealth Parliament, and every State Parliament, passed financial agreement bills in which the Financial Agreement appeared as a schedule. A bill providing for the necessary amendment of the Federal Constitution was passed by an absolute majority of both Houses of the Federal Parliament, and subsequently, in accordance with the constitutional provision, it was referred to the people, and adopted in every one of the six States. I think it desirable to remind the Senate of this history, because there appears to me to be a disposition in certain quarters to try to make it appear that the Financial Agreement had its origin solely in an act of the Commonwealth Parliament. </para>
                    <para>After that agreement had been arrived at, its provisions and the provisions of the draft bill were subjected by every State Government to the scrutiny of its Crown Law officers, so that presumably each State Government was at pains to see that the rights of the State were fully conserved before it asked the Parliament of the S tate to give legislative concurrence to it. So far as I know, no other bill enacted in the history of federation has ever had to pass such a gruelling test as that to which this particular legislation was submitted. </para>
                    <para>Let us now see exactly what alterations we have made in the Constitution as it existed before 1927. Section 105 provides - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>The Parliament may take over from - the States their public debts as existing at the establishment of the Common wealth, or a proportion thereof according to the respective numbers of their people as shown by the latest statistics of the Commonwealth, and may convert, renew, or consolidate such debts, or any part thereof; and States shall indemnify the Commonwealth in respect of the debts taken over, and thereafter the interest payable in respect of the debt shall be deducted and retained from the portions of the surplus revenue of the Commonwealth payable to the several States, or if such surplus is insufficient, or if there is no surplus, then the deficiency or the whole amount shall be paid by the several States. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>That was altered in 1910 by the deletion of the words " as existing at the establishment of the Commonwealth " to enable the debts to be taken over up to that period. The alteration made as a result of the Financial Agreement in 1927 was inserted in 1929 by Act No. 1 of that year. That amendment was of a vital and far-reaching character, and I venture to say that a great many persons in the Commonwealth who have been talking on the subject have never studied the alteration then made or they would not speak as they do. </para>

                            <para>- I am coming to that. That was not the only undertaking he gave. At that time, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> undertook also tq adhere to the Premiers plan to reduce the adjustable expenditure of his Government by 20 per cent., and to meet all future interest payments as they became due. The circumstances in connexion with ' the second default are these : When the Loan Council was meeting in - Melbourne in January last, statements submitted by the New South Wales Government revealed that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> had not kept his promise regarding the Premiers plan, since he had not reduced his adjustable expenditure by 20 per cent. On this occasion he gave the Commonwealth Government only one day's notice of his proposed default. He asked the Commonwealth Government to find the sum of £500,000 at one day's notice, undertaking himself to make available £45S,000, making a total of £958,000, which apparently was due and payable on the following day by the State of New South Wales. The Commonwealth's contribution to interest on debts of the State under the Financial Agreement is £7,584,912 annually; the States provide the balance of the interest payments due on their debts. The £500,000 which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> asked the Commonwealth Government to find was no part of this sum of £7,584,912. </para>

                    <para>We have now to deal with the power vested in this Parliament to enforce the Financial Agreement, and honorable senators are asked to consider what I think can accurately be described as the most vital legislation ever brought before this Parliament. It is without precedent. The situation which has arisen as a result of the default of the Lang Government of New South Wales is also without precedent. The direct issue involved is the financial stability of Australia, and this Government proposes to take the most summary steps to preserve that stability. I remind honorable senators that that was the mandate which we received from the people of Australia at the last general election. </para>
                    <para>I have already recapitulated the main features of the Financial Agreement. I shall now proceed to outline the provisions of the bill. Honorable senators will then be in a position to appreciate the reasons which I shall advance to show how imperative it is to place such drastic legislation on the statute-book at the earliest moment possible. </para>
                    <para>It is advisable, I think, to refer to the fact that joint annual contributions by the Commonwealth and the States are to be made to a sinking fund, for the purpose of finally repaying the sums which have been borrowed. </para>
                    <para>At the present juncture, the crux of the matter is the payment of interest. I may here appropriately mention, that interest amounts to £55,000,000 per annum - which is, I think, prima facie evidence that there was never any intention between the contracting parties that the Commonwealth should undertake the responsibility of raising this sum from revenue. </para>
                    <para>Clause' 2 <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of Part III. makes it quite clear -that the Commonwealth is to raise approximately £7,500,000 in respect of State debts, and that the States shall provide the balance in respect of their liability as set out in clause 2 c, which reads as follows : - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>Each State shall in each year during the same period of 58 years pay to the Commonwealth the excess over the amounts to ho provided by the Commonwealth under the last preceding sub-clause necessary to make up as they fall due the interest charges falling duc in that year on the public debt of that State taken over by the Commonwealth as aforesaid and then unpaid, and on any moneys borrowed by the Commonwealth on behalf of that State and then unpaid, and after the expiration of the said period each State shall in each year pay to the Commonwealth, as they fall due, the whole of the interest charges on any debt then unpaid and included in the public debt of that State .taken over by the Commonwealth as aforesaid, and <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> any moneys borrowed by the Commonwealth on behalf of that State and then unpaid. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>Borrowings since the agreement came into force have been made by the Commonwealth, and are primarily a Commonwealth responsibility. This, though not relevant to the present default by New South Wales, is important in considering the bill with reference to the future; because, as State loans fall due for payment, bonds under any consequential conversion loan will be a Commonwealth liability. That matter is dealt with in the bill, the second reading of which I moved earlier in the day. </para>
                    <para>The problem now to be solved is, in what manner shall the Commonwealth protect itself and the rest of the States in the event of default by one State? In the ordinary contingencies of civil life, the process of the courts for the enforcement of a debt is satisfactory and suitable, but it was not designed to meet cases such as we are now considering. The difficulty in taking proceedings is great, an immediate decision cannot be obtained, and the final step - that of seizing the debtor's property and selling -it - is impracticable in the case of States. In fact, section 65 of the Judiciary Act prohibits process, such as attachment or execution, against the Commonwealth or the States. We have to face an extraordinary situation, which demands a drastic remedy. </para>
                    <para>The obligations under the Financial Agreement must be fulfilled. We propose that in any specific case the High Court shall determine what obligations remain unfulfilled, and that the Commonwealth shall, after taking certain procedure, receive specified revenues of the defaulting State. </para>
                    <para>Very clear and simple provision is made for the collection of such revenue. In outline, it is as follows: - </para>

                    <para>The proposed method of approach to the High Court is simple and expeditious.. It will be founded on a certificate furnished by the Auditor-General that there is a sum of money owing and  unpaid  to the Commonwealth by a State under the Financial Agreement. The certificate will be published in the Commonwealth <inline font-style="italic">Gazette,</inline> and the Treasurer may then apply to the High Court for a declaration that the sum mentioned in the certificate, or any lesser sum, is due and owing. The certificate will be prima facie evidence of the matters mentioned in it. It is open, of course, to the State to bring evidence in rebuttal, but it is obvious that such evidence would arise only from a miscalculation or a clerical error. The declaration of the High Court will have the force of a judgment. </para>
                    <para>The final step in procedure is a resolution of both Houses of the Parliament, applying the machinery, to which I hav referred, to revenues of the State as specified in the resolution. The time during which" such revenue will be collected will be commenced, and later determined, by proclamation. Alternative urgent machinery is provided, by which Parliament may, by resolution of both Houses, after a certificate by the Auditor-General, put into operation the machinery provisions for the collection of revenue pending the declaration of the High Court. </para>
                    <para>Provision is also made to prevent further loan moneys from, being paid to a defaulting State. There is, of course, provision for the adjustment of accounts, if revenue is collected in excess of the debt due by the State. Finally, there is power to call on any bank holding State funds for the payment of such amount of those funds as the Treasurer demands. </para>
                    <para>Two other matters may be referred to in passing. The bill, as amended by another place last night, now contains a clause limiting the operation of the act to a period of two years. It is the intention of the Government that, well before the expiration of that period, the representatives of the States shall be called together to consider this legislation. It is probable that, when that meeting takes place, we shall have, had some experience of the working of the act. In any event, it is highly desirable - in fact, essential - to have on the statute-book some permanent legislation that will enable the Commonwealth to enforce the Financial Agreement. In the light of that experience, and after there has- been consultation with the States before the expiry of the fixed period of two years, the Commonwealth Government will determine whether legislation of this character, or any amendment thereof, shall be brought forward as the permanent legislation dealing with these contingencies. </para>
                    <para>There is also provision that, where advantage is taken of the urgent procedure, the Attorney-General must apply to the High Court for a declaration of the amount due. As the bill was originally presented in another place, it was optional whether the Attorney-General applied to the High Court or refrained from doing so. Now the provision makes it compulsory for him to apply. In addition, a State is given the power to institute proceedings contesting its liability. </para>
                    <para>It is interesting to turn to the provisions of Act No. 48 of 3927 of the State of New South Wales, the short title of which is "The Loan Act 1927". Section 3 of that act authorizes the raising of sums of money not exceeding £5,922,400, by the issue of debentures or stock, secured upon the Consolidated Revenue Fund. I understand that those terms are common to the legislation of all the States, which authorizes the raising of money by way of loan. </para>

                        GEORGE PEARCE.This is interest. It is obvious why that should be so. When a person raises money privately he has to furnish -some security. Trie State of New South Wales cannot pledge the whole or any part of its railways or its harbour bridge; therefore it. pledges its public revenues. Section 8 of the act to which I have referred, provides that where treasury bills have been issued the interest on such bills shall be chargeable on and payable out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund.
                    </para>
                    <para>I invite the attention of honorable senators to one item in the schedule of works enumerated at page 448 of this volume of the New South Wales statutes for 1927 ; it is " Sydney Harbour bridge, further sum', £531,000". It is obvious that the bondholder could not proceed to sell one-eighteenth part of the Sydney Harbour bridge for the purpose of recovering what was due to him; nor could he ask the court to hypothecate any portion of the sixpenny toll which I understand the Government of that State proposes to levy for the purpose of defraying the annual expenditure on the bridge. The only way in which, as a practical fact, the debt and .the interest thereon can be met is by the hypothecation of the revenues of the State. I am not suggesting, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> that it is the interest on that particular loan which New South Wales is not now paying; but I do say that it is the interest on loans with respect to which the New South Wales Parliament made that exact provision. The legislation that we are now asking the Commonwealth Parliament to pass merely carries out what the New South Wales Parliament and the law passed by it says should be carried out, namely, the hypothecation of the revenues of New South Wales to meet the interest on loans raised by that State on the undertaking given by the law which I have quoted. The bill merely proposes that the Commonwealth shall obtain possession of revenues which, under the State act, is charged with the payment of the debt - a State act which, I suggest, the State Government is disregarding. </para>
                    <para>I am not unaware that serious -doubt has been cast upon the validity of provisions contained in this bill. I assure the Senate, however, that the Government has gone to considerable pains to secure the best guidance possible in that regard, and has obtained the advice of eminent counsel concerning the provisions of the bill. </para>

                    <para>Let me examine the question of the ' rights of the States. I am a representative of the State of Western Australia. That State has certain rights. For instance, if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> is allowed to default in his interest payments the taxpayers of Western Australia will have to pay taxation to make up, not only the interest due on their own indebtedness, but also a share of the interest due on the indebtedness of New South Wales. Surely it is a right of Western Australia to see that, each other State meets its own interest payments so that Western Australia will not have to help to make good the default of another State. How can it protect itself in this respect? It may be said that it has a right of action in the High Court. I doubt very much if it would be satisfied with that recourse, because the length of time that  would elapse before it could assert its rights would bo rather appalling.Western Australia, however, some years ago, agreed that something should be put into the Commonwealth Constitution to protect its rights in these matters. As one of the six States, by its own legislation, and by the will of a majority of the people of the State expressed at a referendum, it secured the insertion in the Constitution of a provision giving power to the Commonwealth Parliament to enforce the Financial Agreement. That is where the rights of Western Australia under the Financial Agreement repose to-day. </para>

My view may not be a good law, but it is at any rate, common sense. There are, however, several legal men in this chamber, and I leave the point to them. I do not propose to say anything further at this stage. </para>

The arguments used during the debate on the legislation now before this chamber may or may not be founded on counsel's opinions, but the opinions themselves are at the moment the property of the Attorney-General.
