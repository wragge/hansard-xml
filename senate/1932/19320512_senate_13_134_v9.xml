                    <para>. - Yesterday I asked the Minister to postpone clause 17 in order that he might again examine it. The result of subsequent discussion in the Senate confirms my opinion that that course should be followed. The Minister has suggested that theclause should be recommitted, but I point out that if honorable senators vote for it as it stands they affirm the principle which it embodies. I believe that members of the committee should retain to the fullest extent their powers, without committing themselves in any way to the principle of the clause. It must be obvious to the Minister that the great majority of honorable senators desire specific amendments in both clause? 17 and18. I suggest that the measure would go through more expeditiously if the clause were postponed, and I should like to know whether the Minister is agreeable to that course. </para>

                    <para>. -  I have no objection to postponing the clause. I did not accept the suggestion last night, because I had promised to recommit the definition clause, and also clause 16, in consequence of representations made . by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne.</inline> I, theref ore, thought that it would be more convenient also to recommit cla use 17, so that we would have the three clauses in one sealed compartment, so to speak. A second reason was, that I desired to ascertain whether honorable senators were prepared to grant to the commission the incidental and conducive powers referred to in clause 17. As I sense the opinion of honorable senators, I do not think it is their desire to hamstring the commission in its operations. I point out that if clause 17 is postponed we shall be obliged to discuss it before I can frame the reconstruction of clause 16. </para>

                        <para>- That is so, and I take it that if clause 17 requires any alteration it will also be, to a large extent, a drafting amendment. I shall have to consider the advisability of eliminating clause 16 and embodying it in clause 17. If honorable members feel that by passing clause 17 as it stands, with a view to recommittal, they would be pledging themselves to a principle which later they might seek to deny,I am agreeable to the postponement of the clause. </para>

Clause 18 confers specific powers upon the commission, and it would be most embarrassing if, after passing other clauses, it were found that the Senate was not prepared to give the commission these powers. I think that it would be better to debate the clause now. If necessary, it can be remodelled. </para>

                    <para>. -  Clause 18 is closely allied to clauses 16 and 17. It proposes to arm the commission with authority to print and issue pamphlets and such like matter. The problem is to what extent the Government is to enter the industrial field in competition with private enterprise. We have on record the opinion of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> - that it is perfectly permissible for a department to dispose of surplus material produced by it. We have our own government printing works in Canberra," which issues various publications, and even prints the telegram forms that we use. </para>

                        <para>- I am aware of that. The point is whether the commission shall or shall not engage in printing for its own purposes. I consider that it is right for any department to embark on these activities, which have been found useful and profitable in the past. It is true that we are living in an age that has brought about violent oscillations of opinion on the subject. Many staid and conservative individuals who previously considered that a department could rightly embark upon industrial pursuits provided that they were confined to ministering to its needs, have now changed their opinions. I remember how, in the past, the Victorian Railways Department manufactured locomotives, and how Western Australian governmental departments engaged in manufacturing pursuits, to the great benefit of the taxpayers of that State. Moreover, I can easily visualize how useful such  an  authority would be to the Australian Broadcasting Commission. If it were not armed with this power it might easily be penalized by monopolies. Therefore, the clause has my approval. I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> believes that departments should not engage in outside activities. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> is of the opinion that the commission should engage in any form of industrial endeavour which will minister to "the needs of the department. </para>

                        <para>- There is now  a  confusion of ideas, a variety of opinions in this chamber. I am endeavouring to untangle the skein. It is the duty of the Government to ascertain the opinion of the majority of honorable senators, for, obviously, it cannot ignore that majority. Between the two extremes which I have mentioned there lies a vast ill-defined territory, in which I reside. I believe that the department should be authorized to enter the industrial field if it thinks that course advisable in the public interests. It should be empowered to do anything that would tend to lighten the cost of administration. </para>

                        <para>- That is possible. I remember the time when .departmental construction proved of great benefit to the taxpayers of Western Australia; but if that system were in operation to-day it would mean heavy losses to that State. Public opinion in these matters is veering from the attitude it adopted in the past, because in many cases government enterprise has increased the burden on the taxpayers. Nevertheless, I am not inclined to deprive the commission entirely of the power to engage in industrial pursuits; I prefer to allow it a discretionary power in that direction. I would allow it to undertake these functions provided that it could show that it could compete with private enterprise. In the interests of the general public, the power should remain, even though it is not utilized. For that reason, I think that the clause should stand. </para>

                    COLEBATCH.Not necessarily. I object  to  this clause, first, because it contemplates the establishment of an elaborate printing office which would undoubtedly compete with private enterprise. Our experience does not suggest that that form of competition is good for the country. My second objection is that the establishment of such a printing office would inevitably lead to both extravagance and waste. The commission will probably have large revenues at its ' disposal ; but whether large or small those revenues will come out of the pockets of the Australian people. For ' that reason, it is just as necessary that its revenues shall be as carefully spent as if they were the proceeds of a form of taxation which was inadequate for the purpose for which it was imposed. The existence of large revenues is no excuse for extravagant expenditure. In recent years, many Australian governments have set up publicity departments, which issue weekly or monthly pamphlets that sometimes are printed. These pamphlets are only so much propaganda in the interests of the party that happens to be in power, and, in my opinion, they are an abuse of the privileges of government. Moreover, they entail considerable expenditure. If this power is given to the  commission, I visualize a large printing establishment which will endeavour to extend its activities, employ more and more persons, and generally use up revenue which could better be spent in the interests of the community.

                    <para>. - I suggest that this clause should be postponed, because it is impossible to know how to vote on it until we know what is done with clause 16. We cannot say whether clause 18 is incidental to clause 16 until clause 16 has been finally dealt with. The two provisions deal with entirely different aspects of broadcasting. Once we have established a definite principle in clause 16, we should have no difficulty in making up our minds regarding clause 18. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> that the commission should be given the fullest powers. I do not believe in putting into an act of Parliament, which enunciates one principle, any clause which gives a body to be constituted under it the right to do certain things, which might bring about a system of centralization injurious to some of the States. I know that the Labour party believes that the whole Commonwealth should be centralized; but while we are a federation, it is our duty to see that nothing is done which will be prejudicial to the best interests of the States. Should the commission be permitted to do its own printing, I foresee that while South Australia will be deprived of any chance to do the commission's printing, it will not be compensated by being given the opportunity to construct wireless apparatus. Clauses 16, 17, and IS are so interwoven that it is impossible to give an intelligent vote on them until we know the Government's intention in connexion with the powers of the . commission under clause 16. </para>

I support the amendment, because I believe that the people of Australia are looking for greatly improved programmes under the new control of broadcasting. That will not be easily accomplished ; any material improve ment of the present programmes will mean a considerable alteration of the existing system. That, in turn, will mean the expenditure of large sums of money. All the money that the commission is likely to receive could easily be expended in the improvement of the programmes; and that, after all, is what we are aiming at. The commission will be faced with a heavy task in providing programmes that will be satisfactory to listeners, and for that purpose cannot have too much money. </para>

The Minister said that the British Broadcasting Corporation had power to engage in printing, but I remind honorable senators that, although there has been issued Ti number of printed works, representing lectures given over the wireless, those works were not printed, or published by the British Broadcasting Corporation. They were issued by private publishers in Great Britain. At ' any rate, I know of three or four, each of which has been published by a different publisher. Therefore, if anything is broadcast which, in the opinion of  the  broadcasting commission, merits publication, arrangements can be made to <inline font-style="italic">have</inline> it printed by a private publisher. There is no reason why such work should be done by the commission itself. </para>

                    COLEBATCH (Western Australia)  [11.48]. -  The effectiveness of the amendment depends upon the meaning of the word "publish." I have looked up the dictionary, and find that it is given two meanings. According to one meaning, my amendment would be sufficiently effective if the word " publish " were left in the clause, but according to the other, it would be dangerous to retain the word. The first definition states that the word means " to make generally known, to promulgate, to edit." Then a second definition states that a publisher is " one who produces copies of books ". That might mean one who prints books. If the Minister intends to accept the principle of my amendment, and if the word " issue " is left in the clause, there is no reason why the word " publish " should not be struck out.

                    <para>. -  I am opposed to the amendment. It appears to me that the whole discussion is a storm in a tea cup. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> described the provisions of the bill as half-baked socialism. They are nothing of the kind. In any caseI can show that much good has accrued to the community from the inauguration of State enterprises, which undertook work that private enterprise could do quite well, but in regard to which private enterprise exploited the public. In New South Wales the establishment of State brick works almost immediately brought about a reduction of 30s. a thousand in the price of bricks. </para>

                <para>SenatorRAE. - The whole of the capital cost was eventually repaid, and the brick-making combine was compelled to reduce its prices. Moreover, millions of bricks were supplied to State construction works at about half the price for which they could have been bought from private manufacturers. The State pipe works have produced a profit from the first year, besides having repaid the whole of the capital cost. I know that other State enterprises have been rank failures I am not one of those bigoted persona who believe that every Government enterprise must be successful. Some have failed, and others have been- sabotaged by private enterprise. </para>

Most likely it will get its printing done by outside firms, and will continue to do so until circumstances arise which make it advisable for it to undertake the work itself. The Victorian Railways Department has for years been doing its own printing, because it can get the work done more conveniently and economically in that way. </para>

                        <para>- It appears that the Government Printing Office has so much other work to do that the Railways Department does its own printing. For many years now the department has done its own printing at the Central Railway Office, and I have not heard even the keenest critic of State enterprise find any fault with it. This amendment is unnecessary, and is begotten of a narrow-minded prejudice against State enterprise. Moreover, I do not believe that, even if the amendment is agreed to, it will be effective in preventing the commission, if it so desires, from doing its own printing. The commission's powers will be so wide that it will be able to undertake this work without having specific authority for it. </para>

                    <para>.- I support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly's</inline> contention, and urge the wisdom of postponing the consideration of this clause. Clause 17 gives the commission general powers, but clause 18 confers upon it specific powers. I take it that the committee desires to give the commission such powers as are necessary to enable it to function properly as a broadcasting instrumentality. It does not wish to confer upon it unnecessary powers, or such powers as would enable it to enter the field in competition with legitimate enterprises now carried on under the law. I understand that the Minister is prepared to reconsider clause 17. </para>

                        <para>- Possibly the Minister will agree to that, but honorable senators on this side desire him to postpone clauses 17 and 18, and submit proposals to this chamber for endowing the commission with full power to function adequately, yet without transgressing the political principles of the party supporting the Government. If a privileged body, which is exempt from taxation, enjoys special immunities, invests no capital, and has income flowing to it automatically, competes with private enterprise in which capital has been invested, it has a great advantage. It may destroy goodwill, and the result of years of enterprise. We on this side believe that such a procedure would be injurious to the body politic, because it would arrest progress and development. We expect a Government pledged to the principle of private enterprise to introduce legislation which does not transgress a fundamental policy of the party it leads. I ask the Minister to postpone the consideration of these clauses. I do not object to what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> suggests by way of the omission of certain words, but I have had sufficient experience to know that amendments hurriedly made in committee, particularly amendments which have not been circulated, and not fully considered by honorable senators, have sometimes consequences which cannot be foreseen. In recasting a proposal such as is contained in this clause, I advise the Minister to obtain expert advice. He knows the purpose in view, and he should see that it is expressed in definite terms by officers whose special work it is to draft legislation. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> that the form of this clause must be influenced by the terms in which the previous clause, on further consideration, will be couched. Let us proceed to deal with some of the other clauses in the bill about which there will not be so much controversy. </para>

                    <para>. -  I cannot see that any good purpose would be served by postponing the consideration of this clause. It sets out clearly certain things which the commission may do. There can be no misunderstanding as to the meaning of the language employed. It is provided that the commission may compile, print and publish certain literature. That is distinct from the subject-matter of the two previous clauses. If the words "print and publish " were struck out, the meaning would still be clear, and the clause would have little, if any, relation to the two previous clauses. It is clear to the committee that failure has attended State enterprises; even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> has admitted it. </para>

                    <para>- They have usually been due to sabotage by the employees, and a leading example of that, and one that will be remembered for many years, is the failure of the' Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers. That enterprise was destroyed by those whom it was intended to serve. The duty of this commission is to give the full benefits of broadcasting to the people; but the publishing and printing of necessary literary matter might well be left to private enterprise, which could give a better and cheaper service in that direction than could be supplied by the commission. If the occasion should arise, this legislation could be amended at a later stage to extend the powers of the commission to the printing and publishing of literature, but I prefer to err on the side of caution, and prevent the commission from entering into any activity which could be classed as a socialistic undertaking. </para>

                    <para>. -  So far as I can observe, public opinion is much influenced by the experience of the times. In the past, governments were content to abide by the traditional rule of allowing citizens freeplay within the industrial ring ; but within recent years they have stepped down into the ring, and have engaged in industrial enterprises. It appeared at the outset that this policy had certain advantages. Even non-labour governments admitted this, and with public approval departed from the accustomed groove and engaged in governmental activities. </para>

                <para class="block">Every part of the Commonwealth bears testimony <inline font-style="italic">Ho</inline> the popularity of the policy of State enterprise, and many State industrial undertakings proved highly profitable. We have travelled from that era, and now, our experience is exactly the opposite. It is wrong, however, to assert that it is permanent in its character. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lawson</inline> has spoken of railways. The railway systems of the various States were established as the result of the advice of soberminded men who went to Europe and America fifty years ago to study the developments of railways in those countries. Nobody will dispute the benefit to the taxpayers of Victoria of the activities of the Newport railway workshops. I hope that the losses which are now being experienced in connexion with governmental activities are but a passing phase of our industrial life; otherwise ruin may come upon the community. In my opinion, the present temper of the times is totally wrong. We should not take it for granted that the present conditions will be permanent, and insert in our law an instruction that the Australian Broadcasting Commission shall not undertake any form of industrial enterprise. I am well aware of the failure of certain governmental activities in the past, owing to the prevalence of the "government stroke ", and as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Herbert</inline> Hays has mentioned, the results attending the operations of the Australian Commonwealth Shipping Line afford a striking example of an unsuccessful State enterprise. Nevertheless, the commission should be given the power sought under this clause, otherwise we may be made to look foolish. Why not close down the Government Printing Office at Canberra ? </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator would not say that in Western Australia. If the principle of government control is good in one case it should be accepted in another. It would be inconsistent to say that State-owned railways should be retained, but that the Government Printing Office should go. In this case we should follow the British precedent, and give this commission power to print and publish its own literature, if it should desire to do so. In my ramblings through literature I have read that the dominant thought of the hour is always influenced by the experience of the times; but we should not let that tendency influence our decisions in determining the powers of this commission. </para>

                <para>We should not legislate for the present' only. We can throw our minds back to the time when the Government took up certain enterprises with great profit to the people. Let me give an instance of how the political parties of this country have changed their minds within such a short space of time as not even to allow the public to forget their inconsistency. When federation was first established, the plumping system of voting was still in existence, and because of its operation the representatives of the Labour party first gained a footing in this Parliament. As every one knows, plumping was soon after deleted from our electoral law, but the very party which insisted upon its repeal, was the party which subsequently asked for its restoration. That is an instance of how the experience of the past teaches us to form our policy for the future. This legislation which we are now considering is intended, not for the present, but for the years to come. We should not allow ourselves to be influenced by the abnormal times through which we are now unfortunately passing, and should grant the commission potential power to be held in reserve until such time as it may be found necessary to exercise it. Do not tell the commission that it is unworthy of being entrusted with a power which has been used in the past to the great good of the body politic. </para>

                        <para>- This clause is exceedingly complicated. First of all it states that the commission shall not broadcast advertisements, and then this body is given the right to decide what matter is an advertisement. The commission may consider political speeches to be advertisements, and in many instances they are. If the commissioners were asked to permit the broadcasting of a political speech, which might be contrary to their own views, they might declare it to be an advertisement, and refuse to broadcast it. I suggest to the Minister that he add to the end of the clause the words " the commission not to broadcast advertisements for monetary gain." </para>

                    <para>. -  I hope that the Minister will strike out this clause altogether. The party to which I belong advocates the broadcasting of sponsored programmes by A class stations, but the Government, in. its wisdom, has adopted a different attitude.- If honorable senators will glance at the clause, they will see the ridiculous position in which we place ourselves if it remains unaltered. First of all, sub-clause  1  states that the commission shall not broadcast advertisements. Sub-clause  2  reads - </para>

                <para>Such programmes as those are excepted from the general provision that the commission shall not broadcast advertisements. The exceptions are justified. I draw honorable senators' attention to the iniquitous system that will operate if this clause remains in the bill. Instead of the commission allowing any one to advertise by means of sponsored programmes, only certain organizations, firms or companies will have that privilege. The test is provided in paragraph c which provides that the commission may, if it thinks fit, broadcast a programme by any organization, firm or person, provided the programme is not, in the opinion of the commissioners, being used as an advertisement. Is it probable that a firm would broadcast a programme for any purpose other than advertising? Is not an announcement by the broadcasting company itself that it is putting a special programme over the air, an advertisement? The clause states that nothing in this provision shall be construed as preventing the com- mission from broadcasting, if it thinks fit, a programme supplied by any organization. Would not such a programme be an advertisement? </para>

Either let A class stations acknowledge over the air the programmes supplied by every organization, or delete the provision altogether. Holden's band, for example, may be permitted to broadcast, even though the matter used may or may not be an advertisement; but Simpson's band may be prohibited from announcing its programme over the air. I ask the committee, if it believes in the principle of sponsored programmes, to allow all companies to enjoy this privilege. </para>

                    <para>. -  The dominating feature of the clause is the prohibition of advertising by A class stations. That is a feature to which, I think, the committee will fully subscribe. The exceptions provided for in paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">b,</inline> have not been objected to by the honorable senator. Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> has been included to meet two or three cases relating to the rendering of some of the best class of band music in Australia. There is the Malvern Tramways band, in Victoria, which might bo regarded as an advertisement of the tramway system; Holden's band, in Adelaide, which is connected with a motor-body building company, and being run by that company, might be said to advertise their works ; the excellent Newcastle Steelworks band; and a band in Tasmania, which is supported by an industrial organization in that State. We do not wish to deprive the people of Australia of the music that these bands supply; consequently it is suggested that the discretion provided for by the clause should be given to the commission. I ask the committee to agree to the clause as it stands. </para>

                    <para>. - I think the Minister will agree that this clause gives much wider powers than are necessary. I ask him to have it recast. There can be no objection to the commission collecting news, but if it be permitted to distribute that news in such manner as it thinks fit, it may- be empowered to publish a newspaper, or to do anything else. The clause goes on to say that the commission may establish and subscribe to news agencies. I do not know exactly what news agencies are; presumably Reuter's or some such institution is contemplated. Every bookseller and news vendor in the country is called a newsagent. One cannot say what construction might be placed on those words. I shall not move to amend the clause at this stage, because I wish to hear what explanation the Minister has to offer-, but I suggest the deletion of the words " distribute in such manner as it thinks fit ", and the substitution of the words " transmit from all the national broadcasting stations ". I further suggest the deletion of the words " establish and ". </para>

                    <para>. - I do not consider that a lengthy explanation is required of the dictionary definition of the word " rendition ". It seems to me that the powers and functions exercised by this chamber, and by the Commonwealth Parliament generally, are so omnipotent and allpervading that, if the definition does not suit us, we can pass a short bill to alter it. We are capable of doing whatever we care to undertake. This extreme adherence to the exact meaning of the English language is somewhat strange in conjunction with the absolute disregard of the elementary principles of British justice that has been associated with recent actions of this Parliament. Surely we need not bother so much about the letter of the law, when the spirit of it is entirely ignored! I commend these considerations to honorable senators, and urge them not to waste time upon a definition of the English language by Webster, who, after all, was an American, and might be expected to hold American ideas of justice. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not intend to discuss the wording of the clause to which reference has been made earlier in the debate, but to refer to the provision generally. I think it desirable to make it permissive rather than mandatory, by substituting the word " may " for the word " shall ". There has been a good deal of discussion lately with respect to the formation of an Australian national orchestra, with which I have every sympathy.  It  has even been suggested that the advice of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Verbruggen,</inline> who once conducted the. orchestra at the Sydney Conservatorium, should be obtained in connexion with the formation of such an orchestra. In my opinion, music has never received sufficient consideration from the Commonwealth or State authorities. . Certain general sums of money have been contributed to universities, part of which has been spent in the production of good music, but music, as such, has received very little consideration from the Commonwealth or State governments. Whatever has been accomplished has been the result of individual and private effort. Any one who knows anything about the formation or control of a national orchestra realizes that such an undertaking is exceedingly difficult. As a member of the committee controlling an orchestra in South Australia some years ago, I have had some experience in matters of this kind. The fund which enabled that orchestra to be carried on was provided by private individuals, and, as some of the contributions amounted to £100, they were made by people who according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> are frequently described as Shylock bondholders. I do not wish to go into the financial details of that orchestra further than to say that its funds are now very much depleted. That has been the experience whenever an attempt has been made to conduct State orchestras in Australia. We know that enormous sums have been contributed by private individuals in the United States of America towards the formation and control of national orchestras, all of which have been conducted at a loss. We are, therefore, safe in assuming that, if a national orchestra were formed in Australia, it, would not be able to pay its way. Even in Vienna, where music of the highest standard is produced, the State opera house is always conducted at a loss. In these circumstances it is only reasonable to repeat that a national orchestra in Australia would show a loss. Further, it would be difficult to determine the nature of the orchestral music to be provided, particularly in a case of this kind, where all tastes have to be catered for. Some listeners-in favour only music of the highest class. A large number possess some knowledge of music, and are interested in it. Others; who have no knowledge of music in an educated sense, like to hear a good time, even if it should be only the latest jazz number. There is the danger of concerts rendered by a national orchestra being what may be termed of a " highbrow " nature, and, on the other hand, of music being provided which should more properly be broadcast by B class stations. By all means let us have a national orchestra if we can afford it; but, in view of our present financial position, it does not seem that we are justified in launching out on such an undertaking. If the clause, which provides that " the commission shall endeavour to establish . . . groups of musicians for the rendition of orchestral, choral and band music of high quality," is passed in that form, difficulties may arise, in view of the cost that would be entailed. There are two other factors which make one hesitant in supporting the establishment of an entirely efficient orchestra. First, those listeners-in in possession of efficient wireless sets are in a position to pick up music broadcast by the best orchestras in other parts of the world. Secondly, if that is impracticable, such broadcasts can be relayed. I do not agree with the contention of one honorable senator that a national orchestra should be formed for the purpose of providing occupations for persons who have had no real musical training. A first-class orchestra cannot be formed in that way. </para>

I have had the privilege of hearing some of the world's greatest orchestras in the bes opera houses, and all I can say is thai comparing one with the other, the Adelaide street musicians have very little claim for inclusion in a national orchestra. It appears that streetmusicians are tolerated merely because of the unfortunate position in which the? are placed. </para>

                        <para>- Th,type to which I refer are quite unsuitable for inclusion in an orchestra suck as is suggested in this clause. There mav be a few exceptions, but I have not heard them. The committee has already dealt with the encouragement of local talent under an earlier provision, so that in discussing this clause Ave should look a little beyond the encouragement of local performers. I trust that one of the commissioners to be appointed will be fully qualified in musical matters, and I suggest that it would be desirable if the other members of the commission possessed some real knowledge of and a taste1 for music. I have had opportunities to form an opinion as to the difficulties of compiling programmes of music to be rendered by orchestras. Those entrusted with such work have to provide music that will appeal to the tastes of all sections of the community, not merely to lovers of classical music. This is a measure under which the taste for good music may be cultivated. I do not wish to stand in the way of establishing a national orchestra; my tastes are in the opposite direction. But taking into consideration the financial- position of the country, and the fact that national orchestras are conducted at a serious loss, the best the committee can do in the circumstances is to substitute the word  " may " for the word " shall", thus giving it sufficient time to consider the best policy to adopt. </para>

                    <para>.  - The words employed in this clause are capable of being construed in two ways. The word " shall " is mandatory, but is governed by the word " endeavour." The Government believes that the- commission, within its discretionary powers, should make an effort to form the nucleus of a national orchestra. [ have no objection to the substitution of the word "may" for the word  " shall ", although I think that the words " shall endeavour " meet the case. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes</inline> also referred to the necessity for appointing to the commission persons qualified in music in its highest branches. I take it that this body will consist, not entirely of musicians, but also of professional and university men, and will, generally speaking, be a well-balanced body. The commission will have regard <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> the factors mentioned by the honorable senator. Because of my physical infirmity - I happen to be tune deaf - I am not able to take part in the controversy regarding the quality of music provided in the streets of Adelaide or elsewhere. I understand only one instrument which, I may add, is not usually favoured at any broadcasting station. </para>

                    (South Australia) pass the clause in its present form. If the commission goes about the business of establishing a national orchestra it will certainly utilize the services of a considerable number of talented Australian musicians who, at present, are without, employment. I disagree with those honorable senators who assert that good music is not to be heard in the streets of our capital cities. Instead of giving encouragement to musicians from overseas, we should do everything possible to encourage local talent.

                <para class="block">This clause provides for the appointment of . advisory committees. It is highly desirable that there should be an advisory committee in each State, but unless the appointment of such committees is made mandatory, it is not at all likely that one will be appointed in Western Australia for some considerable time to come. The. commission will probably be domiciled in this remote and bleak Federal capital city, or in Sydney, so that in actual working it will depend upon recommendations made by the managers of the national broadcasting stations. Our experience is that Western Australia is always the last State to get consideration from governmental bodies domiciled in the Eastern States. Some time ago the Government approved of the erection of five or six new regional stations, ail of which have been built, with the exception of a proposed - new station at Katanning in Western Australia. Although I have mentioned this matter <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> several occasions during the last two or three years, the Government will not let the Katanning contract. I, therefore, hope that there will be an advisory committee in each State, so that the interests of the more distant States will not be neglected, and also for the protection of the increasing number of holders of licences. </para>

                    <para>. - In  its  present form, the clause will enable  the  commission to use its discretion in the appointment of advisory committees. The commission itself will probably be functioning from either Melbourne or Sydney, and being, as it were, at the <inline font-style="italic">locus in quo,</inline> it should not require the services of an advisory committee in the State in which it has its headquarters; but, doubtless, it will deem it necessary to appoint one in each of the more distant States. In addition, it may need technical assistance from some of the professors who are lecturing in the higher sciences at our principal seats of learning. I, therefore, suggest that, having regard to the circumstances which I have mentioned, the honorable senator should withdraw his amendment, otherwise it will be obligatory on the commission to appoint an advisory committee in each State, whether it be necessary or not. </para>

                <para class="block">Yesterday, when speaking to clause 16, I urged the inclusion of this proviso, but was advised that its proper place was at the end of the clause now under discussion. It is not necessary that I should repeat the arguments which I used yes terday. Similar legislation in the Dominion of Canada has given some protection to the people, because the Performing Right Association is required to lodge with the Registrar-General1s., or the equivalent in Canadian currency, for each piece of music or copyright work in respect of which it claims a royalty. It will give the broadcasting stations and the general public some protection if the wings of this mysterious association are clipped. </para>

                    <para>. -  In the minds of the general public there is a good deal of sympathy with the view expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston;</inline> for it is felt that something should be done to adjust the position between the Performing Right Association and the public. But the amendment asks that association to do something that is not provided for in any law of this land - something, moreover, which we may be unable to provide for in view of our international relations. If the amendment is agreed to, the Performing Right Association may put a ban on the use by the commission of any of the music of which it claims to hold the copyright. Had a law similar to that of New Zealand and Canada been passed in Australia, the amendment might be in order; but, as things are, it would entitle the commission to ask for the use of property - I use the term in its widest sense - and pay nothing for it, unless the Performing Right Association complied with a condition with which, as the law stands at present, it could not comply. I promised yesterday to reconsider the clause' dealing with the reasons for the termination of the services of a commissioner, with a view to providing that a member of the Performing Right Association shall not hold office as a member of the commission. With that further protection, I think we may well leave the commission to look after itself. It may be that the £30,000 which last year was paid to the Performing Right Association was a reasonable sum. On the other hand, it may have been excessive. At present no one can say. In the circumstances, I appeal to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> not to press his amendment. Whatever our individual opinions, we must recognize that the Performing Eight Association has some legal title, possesses some property, and has an undoubted right to recover from persons using the music for which it holds a copyright. We can safely trust the commission to see that it is not mulcted in greater levies than should be made on it. </para>

Are we to allow the long-suffering public to pay toll to this association indefinitely, without calling upon it to produce its authority for collecting fees in respect of copyright ? At present, the onus of proof is thrown on those against whom the levies are made. This is an opportune time for us to throw the onus of proof on the Performing Right Association. </para>

                        <para>- It may be that rather than fight this association, which appears to have almost unlimited resources, aggrieved persons have paid the fees demanded by it; that they have been intimidated into doing  . so.  It is time that the Government allayed the feeling of unrest in the minds of the public with regard  to  this vexatious question. It seems to me that we shall go a long way if we provide that before the association can collect fees, it must register its copyright;  we  should throw on it the onus of proof. The royal commission which investigated the moving picture industry was informed that representations were made by the Performing Right Association to the descendants of the composers of musical and other works to give the association a power of attorney, under which authority it could levy toll on those who made use of those works in public; a small percentage of the fees so obtained  to be  paid to the persons giving the power of attorney. That is going on to-day. It is useless to turn  to the  State Governments, either individually or collectively, in this matter; it is" the duty of the Commonwealth Government  to  take action. I am not impatient with the Government, for I know that it has not overlooked this matter ; but I feel that it should . make some public pronouncement to the effect that it intends to throw the onus of proof on to the association in order to protect the public. </para>

                    <para>. -  I hope that the committee will reject the amendment, and accept the advice of the Minister. This question of copyright affects a wider field than that  of wireless  broadcasting. I  have  for  a number of years been connected with certain charitable organizations in South Australia. Some time ago one of them wanted to perform one of Gilbert and Sullivan's operas which had not been pre.duced in Adelaide for a number of years. Although the performance was booked to take place in a suburban hall, the- organization was asked to pay twenty guineas for the right to perform the opera. The Minister has. given an assurance that this Government is continuing the inquiry initiated by a previous government into the ramifications of the Performing Right Association. I should like a full investigation to be made by an independent committee of, say, three persons, presided over by a man with a legal training. The committee's report should be presented to Parliament with a view to the introduction of legislation to deal with the subject of copyright in all its aspects. I am afraid that if we pass the amendment, it will appear that this mattor has been dealt with, whereas, in fact, it will be only tinkering with the subject. The position is not so easy as some honorable senators appear to think. It is an intricate and complicated subject. </para>

Having given the subject a good deal of thought, I urge the Minister to consider the appoint ment of a spp nal committee to inquire into it, take  evidence,  and make a full report, the committee to be vested with the powers of a royal commission. In the meantime, I suggest that we do not put in this bill something which, in my opinion, is foreign to its purpose. </para>

                    <para>. - I point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Herbert</inline> Hays' that the Government has not been inactive in regard to this matter. In 1928, Professor <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Harrison Moore attended the International Convention on Copyrights at Rome, . and a report is" to be found on the files in the Attorney-General's Department of what transpired there. Speaking from memory, I believe that the report is to the effect that .the governments which signed the convention were almost unanimously of the opinion that the title of the Performing Right Association was something which ought to be respected. In 1930 or 1931, the British Government held an injury into the matter, and I have recently secured a copy of the report and the conclusions arrived at. That Government hesitated about introducing legislation to deal with this very complex and difficult subject. I took an opportunity, during the last parliamentary recess, to ask some of my Canadian friends for a report, which, I believe, is just to hand, concerning the operation of the law that has been adopted  in Canada with regard to copyright. I have also received a report regarding the position in New Zealand. Immediately I have a chance to do so, I shall, with the law officers of- the Crown, examine both reports, with a view to seeing whether we can do anything to remove the public doubt that exists regarding the reasonableness of the charges made by this association. </para>

                <para>I .suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> that it would" be tremendously difficult to have hundreds of thousands of pieces of music registered. It would involve the setting up of expensive machinery, and that is one of the aspects on which I have sought the advice of the Canadian and New Zealand Governments. Upon a casual examination of the files, T gather that the position in New Zealand is not altogether satisfactory. Honorable senators who have a knowledge of the law will realize that the Government has definite limits placed upon it in regard to this matter on account of its international relations. In my examination, I have cleared the ground to this extent - that I do not anticipate any difficulty in regard to the establishment of title, and, probably, registration ; but there is a doubt in my mind whether I should set up expensive machinery in connexion with the copyright branch. Until I have that aspect of the matter investigated, I cannot make up my mind what my recommendation to Cabinet will be. If I should find that the setting up of machinery on the basis of a small registration fee of ls. would not be satisfactory, I should have to consider whether we could not deal with the matter by some rule of thumb method; and that is where my material is, at the present moment, lacking. I pointed out yesterday that about £30,000 a year is paid to the Performing Right Association by way of royalties on music that is broadcast from A class stations, and I repeat that that may or may not be an unreasonable charge. I ask honorable senators to remember that if the commission is brought into being, one of its first duties will be to regulate its own relations with that association. The commission will have to consider whether it should pay more or less for the privilege of broadcasting certain music, and it will have every opportunity to investigate the practical side of the matter. </para>

                        <para>- The commission will be an independent unit, whose sole duty will be to protect the rights of the public in regard to broadcasting. Let us assume that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston's</inline> amendment is accepted. It must be remembered that the Performing Right Association has been successful in every claim that it has prosecuted in Australia, with one exception, and that, I believe, was an appeal from my own State. If the commission attempted to broadcast music, over which it had royalty rights, the first action of the association would be to restrain it from doing so,, and then we should be entirely deprived of much of the music which passes over the air every night. We should thus be creating a kettle of fish which would boil up at once, for legal action would immediately be taken to restrain the commission from using this music. I have examined the subject up to a certain point, but I have not gone into it to my complete satisfaction. It is an important subject from the public point of view, and some action will have to be taken. I was in communication with the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> before he left Australia for Geneva, and have received a letter from him written when he was crossing the Indian Ocean, giving his views. I am still considering the matter at every opportunity. The amendment would create confusion, and would be, I think, a little unjust in its incidence. During the coming parliamentary recess - if there, should be such an interval - I shall look into this question, and decide what recommendation to submit to Cabinet, either on the lines suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly,</inline> or on those hinted at by myself. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> not to press the? amendment. </para>

                    <para>. - It should be made perfectly clear that no honorable senator who has spoken is opposed to the association obtaining the royalties to which it is entitled. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> said, that, when a certain opera was to be performed in a suburb of Adelaide, an amateur dramatic society with which he was once associated received a demand for twenty guineas for the right to present the play; but, in that case, the licensee could show that he was entitled to demand royalty. I have sympathy with the Performing Right Association, and I consider that it discharges a useful function. What annoys the great majority of the people of Australia is that, if one asks the association for the right to perform a certain piece of music, it will not furnish a definite reply, but says in effect " You perform it, and then we will find out whether we are entitled to collect royalty from you." That attitude of the association is causing all the trouble, and something must be done. I am in sympathy with the Minister, and, if he is prepared to submit a definite proposal in the near future, I shall be content; but </para>

                        <para>- When <inline font-style="italic">Going Up</inline> was presented by the company to which I am referring, we asked J. C. Williamson Limited to make the music available to us. The company would have been prepared to show us its licence, and it replied that its charge would be say, £10 for the first night and £8 for each of the five nights following. This company was willing to show us ite title, but the Performing Bight Association refuses to give any information as to whether it holds a copyright over particular music, or how much it charges by way of royalty. In many cases it claims royalty after the performance. It holds a pistol at the head of the public, and, in almost every case in which it has gone to a court, it has obtained a verdict for the full amount claimed. Ordinary citizens cannot resist its claims by taking costly legal action, because it is well known that the association consists of a syndicate of wealthy persons who could ruin their opponents in a legal battle. This association is the only body which states that it holds copyrights, yet refuses to produce its title when asked to do so. That is the principal complaint made against it. If it were compelled to register its copyrights, as has been suggested, performers could ascertain before presenting a play how much would be charged by way of royalty. In the case to which I am referring, the proceeds were devoted to charitable causes. I doubt if it would be possible to-day to find even descendants of the authors of many of the musical numbers upon which royalties are charged.. Probably few people take the trouble to ascertain who are the authors of old music, such as "Love's Old Sweet Song", that enjoys a worldwide popularity, and is sung at practically every village concert from one end of Australia to the other. A charity organization may include such music in a concert programme, and on the following day have a pistol presented at its head by the Australasian Performing Bight Association. I cited yesterday the case of an orchestra that rendered musical items in a hotel in Brisbane. On one occasion no copyrights existed for the music that was being played ; but, merely to oblige a couple of ladies who entered the lounge, " Rose Marie ", or some similar piece, was played from memory, no score being available at the moment. On the following day, it was learned that these two ladies had acted as spies for the Australasian Performing Bight Association, and a claim lodged by the association for breach of copyright had to be satisfied. If the association will stoop to that kind of thing to extract fees, to what depths will it not descend in its blackmailing practices I trust that the bill will contain an adequate safeguard against the continuance of such a state of affairs in Australia. </para>

                    <para>. - It appears to me, as a sort of listener-in, that the remedy in this matter lies with the authority that issues the copyright, not with the commission. If it will not safeguard the public against being unduly levied upon, the Copyright Act should be altered so as to compel the Australasian Performing Right Association to carry out its duties a little more assiduously, and with greater consideration for the public interest. Compositions like the " Old Village Blacksmith " appeal to the best instincts. That cannot be said of the jazz productions of the present' day, which Paderewski characterized as " the triumph of the nigger over the white man". If the Australasian Performing Right Association can show that it is armed with authority to levy on the public because of the possession of copyright, that is the end of the story. </para>

                    <para>.   -  I notice that the next clause provides that the commission shall be financially self-supporting. This particular clause, however, proposes to exempt it and all its works from taxation. I do not know that that can be considered the right thing to do. As we know, with the inauguration of the commission a number of legitimate businesses that are now being carried on in the Commonwealth will cease to function. The professional musician, the music hall, the theatre of the low, middle, and high classes, and other agencies that in the past have satisfied our aesthetic tastes, will be displaced. The huge army of worthy bread-winners who are thus engaged are regarded by every community as a necessity, and by some of the best authorities as an integral part, and the best part, of society, because of their influence towards higher mental and spiritual development. They will be thrown out of employment as a result of this commission coming into existence, and the taxation that they otherwise would contribute will be lost to the country. If this institution is to be on a self-supporting basis, and fresh ground is to be broken, it should be called upon to pay the rates and taxes that are demanded of other institutions. It will occupy a privileged position, because it will be virtually a monopoly. No monopoly should be exempt from the visitations of the tax gatherer. The clause needs to be re-modelled. </para>

                    <para>.- I support the contention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> but look at the matter from a different angle. I should like the Minister to say whether this body will be exempt from water rates, municipal rates, fire brigade levies, and charges for other social services. After all, the commission will be a money-making concern, and will collect large revenues at very little cost. Municipal councils should not be penalized by being deprived of the rates and taxes that such a body should pay. I am- surprised to find that the commission is not to pay rates, taxes or charges to meet the cost of the services supplied by local governing bodies to the properties and buildings under its control. The commission is to assume control of the studios, offices and other accommodation at present used in connexion with broadcasting, and on which rates and taxes are now levied and paid. This will place local governing bodies at a great disadvantage. They should not be precluded from collecting revenue from this source, particularly as they will have to provide certain services to enable the commission to carry on its business. </para>

                    <para>. -  It is difficult to understand why the Government should exempt from rates and taxes an undertaking which, to all intents and purposes, is a trading concern. It is quite conceivable that the revenue obtained by the commission may, as one honorable senator suggested, amount to £1,000,000 annually. In order to derive that revenue it must use the services provided by local governing bodies. The commission is to take over certain properties from those who are now making a substantial contribution towards the revenue of this country, but on which, under this measure, no Commonwealth or State taxation can be imposed. Is it proposed that the commission shall not pay any rates or other charges to municipal authorities? I cannot understand why the Government should withhold from State Governments or local governing authorities revenue which has previously been available to them. Unless the Acting Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLachlan)</inline> can satisfactorily explain why this provision has been embodied in the bill, I intend to oppose it. </para>

                        <para>- The commission will be in the same position as if it were not working independent of the Postal Department. A number of the studios and stations at present in use are the property of the Commonwealth, on which no rates or taxes are levied. If Commonwealth land or income taxation were imposed it would merely be taking revenue out of one pocket and placing it in another. It is for the committee to decide whether the Commonwealth is justified in levying a toll upon itself. To do so would be establishing a new principle, as all Government instrumentalities are exempt from such rates and taxes. The public will get the benefit of a good deal of the revenues collected by the commission, which is not a moneymaking concern. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. The Commonwealth Bank does not take advantage of its legal position; it observes its duty to the local governing authorities in the districts in which it is operating. I submit that this commission will be in exactly the same position, from the public viewpoint, as the Commonwealth Bank. It will be a serious matter for the local governing bodies if, year after year, new governmental activities come into existence which will occupy land and buildings on which no rates or taxes can be imposed. It is true that, generally speaking, rates and taxes are not levied on railway property, but many of such properties are leased to private persons, and return a revenue in the form of rates and taxes. </para>

            <para>SenatorMILLEN (Tasmania) [4.2].- If the clause is passed in its present form, an extraordinary position will arise, because it enacts that the Postmaster-General shall undertake the provision and operation of all technical services associated with the transmission of pro grammes. Why should not the technical side of the undertaking be also in the hands of the commission which, we assume, will comprise a body of practical men, competent to deal with all phases of broadcasting? If the Postmaster-General is to control the technical services, he will be responsible for the most important phase of the whole business. I have serious objection to this proposed arrangement. The Government has more than 50 per cent. interest in Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, which body has been eminently successful in the carrying out of highly technical work not only in the laboratory but in the actual field of operations, and has more practical information than any other service in the Commonwealth. If the commission needs technical information it can easily obtain it from Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, or failing that company, from the research department of the Postal Department, or from the British Broadcasting Corporation. The clause in its present form will hamstring the commission. I hope that it will be rejected. </para>

                    <para>. - In my second-reading speech, I endeavoured to explain why it was deemed advisable to retain for the Postmaster-General responsibility for all technical services associated with wireless broadcasting. <inline font-style="italic">For</inline> reasons which I then advanced it has been thought advisable that, for the time being, the commission should discharge the functions now being carried out by the present body controlling broadcasting, and that the Postal Department should be responsible for the technical services. Possibly, at a later stage, the whole of these technical services will pass under the control of the commission or some other body ; but we are advised that for the present, they should remain with the Postal Department which is well equipped to carry on this most difficult work. I am informed that there are on the permanent staff of the Postal Department, 207 highly-trained engineers, having specialized knowledge of the technical side of broadcasting, 2,700 mechanics who are also specially trained for the same purpose, 15 research engineers and 12 specially selected mechanics, as well as technical apparatus, to the value of £28,000j "which may be regarded as the nucleus of the equipment required for well-developed research work. I agree that we have too many arms functioning in the realm of wireless broadcasting, and it was with a view to ensuring a* more satisfactory service to the general public that the Government introduced these proposals. B class stations are not affected by this legislation. -It is possible, as I have said, that eventually the technical side of broadcasting will pass under the control of the commission, but it is not deemed desirable to make such a complete change without fuller information. </para>

                    <para>. - The Minister has told us that certain  things  cannot be done. I totally disagree with him. There is every reason why the change should be made. The commission can safely be entrusted with full responsibility for the technical services. The fact that the technicians now doing this work are officials of the Postal Department need not prevent this course from being followed, because the commission could, if it thought desirable, take over their services. Under the existing form of control, Tasmania and Western Australia have been placed at  great disadvantage. Because of the difficulties in receiving transmissions f  from  mainland stations except on the most expensive sets, we were promised a new station for Tasmania. </para>

                        <para>- That is so, but so far nothing has been done in that matter. Western Australia is in very much the same position. How will it be possible for the commission to provide adequate programmes unless it has control of all the national broadcasting stations? At present station 3LO Melbourne may broadcast certain programmes which, without relay stations, cannot be received ia certain portions of Victoria, situated at no great distance from that station. It should be the duty of the commission to see that sufficient regional stations are provided in all the States. A commission of business men could quite safely be entrusted with the technical side of the business, because necessary advice is always available for those who are prepared to pay for it. Unless we vest full authority in the commission, Tasmania and Western Australia will not enjoy the services which they are entitled to expect. It has been said that B class stations do not attempt to provide the higher class of entertainment. I do not subscribe to that view. The majority of  listenersin  in all States prefer to tune in to B class stations for the very good reason that the entertainment value of their programmes is, as a rule, higher that that supplied by the A class stations. </para>

                        <para>- Clause 45 says that the Postmaster-General shall undertake the provision and operation of all technical services associated with the  transmis-  sion of programmes. Another clause provides that, for the purpose of providing and operating the technical services referred to, he may do certain things, among them being the erection and maintenance of the electric lines necessary for the conveying of electric current to a broadcasting station. In the one clause we have the words " provision and operation", in the other "providing and operating." </para>

                        <para>- I was suggesting that the first technical service which the Postmaster-General will have to provide is the erection of electric lines to convey the electric current to the broadcasting stations. If the commission undertakes this work, it will necessarily duplicate the staff of the Postmaster-General's Department. In all the States the Postal Department has its own erecting plant and gangs. The Postmaster-General would probably not be allowed to tender for the erection of these lines; and since we could not expect him to place his erecting gangs and plant under some one else's control, a duplication would be almost inevitable. In addition to the erection of poles for the conveying of the electric current, the commission is authorized to call on the Postmaster-General to provide, free of cost, certain apparatus such as microphones, pick-up equipment, and all other necessary portable apparatus for occasional or periodical transmission from various places within the Commonwealth. There is a definition of "electric line ", which informs us that that term includes casing, coating, covering, tube, tunnel, pipe, pillar, pole, post, frame, bracket or insulator enclosing materials which are already used in other sections of the Postmaster-General's Department. "We were told that the commission would not enter any field outside the studio; that its functions would be restricted to arranging programmes, selecting music, and generally directing the work of distributing sound over the air, leaving the provision of other things in the hands of private enterprise. Should there be any doubt in the minds of the committee regarding these things, I suggest that this clause be postponed until clauses 46, 47. and 48 have been dealt with. 'We shall then know what is meant by technical services. Ordinarily, in an act of Parliament the definition clause is placed at the beginning, so that in the consideration of legislation honorable senators know the meaning of the various terms mentioned; but in this bill the definition, in effect, follows the main clause. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> wants the commission to call for tenders for the supply of technical services. </para>

It provides that under this legislation the Postmaster-General shall have the same powers and be subject to the same obligations as are conferred and imposed on him under the Post and Telegraph Act. I am not interested in the erection of lines or poles to convey electric current to broadcasting stations - I do not care who does that work - but I am interested in the erection of the stations themselves. It is there that the technical services come in. It is not a question of duplicating the ordinary services of the postal department, which would be ridiculous, but of- erecting stations and locating sites. </para>

Should ever Australia be attacked by an enemy ,( we have in Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, a body with a most efficient staff, capable of dealing with any situation which might arise in connexion with the transmission of messages. Under clause 19 we have empowered the commission to purchase sites. Our aim is an efficient broadcasting service throughout Australia - something which Tasmania has not yet had; indeed, no earnest attempt has yet been made to provide such a service. I should like to see this clause struck out, and the matters referred to in it left to the commission's discretion. The government gangs which T. have seen iti the bush erecting telephone and telegraph lines are the slowest I have met anywhere. In the interests of efficiency I hope that these matters will be left to the commission. There are plenty of capable technicians in Australia who are not in the employ of the postal department. </para>

It would be out of harmony with the spirit of the measure to ask the commission to take over the technical services referred to in clauses 46 and 48. The commission's duty will be to broadcast programmes; the stations will bo erected by the postal department, and made available to the  commission.  This bill is not the last word on the subject. It sets up a body to make inquiries and offer advice as to the best course to pursue in the future. I urge the committee to retain the clause as it stands. </para>

                    <para>. - If I were certain that what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> proposes would improve the broadcasting programmes of Western Australia, I should support the honorable senator, for there is great room for improvement in those services. Speaking of technical services, on those occasions on which I have endeavoured to speak from Canberra to Western Australia all that I could hear were some indescribable sounds which suggested that some monster had acquired the art of conducting a thunder-storm.  We ought to be able to speak to Western Australia as clearly as we can speak to any other part of the Commonwealth. Our present postal, telephonic and telegraphic services have evolved from a humble beginning. At one time persons could communicate with their distant friends only by means of letters, which were carried by individuals from one place to another. Later instead of those letters being carried by individuals, the work was undertaken by governments. Then some one discovered the art of telegraphy, and as telegraphy meant that persons could communicate with each other by the new process, this service was also conducted by the same government department which, conveyed letters from place to place. Similarly, when the telephone was discovered, telephonic communication was placed under the control of the same department which dealt with the - other two means of communication I have mentioned. As in the matter of telegraphic and telephonic services, it was . decided to combine the staffs in the interests of economy, so the administrative control of wireless broadcasting was centred in the Department of the Postmaster-General, but it was found that the public interest is not adequately served under the present arrangement. During the transition stage of broadcasting, it is proposed to utilize the services of the Postal Department to give the newly created body a chance to get on its feet. The broadcasting department is to have the benefit of the facilities available in the Postal Department. If it is considered necessary that the commission should depend on the technical services provided by the Postal Department, I should say that this bill will enable that end to be secured. I hope that the result will be that Tasmania and Western Australia will be provided with a better broadcasting service than they now enjoy, but I see no necessity to create a new government department. If it is found, in the course of experience, that the new department can draw its sustenance from its own root system, so much the better; but at the present time, every effort should be made to economize. The present policy is to utilize State services for the carrying out of Commonwealth works, and there is no reason why the broadcasting commission should not avail itself of the technical services which the Postal Department can provide. </para>

                    <para>[4.36].  -  I hope that honorable senators do not imagine that by striking out this clause they will improve the chance of Tasmania, Western Australia, or any other State, obtaining new wireless stations, or that the Postal Department is responsible for the unsatisfactory broadcasting service experienced in Western Australia and Tasmania. All departments are subject to the overriding authority of the Treasury and the Cabinet. For the last' two or three years, each government in power in the Commonwealth has been unable to find money for the erection of the wireless stations asked for, and the responsibility for delay should not be laid at the door of the Postal Department. Portion of the revenue derived from listeners' licence-fees has gone into the general revenue of the Treasury. That, too, is not the fault of the Postal Department, This clause has no effect on the financial relations between the broadcasting commission and the Government. I suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mill</inline> en that there are in Australia to-day two organizations that are capable of providing the technical services required for broadcasting purposes - the post office and Amalgamated -Wireless (Australasia) Limited. It is now suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline></para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator objected to the post office conducting the technical side of the commission's operations. Then, either that work must be entrusted to Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, or a third authority must be set up for the purpose, which would mean that the Broadcasting Commission would have to engage its own technical staff. In these days of economic stress, when governments are endeavouring to avoid the overlapping of departmental activities, the Minister proposes to allow the post office to continue to supply the technical services required. The commission can determine for itself whether those services are satisfactory. </para>

If we strike out this clause we shall be laying down the  principle that we do not desire the Postal Department to provide technical services for national broadcasting.

                    <para>. - The position put by my leader <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> surely is inescapable. Are we to set up, under this commission, a similar technical service to that which already is functioning in the post office? The latter must be continued, because land lines for transmission purposes, and other classes of lines, are under its control. This proposal, if accepted, probably would involve an amendment of the Post and Telegraph Act and the "Wireless Telegraphy Act, with a view to vesting in the commission powers that are now possessed by the post office. This is the foundation upon which the whole structure has been built. The commission should have control of broadcasting, so as to watch its repercussions, and to see how it operates. We do not want to be advised by those who are prejudiced in favour of nationalized or socialized control, nor by those who are actuated by self-interest. We desire to do what is best in the interests of the Australian people. That object can be achieved on sound and economic lines only by the means proposed in the bill. The amendment, if agreed to, would oblige the commission to carry on a technical service, and that would involve additional expense. Is it not much simpler to provide that responsibility shall lie with those who now control this technical service? If any fault develops in the service the commission will be able to sheet home the blame for it. Should it occur in the technical service, that fact will be made known through an entirely independent channel; but should the blame be attachable elsewhere, the post office will be able to clear itself. I cannot avoid the conclusion that the logic of my leader is unanswerable. The whole field is open to the commission for inquiry. The service is to function along the lines that are at present being followed, with the exception that expert advice will be obtainable from an independent body in the shape of the commission. I ask the committee to reject the amendment. </para>

                    <para>. - I should like the Minister to explain whether the commission will have any voice in the location of sites for new stations, and in the class of station to be erected, or whether that matter will be left entirely in the hands of the post office. The honorable gentleman might also say whether it will be competent for the commission to seek other advice, if it is not satisfied with what is tendered by the post office. </para>

                    <para>. - After the vote just taken, the Government should realize that the representatives of Western Australia and Tasmania in this chamber are entirely dissatisfied with the service at present provided by, the Postmaster-General's Department. The Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> contends that it is not the fault of the Postmaster-General, but it is extraordinary to find that when approval was given for the erection of a number of new stations the claims of Western Australia and Tasmania were totally ignored. The only station, although approved at the same time as others, which was not erected was that at Katanning, in the southwestern portion of Western Australia. Since I have been a member of this Parliament, I have had an opportunity to see the extent to which wireless is used in the homes of the people. Wireless sets are installed in almost every home in the cities and country districts of Victoria and New South Wales. This enables the people to enjoy good music, and to obtain the latest news at the earliest moment. In Western Australia, the position is entirely different. </para>

Consequently, the number of -wireless licences issued in Western Australia and in Tasmania is much smaller per head of 'population than in the Eastern States where licensees have the advantage of tuning in to a number of first-class stations. In Western Australia even those possessing expensive wireless sets who reside outside the metropolitan area often cannot get any reception at all. </para>

I maintain that the western State, which comprises one-third of the whole of the Australian continent, should have more than one A class station. The fault for the delay in erecting the new station approved for the south-west of Western Australia rests with the Postmaster-general's Department or with the Government. I trust that the Minister will give consideration to the complaints that have repeatedly been made by the representatives of Western Australia and Tasmania. The people in those States are dissatisfied with the technical services provided by the Postal Department. </para>

                    <para>. - The vote which I have just recorded should not be regarded as an indication of hostility towards the Government, but rather as a protest against the inactivity displayed by the authorities in providing Tasmania with an efficient wireless service.  Listeners-in  in Tasmania have not received fair treatment, and I am anxious to know if they are likely to receive more consideration in the future. If the Government is not in a position to provide the necessary funds to enable a better service to be rendered, surely it does not expect  listeners-in  in Tasmania to pay the same fee as is paid on the mainland. The Hobart station is a disgrace to the authorities. Many persons in Tasmania who have been paying licence-fees for years, now find that the service provided is not so good as it was three or four years ago. Those possessing valuable wireless sets, who can tune in to some of the big stations on the mainland, cannot obtain any reception from the Hobart station. In selecting the commission the Government- should favorably consider the appointment of a resident of Tasmania. I understand that until telephonic communication is provided between Tasmania and the mainland, substantial improvement cannot be expected. </para>

                    <para>. - I intend to support the appeal made by honorable senators representing Tasmania. I cannot, however, agree to the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Herbert</inline> Hays that a Tasmanian should be appointed to the commission. I do not wish to discuss this subject from a parochial viewpoint; but when it is remembered that two-fifths of the population of Australia are resident in New South Wales, and that listenersin  in that  State  contribute a large proportion of the revenue, the proposal of the honorable senator cannot be justified. The Sydney City Council does as much business in one week as is done by the civic  authorities in Tasmania in twelve months. Tasmania's difficulty, I understand, is due to the fact that it has no telephonic communication with the mainland. In this respectthe service should he brought up to date. I hope, also, that there will be an improvement in the service in Western Australia, but I may add that it seems strange that a violent secessionist like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> should be interested in any movement to improve means of communication with the eastern States. I believe that the Government will, through the commission, make every effort to provide improved services in all parts of Australia, but I strongly deprecate the parochial view taken by honorable senators in this discussion. </para>

                    <para>. -  As this clause gives extraordinarily wide power to the Minister, I should like to know how it is to be. used. I am strongly opposed to this authority being vested in any politician or any other person associated with politics. Already, it has been exercised in a most reprehensible manner. The Country party has always experienced much difficulty in having its identity recognized whenever requests have been made to allow its leader to broadcast his policy speech. We were told by one arrogant government that we were merely part of the Opposition, and, therefore, were not entitled to have our policy broadcast from an A class station. Even if we do face the electors in association with another party and in support of a combined policy, we claim the right, as a separate political party, to have access to the national broadcasting stations and to broadcast our views. It is not in the best interests of the country that any Minister should have this wide control over the national broadcasting stations. A more independent tribunal is neces sary so that all parties may expect fair treatment. </para>

                    <para>. - I endorse the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston.</inline> Not only have we to fear partiality in the exercise of this power by the  Minister;  we have had actual experience of it. Only recently the leaders of all parties were given access to the national broadcasting stations, but the Premier of New South Wales was expressly, by direct order of the Prime Minister) denied the right to state his views in the same way. I have never heard of a more scandalous exercise of ministerial authority than on that occasion. No party in power should be in a position to treat its political opponents in this way. I regard the clause as  a  most dangerous one, because, while one party might be in power to-day, it might, following an appeal to the people, be in opposition to-morrow. Consequently, it might not have the same opportunity as other parties to state its views through the national broadcasting stations. Although this Government claims that part of its policy is to place all essential services outside political control, this clause deliberately provides that the Postmaster-General for the time being may interfere with programmes arranged by the commission. The common sense of honorable senators - the knowledge that, following a change in the political fortunes of parties, while their opponents may be out of office this year they may be in office next year - should preclude the possibility of any Ministerial head being vested with such authority as is contemplated in this clause. Assuming that the commission will be well chosen, it would be much better to leave this matter in  its  hands. I do not for a moment deny  that  the Government should  have  the power to prevent certain things from being broadcast; quite conceivably this course might be in the public interest. </para>

                <para>SenatorRAE. - The following clause  gives  the Government the necessary  power.  I entirely endorse the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston.</inline> Although the party to  which  he belongs may, I think, be regarded as one  wing  of the Nationalist  party,  I believe  that  the leaders  of  all parties, including the rival Labour factions, and even the leaders of sub-parties, should have an equal chance to state their views over the air. Rather than deny to any one this right I would err on the side of liberality, and would not object even to a leader of the Communist party being allowed to use our wireless services for this purpose. Ignorance of a party's aims or gross prejudice to its principles should not influence those in authority to do an injustice to any section of the people. I hope that the committee will reject the clause, because clause 53 gives sufficient power to the Minister to deal with any emergency when in the public interest, it might be desirable to deny to a particular party the use of our national air services. To allow any one political party to sit in judgment on the utterances of another, and to say that it would be against the public interest to allow its views to be broadcast, would be an unjustifiable exercise of ministerial authority. </para>

                    <para>.- Unless I have a satisfactory explanation from the Minister as to the need for this clause, I shall vote against it. I am not concerned about the Minister's attitude towards the broadcasting of political speeches, because I think, generally speaking, any Minister can be trusted to deal fairly with his political opponents, but I believe that there should be a limit to the broadcasting of political speeches, for the very good reason that the subscribers will not be encouraged to renew their licences if they get an overdose of politics from the national broadcasting stations. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> that, if we appointa thoroughly representative and impartial committee - I believe it will be impartial - it can be entrusted with the whole of the business of broadcasting programmes. I cannot imagine that the men who will comprise the commission will attempt to put over the air anything to which a Minister may take exception on political or other grounds. We have had a good deal of discussion on the technical side of broadcasting, but the principal duty of the commission will be, I take it, to control the programmes to be broadcast. I, therefore, assume that that body will be drawn from all sections of the community, and will include representatives of the musical, sporting, and similar bodies. Unless an item to be broadcast is seditious or blasphemous it is not likely that the Minister will interfere. Nevertheless, I cannot see why we should give this over-riding power to the Government. It is a dangerous weapon to place in the hands of any Minister, and it is not fair to the commission. That body should accept full responsibility for its programmes. </para>

It has been copied from the charter of the British Broadcasting Corporation, in which it was inserted for reasons of international significance. No government can relinquish its right to control what is said regarding international disturbances which may arise from time to time. Clause 52 retains that right, while the following clause meets cases of national emergency within this country. It is not proposed to take from the commission the power to say what shall be broadcast in ordinary circumstances. The commission will be empowered to say whether the public shall have the benefit of listening to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jones,</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smith,</inline> or to a number of leaders of political parties.

That control will rest with the commission, which will know that it must satisfy the listeners who pay their fees. No doubt the commission will take action to prevent listeners from being nauseated by an overdose of politics. This clause seeks to control broadcasting in the way that a government sometimes has to control the press in relation to international affairs. </para>

With <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll,</inline> I fear that the power may be abused. I propose to move a new subclause to deal with the control of broadcasting -as it affects political parties. I do not forget that the Scullin Government refused <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beasley</inline> the right to broadcast his message to the electors of the Commonwealth, notwithstanding that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyons, Dr. Earle</inline> Page, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scullin</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Theodore</inline> addressed the electors over the air.

We on this side would not refuse any__ political party the right to broadcast its message to the people. I would not deprive the Communist party of that right, for it might merely want to let Australia know that the Soviet Government recently purchased 350,000 bushels of Australian wheat, some of which was, perhaps, grown by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch.</inline> According to the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> there is every likelihood of that Government buying more of our wheat.

                        <para>- I do not wish the Minister to shelter behind the commission. The present Government has been elected for three years, but other governments that were elected for a similar term have gone out of office before the expiration of that period. If this Government is not prepared to accord to all parties the right to 3tate their case when political matter is broadcast, it may find this clause to be a Frankenstein monster capable of doing it injury. I am convinced that one political party has as  much  right as another to the use of A class stations. Recently the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> was permitted to speak over the air concerning the doings of the Premiers Conference in Melbourne; but the Premier of New South Wales was not granted a similar privilege.

Personally, I should like all A class stations throughout the Com-  mon wealth to be prevented from broadcasting political speeches. The B class stations are available for this purpose, provided the usual fees are paid. The national stations should be made use of only by leaders of governments and leaders of official oppositions. It should be remembered that the independent political candidates would regard themselves a.f one-man parties, and expect to be granted the use of the broadcasting service. I take it that the framers of the bill had in mind the necessity to prohibit the broadcasting of information which might cause panic among the people, such as news of fires or floods. The commission will be responsible for broadcasting throughout the Commonwealth, and I am not afraid that the provisions of this desirable clause will be abused. </para>

I resent his nonsensical remark about the danger of certain speeches making night hideous. The commission will have power to limit the time to be devoted to the broadcasting of political matter. I would be content if the broadcasting of political speeches through A class stations were to be disallowed. My sole desire is to see that privileges granted to one party are extended to all others. This clause, if not qualified in some may, will open the way to abuse of the broadcasting service. Two instances of gross partisanship were afforded by the denial by the Scullin Government of permission to the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley)</inline> to broadcast his election speech, any by the refusal of a similar privilege to the Premier of New South Wales. </para>

If the commission found that the public preferred musical -and dramatic selections to political addresses, it should refuse to broadcast speeches of a political nature.

But there is a difficulty that I apprehend. The control of broadcasting is vested in the commission. In Great Britain it was found necessary to have a clause similar to this, on the same high ground that I have already indicated to the committee. The very thing that this clause is directed against may be the subject of some political speech, and it would be incumbent, on the commission to come to a decision regarding it. I do not mind clarifying the language, so long as proper protection is afforded. Only the other day, there was on the continent of Europe a glaring instance of statements being made by a quasi-political leader which led to considerable trouble and turmoil. The same sort of thing might occur here. The welfare of the community, in its highest aspect, is what is aimed at by the clause. The language used connotes an absolute lack of relationship with politics. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch's</inline> proposal is well meant, but does not quite fill the bill. </para>

                    <para>. - I intend to support the amendment. If any justification were needed for it, the speech that has just been delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson</inline> furnishes it. That honorable senator is a prominent Nationalist, who, by a turn of the political wheel, may conceivably become Postmaster-General. He said that, if he had his way, only the Leader of the Government and the Leader of the Opposition would be permitted to broadcast from A class stations. In the present Parliament, the Country party is larger numerically in the House of Representatives than is the official Opposition; yet this prominent Nationalist would not permit that party to utilize the broadcasting facilities, although he would accord that privilege to a smaller party. During the term of office of the Scullin Government we had an experience in Western Australia of unfair criticism of a political speech. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Pearce delivereda veryproper speech in the Perth Town Hall, and, without any justification, a few weeks later a supporter of the then Governmentin another place, questioned his right to make it. In the past, this power has been used wrongly against political parties. Since it is impossible to attain perfection, it will be far better to leave in the hands of the commission the power to prohibit political speeches. as suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch,</inline> instead of in the hands of a Minister whose office in three years' time may be filled by a person of a very different political colour. </para>

                    HAL COLEBATCH  (Western Australia)  [6.13]. -  I trust that the Minister will consider the possibility of adding some proviso that will have the effect of removing from party political control decisions relating to political speeches. He has suggested that he is anxious to do that. If he is, it should be by no means difficult. I fully agree with him regarding the necessity for providing against the broadcasting of undesirable matter. I have had the privilege of broadcasting from A class stations in London. Their unvarying practice is to have handed in to them a day or two beforehand a complete copy of the matter that it is proposed to broadcast. While one is broadcasting, an officer of the station follows the matter, any departure from which by the broadcaster results in his being immediately switched off. Therefore, there really is no difficulty in compelling a broadcaster to confine himself to what the commission decides may properly be broadcast.

                    <para>The financial and economic depression now affecting practically every civilized country is due almost entirely to the vast expenditure and general waste of money incurred in providing armaments and other war material in order to carry on the Great War, in which the leading nations of the world were' engaged for over four years. The United States of America, which did not enter the conflict until towards its termination, was, in the matter of trade, placed at a great advantage compared with other nations. While combatants were busily engaged in manufacturing for war purposes, the United States of America was able to secure additional trade, and by that means derive substantial financial benefit. Great Britain having decided to render  financial assistance to some of the nations assisting her, was eventually confronted with serious problems, and, after the termination of the war, found the work pf financial and economic rehabilitation extremely difficult. After the Treaty of Versailles had been signed, and the nations of the world were endeavouring to get back to normal conditions, the peoples of all civilized countries were urged to stimulate production in order to rehabilitate industry. Heavy indemnities were imposed upon Germany, Austria and Turkey; but it was soon obvious to everyone that those countries could not possibly meet the payments expected of them. The reparations already made have taken the form not of currency but of goods. Owing to the extensive use of modern machinery, production has become greater than consumption, and international finance generally has for some years been seriously disorganized. The Commonwealth Government having asked the British Government to arrange for certain British financiers to advise the Commonwealth with respect to its financial position, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Otto</inline> Niemeyer and Professor Gregory visited this country, and after consultation with the Prime Minister and various members of the Cabinet laid down a programme which it was said would help Australia out of its difficulties. The policy which was then adopted as a result of the recommendations of those two gentlemen has since been discarded. Early in 1930, the Premier of New South Wales <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lang)</inline> attended a Premiers Conference held in Canberra, and at that gathering he pointed out that unless there was a reduction in interest rates to bondholders he would not support a general scaling down of salaries and wages. He contended that there should be equality of sacrifice. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> was not prepared to support the policy of the other State Premiers. When asked by the then Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Soullin)</inline> as to the policy he favoured, he said that there should be a general scaling down of interest on our external debt for a period of, I think, 62 years. The basis of that suggestion was the arrangement which had been entered into with respect to the amount owing to the United States of America by Great Britain under which Britain was able ro extend concessions to Italy and Prance. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang,</inline> who has never in Parliament or elsewhere advocated a policy of repudiation, asked for a moratorium covering a period of two years.  His  second proposal was with respect to interest on internal debts, which he said should be reduced from 5 per cent, or 6 per cent, to 3 per cent. When the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> was attending an Imperial Conference in London, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. .Lyons,</inline> the present Prime Minister and leader of the United Australia party, as Acting Treasurer, submitted a proposal to the Labour caucus which was supported by a majority of its members, for the launching of a conversion loan covering over £30,000,000 worth of bonds held by the Australian people. When practically the whole of that amount was subsequently converted at rates of interest lower than 5 per cent., it constituted an act of deliberate repudiation of a pledge given through the press and in other ways. Although it was originally stated that if bondholders converted their bonds they would be paid a certain rate, it was eventually found that the Government could not stand up to its undertaking and that they would have to comply with the wishes of the Government. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang's</inline> third proposition was the abolition of the gold standard and the substitution of a goods standard. Honorable senators will recall that about that time the Central Reserve  Bank Bill was under consideration in this chamber, and, at the request of the then Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> the  Chairman  of the Commonwealth Bank Board, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Gibson, was summoned to appear before the bar of the Senate to answer certain questions in connexion with that measure. On that occasion I asked <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Gibson whether he favoured a goods standard, and he replied that he did not know what was meant by it. One would have thought that such a distinguished financier would know what was meant by a goods standard, concerning which there are numerous works in the Parliamentary and other libraries, written by expert financial authorities. I do not blame <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Gibson for evading the question. </para>

                            <para>- If the Assistant Minister will give me sufficient time I shall do so. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Gibson told the Senate on that occasion that the abandonment of the gold standard would seriously interfere with the efficient working of State instrumentalities, dislocate the social services of the Commonwealth, and lead to chaos. But what do we see to-day? Members in another place are discussing a measure introduced by the Assistant Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> to authorize the shipment of all or part of the remaining gold reserve of approximately £10,000,000 to London, to be held there, in sterling, against London commitments, so that, in the near future, we may or may not have any appreciable sum in gold in the vaults of the Commonwealth Bank. This being so, of what value is the undertaking of the Treasurer, printed on the face of every Commonwealth note, to pay its value in gold on demand at the head office of the Commonwealth Bank in Sydney? I do not know whether this promise by the Treasurer is or is not a confidence trick; but I am quite certain that if I approached <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Riddle,</inline> the Governor of the bank in Sydney, and asked for gold in return for a Commonwealth bank note, I would meet with a refusal, and possibly the bank authorities would suspect that I had lately escaped from Callan Park. Is the promise of the Treasurer to pay gold on demand a lie, or is it capable of fulfilment? Clearly it is a lie, because we all know that our note issue now is inconvertible. Like many other countries, we have gone off the gold standard." From 1914 to 1925 Great Britain was off gold. In the latter year it returned to the gold standard, but a few months ago, because of serious financial difficulties, it again abandoned it.' </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator is endeavouring to split straws. It is a fact that Great Britain has gone off the gold standard, as also have many European countries, including Italy and the Balkan States. Japan lately has also been conducting a war without gold as a backing for its currency. The experience of the last few years in Australia and elsewhere has shown that the volume and value of the primary and secondary production of any country are the only true criterion of its solvency. It is probable that, in the course of a few months, following the passage of the bill now before another place to amend the Commonwealth Bank Act, the entire gold reserve now in the control of the Commonwealth Bank will have been sent to London, so we shall have to rely entirely upon the output of our primary and secondary industries for the discharge of our overseas obligations. </para>

There is ample evidence on every hand that in their hearts a not inconsiderable section of the commercial and business world in Australia and overseas approve of the Lang plan, but some in this country object that it was launched too crudely; that it might have been introduced in an acceptable form.

                    <para>Very soon a large delegation will leave Australian shores to take part in the Imperial Economic Conference at Ottawa. In my opinion, that delegation is too large, and will prove to be too costly, but we may leave that matter for discussion on some future occasion. It will  have important work to do, and its difficulties will not be any the lighter because of the reported statement by the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> that Australia would not at Ottawa seek preferences with regard to wool and wheat. I am aware that the Attorney-General has denied the statement attributed to him, and for the moment I am inclined to give him the benefit of the doubt ; but when he returns to Australia I shall expect him to state definitely what he did say in Loudon a few weeks ago. If Australia is to obtain any benefit from the Ottawa Conference, its representatives will have to put up a good fight. I hope they will not neglect to press the views which I am expressing to-night. Even the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> has admitted that the interest charges on our overseas obligations must be scaled down, but his attitude is, to say the least, somewhat inconsistent. On one hand he is in violent conflict with the Premier of. New South Wales, whose principal aim is to bring about a reduction of interest payments, and, with his eyes on London, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyons</inline> is pleading on behalf of the Australian people that something should be done to relieve this country of that burden. It is easy to predict the fate of this motion. I have no doubt that it will be defeated.

The Minister in charge of the bill said that it was his desire that all political parties should be dealt with fairly. While not wishing to issue any threat, I point out that if the present Government is not prepared to treat all political parties alike, there is a danger that the precedent so established will react against it, and that a future government may retaliate. </para>

                    <para>. - In this matter the commission must be vested with a discretionary power. In the event of there being ten or twelve political parties in a State, the commissionwould be obliged to allow the leader of each of those parties to broadcast a message to the electors. That would undoubtedly cause inconvenience. In South Australia where there are to-day at least six different political parties, the position would be intolerable if the commission had to allow them all the use of the broadcasting service. In England, only the leaders of the big parties are allowed to broadcast messages to the people, and then only on special occasions, notwithstanding that they have not the benefit of B class stations. I suggest that this matter be dealt with by regulation, which the Senate may disallow. I oppose the amendment for, if  it were carried, the benefits which we hope will accrue to the people from this measure could not be realized. </para>

                    COLEBATCH (Western Australia) [8.39]  -  I am not so much concerned with protecting the interests of political parties as with protecting the people of Australia. Under our Constitution, provision is made for the Constitution to be amended by a referendum of the people. It sometimes happens that two political parties take the same stand in regard to the matter referred to the people ; and, strangely enough, the people, instead of regarding that agreement with suspicion, areinclined to support their proposal.

If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn's</inline> amendment is defeated, or is withdrawn, I propose to move the insertion of a new clause to provide that that commission shall have the power to determineto what extent, and in what manner, political speeches may be broadcast. Unless we are prepared to trust to the capacity, integrity, and impartiality of the commission, we had better not proceed with this bill. But if, on the other hand, we feel that we can trust the commission, then we should leave to it, rather than to the Minister, the control of political broadcasting. </para>

                    <para>. -  I see no good purpose in altering the definition of "national broadcasting stations." In dealing with clause 16, the committee stipulated that the commission shall supply the programmes to be broadcast from the national broadcasting stations. A suggestion was made yesterday that we should alter the  definition in clause 4, so that all stations, of whatever character, should he made available for broadcasting. I point out, however, that while certain stations, which are to be erected will, no doubt, be handed over to the control of the commission, there may be another class of stations which, though capable of being described as broadcasting stations, will carry out special experiments with regard to such matters as television. It is not desirable to include the latter within the definition of "national broadcasting stations," and, therefore, it is better to retain the elasticity which the present definition provides. If stations designed for work in connexion with television had to be handed over to the control of the commission, it would interfere with the experimental work of the Postal Department, which is now proceeding. </para>

                    <para>.- I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation ; but I am still of the opinion that the definition clause needs amendment in the direction that I indicated some time ago. My suggestion was that the definition should read as follows : - " National broadcasting stations " means and includes all stations owned or controlled by the Commonwealth Government or any commission, board, or other authority set up by the Commonwealth Parliament or Government or made available 'by the Government or the Minister for the purpose of the transmission of broadcasting programmes. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>It appears to me that the form of definition I have suggested would be in the best interests of the whole community. As an alternative, the definition in the bill should be amended by the elimination of certain words, so that it would read " ' national broadcasting stations ' means stations for the purpose of the transmission of the national broadcasting programmes." </para>

                        <para>- This matter has been referred by the Australian Federation of Broadcasting Stations to its solicitors, in order to see . whether the "position of B class stations is now definitely safeguarded. It is pointed out by those solicitors, however, that there is one outstanding weakness in the definition of " national broadcasting stations." Under chat definition it would be possible for the Minister, at any time while the act was in operation, to establish broadcasting stations which would not be handed over to the commission, and which, therefore, would not come within the scope of this legislation. Such stations could be set up without further legislative authority, and could, if desired by the Minister, accept advertisements for broadcasting. The Australian Federation of Broadcasting Stations has been given to understand that it is not the present intention of the Government to establish stations of that nature; but, in order to guard against such action by any future Ministry, the solicitors to the federation strongly urge that the definition be amended to ensure that it will embrace all stations owned or controlled by the Commonwealth.

                    <para>. - This amendment appears to me to cut right across and  to conflict with the provisions of the Wireless Telegraphy Act. If it is the intention of the committee absolutely to cramp the style of the Postmaster-General in relation to wireless telegraphy and broadcasting, let that be made plain. But if, on the other hand, it is desired that broadcasting,, which <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> the subject of this bill, shall be controlled in' the manner consented to by the committee, let us not do anything that will detrimentally affect that purpose. To insist that the rights conferred upon the Postmaster-General under the Wireless Telegraphy Act, of erecting, maintaining, and using stations and appliances for different purposes, should be abrogated, would have the result of curbing the activities of the department. I want honorable senators to act with their eyes open. I did not quite see the point the other day when this proposal was first mooted.' What is aimed at is, simply to prevent the Postmaster-General from erecting any stations other than those that are to he handed over to the commission. That body will have given into its control the stations that are to be used for broadcasting purposes only. </para>

                        <para>- It looks to me very much like that. I do not know what the idea is; but it is quite clear that, once the Postmaster-General had handed over the chain of stations that has been mapped out, and those that are in contemplation, he dare not proceed further. It is difficult to explain the subtle distinctions that are drawn. It may be said, however, that a station which is fit for broadcasting is suitable also for a. number of other purposes; whereas a station that may not be suitable as a broadcasting station may be quite useful for some other purpose. Under the Wireless Telegraphy Act, the Postmaster-General is entrusted with the power to erect stations. This amendment would prove coercive, and there would be no inducement for him to do more than provide those stations that are required by the commission for broadcasting purposes. Where is the necessity for this proposed provision ? Everything that is needed for the conduct of broadcasting has already been planned or provided, and will be handed over. Why should all stations be made available to the commission? It appears to me that that point has been overlooked. This savours of the protection of B class stations, and I ask the committee to reject the amendment. </para>

Under clause 22, the commission is prohibited from broadcasting advertisements. It is feared that, because of the looseness of this definition, the Government itself might use stations for the purpose of broadcasting advertisements. If the Minister can suggest any other way of closing that loophole, so that the spirit of clause 22 may be given effect, I do not believe that

If it is, I must oppose the proposal.I cannot see any other object in the amendment. The commission will not broadcast advertisements, nor do anything of that nature. The amendment seeks to force into the hands of a commission, under whose control they may be perfectly useless, all stations that are erected in the future. </para>

                <para class="block">Unless these words are added, all the objections raised under the previous clause will remain. Under the proposed new clause, the commission may, if it thinks it conducive to the fuller development of broadcasting, establish factories or engage in trading. Under the measure as originally introduced, the Government recognized the necessity for restricting the powers of the commission by providing that it should not engage in any subsidiary business without the approval of the Minister. The Minister is now asking the committee to grant the commission power to engage in trading or manufacturing. This matter has already been fully debated, and I trust that the amendment I have moved will be acceptable to the Government. </para>

                    <para>This bill is to approve an agreement entered into between the Commonwealth and the State Government of Queensland with respect to the inspection of meat at the abattoirs of the Queensland Meat Industry Board, Brisbane. At the instance of this department, the then Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> wrote to the Premier of Queensland, on the 27th J anuary, 1931, suggesting that, in order to avoid duplication and overlapping, the inspection of meat to be slaughtered at the State abattoirs at Brisbane - both for local consumption and for export - be carried out by Commonwealth officers. The question was investigated by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> S. Duncan, Commonwealth Public Service Inspector, who discussed the matter fully with the Premier of Queensland, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. A.</inline> E. Moore, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sunners, chairman</inline> of the Queensland </para>
                    <para class="block">Meat Industry Board, and the State Public Service Commissioner. Discussion with the Meat Industry Board revealed the fact that the concentration of inspection of meat, whether for export or for local consumption, in one set of officers would assist in cheapening operating costs, and would enable operators at the abattoirs to find an outlet, for their produce in the export market to an extent which was not possible under conditions then existing. After considering the representations of departmental officers and the Meat Industry Board, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Duncan</inline> recommended that it was desirable in the interests of the industry that the inspection of meat slaughtered at the Brisbane abattoirs should be entrusted to Commonwealth officers. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Duncan's</inline> recommendation was accepted by. the Commonwealth Government and by the Government of Queensland, and an agreement to give effect to it has been signed by the Prime Minister and the Premier of Queensland on behalf of their respective governments. This agreement, which forms the schedule to this bill, came into operation on the 25th November, 1931. It will remain in force for three years, and thereafter until determined by six months' notice by either party. By this agreement the Commonwealth undertakes - <inline font-style="italic">(a)</inline> To carry out on behalf of the State the 'inspection of all meat for local consumption slaughtered* at the State abattoirs, Brisbane; (o) to appoint certain State meat inspectors to the Commonwealth Public Service; (c) to re-appoint any such officers to the State Service on the determination of this agreement should the Commonwealth and those officers so desire. The State agrees to pay to the Commonwealth the cost of - (a) the salaries and allowances of five meat inspectors; (6) providing relief of "such inspectors during leave of absence; (c) superannuation and furlough in respect of these meat inspectors. </para>
                    <para>The cost of these services is estimated at £1,500 per annum, and the number of inspectors referred to may be increased should the volume of work justify it. In that case the payment to be made by the State will be increased accordingly. The proposal embodied in the bill was approved by the late Government, and has been endorsed by the present Government. As already stated, an agreement to give effect to the arrangement has been signed; but, under the Constitution, it can have no legal effect unless authorized by the Parliaments of the Commonwealth and Queensland. The bill is submitted in order to obtain the' necessary authority so far as the Commonwealth is concerned. It is understood that legislation will- be introduced into the Queensland Parliament as early as convenient to ratify the agreement. </para>
                    <para>This agreement is the first of its kind to be submitted for ratification. Others, it is hoped, will be concluded in the near future with the object of eliminating overlapping and duplication in State and Commonwealth services. In this connexion it may be mentioned that the Commonwealth and State governments have agreed that the inspection of fresh apples and pears, both for local consumption and for export, shall be carried out by officers of the State Government Service, and an agreement is now being drawn up for signature on behalf of the respective governments. Negotiations are also proceeding, and have practically reached finality, between the Commonwealth and Queensland Governments whereby the inspection of butter at Brisbane, both for local consumption and for export, will be performed by Commonwealth officers. </para>
                    <para>This measure is submitted in pursuance of a policy of dispensing with overlapping in Commonwealth and State Governmental activities, which has led to unnecessary expense. </para>

The Scullin Government proposed to introduce a similar measure. I take this opportunity to direct the attention of the Government to certain articles which have appeared in the press with respect to the Australian meat industry, and which are of sufficient importance to merit its attention.

                        <para>The freetrade interests papers continue barefacedly to stigmatize the meat scheme. A great deal of the meat ramp actually is the freetraders' ramp. They deliberately issued a document marked " private and confidential " to freetrade papers to head the remainder of the press for the purpose of securing a flyingstart for the anti-dominion propaganda. There never was such a burst of freetrade indignation. The public was told to-day that if the scheme was adopted beef would be' a shilling a mouthful. The freetrade Star rushed reporters to Smithfield, where they were anonymously told that it was practically impossible for Australia to fatten bullocks in less than five years. Even then theywere uneatable, and it was also emphasized that all Australian beef which was frozen might be sold with foreign beef in special shops, necessitating increased marketing costs. If the Argentine's supply was stopped the prices would soar terrifically. The <inline font-style="italic">Star</inline> sneeringly asserts that the dominions are scared to death at the prospects of Argentine mutton and lamb wiping them off the market, and adds that the British organized meat trade would fight the scheme to the last ditch. </para>

I did not have the privilege of visiting the Smithfield market, but I nave read a number of adverse criticisms by certain Australians who have impressed our Australian producers that, if they wish to hold the market, they must pay more attention to beef production. They have told us that the Argentine producers are our keenest competitors, and are determined to capture the world's markets by the production of what is known as " baby " beef. </para>

                            <para>- Under clause 4of the agreement Queensland will undertake to pay the salaries and allowances of five meat inspectors, provide relief for such inspectors during leave of absence, and be responsible for the annual charge necessary for their superannuation benefits. If that State defaults in the agreement, will  the  Prime Minister call out his special constabulary of 200 braves with their nice little batons, and instruct them to seize all the meat hanging in the Queensland meat works ? I feel sure that the Queensland senators will have something  to  say about this bill. I agree with the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Dooley)</inline> that as the Australian meat trade is in a very precarious position, it is to be hoped that bur delegates ut the Ottawa Conference will be able to secure some concessions for our producers in the British market. Within the last few day a we have been informed, in the cable news, that Lord Vestey, who is largely interested in the meat industry of the Argentine, has declared that it intends to fight to retain its hold on the English market. </para>

                        <para>. It is not' for me to tell <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline> officially what would be done by the Commonwealth if Queensland defaulted under this agreement, but I think the general attitude of members supporting the Government on the bill will be this: That until the Government of any State deliberately defaults in respect of any of its obligations, there will be an assumption that it proposes to honour its obligations. If a State defaulted to the extent not merely of the cost of five inspectors as provided in clause 4 of the agreement in this bill, but to the extent of millions of pounds, it would be very difficult for its government to get further credit from the Commonwealth. We may assume, however, that Queensland will honour its liabilities, and I only wish the same could be said of every other State in the Commonwealth. </para>
