            <para>HIS EXCELLENCY was pleased to deliver the following speech: - </para>
            <para>Gentlemen of the Senate, and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives - </para>
            <para>You are called together to deliberate upon matters of urgent importance to the well-being of the Commonwealth. </para>
            <para>My Ministers are deeply conscious of the fact that transcending in importance all other matters of public business at the present time is the necessity for maintaining the soundness of national finance and for hastening, so far as is within their power, the conditions that will bring employment to the workless. It is to the solution of these two fundamental problems that you will bo asked to direct your ' energies largely during the coming months. </para>
            <para>While my advisers believe that the new year has opened with a healthier and brighter feeling in the community, they stress the importance of realizing that, in the final result, a return of prosperous conditions in the Commonwealth must depend, in large measure, upon the recovery of world prices of commodities. So far, they point out, there are no indications of such a general upward trend of price levels as would justify anticipations of an immediate recovery from the prevailing economic depression. The upward trend in export prices noted recently has arisen mainly from depreciation of sterling, and there has been little, if any, improvement in gold prices. </para>
            <para>A policy of merely waiting for an improvement in world prices would involve very grave risks to the nation as a whole. Expenditure, both public and private, must be adjusted to. available means. </para>
            <para>In the circumstances, therefore, my Ministers believe that it is their paramount duty to ensure that all the governments of Australia should faithfully and steadfastly pursue a common objective in adjusting their budgetary expenditure to meet the altered position of the nation as a whole. Strict adherence to this principle is of vital importance in the rehabilitation both of our national credit and of Australian industry. With this purpose in view, my Ministers recently called into conference representatives of the governments of the States. The exceptional circumstances of the States of Western Australia and Tasmania have necessitated special financial consideration being extended to them. My advisers, however, are satisfied  that  there is a general determination to adhere to the plan of financial and economic rehabilitation which has already produced a favorable effect upon the position of Australia. </para>
            <para>My Ministers find it necessary to qualify this statement by reference to the position of the State of New South Wales. They deem it their duty to emphasize that the deficit in the accounts of the Government of that State gravely affects the whole budgetary position of Australia. Unless definite action is taken the whole Commonwealth may be involved in a financial collapse, the avoidance of which has been the main objective of the self-sacrificing measures adopted by all the other Governments. My Ministers also view with the utmost concern the failure of the Government of the State of New </para>
            <para class="block">South Wales to meet its public obligations. The effect of this default has been most serious. While unhesitatingly condemning the policy that has led to public default by the Government of the State of New South Wales, my advisers have felt impelled, in the interests of the credit of the nation as a whole, to honour the obligations of that Government. My Ministers will take steps to compel the repayment of these moneys to the Commonwealth by the Government of the State. </para>
            <para>It is impossible, at the present time, to proceed with large programmes of public works. The great majority of wage-earners must necessarily be dependent upon private industry, whether primary or secondary, for their livelihood. My advisers, therefore, regard it as of cardinal importance that all possible steps should be taken to stimulate private industry, and all proposed legislation should be viewed in the light of this consideration. </para>
            <para>My Ministers consider that the Disarmament Conference is one of the most vitally important international conferences that has yet been held. A real reduction and limitation of armaments would make a great contribution to the peace and welfare of humanity. The problems of disarmament are closely allied to those of reparations and of war debts. All of these problems have a fundamentally important bearing on the well-being and progress of our Commonwealth. My Ministers have, therefore, made provision for representation of the Commonwealth at this conference. </para>
            <para>My Ministers believe that the present year affords an unprecedented opportunity for making a definite advance in the direction of empire trade reciprocity. </para>
            <para class="block">Owing to world-wide depression, the volume of world trade has declined, and the struggle for markets is becoming still more intense. My advisers are convinced that these new circumstances must be met with a new policy and that that policy should be one of reciprocal empire trade. My Ministers will, therefore, take steps to ensure that the Commonwealth of Australia is adequately represented at the forthcoming Imperial Economic Conference at Ottawa. The decisions of the conference will be of great importance in relation to the future prosperity of our country. The representatives of the Commonwealth of Australia will take their part in the discussions not in a spirit of selfish bargaining but with a determination to formulate policies that will prove to be of lasting benefit to the British peoples as a whole. </para>
            <para>My Ministers recognize the special importance of the tariff at the present time, and its intimate relation to the welfare of both primary and secondary industries. It is considered that, with industry generally in its present depressed condition, changes in duties should be made with caution and only after full inquiry and consideration. In preparing proposals for tariff revision, my Ministers will give close attention to recommendations made by the Tariff Board. Subject to certain alterations which will be proposed, steps will be taken to ensure the continuance of the tariff schedules now in force, pending inquiry by the Tariff Board into a number of important items in the schedules. My Ministers will, in dealing with all phases of the tariff, , bear closely in mind the importance of preserving a satisfactory balance of trade, but, subject to that consideration, will review the existing special schedules of surcharges and prohibitions . of imports. </para>
            <para>A measure will be introduced for the purpose of providing that companies and others carrying on the business of insurance in the Commonwealth shall make deposits with the Commonwealth in order to safeguard the interests of policyholders upon a uniform basis throughout Australia. </para>
            <para>A measure to amend the law with respect to unlawful associations will be submitted. </para>
            <para>Consideration has been given by my Ministers to important aspects of wireless broadcasting in the Commonwealth, and, in particular, to the future control of the technical and programme activities of broadcasting. A bill to provide for the appointment of a commission to control broadcasting programmes on the national service will be submitted for your consideration. </para>
            <para>The railway services constitute the chief problem confronting the governments of Australia in their efforts to re-organize their public finances. My Ministers attach great importance to effective measures for the co-ordination of the various transport services in Australia. Every activity in the Commonwealth is affected by transport, and the ability of primary producers, manufacturers and' merchants successfully to carry on their businesses and to provide employment depends, in no inconsiderable measure, upon the provision of reasonably cheap transport facilities. The governments of the Commonwealth and the States have agreed that the whole question of the effective co-ordination of the various transport services should be considered by a conference of experts, under an independent chairman. </para>
            <para>In order to reduce parliamentary expenditure, it is proposed to introduce  legislation to suspend the operation of the Committee of Public Accounts Act and the Common-wealth Public Works Committee Act. If it should be thought desirable to have a parliamentary inquiry into any matters, it would be possible to constitute a select committee for that purpose. </para>
            <para>A bill embodying amendments to the War Service Homes Act will be submitted to you. </para>
            <para>It is proposed in the present session to deal with the immediate and pressing problems to which reference has been made. There are other questions of great importance, such as those of constitutional alteration, which require consideration, but the time available since the election has not been sufficient to make it possible to formulate a detailed policy on these matters. </para>
            <para>In the earnest hope that Divine Providence may guide your deliberations and further the welfare of the people of the Commonwealth, I now leave you to the discharge of your high and important duties. </para>

                <para>The late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ogden</inline> rendered valuable service to his country in the Parliament of Tasmania, and later in the Commonwealth Parliament. He was well known to all of us, and was held in the highest regard by honorable senators on both sides of the chamber. For sixteen years he was a member of the Tasmanian House of Assembly, and during that period held office as a Minister in several governments. Later, he entered the Commonwealth Parliament, and, for a period of approximately twelve months commencing in November  1928,  acted as an Honorary Minister. It may well be said that he was one of the old type of trade unionists. As a working miner, he devoted a considerable part of his earlier life to the organization of his fellow workers into trade unions for the protection of their mutual interests, and in that capacity ho earned their profound respect and gratitude. As an unpaid trade union official, ho took part in many conferences. It was at one of these that I first met him and, like so many others who knew him in his prime, I was deeply impressed by his earnestness and sincerity, his fearlessness and independence of mind. These were marked characteristics of his political life. He differed from many honorable senators on a number of vital political issues, and since he was most outspoken in the expression of his views, his criticism sometimes brought him into violent conflict with those who held opinions contrary to his own, but I am sure that I am voicing the opinion of all honorable senators when I say that even his strongest opponents always gave him credit for honesty and sincerity. Indeed, sincerity, courage and plain common sense were his outstanding attributes. I deeply regret his death. He was a personal friend of mine, as well as of many other members, and the Senate is the poorer for his passing. But our loss is as nothing compared with the loss sustained by his widow and family. Possessing as he did, characteristics which earned for him the deep respect and regard of his fellow men, he must have enjoyed, in full measure, the love and affection of his wife and family, We can only hope that Divine Providence will solace them in their bereavement. I am sure the. Senate will carry this motion with great regret at the passing of this earnest, capable and loyal Australian citizen. </para>

                    <para>.- As one who, perhaps, was more closely connected with the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ogden</inline> in the political life of Tasmania, than was any other honorable senator, I associate myself with the motion so ably moved by the right honorable the Leader of the Senate, and supported by the Leader of the Opposition. Twenty-six years ago I first met <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ogden</inline> as a member of the State Parliament; but I had .already known of him as a private citizen residing on the west coast of Tasmania. While members of the Parliament of Tasmania, he and I differed widely in our political views ; but I always held him in the highest esteem, because of his manly attitude in debate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ogden</inline> deservedly earned the respect of every member of the Tasmanian Parliament during his long association with it, and there is no need for me to remind honorable senators of the esteem in which he was held here when, later, he was transferred to the higher sphere of federal polities, as a member of this chamber. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ogden</inline> was never ashamed of his convictions. "When 'he felt that he had been holding wrong views, he was man enough to admit his error, and to espouse opinions which previously he opposed, so long as he was convinced that they were right. Knowing his relatives,  I  feel sure that this mark of appreciation from the late senator's colleagues will alleviate to some extent their sorrow at his death.  I  join with others who have spoken in expressing to his widow and children our deep . sympathy in their bereavement. </para>

Shortly before his death he gave me a message to convey to you, sir, and his fellow senators. He told  me  that he realized that the state of his health was such that he was not likely to attend the sittings of this Parliament again, and he asked mc, therefore, to give to you, sir, and to the other members of the Senate, his very best wishes. Honorable senators know the sterling worth of their late colleague. He was a conscientious  man,  a true patriot, and while  I  am pleased to associate myself with the motion,  I  deeply regret the occasion for it. </para>

                <para class="block">As  time goes on, death will come to each  of  us. After death comes burial, and with the burial the covering of any defects, the obliteration of all errors, as well as the extinguishing of all dissension, leaving only tender memories and loving recollections. When we reflect on tie life of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ogden,</inline> and review his work, we appreciate that he had a profound knowledge of politics, coupled with the practical sense that kept' his idealism in touch with facts.  His  faith in democracy, his cautious handling . of economic tendencies, saved him from mistakes. He had, moreover, a de.ep knowledge of men, while his deeper knowledge of history tended to keep his views always sane. But, perhaps, the one thing that stood out in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ogden</inline> was his great love of nationality. He saw its essential relationship to democracy, and he ever endeavoured to put it on an unassailable foundation. A man of wide vision, he was above petty jealousies, and free from malice. Notwithstanding that in others, as in himself, he saw defects, he was tolerant in all his dealings with his fellow men, excepting, perhaps, when in the political sphere he felt that vital principles were at stake. Yet his tolerance did not prevent him from standing foursquare for what he regarded to be his duty. With <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ogden</inline> duty was no abstract theory, but something for which he was prepared to sacrifice even the prospect of power and success. Within the Commonwealth today is being waged a fight for the very existence of democracy. The people of Australia have far too much faith in freedom, too great a sense of justice, too much love and goodwill for their glorious heritage, to remain subservient to those powers of reaction and tyranny which menace its life and would reduce democracy to a condition of serfdom. Only by emulating men like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ogden</inline> along the path of duty can we do for the people of Australia what they desire of us. The death of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ogden</inline> is a distinct loss to Tasmania, a personal loss to senators from that State, and the Commonwealth Parliament is the poorer for his passing. With other honorable senators  I  join in expressing my sympathy to his widow and family in their bereavement. </para>

He was born in the district in which I now reside, and, as a mere stripling whose health even then was not robust, set out to make his way in the world. While yet a youth, he was employed in the shearing sheds in the district in which he was born, and afterwards in the mines of Western Australia. Some time later he rendered splendid service to Tasmania as a member of the Parliament of that State, and later was selected by the people of the island State to represent them in the Senate. </para>

                    was a great Australian democrat, a splendid, fearless, scholarly man, and rendered great service not only to the State of Tasmania, but also to the whole Commonwealth. He was earnest, energetic, and capable, one of nature's gentlemen. We deeply regret his passing, and our hearts go out to those whom he has left behind.  His  colleagues in the Senate, and those who were his comrades, will miss him very much indeed. .

                    <para>- Before putting the motion I should like to endorse all that has fallen from the lips of honorable senators. I knew <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ogden</inline> very well. Apart from our parliamentary association we had tastes that in many respects were similar, and this led to our spending many hours together in discussing a variety of subjects. I was familiar with the honorable senator's history, and was quick to learn that the dominating trait of his character was moral courage. He was also always considerate for others. To me the most pathetic note struck during the short debate on this motion was that sounded by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Herbert</inline> Hays, when he conveyed to honorable senators their late colleague's good wishes for their future in his closing hours. Although he knew his end was near, he yet had time to think of those with whom he had been so long associated. I shall take steps to see that this motion of sympathy and condolence is appropriately conveyed to the widow and family of the deceased gentleman. </para>

                    felt that duty demanded that he should take a stand which meant severing his connexion with the party that he loved. He had been associated with that party for years, but he put duty before all other considerations, and his action on that occasion earned for him the profound respect of the people.  His  work as a parliamentarian is well known. In his early political career he was a member of the State House of Assembly, arid later became a Minister, in which capacity he rendered excellent service to Tasmania, as also he did to the Commonwealth when subsequently he became a member of this Parliament. I associate myself with the motion and express my personal and sincere sympathy with his widow in her bereavement.

                    <para>That the Senate expresses its deep regret at the sinking of British submarine M2, and tenders its heartfelt sympathy to the relatives of those who so tragically lost their lives, and to His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom in the loss the country has sustained. </para>
                    <para> Honorable senators will remember the tragic circumstances which accompanied the loss of this submarine, when 56 officers and men perished. It is a great tribute to the men who compose the British Navy that the submarine service, which is the most risky of all the services, even in training, has always attracted to it the largest number of volunteers. Several, tragedies of this character have been associated with it in peace time, but the* is perhaps one of the most tragic of all. I feel sure that honorable senators desire to be associated with a motion expressing regret at the sinking of the submarine, and our sympathy with the bereaved in the loss that they have sustained by the death of their loved ones under such sorrowful circumstances. </para>

                            <para>. - I second the motion. Unquestionably the sinking of this submarine was a tragedy,, because of the number of gallant men who lost their lives without apparently having a chance to put up a fight to save themselves. The fact that such a thing can happen in peace time should be an inspiration to those great minds whose influence is being exerted in the direction.  of securing the abolition of submarines. The tragedy in this case is accentuated by the widespread nature of its effects, and it will be felt just as. keenly by the relatives of the men as it will in the homes that have been left behind by the officers who perished. It is fitting that we should extend our deepest sympathy to those who have been bereaved, because they are of our own kith and kin. Let us hope that the sacrifice that has been made will furnish a forcible reason for the abolition of such a dangerous occupation in every civilized country. </para>

By mutual arrangement between the parties - the Leader of the Opposition in another place <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> was consulted, but such a course was not possible in this chamber, because at the time no Leader of the Opposition had been appointed - in future the adjournment will be not for the day but only for one hour. </para>

I can assure honorable senators -who are leading the Opposition, that the Government will extend to them the same courteous treatment which they extended to myself and other Ministers when our positions were' reversed. I need not repeat the hoary old joke about the length of time honorable senators will be in Opposition. I hope that on both sides of the chamber there will be a desire to.' advance the interests of the country.

Our task will indeed be a difficult one, but we shall endeavour to carry it out. We shall, in the interests of the country, give the Government, quite courteously, as much trouble as we are capable of. I am sure that this chamber will do its share of the very necessary and urgent work that is required of this legislature for the benefit of the people of the Commonwealth, and I can assure Ministers that whatever legislation they may bring forward with that end in view, will find no obstruction from this side of the chamber. </para>
