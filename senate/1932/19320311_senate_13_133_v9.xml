<para> I would refer the honorable senator to a statement made by the Prime Minister in another place to-day indicating that the whole question of unemployment is engaging the Government's earnest attention. It is not thought that any useful purpose would be served by adopting the suggestion of the honorable senator at this stage.

                    <para>In June, 1931, the Parliamentary Joint Committee of Public Accounts decided to conduct an inquiry into the matters set forth in the motion. In the course of its inquiry the committee sought the aid of prominent financial experts, most of whom spent a considerable amount of time in research and preparation of matter for submission to that body. </para>
                    <para>At the time of the dissolution of Parliament last year the committee was engaged in the preparation of a compre hensive report, and those members of the last Public Accounts Committee who are members of the present Parliament have asked that they be appointed a joint select committee for the purpose of completing and presenting a report. The Public Accounts Committee regarded the investigation as one of great importance. The Government considered the representations made and decided to submit to Parliament a motion for the appointment of a joint select committee and to ask for the appointment of three senators who were members of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts of the twelfth Parliament. </para>
                    <para>Each member of the late committee has signified his willingness to act on the select committee in a purely honorary capacity, and the only additional cost involved in the inquiry will be the cost of printing the report. No further witnesses are to be called to give evidence. The Government feels that it would be a pity if the work begun by the late public accounts committee were not completed. I am sure that we all appreciate the public spirit of the members of that committee, who have offered to complete the work without additional cost, and, on behalf of the Government, I wish to express our thanks to them. In the appointment of this select committee the usual procedure is not being observed for very good reasons, which are well known to honorable senators. Obviously, if we appointed members who were not included in the personnel of the Public Accounts Committee they would be at a disadvantage, because they would not have heard the witnesses examined, and would be obliged to peruse the whole of the evidence taken. Possibly, also, they would want to recall some of the witnesses. For this reason we are departing from the usual procedure, but in the special circumstances I ask the Senate to agree to the motion in this form. </para>
                    <para>SenatorDOOLEY (New South Wales) [2.41].  -  I support the motion. I appreciate the excellent work that has been performed by the Committee of Public Accounts. The Commonwealth would suffer a considerable loss if the inquiry upon which that committee was engaged when the last Parliament was dissolved, was not carried to a conclusion. The correct action is being taken in delegating to those who were so deeply interested in the subject the task of completing the inquiry. It is too late to regret that the Committee of Public Accounts has passed out of existence. That being so, the Senate would be well advised to give to the proposed select committee the power to complete the report, which, I understand, is a most valuable one. </para>

                        <para>. - I can assure the Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Greene)</inline> that the power to which he refers is preserved.  I  point out, as I have often done from the chair, that at present the only method of reference to a select committee occurs at a stage before the bill is read a second time. The Standing Orders - if I may be allowed to speak generally for a moment - are framed on the understanding that no bill shall enter the committee stage before the second reading has been passed in some form. After all, a select committee is a committee stage of a bill, and the committee stage is not supposed to occur until the principle of the bill has been affirmed by the passing of the motion for the second reading. It is proposed under this new standing order that when the second reading stage is reached the honorable senator in charge of the bill, may move the second reading <inline font-style="italic">pro forma.</inline> Then follows the motion, "That the bill 'be committed". On that motion it is laid down that a debate may ensue corresponding in all respects with a second-reading debate. Honorable senators will see that the effect is to get to the select committee stage by the bill being read a second time <inline font-style="italic">pro forma.</inline> If the motion that the bill be committed is negatived, then the measure, so to speak, comes to a stop. The proposed new standing order has the effect of transferring the second-reading debate on the formal motion to the motion that the bil] be referred to a standing committee or a select committee. In this connexion I again refer Honorable senators to the explanatory matter concerning the practice in the Dominion of New Zealand, which is in the possession of the  Clerk  of the Senate, and is available to them. Honorable senators will see that every right to move for a select committee is to be preserved to a private member. That is the reason why he is to be afforded the opportunity to give notice when the second-reading stage is fixed. I presume, of course, that the Minister in charge of the bill would assist in this matter. At least two clear days' notice must be given of the intention to move that the bill be read a second time <inline font-style="italic">pro forma.</inline> When a Minister, or any other honorable senator in charge of a bill, arrives at the stage when he has to fix the second reading or go on with the motion for the second reading of the bill, he can, by leave of the Senate, move the second reading <inline font-style="italic">pro forma.</inline> That motion, when submitted <inline font-style="italic">pro forma,</inline> would not be debated. The second motion, that the bill be referred to a standing or a select committee, would then be moved, and the  debate upon it would correspond with that on the motion for the second' reading of a bill under the existing standing order. </para>

                        <para>. - I think that there is a good deal in the contention of the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce).</inline> I direct <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill's</inline> attention to the exact wording of the proposed new standing order, which if allowed to remain in its present form,must of necessity operate more or less in a one-sided manner. When it is intended to move to refer a bill to a standing committee or a select committee, the second reading, it is provided, " may " be moved <inline font-style="italic">pro forma.</inline> I think the word " shall " should be used. In my opinion, we can clarify the position by striking out the words " When it is intended ", and inserting " If it be intimated that it is intended ". Obviously, the person in charge of a bill is the only person who can move its second reading. If he were permitted by the Standing Orders to rise and say that it was his intention to ask the Senate to refer the bill to a select committee, then a <inline font-style="italic">pro forma</inline> motion for the second reading could be moved. </para>

Before the committee of the whole comes into existence it is competent for any honorable senator to move, without notice, that the bill be referred. to a select committee or a standing com*mittee. The rights of honorable senators in that respect are fully protected. The Senate seems to be fairly well agreed that any motion for reference to a committee should be moved only after the second reading. That provision is preserved. These standing orders have been framed to preserve a practice which, I understand, exists practically throughout the Parliaments of the Empire. It is possible under them to move, even at later stages than immediately after the second reading, for a bill, or portion of a bill, to be referred to a select committee or a standing committee. I have seen that done, although not frequently. I can call to mind instances of bills having been referred to a select committee, when progress was being reported. Not only are the existing rights of honorable senators preserved under the proposed new standing orders; they are amplified, without detriment to the conduct of business. </para>

The time for referring a bill to a select committee is definitely put after the second reading, which, honorable senators will agree, is the proper place for it. The votes and proceedings of, I think, all the dominion parliaments of the Empire, are filed in the library. Those honorable senators who were members of the Standing Orders Committee, and others who have studied this subject, are agreed that the standing order works well in New Zealand, and is, indeed, a valuable aid to the conduct of business there. I commend the proposal to the committee. </para>

                        <para>. - The explanation given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill</inline> clears up the difficulty for all -practical purposes. I may' be somewhat old-fashioned, but I have always held that the assent of a member to the second reading of a bill commits him to agreement with its general principles. When the Central Reserve Bank Bill was under discussion in the Senate last year, the motion to refer it to a select committee was moved while the motion " That the bill be now read a second time", was under discussion. It is perfectly clear from our knowledge at that time that had the bill gone to the second-reading stage, it would have been defeated, and the Senate would have been deprived of the very valuable report the select committee Drought in at a later stage. An honorable senator might feel embarrassed at voting for the second reading of a bill owing to the general parliamentary practice that one who votes for the second reading of a bill is committed to the general principles of the bill. I am wondering whether the procedure now suggested would allow one in the course of the second reading to say, "I do not believe in this bill , but I shall vote for it so that later on I can move for a select committee to inquire into it, and then I may be able to sponsor it ". I do not want to find myself embarrassed. In no circumstances would I vote for the second reading of a bill until such time as it had been subjected to full consideration. </para>

                    <para class="block">The rejection of that motion is an  abso-'  lute end to the bill, having exactly the same effect as the rejection of the second reading. If anything objectionable about the measure is found in the course of investigation, before it is considered in committee of the whole Senate, then, on  the motion for commitment, the bill can be rejected. After the second reading, the- bill may be referred to a select committee or a standing committee. No rights are taken away from private members. Indeed, their rights are strengthened. The more one studies this ingenious method of keeping a bill open to rejection after the second reading has been passed, the more one admires it. I do not think that the experience of New Zealand in working this procedure for many years has disclosed many weak points. </para>

When a committee was formed to go into the question of amending the Standing Orders with a view to appointing standing committees to deal with proposals for referring bills for further investigation, one of the reasons which actuated it in recommending this proposition to refer a bill to a select committee, was that such a motion has hitherto carried with it the idea of hostility to the bill. </para>

Some years ago, I used select committees for the purpose of saving time in the committee stage in the consideration of long and technical measures. The procedure I found very useful in the case of bills requiring a lot of explanation. If such measures can be referred to a select committee which understands its work, it results in cutting down the committee stage by at least one-half. Honorable senators, in addition, ha,v,e a very much better opportunity to find out what may be the purpose of a bill. </para>

                        will shortly be introducing a measure like the Bankruptcy Bill. As it is a technical measure, he knows that there will probably be a long debate in committee on its various provisions. Therefore, he will intimate that the second reading will be taken
                        <inline font-style="italic">proforma</inline>
                        and the bill referred to  a  select committee or a standing committee. Up to that stage no member will have spoken on the measure, not even the Minister in charge of it. The committee having dealt with it will present its report, and the Minister then will move " That this bill be now committed." On that motion there can be a general debate. This is a new procedure in the Senate. In respect of such bills the debate on the motion to commit will really be the second-reading debate. If that motion is carried, the bill will go into committee of the whole Senate. That is one illustration of the working of this proposed standing order. Let us consider also the procedure under it of the Broadcasting Bill, which will be introduced next week. Say that the Government does not desire that the measure be referred to a select committee, but
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline>
                        does. The Minister in charge will move the second reading, the debate will proceed, and the vote will be taken. Then will come

                        opportunity to move that it be referred to a select committee or  a  standing committee. If the motion is carried, the committee will examine the bill, and report upon it. In what way is the right of a private member being interfered with?

                        <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has stressed the rights of Ministers as against the rights of private members. Surely he will admit that a Minister must have some additional privileges, otherwise his life would be hardly worth living. He should have the right to have a bill referred to a select committee without what sometimes proves to be a tedious second-reading debate. But the Senate has not lost its grip on a bill by the inclusion of this proposed new stage, which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> will remember was in existence in the Parliament of Western Australia when he was there. When the second-reading debate was concluded, a motion was made by the Minister in charge of the bill that the  President  do now leave the chair and that the bill be considered in committee of the whole. That stage has been restored under this proposed new standing order, and at that stage a private member is in possession of rights equal to those of a Minister. </para>

As a matter of fact a bill is made more vulnerable than was previously the case. Private members' rights are increased rather than decreased by the proposed change. </para>

I hope, therefore,  that  every effort will be made to conclude the business on the notice-paper by Thursday next. </para>

                            <para>- Some honorable senators may desire to attend the celebrations connected with the opening of the Sydney Harbour bridge. I have not been invited to the ceremony, and it would appear that no general invitation to members of this Parliament has been issued. I am not concerned about that, for even if I had been invited, I probably should not have gone. In this connexion it is interesting to compare the action of the present New South Wales Government with that of the Government of Western Australia which was in office when the pipe line erected to convey water nearly 400 miles from the coastal district to Kalgoorlie was opened. On that occasion every member of the Federal Parliament was invited to witness the ceremony. </para>
