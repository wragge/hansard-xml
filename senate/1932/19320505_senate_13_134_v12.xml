                <para class="block">The existing law creates offences and disabilities in . relation to unlawful associations and membership thereof, but does not provide machinery for securing an express declaration by competent authority as to whether or not any particular body of persons is, in fact, an unlawful association. One of the purposes of the present bill is to enable declarations to be obtained from the HighCourt or the Supreme Court of a State that a particular body of persons is or is not an unlawful association. To that end, complete machinery is provided in the bill. Once the unlawful character of an association has been established, the offence and disabilities connected with the membership, property, and propaganda of that association may be readily enforced. </para>
                <para>The supplementary provisions include power for the Attorney-General to require the answering of questions and the production of documents relating to the funds and transactions of an unlawful association. The imprint upon any book, periodical, newspaper, &amp;c, is made prima facie evidence that the book or other publication was printed or published by or on behalf of the person or body of persons specified in the imprint. The Postmaster-General is authorized to cancel any licence under the Wireless Telegraphy Act issued in respect of broadcasting stations, operated by or in the interests of an unlawful association. It is made an offence for any person to allow a meeting of an unlawful association on any premises of which he is the owner, lessee, agent or superintendent. So far as section 41 of the Constitution allows, a member of an unlawful association is debarred from enrolment for the Senate or House of Representatives. Power is taken to deport members of unlawful associations and persons who commit seditious offences, or who take part in or encourage industrial disturbances, or who, having once been deported, return to the Commonwealth. That power is not limited by the fact of a person not being a migrant ; its application is general, provided the person concerned was not born in Australia. The power of disfranchisement is limited by section 41 of the Constitution, but if this bill be agreed to, any State Parliament may legislate in aid of that power. I stress the necessity for this legislation, particularly at this juncture. The danger to the body politic is to be feared, not from the Communist party directly, but from various other organizations, dissociated in name, but in reality directing Communist activities in the Commonwealth. Friends of the Soviet Union, the League against Imperialism, and several other bodies rejoicing in equally high-sounding names really direct Communist activities, while pretending to be dissociated from them. The truth is that they advocate exactly the same vicious principles as the Communist party, and against them this legislation is directed. Proof that these bodies are unlawful associations within the meaning of the act may or may not be forthcoming; I believe that it will be. When a body is found to be an unlawful association, the consequences for which the Crimes Act provides will follow. I commend the bill to the Senate as a necessary measure to meet the intensified action and subtle methods adopted by certain bodies to evade the provisions of the existing law. </para>

                <para class="block">This measure is the outcome of a public demand for a change in the method of controlling wireless broadcasting in Australia, and marks another stage in the rapid advance which this service has made. To-day, an efficient broadcasting service is almost as essential to some people as are electricity and transport facilities; it is popular and cheap, and is undoubtedly playing a very important part in our social life. The bill proposes that control of the programmes broadcast by the national stations shall be vested in a commission, as is the control of most other public utilities, includingrailways and tramways. The supply of electricity to the people of Victoria is controlled by a commission in a most satisfactory manner. </para>
                <para>For the control of broadcasting in Australia the Government has endeavoured to follow, as nearly as possible, the British system. The technical side of broadcasting will still be controlled by the Postmaster-General's Department, but it is proposed that a broadcasting commission shall be constituted, to consist of business men, who will bring their experience to the assistance of the Government. The Government will have the benefit of the commission's knowledge and experience of the requirements of the public, and the commission will operate in association with the Postal Department in managing broadcasting in the best interests of the people of Australia. At present our listeners-in pay approximately £400,000 per annum in licence-fees, which are distributed between the holders of the patent rights - Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia)Limited, the Australian Broadcasting Company, and the Commonwealth Government. Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited receives £50,000 for its patent rights; the Australian Broadcasting Company £202,000 for its service, and the Commonwealth Government £151,000. Of the last-mentioned amount a certain part is devoted to the provision and maintenance of equipment and expert technical service, and the balance is paid into the Consolidated Revenue. The payments to the British Government out of the revenue received by the British Broadcasting Corporation are nearly in the same ratio to the total receipts as the payments to the Commonwealth Government. Of course the British revenue is much larger; it amounts to about £2,000,000 per annum., or five times as much as is received in Australia. </para>
                <para>It has been impossible to adopt, entirely, the British system of control. A separate technical staff, apart from that employed in the postal service, which consists of skilled engineers and mechanics, is at present beyond our means. It is pleasing, however, to note that a "wireless " sense has developed in this country. That is, perhaps, due to the fact that because of our isolation from the rest of the world we are dependent to some extent upon wireless for the rapid dissemination of news, and to the mechanical aptitude of a large number of young Australians. Discoveries of some importance have been made by young men with only a smattering of technical knowledge, some of whom have developed into skilled radio engineers. As to embark on the establishment of a separate technical staff is, as I have said, at present beyond our means, it has been thought economical to utilize the services of officers now employed by the Postal Department. In that department we have over 200 engineers with specialized knowledge in broadcasting, and there are approximately 3,000mechanicsemployedon work of this nature, or allied thereto. The capital value of the plant and equipment used solely for broadcasting purposes is over £200,000, and includes special research apparatus. </para>
                <para>The stations which will be directly affected by the bill are the A class stations, of which there are twelve in operation in the Commonwealth. It is desirable that further stations should be constructed, but that is a matter for future consideration, and cannot be dismissed at length in connexion with the present proposal. The Government will await recommendations on the subject, and so far has not committed itself to the erection of additional stations. </para>
                <para>The proposed commission is to consist of five members; a  chairman,  who is to receive £500 per annum, a vice-chairman at £400, and three commissioners at £300 per annum. The commission will have power to appoint a general manager and the necessary staff, and will be charged with the provision of suitable programmes. It is not contended that the commissioners shall devote the whole of their time to broadcasting work. It is not considered desirable to appoint three or four commissioners at a high salary, and require them to devote the whole of their time to the work of the broadcasting commission. Men with extensive commercial experience and the necessary qualifications will be appointed, and they will, while providing an efficient service, have regard to the interests of economy. This, it is anticipated, will enable a selection to be made from a larger number of suitable applicants. The commission will appoint the general manager. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. Instead of appointing full-time commissioners at a high remuneration, it is considered desirable to appoint part-time commissioners, and they will appoint a full-time general manager. The commissioners will formulate the general policy with respect to broadcasting, and effect will have to be given to it by the general manager. After the commission has been functioning for some time, it will be in a position to make recommendations as to what policy is considered beat in the interests of broadcasting. </para>

                <para>Although it is intended at present thai the technical side of broadcasting shall be under the control of the Postmaster-General, it may eventually be possible to place the whole control under one authority. There are various angles from which this proposal has to be considered before a definite conclusion can be reached. The present system has been found unsatisfactory to the public,  but  as the man who pays the piper should cai! the tune, it is considered necessary to institute a different system of control in the interests of those  listeners-in  who provide the revenue. It is expected that the proposed commission will provide a more satisfactory service than we now have, and provide better entertainment. </para>

                    <para>. - Since the committee reported progress yesterday I have had an opportunity to look into the question raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch. His</inline> amendments would require every customs proclamation now in force, imposing a prohibition, to be brought under' revision. That would involve a considerable amount of expensive and unnecessary work. Many of these prohibitions have been in operation since the early years of federation, and concerning them there is likely to be no difference of opinion whatever. </para>

                    suggest that we should validate any prohibition which has been covered by a proclamation within the last three years. That, I think, would meet the general desire of honorable senators. Of course, that would cover all the recent prohibitions, including the large list, for instance, contained in the proclamation issued comparatively recently, which, I think, expires in February next. In that list there were 36 prohibited articles, and the clause would cover all those, as well as a fair number of others issued during the last three years. We should not put the Customs Department to unnecessary trouble and expense. I suggest that

                        <para>- .  A  regulation embodying 500 prohibitions would cause very little, but I think that the actual number would be nearer 50 than 500. I cannot accept that as a sufficient justification for the Minister's amendment. It seems to me that the longer a prohibition has been in force without Parliament having had an opportunity of reviewing it, the greater is the necessity for us to review it now. Unless a stronger reason than has been given by the Minister can be advanced, I hope that the committee will insist on carrying my amendment. The fact that a prohibition has been in force for three years, and that the Parliament has been deprive( of an opportunity of review, is not a good reason why we should be deprived of that opportunity for ever. Apparently, if we pass the clause in the form suggested by the Minister - and there may be some prohibitions to which a majority in this chamber has strongly objected - then, merely by the fact of being kept away from Parliament improperly for three years- </para>

                        <para>-] do not hesitate to say that this has been done improperly. The section of the Customs Act authorizing the Government to prohibit imports by proclamation was undoubtedly intended by Parliament to cover only things which ought to be prohibited because of the nature of the articles themselves. If it were otherwise, the act would never have mentioned the things, the importation of which should be prohibited. The power contained in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">g</inline> of the section was given only because it was recognized that Parliament could not foresee all the articles of a deleterious and dangerous nature to which the prohibition should be applied. Therefore, the Government was given' the right to prohibit by proclamation, and in using that power to prohibit purely for protective purposes the Government has abused its power, and has acted entirely improperly. That is the sense in which 1 make use of that word, and I challenge contradiction on the point. The last Government' used a power given for the purpose of preventing the importation of articles, the use of which would be deleterious to the community, or contrary to public policy. It created a superprotection, knowing that a protective  tariff would finally have to be considered by Parliament. That Government misused its power under the Customs Act to bring about an actual prohibition, and now we are told that because of the improper use of that power, some prohibitions, which have been in operation for three years, are to be continued indefinitely, I cannot subscribe to that doctrine. </para>

                <para class="block">The paragraph has been framed in its present form in order that the Transport Commissioners of New South Wales may be dealt with in a special class by themselves. The term " statutory body " includes bodies like the Water and Sewerage Board of New South Wales, which have been constituted under the law of the State, and have obtained from the loan account of New South Wales the money for carrying out the works which they control. These bodies are required to pay interest to the State; and until <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> adopted his infamous policy, the interest payable to the bondholders who advanced the money for the construction of the works controlled by them was paid, either from the revenue they paid to the State, or, if that was not sufficient, from general revenue. Under this paragraph so much of the interest as is payable 'by these bodies, which hitherto has been paid to the State Treasurer, will now be payable to the Commonwealth Treasurer. When we reflect that the Commonwealth is now liable for the payment of all interest due by New South Wales, we must agree that it is only just that public bodies which have had the use of loan moneys to carry out certain works, and are paying both working expenses and interest, should pay that interest to the Commonwealth in order that it may meet the interest indebtedness of New South Wales. </para>

                <para class="block">Estimates submitted by the Transport Commissioners, as well as by the Treasurer of New South Wales, indicate that the railways of that State are paying working expenses, but are not earning sufficient to pay interest on the whole of the money borrowed for their construction. In the past any deficit has been met from the Consolidated Revenue. That is the position as revealed by official records supplied by the New South Wales Government. The operation of this paragraph will enable the Commonwealth to take the surplus revenue over working expenses, but not the whole of the surplus. With this paragraph in operation, there will still be left in the hands of the Transport Commissioners of New South Wales a margin sufficient to run the railways as they are now being run, and to leave them a balance in hand after complying with this law of the Commonwealth. I wish to make it clear that the passing of this paragraph will not give the New South Wales Government, or the Transport Commissioners of that State, any excuse for not continuing to run the railways; should they discontinue any railway services their action will not be due to the operation of this Commonwealth law. The Transport Commissioners of New' South Wales are a statutory body, whose revenue and expenditure are severable from the general revenue and expenses of the State. References to the budget papers and Estimates submitted to the State Parliament show that the Transport Commissioners have been treated as a separate body, and that their revenues have not been, and are not, transmitted to the Treasury as is ordinarily the case with government departments. Under this arrangement, the Commissioners will have full power, as well as ample financial resources, to enable them to continue to run the railways as previously; only a portion of their revenues which is surplus to expenditure will be attached under this paragraph and applied towards meeting the interest charges on the loans which have been raised for the construction of the railways. I emphasize that ample funds will remain in the hands of the Commissioners to meet wages and other charges, and still leave a margin. </para>

                <para class="block">Judging by the vagaries of the gentleman who is Premier of New South Wales, it is not unreasonable to expect him to impose increased rates and fares and freight charges on the New South Wales railways, and in doing so to endeavour to make it appear that, they are due to the operation of the Commonwealth law. The facts which I have already placed before the Senate show clearly that that would not be the ease. In the event of rates and fares being increased, the additional revenue so obtained would, by virtue of this paragraph, not go into the State Treasury, but would be applied towards meeting the interest on the railway debt and the general debt of New South Wales. The paragraph will make it clear to the people of New South Wales that the operation of the Commonwealth law will make quite unnecessary any increase in railway charges. Should increased rates be charged, the people will know that these have been imposed only for political purposes. In any case the higher charges will not benefit either the railways or the Government of New South Wales; they will merely represent so much more money taken from the -pockets of the railway users to meet the interest on the public debt of the State. </para>

In this case also, the Commonwealth law will protect lessees, and holders of conditionally purchased areas who, during the operation of this law, may become entitled to grants. Provision is made that grants must issue when such purchasers have complied with the conditions of their agreements, notwithstanding that moneys hitherto payable to the State have been paid by them to the Commonwealth. Indeed, the Commonwealth law goes further, for it provides that any payment to the State of moneys which are now payable to the Commonwealth Treasurer is illegal, and would not entitle the purchaser of lands to a grant. In such a case his title, if it were issued to him by the State department, would not be a legal title. It would be capable of challenge, because he had not complied with the .conditions of the law. In this matter the law with which he has to comply is that passed by this Parliament. </para>

Paragraph xvi. of the resolution states that revenue from fees payable in respect of the registration of motor vehicles, and the issue of drivers' licences, from the renewal of such registration and such licences, and from any -payments required to be made in pursuance of any conditions imposed in any licence or permit issued in relation to motor vehicles, may be attached by the Commonwealth. The previous resolution empowered the Commonwealth to attach revenue derived from motor taxation but, in addition to revenue derived- from this source, other revenue is obtained from registration fees, and the Commonwealth is now taking power to seize that revenue also. </para>

                <para>The manner of collecting this revenue has been considered very carefully, and in general, the arrangements which exist, at- the time of the passing of this resolution and the issue of the proclamation, will be continued up to the point where previously the moneys were paid by a State officer into the bank to the credit of the Colonial Treasurer. At that stage the moneys will now be paid to the Commonwealth. We are not bound by that procedure, but in most cases it will be followed, for the reason that it will cause a minimum of interruption in the administration of services in New South Wales. The obligation to. hand over the revenue to the Commonwealth is one which we are empowered by this law to place on every State officer, and any State officer who breaks the law is liable to a penalty under the provisions of this law. It is obvious, therefore, that, so far as legal provisions can do so, the Commonwealth is armed with power to intercept the revenue, and to take possession of it. </para>
                <para>This revenue may be used by the Commonwealth for one purpose only, namely, to pay the interest due by the State of -New South Wales. It cannot be used by the Commonwealth for its own purposes, nor even for the benefit of the State of New South Wales in any direction other than the discharge of interest obligations. I remind honorable senators that the Government of New South Wales has now defaulted on the interest due on its internal debt, as well as in respect of its external debt. It. now refuses to pay the interest due to citizens of Australia who have lent it money. There has been no " scaling down " of interest, to use <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang's</inline> expression. So far as New South Wales is concerned, there has been an absolute repudiation of all obligations to pay interest, not only to bondholders overseas who have been a favorite topic of denunciation, but to the bondholders in Australia as well, including citizens of New South Wales. </para>
                <para>This resolution, and the proclamation which will follow it, constitute an attempt to do, on behalf of the people of New South Wales, what I am sure the great majority of them desire to do : That is, honestly and honorably to meet their obligations to their creditors overseas, and in Australia. For that purpose I confidently ask for the co-operation of the Senate. It ought not to be too much to hope that this resolution will be passed unanimously. It is of no use saying that we are opposed to repudiation if, at the same time, wc endeavour to defeat the only means whereby Australia as a whole can honour its obligations. When the Government of New South Wales is breaking its undertaking to bondholders at home and abroad, there is only one way in which we can show the world that we are opposed to repudiation, and that is by supporting the action of the Government which, according to the judgment of the High Court, is legally using the revenues of New South Wales to meet the statutory obligations of that State. </para>

In New South Wales widows' pensions have always been paid in this way: Treasury officials bring down to the bank from the Treasury a sum of money equal to the total payments to be made, and accompanying the money is a list of those who are to receive pensions. The bank then pays out the money to the claimants certified in the list. </para>

                    PEARCE Yes. The fact that
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline>
                    and his cohorts have sought to fasten this charge in respect to child endowment on the Commonwealth indicates how desperate his position must be. The Commonwealth Government has in its possession a letter addressed to a widow drawing a pension in New South Wales. ' It was written by the Welfare Department, as it is called, which is responsible for paying the pensions. There has been a delay of a few days in the payment of the pensions, and this long letter was written by an official in the department, blaming the Commonwealth Government for the delay. The fact that the department was able to pay the pension at all shows that the delay was not due to any action of lie Commonwealth, because if the pension could be paid on one day it could have been paid on another. That  letter is a piece of pure, political propaganda. While the pensioner was actually receiving her money, she had this piece of poison poured into her mind in -an endeavour to make her believe that her pension was in danger from the Commonwealth Government. That sort .of thing is being done by government officials in New South Wales, apparently at the direction of the Government.

                        <para>That is the extraordinary thing. What is the virtue of a plan unless somebody derives benefit from it? But all the Lang plan has done is to bring ruin and disaster in its train. New .South Wales has the highest percentage of unemployment in the Commonwealth, and the. highest proportion of destitution amongst its people. The Defence Department generally has on its hands stocks of unserviceable military clothing which, though condemned for military use, is suitable for other purposes. The late Government commenced the distribution of such clothing to unemployed and destitute persons, and altogether more than £100,000 worth of clothing, valued even at depreciated rates, has been issued up to date, speaking from memory, not less than seven-eighths of that clothing has been issued in the State of New South Wales. We may assume that only those who are absolutely destitute would apply for, and receive this clothing. So that it becomes plain that New South Wales, the State in which the Lang plan operates, possesses a greater amount of destitution than any other State in the Commonwealth.</para>

                        - It would seem that the Federal Government is having more trouble in its attempts to round up
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline>
                        than " Clancy of the Overflow " had in rounding up his brumbies. Ministers have been three months on the job now, and although they have about worn out their stock whips, apparently they have not made much progress. All this trouble with the Government of New South Wales is of very great concern to the people of Australia. They have no desire to see the time of the Federal Parliament occupied in everlastingly passing resolutions to attach this or that source of State revenue, or the time of the State Parliament taken up in dodging the Commonwealth's legislative proposals. I think that we are all agreed that the sooner the trouble is brought to a head and settled one way or the other, the better for the people generally, This Government has complained of the ineffectiveness of the action taken by its predecessors to do what it is now attempted by the wiseacres directing Commonwealth policy. As I have said, they have been three months on the job and, up to the present time, have not done very much. Apparently the gentleman being chased is about two lengths ahead all the time, and although the Commonwealth Government has thrown many barriers across the track to intercept his flight, he seems to be able to take them in his stride; he is keeping well ahead of his pursuers who are not getting any nearer. But this unfortunate conflict between the Federal and the New South Wales Governments has its tragic as well as its ludicrous side. Since it is claimed in some quarters that the people of New South Wales are suffering as the result of this Government's action, the onus is on Ministers to show that the charge against them cannot be sustained, that the Commonwealth Government is not responsible for the withholding of child endowment, as well as pensions to widows and other recipients of the State Government benevolence. This accusation regarding the financial over- lordship of the Commonwealth has been broadcast by the New South Wales Government and the people interested in the success of
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline>
                        in his conflict with the federal authorities. The Commonwealth Government, has. at its disposal the resources of the capitalist press and the national broadcasting services for the statement of its case, and if it cannot convince the people that it is right and
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline>
                        is wrong, then the fault must lie with the Government. This business is no good to the rest of the people. Personally I offer no opposition to the passing of the resolution if it will put an end to the present trouble and enable the Commonwealth and States to work together harmoniously. I do not know if this Government has sought to employ other means to reach a settlement with the New South Wales Government; I am not aware, for example, if, instead of using force, it has attempted to reason with
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang.</inline>
                        But I am informed that the Premier of New South Wales would not hesitate to meet his interest obligations overseas and within Australia were it possible for him to tap those sources of State revenue that are closed to him because of the attitude of the Legislative Council, which he is powerless to shift. Apparently the only alternative, if the State Government is to meet its interest obligations, is to cut down pensions payable to widows and others, and levy additional taxation on those people who are least able to bear it. If this correctly sums up the situation, this Government, which represents the capitalistic element in this country, should be able to bring some pressure to bear on the New South Wales Legislative Council. Possibly if the Prime Minister and his able colleagues in the Cabinet approached the Legislative Council, they would be able to persuade members of that chamber to pass the necessary legislation so as to permit the State Government to meet its obligations.

                        <para>- It is said that a stern chase is a long chase. Apparently that truism holds good in this instance, because the New South Wales Premier is being well advised as to the loop-holes in this legislation, and, up to the present, has been pretty successful. The situation reminds me of a hare that is being chased by a dog, running in and out of holes in a hedgeuntil finally the dog gets knocked up and the bare escapes. </para>

If in the further administration of this legislation the Government follows the course it adopted with regard to income tax payments, requiring licence-fees and other payments to the Crown for land rents and other purposes to be paid to the Commonwealth Bank, instead of to the State office where the records are kept, it will alienate a large body of influential public opinion in New South Wales that is at present entirely behind the Commonwealth in its fight with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang.</inline></para>

                        <para>- I am glad to have that assurance, and I hope that the Minister will follow it up by saying that it is the intention of the Government to have those land rents paid to the Crown Lands office, after which they will be attached. A great many of those who are on the land acquire their blocks on a conditional purchase scheme extending over  20  to  30  years, and two or three times a year they send cheques, covering capital and interest, to the Lands Department. The majority trust the department to send their titles when the contract is terminated. They often do not bother to keep the receipts for twenty or more years. It would be most awkward for such persons if they were instructed to make their payments other than through the State Lands Department, as the amount might not be credited to their accounts. A similar position exists in regard to licence-fees for motor vehicles and for hotels. The registration of a motor car in New South Wales is rather an intricate matter. The vehicle has to be weighed, the horse-power calculated, and other matters attended to, which occupy the best part of two hours. It would be impracticable for Commonwealth Bank officials to undertake that task. </para>

                        <para>- In this debate I am permitted to refer only to the new sources of revenue that are to be attached under this resolution. Hotelkeepers represent a deserving section of the community, and it would be wrong to instruct them to pay their licence-fees to an official of the Commonwealth Bank, who would not be in a position to enlighten them as to what amount they had to pay, or as to the position generally. In New South Wales, and most of the other States, these fees are based almost entirely on the amount of the turnover of the previous year. The State department possesses a complete record of liquor purchases, and is able imme diately to 'determine what fees have to be paid. The Federal Government should attach such moneys only after they are paid to the State office concerned. </para>

                <para>I hope that, so far as is possible, the Government will avoid the unfortunate practice of making taxpayers bailiffs to the Commonwealth, a position which subjects them to inconvenience and disturbs their business arrangements. I have no objection against the amounts being first paid to the proper State department, and then, after the usual receipts are given and credits made, attached by the Federal Government. The act has been amended to permit of that being done. </para>

                    HAL COLEBATCH  (Western Australia)  [12.37]: -  I did not speak last night on the amending bill, which paved the way for these resolutions, for the very good reason that the brief speech of the Leader of the Government in the Senate in introducing the bill gave no very clear indication as to what it meant; and, as a matter of cold fact, I had not finished reading the bill when the vote was taken.
                </para>
                <para>I opposed the first steps taken in regard to this enforcement procedure for two reasons, the first being that I believed that the contemplated action was contrary to the provisions of the Constitution. That objection has now been removed. Whether I agree or disagree with the finding of the High Court in the matter, I recognize it as the duty of every citizen of Australia to abide by that decision. </para>
                <para>My second objection remains. I object on the ground that this procedure is entirely contrary to the federal spirit of the Constitution,and on the ground that it might, and probably will, in future, be regarded as a precedent underwhich a Commonwealth Government, aiming at unification, can effectively smash the whole of the States. There is no question that not one of the States can at the present time, or is likely in the future to be able to meet its obligations without some sort of assistance from the Commonwealth. That is the position into which we have drifted. It may well bo that whereas an attack is now being made upon a State which refuses to pay, we shall find attacks being made in the future on States that are unable to pay. </para>
                <para>It seems to me that two things are essential to the carrying on of this federation - the financial independence of the States, and its corollary, the financial responsibility of the States. I, for one, cannot regard with complacency the complete destruction of those two elements in the federation. It is worth while considering for a moment how their destruction has come about. The framers of the Constitution recognized that this was going to be one of the great difficulties, and they set up provisions which, in their wisdom, they believed would protect Australia against these difficulties. Unfortunately, those provisions have been evaded. The first evasion was the subterfuge employed . by a Federal Government to evade the payment of surplus revenue to the States. The second was the unexpected taxation of State imports at a time when Sta*te Governments were importing goods largely by the aid of borrowed money. Those two factors had the effect of swelling Corn mon wealth revenue to an extent that was bound to excite n period of extravagance, not only by the Commonwealth, but, in imitation, also by the States. I venture to say that those two events have played a big part in bringing about those difficulties which are peculiar to Australia to-day, and are si.n addition to the troubles that we are suffering in common with the rest of the world. The third step was the abolition of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments, and, following upon that, the making of the Financial Agreement, which was, in effect, forced upon the States. I remember very well when I was carrying on a campaign against that Financial Agreement that I directed particular attention to sub-clause 5 of what is now section 105a of the Constitution, and I protested against putting into the proposed amendment something that might entirely destroy the constitution of the States. I was in Sydney at the time, and I published that objection in the newspapers of Western Australia. The present Leader of the Government in the Senate was then in Western Australia, and he sent mc a long telegram in which he incorporated the opinion of the then Attorney-General to the effect that the inclusion of sub-clause 5 was merely intended to prevent either the Common- wealth or the States legislating themselves out of the Financial Agreement. I am confident that neither .the Attorney-General nor the right honorable senator imagined for a moment that that provision would be used in* the way that it is being used to-day. In effect, we have reached the point when we have destroyed at once the financial independence and the financial responsibility of the States. Those are very unhappy consequences, especially when we happen to have a Premier in charge of one of the States who is ready to take the utmost advantage of something that seems to relieve him of responsibility. </para>
                <para>I was very sorry to hear the  Deputy  Leader of  the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Dooley),</inline> a man for whom I have the very highest respect, talk last evening in the fashion that he did about starving women and children. That is no new plea. Over and over again, persons who, by gross mismanagement of the territories under their control, have either created or desperately increased the poverty of the people, have tried to screen themselves by the plea that they were charitably distributing other people's money among the poor. We do not have to go very far back for an example. Take a comparatively recent one, that of Boss Tweed. the most notorious of the great corrupters under the influence of Tammany Hall, Kew York. After misappropriating some millions of pounds from the citizens of that city, he made the proud boast that he was charitably distributing much money among the unfortunate poor. Big Bill Thompson, of Chicago, used exactly the same plea, after he had almost ruined the City Corporation, and rendered it impossible to pay public employees. He boasted that bo was paying money to the poor - poor largely of his own creation. Still more recently we have the case of Scarface  Al Capone, who, charged with failure to pay his income tax, boasted that he was maintaining 2,500 poverty stricken citizens of Chicago. </para>

                        <para>- T have endeavoured to make an appeal to those honorable senators who are inclined to support, in some part at least, the attitude adopted by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang,</inline> and even to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> himself, if he would deign to listen to such an appeal, to drop all this talk about women and children. I have also endeavoured to warn them that, if they persist along those lines, they inevitably place themselves in very bad company. The cases that I have quoted are not remote; they are well known and can be readily authenticated. It was in the last years of the previous century, that Boss Tweed commenced the corruption of New York under Tammany rule. The details are at the easy disposal of honorable senators. They can assure themselves that it was the practice of Boss Tweed, by devious means, to rob the city of millions of pounds, and that, during the whole of the time that . he was reducing the city to poverty and bringing trouble upon it, he was distributing large sums of money among the poor, principally those of his own creation, the victims of his own bad policy. It is only a few years since Big Bill Thompson, through corruption and maladministration out of which he and those who were associated with him made enormous sums of money, eventually reached the stage that he was unable to pay the city employees, and the entire city was brought to the verge of bankruptcy. He also distributed money among the poor of the city, on a scale that had never been reached previously. Then there is the final example of Scarf ace Al Capone.  His principal defence when he was charged with having defrauded the public revenues by his failure to pay taxation, was that at that very time, out of his own pocket, he was feeding from 2,500 to 3,000 of the poor of Chicago every day. In each of those cases, but particularly in the first two, the attempt was made to excuse maladministration, and, by playing up to the sympathies of the people and making a pretence of doing something that other people were unwilling to do for  the deserving poor, to obtain a further lease of power. </para>

                <para>F put it that the man who is really entitled to the thanks of the deserving poor, and of women and children, is he who, in spite of hostile criticism, in spite of many difficulties, in spite possibly of abuse, so shapes his public policy as to reduce poverty and unemployment; not the man who, greedy for personal power, does not care to what extent his policy injures his- country, and looks upon the poor, in whom -he is willing merely to keep a flicker of life, in one case as servile instruments at the ballot-box that will enable him to remain in power, and in other cases as instruments that may be used to incite disorder and violence in the ranks of a community that otherwise, by patience and endurance, would work its way out of its own troubles. </para>
                <para>There is this distinct analogy between Tweed, of New' York, and Thompson, of Chicago, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang,</inline> that they were responsible for the maladministration which largely contributed to the troubles of those cities, and that the money distributed among the poor was other people's, and not their own. I am not <inline font-style="italic">at</inline> all sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang's</inline> latest action does not definitely suggest that he has in mind the creation of trouble and disorder, in which event the greater the suffering in the community the more likely might be his chance of success. I say that because I do not think it is possible to escape the conclusion that whatever view a citizen may take of the judgment of the High Court, it is the bounden duty of every citizen to obey it. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> appealed to the High Court, he certainly had my sympathy, in the belief that his view was the correct one. But when the verdict went against him, it undoubtedly was his duty to comply with the decision  of the court. So 1 have no sympathy for him in that respect. But I dp feel that the difficulty extends a good deal beyond <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang,</inline> or the borders of New South Wales, and that it is one in which the whole of Australia is concerned. Even though Ave  have in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> one who is making the difficulty worse than it otherwise would be, and creating troubles that ought not to exist, I do not believe that even that section of the trouble can or should be settled by force or violence. I am very much inclined to. think that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> is, with some deliberation, playing for such a settlement; and I am bound to say that I do not think that the course that, is being followed by </para>
                <para>Lbc  Federal Government is best calculated to avoid the possibility of such an unfortunate happening. For that reason, while I shall certainly not offer any obstruction to this resolution, or say anything in defence of the actions that have been responsible for it, I feel much inclined to echo the sentiment of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Barnes)</inline> and, while dissociating myself from the whole business, wish the Government every luck in carrying it into effect. </para>

                    <para>. - This is another of the numerous moves that have been made by the present Government' within recent weeks to bring about the downfall of the Government of New South "Wales. If all were true that has been said by our opponents in support of the three measures chat have been enacted by this Parliament, and the resolution that the Senate has been asked to pass to give practical force to their provisions, no one could refuse to listen to the appeal of the right honorable the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> to pass this resolution unanimously. But, as I pointed out when I spoke on the first of these measures some weeks ago, there is a good deal to be said for and against the cause of New South "Wales as well as for and against that of the Commonwealth. I think that we can discuss the real merits of the case, and the effect upon the Australian federation of the ultimate decision and its consequences, without laying ourselves open to the charge either of supporting <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> or of believing in his policy of repudiation. "When I spoke in this chamber previously, honorable senators supporting the Government who followed me twitted me with being in favour of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang's</inline> repudiation policy, and with being a supporter of that gentleman <inline font-style="italic">unci</inline> his Government. I do not believe in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang's</inline> methods, nor am I a supporter of his Government. But I recognize that, for the time being, he is the Premier of one of the most wealthy and populous States in the Commonwealth - a State to which some of the poorer States, whose representatives in this chamber have hurled at it candid and harsh criticism within recent weeks, owe a good deal. I cannot forget that my own State, because of disabilities suffered under federation, and other natural disabilities, has been dependent on the largess of the Commonwealth Parliament within recent years. </para>

The point that I wish to make, however, is that the money for those payments has to be found by the taxpayers of other States which are not receiving similar treatment, because they are not subject to the disabilities that the payments are calculated to remove. Ultimately, the result of this may be the instigation of a feeling in this Parliament that will not be beneficial to the States that depend upon it for financial assistance. </para>

                <para>During the whole of .this wretched business, judging by the actions of the Commonwealth Government, and the statements that have been made by its leader, I have been unable to free my mind from the belief that they are more concerned with the downfall of the present Government in New South Wales than with the collection of the money that is due to the Commonwealth, by that State: because they must know that, at some time or other, if the present Government in New South Wales does not honour its obligations, and if all that, we hear concerning the antipathy of the people of New South Wales towards it is true, that Government must come to an end; and in such an event, there would be in the Parliament' of New South Wale3 a government that would discharge its commitments to the Commonwealth. I believe that, had negotiations been conducted, as honorable senators who sit on this side suggested they should be when the first of these measures was before the Senate, the dispute could have been amicably settled, as it was by the last Government. These measures, which have caused so much bitterness and ill- * feeling, would have been rendered unnecessary, and the resolutions that we have been called upon to pass would not have occupied the time of this Parliament, which ought to be dealing with the many urgent and important problems that call for solution by it. </para>
                <para>Like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch,</inline> my principal objection to this legislation was on the ground of its constitutionality; and that has been removed by the decision of the High Court. But my second objection still remains. The fact that the validity of a law has been upheld by the High Court does not necessarily prove that law to be a good one. All that the court has done is to certify that this Parliament, acting under its Constitution, had the right to pass the legislation it enacted, and to apply its provisions to the conditions obtaining at the moment in New South "Wales. The court was not called upon to decide whether the law passed by this Parliament to deal with the dispute between the Commonwealth and New South Wales, and with the financial position of that State, was a good or a bad law. My objection on that ground still stands, because each succeeding step taken by this Government under the provisions of the three measures passed recently, and the steps contemplated by this resolution to which we are asked to agree unanimously, remove the last vestige of financial power from all the State Parliaments in Australia. Previous resolutions attached certain classes of revenue which were payable to the Treasury of New South Wales, and this resolution extends the ambit of the attachment principle. The Government and its advisers must have pondered deeply and long when drafting this resolution, because if it is given effect, not very many sources of actual or potential revenue will remain unattached by the Commonwealth. The resolutions provide that the trading activities of the State shall be interfered with, that portion of the returns which are available day by day and week by week shall be taken by the Commonwealth, and that licence fees shall be seized. They also provide that death duties shall be seized. That will not matter much to the citizens of the unfortunate State of New South Wales. A man who was dying in a mining camp had bequeathed a few shillings to several of his friends. One friend who happened to be at the bedside asked what they should do with their small legacy. The dying man said, " Have a drink after I have gone ". The friend then said, " Shall we have a drink on the way to the cemetery or on our return ?" The man replied, " Drink when you like ; it will not matter very much to me ". The seizure of death duties will not matter very much to the people of New South Wales, but nevertheless this resolution pursues them beyond the grave by attaching death duties which are paid into the Treasury of New South Wales. </para>
                <para>This legislation destroys the last vestige of financial sovereignty which the States possess. What is to be done in New South Wales to-morrow may be done in the near future in some of the other States. Where is this business to end? Are we to continue to deal with effects in this higgledy-piggledy incompetent, and haphazard manner as they arise, or are we to endeavour to dealwith the root cause of the world trouble? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> during his excellent speech attempted to draw a comparison between certain notorious gangsters and Tammany lenders in the United States of America and the Government of New South Wales, but he would have given more point to his observation had he indicated in what respect the management of New South Wales under the present State Government resembled the business practices of the notorious Tammany leaders. Is it because of mismanagement and maladministration that the State of New South Wales is to-day unable to pay its interest bill? </para>

                        <para>- Nor are the farmers of South Australia responsible for the fact that that State cannot pay itsway. ' Last year those farmers produced morewheat than had been produced in South Australia before, yet many of them are now living in absolute poverty. Recently, when vi siting one of thewealthiest agricultural districts in that State, I discovered that many farmers who had grown record crops had not the price of a suit of clothes to show for their year's labour. That position affects the taxable capacity of the State, and reduces its revenue to such an extent that the Government has to decide whether wages and salaries are to be reduced belowwhat is claimed to be theliving standard ; whetherwidows' and other pensions are to be discontinued, orwhether some equitable adjustment should be agreed to on the part of those to whom the State is in debt.Sooner or later this Parliamentwill have to face the position. The passing of this legislationwill not increase the taxable capacity of our people. The taxable capacity of New South Wales has recently become so diminished that that State has had to curtail its expenditure. It has decided that it is preferable to continue pensions and endowment payments rather than to meet its interest commitments. That brings us to the consideration of the question whether we can pay all that weowe, and it is here, that I part company with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang.</inline> There will have to be an adjustment of not only national, but also private, commitments in this country, and, in fact, throughout the world.Before the people of New South Wales can produce at. a profit, and again become revenue-earners and taxpayers to the Treasury, there will have to be a scaling down of liabilities which were incurred during the years of inflation. It is impossible for us to meet, with our deflated returns, the interest on the commitrneiits incurred in a period of inflation. Our taxable capacity has been reduced, and State revenues have diminished. There is every likelihood of other States defaulting, and of the Commonwealth attempting to enforce this legislation in respect of them. I am not conducting a crusade against the bondholders,whose interests the Commonwealth is seeking to protect under this legislation. We have to face- the facts honestly and fairly, and the sooner Ave do that the better it will be for the nation and the individuals, because if the individuals cannot pay their way it is obvious that the nation cannot pay its way. </para>

He explained that the application of paragraphs ix and x of the resolution would not bring about the discontinuance of the transport services of New South Wales, because the Commonwealth Government proposes to leave in the hands of the Transport Commissioners sufficient money withwhich to meetwages and working expenses. This Commonwealth is not in a position to decide how much money is required to maintain the transport services. It has introduced a dangerous principle, because next year South Australia, or any other State, may be forced into a position similar to that of New South Wales. I. do notwant the Commonwealth Government to instruct South Australia as to what percentage of the railway and harbours revenue must be devoted to the maintenance of those services, and what percentage must be paid to the Commonwealth Treasury, so as to ensure that the people from whom we have borrowed money shall receive the interest due to them, no matterwho suffers in the process. This Government, although it professes to be opposed to unification - the policy that we on this side advocate - is taking effective steps to bring about the downfall of federation, and to place the people of Australia under the control of one Parliament; The Leader of the Government in the Senate also made a strong denial of the statement that the action of the Commonwealth in applying certain provisions of this legislation to the banking institutions of New South Wales had been responsible for the non-payment ' of widows' pensions and endowment. </para><interjection>

The general principles upon which he has now begun to speak have already been debated two or three times in the Senate. The details of the motion only may now be discussed. </para>

                        <para>- I thought that I was within my rights in pointing out that if certain other steps were taken it would not be necessary for the Senate to pass this motion. I am suggesting that, as an alternative, the Government should cease hostilities towards New South Wales and get to grips with the real problem which has made the passing of this motion necessary, and with which it will be forced to get to grips unless, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> pointed out yesterday, it vacates the treasury benches in favour of an administration which will grapple with the problem on the lines 1 have suggested. I regret that the time of Parliament should be taken up in passing a motion of this kind. How ineffective it is likely to be is , shown by the statement of the Lender of the Government in the Senate that the total amount collected and withheld from New South Wales is under £500,000. I take it that the amount includes the sums withheld by the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>. - The right honorable the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> has painted a vivid picture of the position of New South Wales, and has described the Premier of the State as a defaulter and a repudiationist. According to the right honorable gentleman, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> has been guilty of almost everything that a mau can be guilty of. I believe in getting down to the principle adopted at the Premiers Conference, and I believe that the truth should be told in this chamber, or, at any rate, that we should get as close to the truth as we possibly can. It was understood at the Melbourne conference which drew up the Premiers plan that the Premiers had the sanction of the conference to make economies in their own States in their own way. I think that that is the truth. At any rate, it is what I have gathered from the reports of the conference. In accordance with his promise to the conference, the Leader of the Government in New South Wales submitted to the Legislative Assembly a bill to reduce all wages and salaries of judges, politicians, and civil servants to a maximum of £500 per annum. Unfortunately, the gentlemen of the Legislative Council, supporters of the majority now in the Commonwealth Parliament, rejected the measure, contending that it was not equality of sacrifice. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think so. It was more than the other States endeavoured to do, and I shall show how far the shadow sparring has gone. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lung</inline> then introduced another bill into Parliament, embodying a graduated form of taxation, under which all incomes over £500 would be taxed at the rate of 5s. in the £; but again the Legislative Council rejected it. In fairness to the Premier of that. State we should say that he did his utmost to keep up with the undertaking entered into at the Premiers Conference in Melbourne. That was his intention; but the Legislative Council prevented him from doing what he desired. I often wonder whether honorable senators from the other States realize the extent to which those States must also be affected by this legislation. </para>

I know the actual position in New South Wales much better than do honorable, senators opposite. They do not know the hardships that are being imposed upon the people of that State as well as I do. That is why I am in a position to speak more authoritatively for them than arc honorable senators interjecting. We have been' informed that every State Government, with the exception of the Government of New South Wales, has observed the agreement made at the Premiers Conference in Melbourne. That has  been  said so often that some honorable senators opposite have come to believe that it is true; but the Governments of Queensland, Victoria and Western Australia, as well as the Government of New .South Wales have been unable to keep their deficits within the limits laid down in Melbourne. </para>

                        <para>- Of the four States mentioned whose deficits exceeded those stipulated, that of New South Wales was relatively less .than those of the other three States. Notwithstanding this the Commonwealth Government has said that the three States with greater deficits than New South Wales have kept within the Premiers plan, while New South Wales has not done so. New .South Wales complied with the undertaking entered into in Melbourne to its fullest possible extent. Had the legislation, to which I have referred, been passed by the New South Wales Parliament, there would have been no occasion for the Commonwealth  Government  to introduce its Financial Agreements enforcement legislation or for a display of enmity towards <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang.</inline></para>

                        <para>- It all depends- on what is meant by Labourites. A great deal ha3 been said with reference to the money received from New South Wales, and the actual amount owing by that State. A little controversy occurred a few minutes ago between the Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Greene)</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Halloran,</inline> on that point. In order to show how far the Commonwealth has succeeded under its wonderful enforcement legislation, I quote the Prime Minister, who said that- </para>

                    <para>The Premier of New South Wales, Air. Lung, had defaulted in internal interest to the amount of £184,54.3 representing the discount on treasury-bills. The gross default of New South Wales to-day is approximately £3,200,000. The recoveries under the Enforcement Act are approximately £440,000, and the net amount outstanding is £2,700,000. </para>
                </quote><para class="block">I am reminded of a remark of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes,</inline> that the action of the Government resembles that of a dog chasing a hare. The. Government's enforcement, legislation has not had the effect anticipated. Notwithstanding its efforts no progress has been made, and it appears that the practice of introducing amending bills will 110 get its very far. I believe that there is i.no .her solution of this difficulty. I have come to the conclusion that wiser counsel should prevail, and that it would be preferable for the Government to adopt a conciliatory attitude rather than to hold a gun at the State concerned. I have been an ardent supporter of conciliation all my life. When an industrial dispute occurs between employers and wageslaves in this country, honorable senators opposite always advocate concilation ; but when faced with a major dispute, such as this, affecting as it does the whole of Australia, they advocate not conciliation, but direct action such as is now being taken. In these circumstances, one is justified in concluding that even if the New- South Wales Government were able  to pay its overseas and internal indebtedness, that would not be sufficient to satisfy the Commonwealth Government. This Government would not mind if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> defaulted in those payments, provided he reduced the basic wage, abolished child endowment, widows' pensions, and other social services. If he had agreed to reduce the basic wage in N ew South Wales to £211s. 6d. per week everything in New South Wales would, according to the opinion of honorable senators opposite, be all right. Even if a general election were held in New South Wales the position would not be altered. I am firmly convinced that the fight is only against the Premier of that State, It is fortunate that the people of New South Wales have a man prepared to fight when be thinks he is right. </para><interjection>

The figures quoted a few moments ago by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mooney</inline> as to the total default of New South Wales are not correct. The gross default of the State is £3,948,672. The monthly interestwhich is the contribution by the Commonwealth - set . off, is £729,354. There has also been set off an overpayment of interest amounting to £19,105. The amounts recovered - in other words, the amounts which have been actually collected from the taxpayers of New South Wales - aggregate £481,357. This makes a total recovery of £1,229,816, leaving at the moment a default of £2,718,S56. That is the actual position as I know it to he, and I think it well to place it on record. I suggest that, the recovery of £1,229.816 is a better result, than was achieved by the Scullin Government. </para>

                    <para>. - It seems a pity that this matter could not be dealt with in a different way. I opposed the principal act, which this bill seeks to amend, because of the constitutional difficulties which I feared would arise if it became law. Since then, however, the High Court has declared that the legislation, whose validity I doubted, is constitutional, and therefore I -can no longer take the stand which I formerly took. A further reason for my opposition to that measure was that I anticipated that the Government would expert-  ence  considerable difficulty in collecting the money. Difficulties still remain. I should like the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> to explain the position of a hotelkeeper who pays his licence-fees to the federal authorities in accordance with the Commonwealth law. Will he be liable to prosecution, by the State for keeping a hotel without a. licence? Similarly, I should like to know how the law will affect the owner of a motor car who pays his registration fee to the Commonwealth? Will the State authorities be able to proceed against him for using an unregistered vehicle? </para>

The High Court has ruled that this is a matter upon which the Commonwealth is entitled to legislate, and that being so, the Commonwealth law is supreme. The Commonwealth can therefore protect the hotelkeeper by compelling the State to issue a licence provided that the other requirements of the State law have been complied with. </para>

                        <para>- A good deal has been, said about the starving condition of many persons in New South Wales. Their misfortune has been used as an argument against paying the interest due to bondholders. Such statements merely show how <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> and his followers are playing to the gallery. South Australia is the most heavily taxed State in the Commonwealth, and possibly in the world; but that State has endeavoured to meet its interest commitments as well as supply its people with food. Every State has its own system of supplying food to the unemployed, and others in want, and there is, consequently, no reason why any person in the Commonwealth should starve. There is no solid ground for the argument that people are starving, and that interest payments should therefore not be made. </para>

                <para>New South Wales of the payments due to them has been given great publicity. The Minister in charge of the bill <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> has denied his charge. I hope that he will see that the same publicity is given to the facts of the case as has been given to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang's</inline> statement.

                <para>Sooner or later, the Federal Government must triumph in the present battle, and then the Lang Government will go out of existence. But I suggest that if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> Avishes to prove his bona fides, he should not Avait until he can no longer resist the pressure brought to bear -upon him, but should immediately appeal to the people of New South Wales. Indeed, that is the only honorable thing that he can do.  His  supporters say that an appeal to the electors would result in the return of the Lang Government. All I can say is that, in that case, it would have a mandate to carry on. I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> will soon give the electors an opportunity to prove whether they arewith or against him. </para>

                <para class="block">I do not intend to traverse any of the observations made in this debate, but I think it highly desirable that there should be a realization by the Government of New South Wales, as I believe there is by the people of that State, that ultimately it would be better in the interests of New South Wales if its Government comported itself  Avith  honour and honesty. Whatever adjustments may have to be made, and probably such adjustments will be necessary throughout the world, these cannot be accomplished by bluff and bluster, or dishonest methods. This amendment will make the provision in paragraph x more elastic, and enable it to play on the functious of the Transport Commissioners of NeAv South Wales irrespective of whether the title of that body is changed or whether the particular functions which the commissioners are now discharging are entrusted to some other person or authority. </para>

                        <para>- Speaking on the motion for the adoption of this resolution, I pointed out that the people of New South Wales apprehended some danger from it. They believe that the concern of the Commonwealth Government is that the bondholder shall get his interest, and that the welfare of the individual employee may be lost sight of. I merely wish to safeguard that position, and to make sure that it is the intention of the Government not to penalize the employees. That can be done, either by an amendment or by the giving of an undertaking by the Government. I suggest a proviso to paragraph xi., setting out that nothing in the paragraph shall prevent the payment of existing award rates, and the observance of existing conditions, and that the Commonwealth guarantee the employees accordingly. I take it that it is not the intention of the Commonwealth to make the employees in the railway service of New South Wales suffer as a consequence of the attachment of one-sixth of the revenue of that service. There is the danger that the revenue may fall off to such an extent that it will not be possible for the Transport Commissioners or the Government to pay the wages of the service after meeting the requirements of the Commonwealth. I should like the Leader of the Government to give the Senate the assurance that, in the event of such a depletion of revenue that the fivesixths remaining with the State is not sufficient to pay the wages of the employees, it will not take the one-sixth at the expense of those employees. </para>

                    <para>[4.37].  - The Government could not agree to the suggestion of the honorable senator as a condition precedent to the acceptance of the amendment to paragraph x. The proposed addition does not appear to have anything to do either with the amendment or with the resolution itself. The Commonwealth cannot, under the power that it possesses, determine the wages that shall be paid in the railway service of New South Wales. Nor is that one of its powers under the Financial Agreements Enforcement Act. It has no power to interfere with wages. </para>

                    <para>. - The right honorable gentleman apparently has misunderstood the position that is taken up by the Opposition. The Commonwealth proposes to take one-sixth of the railway revenue of New South Wales. Out of that revenue certain obligations, including wages, have to be met. The State is to be permitted to retain five-sixths of the revenue. If that five-sixths is not sufficient to pay the wages of the employees, who will make good the balance? </para>

                        <para>- No man to-day stands higher in the legal world of Australia than the learned gentleman to whom he has referred, and his awards have been followed in very many instances by other tribunals. On the figures quoted by the Leader of the Government, it would appear that there will be sufficient in the five-sixths of the revenue to meet wages commitments. </para>

We would like to reject this resolution; but, as we cannot, we ask for the assurance that, if the five-sixths is not sufficient to meet the wages payable, and to compensate for the observance of the conditions, the Commonwealth Government will pay to the workers, out of the one-sixth that it confiscates, what they are entitled to receive under any awards that may be made from time to time. </para>

                    <para>. -  As I understand the position, the purpose of the resolution is to set out clearly the different classes of revenue that may be attached by the Federal Government. Any proposal to superadd a proviso that is quite foreign to the purpose and the intent of the resolution, I submit, would be out of order. If it is in order, I should fail in my duty did I not safeguard the interests of other elements in the community, in addition to those who are receiving wages under awards. </para>

                    <para>Asked whether he considered  the  Wyndham aerodrome suitable as a landing ground  for  overseas aviators, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Richards</inline> said that it was  in every  way  suitable. The sea crossing from Kupang to Wyndham was loss by 100 miles than from Ku pang to Darwin. In the flight to Darwin, head winds might prove a seriousmenace on account of the limited fuel supply which aeroplanes could carry.If the crossing were made to Wyndham, it would not matter if head winds at 40 miles an hour were encountered; the flight could still  be  made safely if the engine held out. Moreover, there  was  an excellent landing ground at the Drysdale Mission, which was on the line of flight. </para>

                        <para>- It is taken by a great many aviators. The Dutch aviators used, it when visiting Australia. I am inclined to think that Darwin has been favoured because it is in Commonwealth territory. I ask the Minister for Defence to take into consideration these representations from an independent source when dealing with the request of the people of Wyndham, that an all-weather aerodrome should be established at that airport. According to the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian,</inline> in the last fortnight a new site has been discovered at Wyndham which, if cleared, can be made -safe for aeroplanes all the year round. </para>

                        <para>- They are all practically the same distance. Air-Commodore Kingsford Smith has frequently flown to Asia by way of Wyndham. Thanks to the courtesy of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> honorable senators can see hanging in the Senate club room a large handsome air map of Australis supplied by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McCallum</inline> Smith. M.L.A., of the Perth <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Times.</inline> That map shows clearly that the route to Asia via Wyndham is just as short as that via Darwin. There is practically no difference. Even if there is, I submit that an all-weather aerodrome should be established at Wyndham at the expense of the Commonwealth, so that those aviators who desire to make a shorter sea crossing in planes designed mainly for travelling over the land should be given the chance of both routes by the provision of suitable aerodromes at the two centres. </para>

                <para>SenatorFOLL (Queensland) [5.1].- The answer to a series of questions I submitted this morning in connexion with certain assessments under the Wartime Profits Tax Assessment Act states that owing to the secrecy provisions of that act, the Commissioner of Taxation is precluded  from  furnishing any information in connexion with the case referred to in my questions. In these circumstances, I ask the Acting Attorney-General whether the secrecy provisions of that act are not provided to ensure that the profits or particulars in assessments shall not be made public, rather than to prevent information being withheld when a taxpayer who thinks that he has been unjustly treated w ishes to bring his case under the notice of Parliament. I can recall an occasion some time ago when a debate ensued in another place, and when the Leader of the Opposition, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scullin,</inline> spoke at considerable length concerning the alleged failure of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Sidney</inline> Kidman to pay taxation said to be due to the Federal Government. On that occasion a lengthy and bitter debate ensued and serious charges were made by the then Leader  of  the Opposition in another place. In the case mentioned in the questions I asked, a taxpayer feels that he has received an unjust deal from the Taxation Department, and also from certain partners in business, owing to the manner in which his assessment was dealt with by the department. He, therefore, seeks an opportunity to bring his case under the notice of the Treasurer in order that he may have what he alleges a wrong redressed. </para>

                        <para> It would establish a dangerous precedent if details of any taxpayer's assessment were made available. 1 agree that the secrecy provisions of the Wartime Profits Tax Assessment Act or any other act administered by the Commissioner of Taxation, should be strictly observed. The Federal Taxation Commissioner should not be subject to the direction of Ministers in the matter of making available particulars contained: in taxation returns made to him. This is a case in which an injustice is claimed to have been perpetrated upon a man by his partners - a man who,, owing to the fact that the Taxation Department is not prepared to make certain assessments available, is unable to establish his partnership in a business in Western Queensland. </para>

                        <para>- If a person feels that his partners have not been assessed in such a way as to ensure him receiving justice, and the Commissioner has given his decision and an appeal has been heard,, he has no right to bring the matter before Parliament. He cannot, even if an injustice has been done, place his case before  this Parliament in order that the Treasurer, who is the nominal head of the Taxation Department, may have an investigation made. In spite of the brief but courteous answer to my questions,I may say that this case was discussed at considerable length in the Queensland Legislative Assembly, where it was not regarded as being outside the scope of debate. </para>

                    <para>. - The position is, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> knows, that the Minister cannot direct the Commissioner of Taxation in the execution of his duties to answer any of the eleven questions asked by the honorable senator. The Commissioner is the sole judge of whether he should or should not divulge any information in his possession. To do so would be a breach of the oath of office which he takes. It is not competent for any Minister to direct the Commissioner to divulge any information. Sub-section 7 of section <inline font-style="italic">it</inline> of the Wartime Profits Tax Assessment Act reads - </para>

                <para class="block">There is greater necessity for secrecy in ' connexion with the Wartime Profits Assessment Act than there is in regard to Income or Land Tax Assessment Acts. That is the first point. Secondly, if I remember aright, the debate in connexion . with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir' Sidney</inline> Kidman's land tax assessment was based on the Annual Report of the Taxation Commissioner, which is tabled in Parliament every year, and in which is set out the activities of the department. Consequently, the information in. that case, such as it was, waa available to honorable senators. The Commissioner of Taxation is obliged under the act to make such. a report to Parliament. This is an entirely different matter. It is within the discretion of the Commissioner of Taxation to determine whether the furnishing of any information would be a breach of his duty under the law. I assume that the position is that the Government cannot say to .the Commissioner that he must divulge the information, and he is within his rights in withholding it. </para>
