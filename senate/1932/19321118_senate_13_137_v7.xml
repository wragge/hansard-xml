                        <para>- Great Britain has suspended the payment of the interest due to her on our war debts during the currency of the Hoover Moratorium because of the relief which she has been granted from her obligation to pay certain sums to the United States of America. If Britain has to resume her payments to America, it is reasonable to suppose that she will ask us to resume our payments to her. To that extent the budget will be affected. </para>

                    <para>- When I was in Western Australia some time ago representatives of the wheat farmers in  the  remote districts near the rabbit-proof fence, which is practically the limit of the wheat-growing area in Western Australia, waited on me and pointed out that, in consequence of the dry season in the interior, emus in thousands had come in to get water. I was informed that these emus were doing tremendous damage to the standing crops. Those who have seen emus only in a zoo would not realize the damage that these birds can do in a standing crop. The general impression is that they only pick off a few ears of wheat. </para>

                        <para>- Any one who has been i ti a district where emus are plentiful knows that the birds actually roll down the crops. They act in a crop much as. barnyard fowls act in a fowl yard. The crops in this part of Western Australia were just about ripe, it was explained to me that the use of rifles for the extinction of the birds was quite ineffective, because only one or two birds could bo shot before the remainder scattered far and wide. Ordinary fences such as keep out dingoes and kangaroos offer no obstacle to emus, for the birds take them in their stride, or  knock  them down, and thus let the rabbits into the crops. I was asked to allow machine guns belonging to the Defence Department to be used for the destruction of the birds, the farmers undertaking to pay for the necessary ammunition. I could not  allow  the machine guns to go into the hands of persons' not under Commonwealth control or authority. The State Government associated itself with the request for the use of the guns, and I ultimately agreed to allow three members of the permanent military personnel to go into this district with the guns, on the State Government -undertaking to give them their railway fares and pay for the ammunition used. An arrangement on this point was made between the State Government and the farmers. No extra pay was to be made to the personnel, and the operation was not to cost the Commonwealth Government anything. This arrangement having been made, the guns and crew were despatched to the area where the birds were doing so much destruction. Subsequently paragraphs appeared in the press of the eastern States to the effect that the machine gun shooting of the birds was not effective, as only a few birds had been shot. Assuming those paragraphs to be correct, I issued the instruction that the guns and crew should be withdrawn. This action caused a storm of protest from the people in these wheat areas, and also from the Premier of that State, and I was informed that the guns had been effective, for hundreds of birds had been shot, and that since the cessation of the shooting the birds had returned in thousands. I then agreed that the guns and crew should be returned to the area. </para>

                <para>To the allegation of cruelty to the birds in shooting them by this means; my reply is that there is <inline font-style="italic">no more</inline> cruelty in shooting birds with a machine gun than with a rifle. The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals sent one of its officers into the district while the machine guns were being used, in order that the society might be satisfied that there was no unnecessary cruelty. Of course the taking of life by any means involves some measure of cruelty. Every thing possible is being done to ensure that the shooting shall be done as humanely as possible. "When the guns open fixe the. birds very quickly get out of range, and men are then sent among those which have been wounded to despatch them quickly. In all the circumstances I feel that the Government was justified in doing what it did in order to protect these settlers from the loss of their crops, which would have meant the loss of their living. </para>

                        <para>.- It is my belief that the Ottawa Conference, and the measure of agreement there arrived at, will constitute a landmark in history - a landmark pointing the way to world recovery. Our proximity to the event prevents a full appreciation of its immense import. We cannot yet see in true perspective what it connotes. Jaundiced political considerations almost forbid appreciation by factions. It behove3 us to consider how agreements which,' perhaps, constitute the greatest protective gesture the world has ever seen, have been made possible between units of the Empire. A true appreciation of the underlying principles of the recent conference cannot be gained without a study of the evolutionary processes whereby the partners in the British Commonwealth of Nations reached their present standard of relationship. The subject of such relationship has been considerably affected by prejudices, the cant of " anti-imperialists," and a tendency to misconstrue the motives of certain of the partners - especially Great Britain. I do not think that I can better express the existing relationship of the members than by using the words of the Balfour " Imperial Relations Committee " of the Imperial Conference, 1926 - </para>

                    <para>There has been in Australia, at all times, a school of thought which seeks to convey the impression that, in conferences to promote inter-Empire trade, there has been some sinister influence. The insinuation is based upon the suggestion that opportunism on the part of Great Britain has been the controlling factor in all the deliberations at conferences which have been held in the past. Australia, having proceeded- by definite and progressive steps to constitutional autonomy, this school of thought has suggested that Great Britain was striving for " economic or fiscal domination" to replace the constitutional' domination of the British Parliament which obtained during the days" of the early Colonial Empire. It is time that the people of Australia, and the exponents of the above school of thought, particularly, were informed of the facts, and of the real processes underlying the present <inline font-style="italic">rapprochement</inline> between the component units of the British Commonwealth of Nations. </para>
                    <para>It is very difficult to dissociate considerations of trade from the subject of constitutional freedom ; but a study of history discloses how these two aspects of inter-Empire relationship proceeded on parallel lines. As a matter of fact, the period during which the full status of constitutional freedom was accorded the dominions was marked almost by indifference on the part of the British people. It is interesting to observe that this indifference contributed largely to the detachment of the dominions, orcolonies, in a constitutional sense. It has been said that, " This indifference largely greased the ways for the large concessions of responsible government and of fiscal and diplomatic freedom, which were demanded by the dominions and conceded at their request ". The era of indifference was occasioned by the following factors : - </para>

In the early days of the British Colonial Empire, the British Parliament purported to restrict the freedom of the colonies in certain respects. There were many disputes concerning tariff discriminations between upper and lower Canada, and between Tasmania and Victoria in pre-federation days. As a matter of fact, the restrictions went so far as to prohibit the manufacture of woollens, or of iron and steel in the colonies, and the cultivation of tobacco was prohibited in England.

                    <para>The power of the dominion legislatures to make such enactments has never been gainsaid. It wa3 ultimately realized that dominion tariffs were inevitable, and no protests were made in the British  Parliam-  - ment against them. The " die-hard " freetraders vanished, and a new attitude was adopted towards dominion fiscal policy and commercial systems. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> Chamberlain was the first statesman at Westminster to adopt and proclaim the new attitude. Upon his return from Canada in 1888 he said that it was "useless to expect that the colonies would abandon customs duties as their chief and principal source of revenue." He added "It is hardly to be hoped that the protected industries fostered by their system will willingly surrender privileges which they now enjoy." The first colonial conference was summoned by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> Chamberlain, on the occasion of the Queen's Jubilee celebrations in London in 1887. The Premiers of all the Australian colonies were invited to it, as well as the Prime Ministers of Canada, New Zealand and other colonies. That conference necessity for fostering inter-imperial trade. The next conference was held in Ottawa in 1887, but the results were negligible. At the time that these conferences were held, interstate trade in Australia was not free, and tariffs were imposed by several States, discriminating against the goods of their neighbours. Accordingly, there was no authority capable of speaking for Australia as a whole. Indeed in view of the inability of the Australian States at that time to reconcile their own tariff differences, it was difficult to see how they could make any reciprocal arrangements with the British Government. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> had a great belief in the British race, which he described as the "greatest of the governing races the world has ever seen."  His  political outlook was, as he himself  put it, "modified by changing times and altered circumstances ". From the colonial office, he, probably the greatest and most far-sighted of all the distinguished men who have . occupied that post, in November, 1895, issued a circular which embodied in the form of a questionnaire the principles on which the present agreement is based. He proceeded : "I am impressed with the extreme importance of securing as large a share as possible of the mutual trade of the United Kingdom and the colonies for British producers and manufacturers,  whether  located in the colonies or in the United Kingdom. In the first place, therefore, I wish to investigate thoroughly the extent to which, in each of the colonies, foreign imports of any kind have displaced, or are displacing, similar British goods, and the cause of such displacement." </para>
                    <para>The first important imperial conference was held in 1902. It affirmed the principle of preferential trade, and carried a resolution in the following terms : - . . . (IV.) That the Prime Ministers of the colonies respectively urge on  His  Majesty's Government the expediency of granting in the United Kingdom preferential treatment to the products and manufactures of the colonies, either by exemption from or reduction of duties now or hereafter imposed. </para>
                    <para class="block">It is significant that, at the various colonial conferences - as they were then called - the overseas representatives never failed to raise the question of the development of inter-imperial trade by means of tariff preferences. Reference has already been made to the fact that constitutional independence within the Empire was sought by the colonies consistently. It is now clear that they also sought the development of inter-imperial trade. </para>

                        pointed out that while the Empire could be self-sustaining, and could provide itself within its own limits with every necessary and almost every luxury, it drew the greatest part of its supplies from, outside, and exported, the bulk of its surplus produce to foreign countries. All this trade, he urged, might be carried on within the Empire; but how could such an interchange of commodities . between different parts of the Empire be promoted by statesmanship? Under existing conditions in the colonies, it was not practicable to establish freedom of trade between them and the Mother Country. He followed this in his tariff reform agitation of 1903 by saying -

We take from Prance about three times as much- From the United States of America we take about six times as much as they take from us. Who is it that stands to lose if there is to be a war of tariffs? And there is something else. We have what none of these countries have. We have something, the importance of which I am trying to impress upon my countrymen, which at present they have not sufficiently appreciated. We have a great reserve in the sons of Britain across the seas. There is nothing we want that they cannot supply. There is nothing we sell that they cannot buy. We do not ask you, the people of this country, to give anything for nothing, but we say that what you give will be met by what they give, and that the bargain is one that benefits both sides. I have known a great deal about business in my time, and I say I -have never cared for a bargain in which I thought I had gained everything. I do not think that is a lasting bargain.

Even now, however, we have by no means exhausted the field of mutual preference. Of the trade carried on by the Empire, 70 per cent, is still with foreign countries, only 30 per cent, among ourselves. Were conditions to remain as they are, the possibilities of expansion would be enormous, but looking to future generations, as population increases, the scope can hardly be measured. Development may come more quickly than we anticipate. </para>

                    <para>When George III. ascended the throne, the population of Great Britain was only 7,000,000. By the end of his reign it had doubled, and 100 years later that doubled population had trebled. In the life of a people, 100 years is but a brief span. The present universal depression makes the extension and improvement of imperial trade a matter of urgent importance to all parts of the Empire. It offers the most hopeful means of stimulating demand in the world markets, and of restoring to a sound level wholesale commodity prices. We are well aware that in every dominion there is a section of opinion - it may even attain the dignity of a party - which is almost avowedly anti-English. In ordinary times it is more or less manipulated by politicians who are bent on excluding commercial and industrial competition, and laying steady pressure on the local ministry to thwart any policy that may appear to be inspired from London or prove advantageous to the people of Great Britain. The exponents of this acrid patriotism have to withdraw to the background when a common danger threatens, or some single cause engages, the whole of the British race; but as soon as the hour of emergency has passed, they are at work again - stealthily or noisily, as the case may be. </para>

In that year, preference was given to certain dominion products, including currants, dried fruits, sugar, tobacco and wine. These preferences have been of considerable value to Australia. A measure of preference to the products mentioned has been accorded them ever since that year, and the list has been added to by the Import Duties Bill enacted in April of this year, in conformity with the new fiscal policy of the British Government. </para>
                    <para>This historical excursus is designed to illustrate the fact that the discussions with Great Britain on the part of the dominions have been those which actuate partners in a commonwealth of nations, the initiative, in the matter of interEmpire trade, being taken by the dominions. Now that Gr.eat Britain, through her change of fiscal policy, is in a position to reciprocate more fully in the enlargement of inter-Empire trade, it is difficult to understand how it can lie with any public men in Australia to  decry the rationale underlying the recent conference at Ottawa. </para>
                    <para>During the war, consultations on matters of mutual concern were provided for, and the Imperial Conference of 1923 added to the conception of partners " freely associated " for mutual ends. The status expressed by the Balfour Committee had been recognized over and over again in documents and public acts since the conference of 1907. The 1926 conference was in the nature of a rediscovery of such a status - the war and its aftermath having made a definition of inter-imperial relations necessary. Many of the effects of the war upon world finance, trade and social conditions, and territorial alignments, generally, are patent to all. There are two important aspects of postwar conditions which should be borne in mind. The first aspect is the complete vindication of the role of the British dominions as autonomous bodies, enjoying diplomatic freedom in the international sphere. The signing of the pact of Locarno, and other activities connected with the Peace Treaty, and since, have ensured to the dominions their place as autonomous entities, with diplomatic freedom. They signed those undertakings as separate entities. Thus we find their sovereignty, their constitutional, autonomous and diplomatic freedom, completely vouchsafed them. The second view of the war aftermath, which is concerned with the new territorial alignment, is the engendering of an intense economic nationalism oh the part of all countries engaged in the- war, and the new countries arising out of the peace conferences. The . clash of tariffs, which are the instruments of the new economic nationalism, has been most severe, and the world has resolved itself into a number of trade-warring factions. Such a state of affairs can only end in one of two ways - (a) either the intense battle of tariffs will culminate in a battle of armaments; or <inline font-style="italic">(b)</inline> the nations indulging therein will become tired of the fight, or will realize the suicidal features of such a struggle, and attempt to make reciprocal treaties with their neighbours or with other countries. In such a welter of economic nationalism, the partners in the British Commonwealth of Nations can furnish to the other nations of the world an object lesson in the virtues of complementary trade arrangements between nations, making for the economic health and progress of the units concerned. Australia, endowed with unquestionable freedom in her constitutional status, fiscal freedom in the economic sense, and national independence in the diplomatic sense, is free to enter into trade arrangements at will. Whom should she choose but her fellow-partners in the British Commonwealth of Nations, as a first step towards a trade <inline font-style="italic">rapprochement?.</inline> It may be that, after a rationalization of Empire trade in the sense emphasized by the recent proceedings at Ottawa, the British Commonwealth may, on behalf of* all its partners, and in cooperation therewith, enter into trade treaties with other countries-.: " For example, Australia has a huge quantityof wool and wheat which it must export, and sell at world's parity,  after the practical stock-taking involved in the implementation of the Ottawa conclusions, the partners in the Empire may join to negotiate with some other country, whose exclusive products they may agree to buy in return for preferential treatment of Australian wool and wheat. </para>
                    <para>I hope that honorable senators will approach consideration of the Ottawa agreement in the light of the conceptions which I have endeavoured to portray and emphasize herein. Underlying the reciprocal features of inter-Empire trade relations' are ties based on common interests, traditions and ethical standards of national consciousness. It is difficult to express such sentiments without provoking the cynical jargon of those who make a play upon words, to whom the word " Empire " is anathema and synonymous with the " imperialism " of conquest and suppression of the. primitive days of colonization. This feature has long since ceased to be a characteristic of the nexus binding the partners of the British Commonwealth of Nations, " freely associated ". </para>
                    <para>The opportunity for inter-Empire trade agreements  ha3  come to us when our constitutional, fiscal, and diplomatic freedom is secure; dominance -in either sense is impossible and inconsistent with the thought and ethical standards of British communities. Less secure in the above qualities of our autonomous status, we might be apprehensive of "imperialism ". Prussia, in the German <inline font-style="italic">zollverein</inline> or customs union, used trade agreements and tariffs to inflict political domination upon the German States within the customs union, and thus established " Imperial Germany ". To Britishers, such a procedure is an anachronism. That the political and fiscal freedom of the dominions is inviolate is mutually conceded by all parties to the agreement. </para>
                    <para>Finally, while it is an accepted principle of our form of government, that ono parliament cannot bind its successor, it is hoped that the goodwill, the good sense, and fraternity which has made the Ottawa agreement possible will not render facile the abrogation of the agreement before its expiry.

                            <para>- Immediately. I am merely providing a little parsley dressing. Supplementing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Baillieu's</inline> representatives were the representatives of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Theodore</inline> Fink. As a result we had wirelessed to us from the <inline font-style="italic">Aorangi</inline> long screeds of press propaganda, describing how, day and night, the delegation worked assiduously at its task. Arriving at Vancouver, this picturesque, gang was met by the representatives of the Canadian Government, by whom, as it continued its meanderings along the Canadian-Pacific railway, it was appropriately feted. The party came to the Rockies and saw, probably for the first, time, the locale of that soulful masterpiece, " Springtime in the Rockies ". Then they reached Ottawa, where the stage was set for the presentation of an Empire comedy. There appeared on the scene another delegation, consisting of the statesmen of imperialistic Great Britain. When these men got <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gullett</inline> at the conference table, they " put it all over " them. Let us for a moment examine the calibre of the British personnel at that gathering. It comprised <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Baldwin,</inline> the Leader of the House of Commons; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain,</inline> the Chancellor of the Exchequer; two eminent British- statesmen, and, no doubt, personally likeable gentlemen. To give a democratic touch to the British representation, the delegation included also <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. "</inline> Jimmie " Thomas, ex-British Labour leader, a man who got into the Mother of Parliaments on the backs of the British workers. He was sent  to Ottawa, there to act as the lick-spittle of his leaders, who, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford</inline> told us yesterday, were determined to drive a hard bargain with the dominions' representatives. </para>

                    <para>I was much interested' and impressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford's</inline> criticism of the work of the conference, and I was delighted to think that one of the rank .and file among Government supporters was courageous enough to state his opposition to certain articles in the agreement, particularly those which interfere with the protective policy of this country. But I was disappointed to hear Him say, towards the end of his speech, that he intended to support this </para>
                    <para class="block">Government of exploded ideas, which is looking to the Ottawa agreement to get this country out of its present difficulties. </para>
                    <para>The foundations of the defeat of this Government were laid at Ottawa. This opinion is expressed in the latest circular issued by the influential Bank of New South Wales, which has played such an important part in the financial history of that State. The Government bitterly resents the criticism which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Davidson,</inline> the general manager of the Bank of New South Wales, has directed against the Ottawa proposals. It objects also to criticism from our manufacturers, many of whom were given substantial tariff protection by the Scullin Administration, but when the political tide turned transferred their allegiance to the Lyons Administration, and connived with it and its supporters to break down our trade barriers. This alteration of the tariff policy will not benefit the workers of this country. Other honorable senators who have spoken from this side of the chamber have made it plain that the complete emancipation of the world from its troubles will be possible only when the present economic system is radically changed. The imperialist delegates to Ottawa, and the Governments which sent them there, have been, declaring through the press to the workers in the bush, to the primary producers, to the unemployed, and to the millions of workers in all Empire combines, that all will be well if only the Parliaments of the various dominions will accept this new policy for the promotion of intra-Empire trade. We have been told to look to Ottawa for a solution of our difficulties. But what has been the result? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford</inline> reminded us yesterday that the British delegation had driven a hard bargain with the dominions and Crown colonies. I agree with him. The Ottawa Conference resolutions will not put right the balance of trade, but in all probability they will mean the disintegration of the British Empire. We shall not get out of our present difficulties until the workers of this and other countries have full control over the means of production, distribution and exchange. The right honorable the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> will no doubt suggest that I am one of the " reds." </para>

                        <para>In recent years Australian economic policy has been directed towards establishing a favorable balance for Australian trade; towards maintaining over imports an excess of exports sufficient to meet external obligations. In principle this is eminently wise; but, unfortunately, the policy has been applied with little discretion. Australia has been too much inclined to shut herself off from commercial intercourse with foreign nations. </para>

In the actual practice of to-day, Australia is tied to the apron strings of the Mother Country politically, commercially and financially, just as closely as when people began to discuss dominion status. It is true that recently, on account of the failing purchasing power of the United </para>
                        <para class="block">Kingdom, .Australian Governments, business men and bankers, have manifested some inclination to establish closer contact with nonBritish countries; but they are doing this with  so  much hesitation that they are in danger of missing altogether opportunities which probably will not recur. Quite rightly they are thinking much of the imperial connexion; quite rightly they are thinking of imperial trade, but they should be thinking also of developing <inline font-style="italic">an</inline> intimacy with foreign peoples, and of building up a larger foreign trade Already it has been explained that this dual policy implies  no  inconsistency; that it implies no disloyalty to the imperial idea, to the United Kingdom, or to other self-governing dominions. Australia must partake of the responsibilities and privileges of Empire, but she cannot neglect her obligations to Australian nationalism. The Commonwealth must prepare itself to stand alone should world events place it in a position  of  isolation. In short Australia must work for and with the British Empire; but she must not ignore the possibility of imperial decay, or even dissolution. It may be said quite definitely that Australia has not yet recognized the significance of the latter implication. Political and economic foresight should not bo limited to years or decades; they should look centuries ahead. Consequently, it seems to be the case that, while Australia should play its part in working out a scheme of  intra-imperial  trade, in building up a self-efficient Empire, it should also - and it could do this without reproach - persist with the development  0t  Australian nationalism. </para>
                        <para>Australia can quite consistently play its part within the British system and develop profitable relations with  non-British  States. From what has been said above, it will be clear that the Dominion  of  Canada is putting this dual policy into practice. Australia, on the other hand, while obviously anxious to play its part in one direction, is failing lamentably in the other. The Australian tariff law, indeed, by its intermediate rates, has made provision for the development of closer commercial intercourse with foreign people, but the provision lies neglected and unused. Commercially and financially, Australian nationalism has been given no expression outside the narrow circle of imperial interests. </para>

The Leader of the Government <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> when he looks at his reflection in the mirror, and observes .himself decked with the tinsel baubles of rank, may take what pleasure he can from the fact that he is a knight of the British Empire. The honorable gentleman was trained in the same university as I was, that of hard knocks; but later he became respectable, and joined the select band of knights. Had the statements which I have just quoted been made by some one less eminent than a professor of the Queensland University, the Leader of the Government would have branded him as a seditionist  as a person disloyal to his King. During election time we hear a great deal about the Empire and the Flag.

Details gradually becoming public reveal that the cargo is the first of several being sent to Canada in part payment for aluminium wire which is to be exported from Canada to Russia. </para>
                        <para>The docking of the <inline font-style="italic">A.ase Maersk</inline> is an event of outstanding importance because of past declarations by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bennett's</inline> Government on trade with Russia, and also because of the determined effort made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bennett</inline> during the Imperial Economic Conference to persuade British delegates to agree on a Russian embargo. It now emerges that the Bennett Government agreed to the present interchange of products with Russia during the conference, at the very time when the Canadian drive for a British embargo against Russian timber and wheat was at its zenith. </para>
                        <para>Earlier negotiations. - Russia appears to be badly in need of aluminium. Last summer Russia approached the Aluminium Company of Canada, a subsidiary of the Aluminium Corporation of America - a Mellon company - with a proposal for $1,500,000 worth of aluminium wire. Russia promised to pay by sending half the purchase price in crude oil and the other half in gold. The Aluminium Company of Canada, located at Arvide Quebec, is feeling the depression keenly. The plant is virtually closed down. This business would mean the immediate employment of 300 men and an additional 700 in the course of a few weeks. </para>
                        <para>The company's officials came to Ottawa and arranged with the Bennett Government to allow the oil to enter Canada, to be refined by an <inline font-style="italic">independent</inline> oil company in Montreal, and to be sold in competition with the product  of  Canadian refineries. </para>
                        <para>Secret transaction. - The transaction was kept secret until the arrival of the tanker The Government delayed unloading for three days while the matter was reconsidered, but a permit was granted on Saturday. A great outcry by the Canadian refineries against competition by communistic Russia failed to impress the Government. There is tremendous surprise in the Dominion at this aboutface by the Bennett Government, but no explanation is yet forthcoming. </para>
                        <para>The attitude of the Bennett Government in the past has been one of consistent antagonism to Russia. When Russia offered to exchange coal for Canadian farm implements, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bennett</inline> intervened forbidding any trade with the Soviet Government. In that month the Bennett Government put through an Order in Council banning imports of Russian coal, asbestos, wood products and furs. This order declared that the Government believed that political prisoners were being exploited, that standards erf living in Russia were below any level conceived  of  in Canada'. Broadly speaking, there is a Communist Government in control which regulates all conditions  of  work and seeks to impose its will on the world. This is communism, its creed and its fruits, which we as a country oppose and must refuse to support by interchange of trade. </para>
                        <para>This attitude was maintained vigorously by the Bennett Government during the Imperial Economic Conference when the demand for a British embargo against Russian timber and wheat was carried to the verge of breaking up the conference. To-day the presence of this Russian tanker at Montreal is a direct repudiation of the Government's previous position. Canadian industries which hope to gain most from a British embargo feel that the Bennett Government has hopelessly compromised its position in respect of Great Britain by agreeing to the present interchange of trade. </para>

                    <para class="block">While the Prime Minister of Canada was presiding at the Imperial Economic Conference at Ottawa he was actually negotiating a secret treaty between the Dominion of Canada and Soviet Russia. From what we have been able to learn, the Prime Minister of Canada bulldosed, not only the Canadian people and their representatives at the conference, but also the representatives of other dominions. For the information of honorable senators I quote the following editorial which appeared in a pillar of the British press - the <inline font-style="italic">Manchester. Guardian</inline> - of the 20th September of this year :- </para>

                <para>The thing which would he really worth knowing about the 9.000 tons of Russian oil now being disembarked at Montreal is the date  on which it was ordered. The oil is one side of a remarkable deal between Russia and Canada. The other side is an order for a quarter of a million pounds' worth of aluminium wire. And the question is - was' the bargain struck before or after Mr. Bennett, in righteous indignation against slave labour, stolen property, price cutting, and all other sins of communism, tried to insert an embargo on Russian goods into the text of the Canadian agreement with this country at Ottawa? When he made his gallant, if belated, stand did he know that a Russian order- worth a a quarter of a million pounds was in a Canadian manufacturer's pocket? The evidence so far to hand suggests that he did know; that at the very time when he was trying to get this country .to forswear Russian wheat and Russian timber, negotiations for the exchange were going on under his nose. That is not the only amusing facet of this most unimperial  affair. Canadian purchasers of oil are transferred from Trinidad to Russia. Canada enters the market - is it for the first time? - as an exporter of manufactured goods in competition with Great Britain. </para>

                    <para>The retention of world markets is vital to Britain. A tariff policy which discriminates in favour of the dominions may result in British products being penalized in some of her most important foreign markets, where she is already hard pressed to hold her own. In the Argentine, for instance, Britain was unchallenged until 15)14, but during the war the United States of America took advantage of this opportunity to break into this vast commercial field, and by 1923 had built up an export trade almost equal to that of Britain. By 1920 the United States of America exported to the Argentine £40,000,000 worth of goods, whilst Britain's exports were valued at £31,000,000. Germany had also managed to secure a share of Argentine trade amounting to more than half that of Britain's. The position of Brazil is somewhat similar, and, as over £1,000,000,000 of British capital is invested  in  South America, Britain cannot afford to take any action which will jeopardize her trade in that continent. </para>

                <para class="block">Does the Leader of the Government in the Senate imagine that Australia, as a# unit of the British Commonwealth, of Nations, will derive any benefit under the Ottawa agreement, particularly in the matter of meat exports, when £1,000,000,000 of British capital is invested in the Argentine republic? If the right honorable gentleman thinks that we shall, he is sadly mistaken.  His  early training in the Labour movement, and perhaps his recent activities as Minister for Defence in directing the destruction of emus in Western Australia, enables him to realize that the remarks of the  president  of the Chamber of Manufactures, New South Wales, are true. He knows that British imperialism is only a matter of pounds, shillings and pence. I ask honorable senators familiar with the record of the right honorable gentleman if there was ever a greater opponent of British imperialism than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> was some years ago. Of course that was before he became politically "respectable." In days gone by he used to throw out his political chest and move resolutions at May Day celebrations. </para>

                        <para>. - I wish, in common with other honorable senators on this side of the chamber, to enter my emphatic protest against the ratification by this Parliament of the Ottawa agreement. I approach this subject without prejudice, but as a citizen of Australia with the interests of this country at heart. In developing our trade, we must first serve Australia, and afterwards other parts of the Empire. New Zealand should be first in the order of succession, because that dominion is our nearest neighbour, and is almost entirely populated with white people. Its defence policy is, to some extent, bound up with ours. There is, therefore, no reason why we should not encourage trade reciprocity ,with New Zealand. The next country to which we should give preference is Great Britain. Australia has for many years advocated trade preference within the British Empire. I was in the Old Country twenty years ago, when an imperial conference took place, and even at that time the dominions, which were then colonies,. pressed Great Britain - unsuccessfully, I admit - for trade preference. Great Britain has now changed its fiscal policy and, as is disclosed by this agreement, is prepared to exchange preference with Australia. The British Parliament has already ratified this agreement which binds Australia, so far as our fiscal policy is concerned, to the Mother Country. The home market for primary industries which the supporters of the Government are anxious to assist, has been severely protected. In 1911-12 Australia paid £9 Is. 6d. per head of population for agricultural produce, and in 1925-26, £13 15s. Id. ; an increase of 64 per cent. I admit that there is justification for protecting the home market for our primary industries, but a sterner measure of protection is required for our secondary industries. That measure of protection is by no means being given under the Ottawa agreement, because it seeks to share with the British manufacturers the local market which is now enjoyed by our own manufacturers. We must ask ourselves the question whether the Ottawa agreement is likely to be of any great importance to Australia. In the words of a great agnostic - la there beyond this night </para>

                            <para>- As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Halloran</inline> says, this agreement will undoubtedly prove harmful to Australia. We have been accused, because of our opposition to the agreement, of being antiBritish. But my idea about world trade is that every country is influenced by self-interest. Australia in its trade relations with other countries is actuated by self-interest just as Great Britain has for many centuries been actuated by self-interest in respect of its trade and commerce. Much has been said about our primary production and about what Great Britain has done in providing markets for us. Our wool industry is probably the only one in Australia that has to compete unaided against other countries in the open market of the world. There is scarcely any other industry in Australia not receiving assistance by way of tariff protection or bounty. Great Britain buys our wool not because of its affection for us, or because of its admiration for our physical or mental characteristics, but because it obtains from us cheaper and better wool than it can purchase from other countries. The same applies to our butter and. other products. Minerals, of course, sell themselves. That, I contend, is the basis of world trade. I submit that our secondary industries which will be adversely affected by the operation of the Ottawa agreement, deserve to be protected, even against Great Britain. We must have regard for our national welfare. The following is an extract from a book called <inline font-style="italic">The Case for Protection,</inline> by Ernest Edwin Williams, Fellow of the Royal Statistical Society, and author of <inline font-style="italic">Made in Germany,</inline> a book which most of us read nearly a generation ago: - </para>

                        <para>The fostering of varied industries brings to a nation another advantage, in that its sons have a wider range in the selection of the industry for which they are best adapted. A variety of occupation in a country minimizes the national loss and individual distress which is caused by trade depressions. A nation's prosperity in general depends less on the mass of wealth produced than upon the greatest possible diversity of industries so that all the phases of national productive energy may be well developed. A nation, when the whole field of industry is kept open, can pick and choose the industries with which it will occupy itself. A State should be economic and self-contained. It is not really independent unless it be capable of producing at least the necessaries of life. Economic independence is the necessary support of political independence. A nation which depends for its food on another nation practically acknowledges that country as its suzerain. So as to be independent, a nation should strive to have all the important productive industries. </para>

                    <para class="block">Great Britain has, for a generation or so, been in the unfortunate position of having to depend on other nations for necessaries of life. . A nation, to be independent, must have both primary and secondary industries. Great Britain is largely a country of secondary industries, while Australia is a land of primary production. But we must protect and encourage our secondary industries so that we may be a self-contained nation if at any time - and God forbid that it should happen - we may suddenly have our connexion with Great Britain severed. We must develop both our primary and secondary industries if we are to keep this nation compact and unsullied by the advent of foreigners, at the same time giving preference to other units of the Empire in respect of goods which we cannot manufacture ourselves. The meaning of article 12 of the agreement is that Great Britain is to have a reasonable opportunity of competition with us in our home market. Much will depend on the interpretation of the wording of that article, and I shall deal with that matter later. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Williams</inline> continued- </para>

                    <para>As an illustration of the effect of this agreement, I may mention an industry in my own State. At Maryborough, a small but substantial town about 167 miles from Brisbane, there are large engineering works conducted by Walkers Limited, a firm that came to Queensland from Ballarat. At one time these works employed about 800 people, but through depression .and other causes, the number was reduced to 200, When I visited the works in 1930, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> S. Goldsmith, the general manager, took particular pride in showing to me a new branch for the construction of diesel engines. He looked forward confidently to a steady development of this business and to increasing the number of his employees to their former' strength. Under the Ottawa agreement, Walkers Limited, will be prevented from constructing stationary engines above 350 horse-power, although in his evidence before the Tariff Board, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Goldsmith</inline> strongly objected to any reduction of the duty on crude oil engines up to 1,500 horse-power in the stationary type, and 250 horse-power in the marine type. Other Australian makers of these engines are Ronaldson  Brothers  andTippett  Proprietary Limited, of Ballarat, and A. H. McDonald and Company Proprietary Limited, of Richmond, Victoria. About two years ago, I visited a Bowen orchard, and the proprietor mentioned with particular satisfaction a crude oil engine manufactured by A. H. McDonald and Company, of Victoria, which, he said, suited his purposes admirably. As we have proved our capacity to manufacture these engines efficiently, there should be no limitation of our right to do so; Australian manufacturers should be protected even against the machinery makers of Great Britain. </para>
                    <para>Despite all we hear of the concessions given to our primary producers under the Ottawa agreement, Great Britain also is endeavouring to protect its home markets, and there is a large section of public opinion that has supported tariff <inline font-style="italic">reform</inline> or the imposition of protective duties because of the desire to protect British agriculture, particularly in respect of meat and butter.

                            <para>-  That is true. In 1920 the Government of Queensland wanted to raise a foreign loan; plenty of money was available in London, but because the Queensland Government of the day was showing some political independence, it was denied accommodation. But Sao Paulo, a large State in Brazil, populated by a mixture of Spaniards and Indians, was able to borrow £1,000,000 from good old John Bull, who professes so great a love for his children in Australia. I place no blame on the British people; they are distinct from the Government of Great Britain. The British Government consists of the representatives of big financiers and merchants whose centre of activity is London, and not of the real British people. Those commercial interests were willing to lend their money to black, brown, brindle, yellow or white people of any country, irrespective of the views of the governments they supported ; it mattered not to them whether governments were of the revolutionary type which retain  office for six months, or of any other type, <inline font-style="italic">so</inline> long as there was a reasonable chance of getting "  shent  per  shent  " for the money lent; but they were not prepared to lend money to Australia when she needed it so badly a year or two ago. . </para>

I was in London when the 1911 Imperial Conference was being held, and I know how the idea was received. The British interests did not want to offend the people of the Argentine and Paraguay, and, probably at that time Russia also. Furthermore, they wanted to preserve good feeling with India,  China, Peril and many other foreign countries.

I should say - Let us have a 10 per cent, duty on such colonial produce as come into competition with home produce, 25 per cent, on competing foreign merchandise, and 15 per cent, on foreign merchandise which competes only with colonial produce. There is no natural reason why we should go to foreign countries for our imports. If we trade within our own Empire, foreign nations may then starve their workmen, and grind them down with unremitting toil; they may play tricks with their currency, or do what they like. </para>

The honorable senator admitted tha't £400,000,000 was invested in the Argentine. I think that those investments could be valued more accurately at £800,000.000. This would certainly be so if we include Paraguay, which is just across a river from the Argentine. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> has said that Britain has invested £2,000,000,000 within the Empire.

I estimate that the loss in manufacturing production in Australia, owing to the operation of the tariff, will amount to about £20,000,000 per annum. As a nation, we have, no doubt, been sold; but there will be just retribution. Who are Messrs. Bruce and Gullett? </para>

Although they were both born in this country, one of them lived for a score of years in England, and became imbued with British ideas. The other has also lived for a number of years in England, and is impregnated with similar views. I regard them merely as political agents for Britain. It is not necessary for mo to quote any further from this journal. Suffice it to say that it smashes the Ottawa agreement to bits in regard to the benefits that that agreement allegedly confers on primary producers. </para>

                    <para>For a brief space I wish to deal with the subject of bananas. This wonderful British Empire of which we form a part comprises about 60,000,000 or 70,000,000 white people, and 400,000,000 members of coloured races. The welding of those into one economic whole is a matter that presents difficulties of the most extreme character. The feeling is general in Queensland that the products of that State are being attacked; and any attack upon them is regarded as an attack upon every Queensland citizen. The introduction of the  Fiji  banana to Australia will upset the local trade, and prove most detrimental in its effect upon Australia's national policy. For whom is this being done? I quote the following from the report of the Fijian Planters Association for 1922: - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>Banana production has passed almost entirely into the hands of small settlers, Indian and Fijian. The decline in production is primarily due to attacks of disease, about which little is known. </para>

                    <para class="block">From my knowledge of Fiji, I should say that there has been very little investigation into the causes of the disease, and unless we exercise care, we may find that our bananas and other tropical products have become affected.

                        <para>The ravages of disease have largely discouraged cultivation. Cultural methods have been neglected. Fruit sent to New Zealand provoked complaints. In 1921, 582,925 bunches were exported, as against 1,051,629 in 1910. </para>

                    <para class="block">Fiji is a small group of islands of a total area of about 7,500 miles - hardly as !big as a large Queensland cattlestation. According to the <inline font-style="italic">Statesmen's Year-Boole</inline> for 1932, Fiji is doing very well. In 1930, it exported to British possessions products to the value of £1,167,000 and imported from them products valued at £1,077,000, the balance in its favour thus being £90,000. It is well known that Queensland had no representation at Ottawa ; and I maintain that the Australian view-point also was not truly represented there. </para>

It must be remembered, however, that a considerable proportion of the goods sent to Fiji from Australia are really re-exports of goods imported to this country from Great Britain and other countries. </para>

                    <para>The fact that Vestey's have £4,000,000 invested in one meat works in the Argentine is indicative of the enormous interests that British financiers have outside the Empire. We members of the Labour party do not intend to allow ourselves to be fooled by the shibboleths that are uttered in regard to Umpire trade. We read a little, and know something. It is difficult to gauge what is happening, from what appears in Australian newspapers. British radical and Labour journals enable one to form a true perspective of the vast organization that is known as the British Empire, and to obtain an idea of the relative importance to British financial and commercial supremacy 'of Australia and the other dominions and colonies. As a party, we do not regard fiscal issues as of the first importance. We do say, however, that Australia ought to be self-contained. We are protectionists for the good of Australia. As this agreement cannot be altered, we shall be hound to Britain's chariot wheels, particularly while our political opponents arc in power; and we shall continue to bo bound so long as we are willing to be treated as children. That is how we are being treated in connexion with this legislation. 1 shall not refer to article 12 of the agreement; it is understandable to any one who can read, and it has been debated at great length in another place. It is plain that we have been sold into fiscal bondage. </para>

                            <para>- Unlike <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> who has made pertinent interjections, the honorable senator who has just interposed appears to be rather dense. I am sorry that I  cannot supply him with a cerebrum that would enable him to meet, all emergencies. Probably his is so tightly packed scholastically that there is no room in it for other ideas. It is possible that a great deal of what he hears in this chamber has never previously entered his head. A man may be a university scholar and a barrister, and yet unread and even stupid on certain subjects. He may even believe in the Bible and Santa Claus, and may wander through fairy gardens during the whole of his lifetime. </para>

We have <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> large measure of national cooperation at the present time, but there must be a greatly increased application of socialistic control before either Australia or any other country' can achieve the status of a truly Christian nation That may appeal to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brennan.</inline><inline font-style="italic">1</inline> T we were efficiently organized in regard to production and distribution we could, in less than ten years, pay off our external debts and provide a consuming power for our products, leaving leisure for culture far greater than is at present dreamed of by our conservative opponents. After all, our cousins in the United States of America achieved political independence by cutting away from the British Empire. </para>

                PEARCE.We have  to  deal with the United Kingdom and Australian Trade Agreement Bill. the Sugar Agreement Bill, a Public Works Committee Bill, u measure providing relief from taxation, and relic to the wheat industry,  an  amending income tax assessment bill, and, possibly, a sales tax bill. There will also be a judiciary bill, and a' small crimes hill, both minor measures. The majority of those are not contentious measures. So far as I can gather that will complete the programme, which will take us into December.
