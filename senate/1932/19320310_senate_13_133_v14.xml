                    <para>. - The draftsman consulted me concerning this definition, and it is now thought that this is a better way of expressing what is intended. Consideration was given to the definitions in the South African and British acts, and we adopted something between the two. The difficulty felt by the draftsman was that if the definition were left in the form in which it passed this chamber, it would mean the undertaking of liabilities generally. I suggest, for the information of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Barnes),</inline> that without this amendment the definition might include a gentleman who wields a pencil on the Flemington fiat. It was felt that this definition should be connected with the life insurance business which it is desired to control, and the draftsman therefore suggested that this amendment should be made.

I had considerable misgiving with respect to the use of the word " exclusively " after we had remodelled the clause in this chamber. Honorable senators will see that this amendment and the succeeding one will bring the provision into harmony with other portions of the bill, and will, I think, remove any doubt. I move - </para>

The clause should read, " on account of a group or groups of insurers ", for the reasons which I gave when the bill was before this chamber. Lloyd's consists of about 28 groups, and unless we use the words, " group or groups of insurers ", 28 deposits may be required. </para>

It provides that sums of money deposited shall be invested by the Treasurer in such prescribed securities as the depositor selects. It may be important that there should be a particular prescription of the security for the purposes of this section. In order to prevent any confusion between this provision and earlier clauses with respect to the investment of depositors' money, some security should be prescribed.

                        <para>. - I appreciate the manner in which the Leader of the Government <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> has brought forward his motion. I also thank the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Barnes)</inline> for his remarks. I have no wish to embarrass the Government, or to delay the business of the Senate. Nor have I any desire to prevent honorable senators from seeing the Premier of New South Wales, the Honorable J. T. Lang, perform the ceremony of opening the Sydney Harbour bridge next week. The occasion will be an historic one; and it will provide those supporters of the Government who have expressed the opinion that it would, be well if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> were assassinated with an opportunity of gratifying their desire in that direction. When I gave notice of my motion, I had in mind something which occurred last week. Recognizing the wish of the Government to deal with certain legislation before the Easter adjournment, and accepting the assurance of its leader in this chamber, that I shall have an opportunity to move my motion before the Australian delegation leaves for Ottawa, I shall not oppose the motion which the right honorable gentleman has moved. </para>

                    <para>. -  At the outset I wish to allude briefly  to  some remarks made by previous speakers with reference to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang,</inline> the </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">Premier  of New South Wales. Press reports of yesterday's proceedings in the Senate show that one honorable senator referred to him as a " crook ", a "welsher" and a "spieler". Many leading newspapers in Australia, particularly those published in Sydney, have at various times, severely handled the Premier of New South Wales, and in some cases they have been obliged to withdraw their al legations against the personal honour of that gentleman. All I need say on this point is that, as the Premier of the leading State in the Commonwealth, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> bears just as good a character as any honorable senator supporting the Government or any honorable senator on the opposition benches, so these slanderous and cheap gibes about his being a " crook ", a " spieler " and a " welsher " may be ignored. At the best they  are  attempts by more or less obscure persons, to obtain a little cheap notoriety in the press. I remind them of an old adage that people who live in glass houses should not throw stones, and another old adage to the effect that the average citizen in any community has a skeleton in his cupboard. I feel that I can leave it at that. </para>
                <para>With these few observations concerning the nasty gibes at <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> I turn now to the consideration ' of the bill. We have been told by the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> that the Ministry has obtained the highest legal opinion as to, the constitutionality of the proposals contained in this bill. I have no desire to use unparliamentary language, but I consider it was audacious on the part of the Acting Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLachlan)</inline> to affirm that the </para>
                <para>Government  had gone to the highest sources in Australia for this opinion, but was not prepared to disclose the names of the eminent gentlemen who supplied it. I remind him that we have in this Parliament a number of eminent legal gentlemen well qualified to take their place as equals with the highest legal talent in any part of the British Empire. Were they consulted? If the Government's action is really supported by eminent legal authorities what objection can there be to disclosing their names? When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> was Leader of the Senate in the previous Administration, the present leader of this chamber, who was then Leader of the Opposition, admonished him on more than one occasion for not placing all his cards on the table. The situation to-day is reversed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> is once more a leading member in a new Ministry, and is reluctant to disclose the nature or source of legal opinions obtained with regard to this bill. </para>

                        <para>- I believe the honorable senator is right. This Government could not have exhausted the list of eminent legal gentlemen whose opinions as to the constitutionality of its proposal must be of some value. We have in another place an eminent K.C in the person of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holman,</inline> as well as another gentleman learned in the law, in the person of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Littleton</inline> Groom. I have had the pleasure of listening to their views on this bill in the debate elsewhere. In this chamber also we have in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lawson,</inline> another leading legal authority. The honorable senator was, for some years, Premier of Victoria and is, I believe now practising his profession in Melbourne. I should like to hear what he has to say on the constitutional aspects of this bill. There is also another recognized authority on constitutional law in this chamber. I refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator .Colebatch.</inline> On Tuesday last the honorable <inline font-weight="bold">Senator raised</inline> a number of constitutional objections to the bill. Although on other political subjects the views of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> and honorable senators in opposition are as wide as the poles, we have the highest respect for his opinion on constitutional questions. It is to be regretted also, that we have not had an opportunity to hear another leading legal authority, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brennan,</inline> K.C, on this subject. For the information of honorable senators I desire briefly to quote the views of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holman,</inline> K.C, in another place. </para>

If it does not allude to what was said in another place I am willing to allow it, but I .shall not allow him designedly to disobey Standing Order No. 416 which states that no senator shall allude to any debate of the current session in the House of Representatives. </para>

Those remarks, I consider, were rather cheap, and in poor taste. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> is not the type of man who would adopt cowardly methods, or make a cowardly retreat when his State was affected by any constitutional enactment.

During the conversion loan the Prime Minister, who was applauded by certain sections of the press which referred to him as "Honest Joe", and used a good deal of unnecessary press patter, said that his object in endeavouring to bring about a successful conversion of £28,000,000 was to assist in the financial rehabilitation of Australia. It was never suggested at that time that in his endeavours to give effect to such a policy he would, in addition to scaling down the interest rates, introduce a measure of this character. He was merely playing a confidence trick on the electors. Is not this Government now defaulting in the promises which it made to its supporters? The report of Mi:.

He further said that he had either to pay the interest to the bondholders or allow many of the people in New South Wales to starve. In that State in which two-fifths of the population of Australia reside, no less than £7,000,000 out of a total of £14,000,000 is being utilized to feed the unemployed. Is the Premier of that State to be condemned because he adopts such a humanitarian attitude? Are we not told in the Scriptures how our Redeemer fed the multitude.

                <para class="block">The Attorney-General of that State, whose legal ability must be equal to that of those holding similar positions in the other States, said in effect that if the occasion arises the Government of which he is a member will not allow the " bum bailiffs " of the Commonwealth to collect the revenues of that State in order to satisfy Commonwealth claims. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> definitely stated that in his opinion the action of the Government was unconstitutional. The honorable member for Martin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holman)</inline> and other eminent legal authorities have expressed the same opinion.

                <para>The Government has not received any mandate from the people to legislate in this way.

I do not know, sir, whether you have ever attended that club, but I always avoid it. The Prime Minister met these poor and feeble-minded individuals, and posed as a Mussolini.

                    <para>As usual. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McPhee</inline> was caught napping in this matter. Our Premier loses his opportunities and has to be almost thrashed into doing his duty. In our Parliament on Wednesday, nobody could have denounced the Enforcement Bill more emphatically than <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McPhee</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Walter</inline> Lee. This they did almost as soon as it was announced. Indeed, the Premier sent despatches to other States asking for official State protests. But discussion could not be ruled out of order on the later motion " that the House do now adjourn." <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ogilvie</inline> reads his motion again and speaks to it. The Attorney-General supports it, and states that if the Enforcement Bill became law, the Government of Tasmania would have to consider whether it should not join with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> in contesting its constitutional validity in the High Court. The  Speaker  realizes the importance of the whole matter. With the consent of the House he relaxes the laws of Parliament. </para>

                <para class="block">I believe that the  speaker  of the Tasmanian House of Assembly is as strict a custodian of the Standing Orders under which that Parliament works as you, sir are of the Standing Orders of the Senate. Notwithstanding <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch's</inline> praise of Western Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir James</inline> Mitchell, the Premier of that State, at a recent meeting of the Loan Council admitted that the finances of Western Australia were in a serious position. On this point I present the following figures obtained from Treasury returns for the year 1929-30:- </para>
                <para>As honorable senators will n'ote, the expenditure by the Commonwealth in New South Wales was 14s. per head of population less than the revenue received from that State, and in the case of Victoria it was 10s. per head less than the amount received, whereas in the other four States, Commonwealth expenditure exceeded the revenue obtained by 9s. per head in the case of Queensland, 15s. 9d. in South Australia, £2 5s. 4d. in Western Australia, and £3 16s. 3d. in Tasmania. What have <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> to say to these figures? Western Australia, we are told, wishes to raise the fiery cross of revolt. Not long ago some one, so it is said, had a brain wave, and designed a flag behind which the secessionists of that State were to march to Canberra and demand separation from the Commonwealth. Tasmania also, I remind the honorable senators from that State, has done very well out of the federation. As a matter of fact, Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania may really be regarded as the mendicant States. </para>

                <para>In opposing this bill, I and my colleagues in this chamber, feel that we are on safe ground. I believe that the people of New South Wales will take up the challenge implied in this obnoxious measure, which is the outcome of hatred of the Premier of New South Wales who, according to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> is an incubus that must be removed. We accept the challenge, and invite the Government to get on with the job and remove <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang.</inline> We further suggest that he give his attention to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir James</inline> Mitchell, the Premier of Western Australia, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McPhee,</inline> the Premier of Tasmania, who also have been indulging in talk of secession. If this Government attempts to establish a constitutional bailiff in New South Wales, it is looking for trouble. Its whole attitude to the States suggests that it might be as well to erect at Parliament House, Canberra, a notice that companies or persons requiring the services of bailiffs, should apply at the office of the Prime Minister. </para>
                <para>It is contended, in support of the bill, that the Government was returned with a mandate to introduce this class of legislation. I deny that. Unfortunately, the Australian Labour Party is divided into two sections, but the Government's attitude will consolidate its ranks, and I can assure the Senate that the section to which I belong will fight these proposals to the fullest extent of its power. If the Government wishes to force New South Wales into the ranks of the secessionist States, the sooner it gets on with the job the better. States that are feeling the full effects of the world-wide depression, should receive sympathetic consideration from the central Government. The Government submitted to the people a programme for the relief of unemployment, and the rehabilitation of Australia. At no time were they given to understand that there would be introduced legislation to interfere so seriously with the rights of the States. All countries are suffering in the same way and from the same causes, and I am convinced that, although the Government and its supporters may expect some relief from the approaching Imperial Economic Conference at Ottawa, the Commonwealth will never be rehabilitated until there is <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> complete change in the existing monetary system, not only in Australia, but also in all civilized countries.

                <para class="block">When the amendment was moved I did not grasp its purport. I now understand that it proposes to delay the passage of this bill until a referendum on it has been taken. Surely it cannot be held that any proposal for the taking of a referendum is relevant to the subject-matter of the bill? The Constitution contains certain provisions for the taking of a referendum, but they would not apply in such a case as this. We could not, under our Constitution, refer to a referendum a bill of this character; the only bills that may be so referred are those which propose constitutional alterations. This measure does not do that. I suggest that the amendment is not strictly relevant to the subject-matter of the bill, and I ask you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> to give a ruling on the matter. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not intend to give a silent vote on this measure, because I find myself not quite in agreement with other honorable senators from my State. Having fully considered the matter, I have come to the conclusion that in some respects the bill constitutes a danger to the States. That may be thought to be too sweeping a statement; but it is also the opinion of the Tasmanian Government, which has given the whole subject very careful attention. Although that Government recognizes that in the hands of the present Commonwealth Government there may be no objection to it, the belief is held that in other circumstances it might be used detrimentally to the interests of the States. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>The first objection to the bill is that which was raised by the Tasmanian Attorney-General in the House of Assembly, in regard to its constitutionality. Doubtless the Commonwealth Government has very carefully investigated that point, and has received the best advice available upon it. </para>
                <para>Other objections are summarized in the following statement, which was submitted to and considered by the Tasmanian Government :  - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>The authority for the Federal Parliament to enact this legislation is said to be contained in clause 105a, sub-clause 3, which provides - </para>
                    <para>The Parliament may make laws for the carrying out by the parties thereto of any such agreement. - i.e., financial agreement. </para>
                    <para class="block">The provisions of the first Financial Agreement( No. 4 of 1920), the carrying out of which by a State is sought to be provided for in the bill, is contained in Part 3, clause 2, sub-clause c of the schedule, as follows: - </para>
                    <para class="block">Each State shall in each year during the same period of 08 years pay to the Commonwealth the excess over the amounts to be provided by the Commonwealth under the last preceding sub-clause . . . </para>
                    <para class="block">Sub-clause <inline font-style="italic">d</inline> provides that the method by which payments shall be made by a State under sub-clause c of this clause shall be arranged from time to time between the Commonwealth and the State. </para>
                    <para>The question is, whether the present bill, if it becomes an act, will be one for the currying out by the State of the foregoing terms of the agreement. These terms, of course, only contemplate direct payments by the State to the Commonwealth. The bill provides a special type of machinery, under which the Commonwealth obtains satisfaction not by a payment by the State or from the Treasury of the State, but from the pockets of the miscellaneous debtors to the State. It intercepts funds in the hands of strangers to the agreement, and imposes upon them the legal duty to pay not the State but the Commonwealth. Is this a law for the carrying out by the State of its obligations to pay! It is true that if payment is made by the State debtors direct to the Commonwealth, the obligation of the State to the Commonwealth is discharged. But it may well be doubted if this result is achieved by the carrying out by the State of its obligations. It is clear also that the method of payment by a State was to be the subject of an agreement between the State and the Commonwealth. </para>
                    <para>The most serious objection to the bill in point of substance is that it gives a power of control over the States to the Commonwealth, which if carried out in the manner contemplated is destructive to the federal principle of government and also to the constitutional rights of the States. In its laudable desire to compel the Lang Government of New South Wales to pay its debts, the Federal Government is going far beyond what is consistent with the position of a State in a federal system. The essence of the measure is, that it permits the Commonwealth to intercept funds in the hands of the State debtors and discharges the debt us between the debtor and the State. This cuts away the ground from under the State. </para>
                    <para>The most far-reaching clause is 24 which gives the Governor-General power to make regulations - </para>
                    <list type="loweralpha">
                        <item label="(a)">
                            <para>for conferring on the Treasurer, officers of the Commonwealth, or authorized persons, powers of requiring returns and production of documents, and any other powers which in the opinion of the Governor-General are necessary or desirable to be conferred for the purposes of carrying out this act; and </para>
                        </item>
                        <item label="(b)">
                            <para>for imposing for the purposes of this act duties on Ministers of and officers and persons employed by the State; and </para>
                        </item>
                        <item label="(c)">
                            <para>for prescribing penalties, not exceeding in any case one hundred pounds or imprisonment for six months, for any contravention of the regulations. </para>
                        </item>
                    </list>
                </quote>
                <para>These extensive powers enable the Commonwealth to lay down a complete code of rules by which State Ministers and officers are hound, lu other words, State Ministers and public servants generally may be turned into federal officers for carrying out the purposes of the act. This means, literally, that the Commonwealth takes over the State; assumes full and complete and direct jurisdiction over its officers almost as if they were federal officers, with an additional threat to their liberty if they do not carry out these duties. Surely no federal system of government could survive the exercise of such power by the Commonwealth against the State. </para>
                <para>Clause f&gt;, sub-clauses .'I and 4, provides for legal proceedings by the Commonwealth against the State in the High Court of Australia. The taking of such proceedings gives an opportunity to the State to dispute the validity of the claim and to take any other objection which may bo open to it. But sub-clause 7, of clause 5, introduces an entirely novel method of applying such legal remedies against the State. It enables the two Houses, by passing a resolution, to bring into operation the severe garnishee proceedings which are provided in sections 7 to 13 inclusive. This is an extra-judicial method of enforcing legal remedies which is dangerous. If the normal course bad been followed in relation to such proceedings there should have been a further application to the High Court, in which the debtors to the State, or a nominal defendant as their representative, would have been given an opportunity to dispute the availability of these proceedings against themselves. The passing of a motion through both Houses of the Federal Parliament gives them no such opportunity. </para>
                <para>Clause 0 is even more dangerous; it enables the Commonwealth, which is only one party to the transaction, to obtain a judgment against the other party to the transaction in what are called cases of urgency. Who is to determine what is a case of urgency, is the party in whose interest these special proceedings are to be taken. This is a very wide power and very liable to abuse. There should lie at least an obligation upon the Commonwealth to apply forthwith for a declaration of the High Court, and if it is not applied for then further action on the Auditor-General's certificate should at once cease. </para>
                <para>The fourth objection is that there are other means of enforcement against a defaulting State which are reasonably adequate, although not considered so effective from the point of view of the Commonwealth. These are found in Part !) of the Judiciary Act, section 00 of which provides that the High Court may grant an injunction against the State and against all officers of the State and persons acting under the authority of the State, and may enforce thu injunction against all such officers and persons. Section (IS provides that no execution or attachment or process of the nature thereof shall be issued against the properties or revenues of the State, but when any judgment is given against the Commonwealth or a State the Treasury can issue to the part}' in whose favour the judgment is given a certificate in the form provided. By section 0(1. on receipt of this certificate, the Treasury of the State shall satisfy the judgment out of moneys legally available. There is also power in the court to appoint a receiver. </para>
                <para>The above powers, combined with the adherent powers of the court to punish State officers for contempt or to bind them by an injunction, particularly by what is called a  mandatory injunction ", are very extensive, and are all that should be demanded by the Commonwealth against any State, under a federal system of government. </para>
                <para>
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline>
                    Mitchell, in Chapter 5 of his book.
                    <inline font-style="italic">What Every Australian Ought to Know,</inline>
                    discusses the extent to which pecuniary obligations under the financial agreements may be enforced preferentially, that is, in priority  to  other obligations of the debtor State. It is clear from a consideration of the relevant sections of the Judiciary Act, and in the light  of
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline>
                    Mitchell's comments (written before the present bill was prepared) that the existing powers of the Commonwealth against a defaulting State are very extensive.
                </para>
                <para>The fundamental objection to these new and further powers is that they far exceed thu limit which should be set as between the component parts of a federal system of government. The fundamental principle of such a system is, that the two authorities, Federal and State, are in their legal and political relations independent. They each occupy separate fields of legislative and executive power. The present legislation subjugates the States to the federation. </para>
                <para class="block">I agree entirely with the views expressed in that statement. It is realized that, although there is no ground for fear while the present Government is in office, this power in the hands of a government or party pledged to unification would mean the downfall of the various States. Tasmania is a self-governing community, possessing the rights of a sovereign State. Those rights are gradually being filched from us by federal enactments and decisions of the High Court, and we intend to keep intact as many as possible of those that we still hold. </para>
                <para>I do not for a moment dispute the absolute necessity for some action by the Commonwealth owing to the default of New South Wales. That default has been serious. In my opinion  it  was premeditated and absolutely unjustified. I attended most of the meetings of the Loan Council and conferences of State Premiers. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> came to those gatherings with his tongue in  his cheek, took  what he could get, and went  back on  every word he uttered. </para>

                <para>This bill has had the serious consideration of the Government of Tasmania. As the State Attorney-General has said, the Government of that State is not in sympathy with the Government of New South Wales, but it is of the opinion that the steps contemplated by this measure may prove disastrous to the smaller States. During the debate it has been said that other States have defaulted. That is not correct. Deficits have probably been a great deal more than was anticipated at the time the estimates were made, but  that  is  due to the  fact that revenue returns have slumped. All the States, with the exception  of  New South Wales, can justly say that they have made a 20 per cent, reduction in their adjustable expenditure. New South Wales has made no attempt to effect such a reduction. </para>

Every other State had made a reduction of 20 per cent. Indeed, the reduction made in South Australia is between 29 and 30 per cent. In Tasmania we were not able to reduce by more than 20 per cent. We had already been working on a much lower scale than any other State, and it was much harder for us than for the other States to get down to the agreed-upon basis. Nevertheless, we carried out our promise that we would reduce our expenditure to the extent agreed upon. </para>

                <para class="block">The people having given to the Commonwealth Parliament the right to enact legislation enabling the Commonwealth to enter into an agreement with the States, and for the carrying out by the parties thereto of any agreement, we have to consider what that provision actually means. Prior to the granting of this particular power, the Commonwealth stood in relation to this particular branch of the law in the position an infant occupies under the common law. That disability, which had to be removed, was removed by the expressed will of the people. The people said, "We shall remove this disability, and so enable the Commonwealth to enter into a partnership with the various States to carry on a business that individually the parties have not been successful in undertaking, and to that end we shall give to the Commonwealth the right to decide the question of how the agreement shall be carried out ". Let me draw an analogy. A baker, a butcher, a confectioner, and an aerated waters manufacturer who may be carrying on separate businesses for the purpose of enabling a restaurant keeper to run his business, may suddenly come to the realization that each has been carrying a heavy load by borrowing in different markets, and by not having a cohesive plan which would enable the goods produced by them to be sold profitably in the restaurant. They may come to a decision that in future any money required for their activities shall be borrowed through one channel, and that any interest to be paid shall be paid through that one channel only. In coming to this agreement, would these partners have it in mind that their ordinary individual legal rights would be taken away from them? For example, is Tasmania not entitled to claim that the words, " carrying out " in section 105a of the Constitution mean nothing but " carrying out according to the law ". It may be argued that that is simply begging the question. </para>

                        <para>- I am pleased with that interjection. The right honorable senator can sit down upon legal opinions, and not allow legal men on this side to see them, but I can show him that it is not begging the question. The Constitution of the Commonwealth, according to my understanding of the law, contains watertight compartments. The powers vested in the judiciary are watertight. There is a fund of high court law relating to cases in which this legislature has attempted to set up tribunals to deal with the rights and obligations of certain parties, the High Court having ruled it is not a function of this Parliament to do so. The cases run from Alexander's to that of the recent British Imperial Oil Company's. If the Acting Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLachlan)</inline> will not disclose the names of the legal gentlemen consulted by the Government, or the opinions he has obtained, he might try to segregate tha* list of determinations from what the Government now seeks to enact. But he knows that this is merely a gesture, that the Government is simply trying to do something to show the people that it is determined to end Langism for all time. The means by which this is to be attempted is legislation which we know in our own hearts is <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires</inline> of the powers of the Commonwealth. Any first-year law student would say at once that clause 6 of this bill is unquestionably a violation of the rights of the judiciary. I challenge the Acting Attorney-General to produce an opinion from one King's counsel to the effect that it is <inline font-style="italic">intra vires</inline> of the powers of this Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- I have sufficient respect for the intelligence of the honorable senator to believe that if after we had been given an opportunity to analyse these opinions we found that they did not coincide with what the Leader of the Government said, but were really against the Government's proposal, the honorable senator would vote to refer this legislation back for redrafting just as he did in connexion with the Central Reserve Bank Bill. The Leader of the Government, as a layman, might quite honestly misconstrue a legal opinion. There is no doubt about that. I should like the Acting Attorney-General, who I think will follow me, to epitomize the legal opinions given to the Government with regard to clause 6. He could do so without disclosing names ; he could designate counsel as X, Y, Z, &amp;c. </para>

                <para>We are asked to pass legislation to enable us to " carry out " an agreement between the parties. What is the procedure to be adopted? We can put the defendant in the box; we can constitute ourselves a judicial tribunal, and try him. Will the Acting Attorney-General suggest for a moment that Ave are justified in establishing ourselves as a judicial tribunal to try this issue? Would he suggest that, we should not be guided by all those rules in our British system of jurisprudence, which have always been regarded as sacred ? Can we take on this task without setting ourselves up as a judicial tribunal? We cannot. And if we sit in a judicial capacity to decide a question as between the Commonwealth and the States we shall find, according to the line of decisions from Alexander's case, right down to the British Oil Company's case, that we are acting unconstitutionally. I invite the Government to confer with the .Attorney-General (/Mr. Latham) by wireless on this point. If it does, it will be told by him </para>
                <para class="block">I hut we have no right to establish such a tribunal. The people of the Commonwealth deliberately intended that their rights - the rights of the sovereign States - should be kept in the non-political atmosphere of the High Court. When the Senate was dealing with a taxation measure some time ago, I remember <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> admonishing the Government for attempting to break away from the high -judicial system provided by and for the people. We were forced to amend our legislation in order that the taxpayers' right to go to the High Court might be preserved. The Senate was not prepared, in that case, to allow the Federal Commissioner of Taxation to say to a taxpayer: "You shall pay a certain amount, and within a reasonable time, we will approach the High Court for a declaration." What happened in connexion with the Insurance Bill last week? The point was raised as to whether the Treasurer should have the right, as was proposed, to decide a certain issue. When the position was brought under the notice of the Minister in charge of the measure, lie did not hesitate. He saw in a moment that it was an abrogation of one of those fine legal principles for which this Parliament stands, and readily acquiesced in my suggestion to amend the provision. I ask, in the name of the States, that they be given the same rights as have been given to the insurance companies. Is that being done? Clause 6 provides that- </para>
                <para>Notwithstanding the provisions of the last preceding section, if, at any time after the Auditor-General lias given to the Treasurer such a certificate as is specified in sub-section I. of that section, each House of the Parliament resolves upon motion moved in each House by or on behalf of a Minister, that the certificate be approved and adopted, and that by reason of urgency it is desirable that (he provisions of sections 7 to 13, inclusive of this part, should apply immediately in relation to the State specified in the motion being a State to which the certificate relates) aud in order to protect, the interests of the Commonwealth until the question of .the liability of the States has been determined by the Hi"'1' Court, pursuant to an application under this section, should have effect with respect to the specified revenue of that State, the provision*: of those section? shall apply and have effect accordingly to t'ie extent of the amount «nt forth in the certificate, or of any smaller amount stated in the resolution. </para>
                <para>It is provided that the certificate shall have effect to the extent of the amount set out in the certificate or any smaller amount. First of all, when a motion i3 moved, I suppose that there will be <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> trial as to whether there has been, in fact, a default. In so far as this purports to give the Auditor-General the right to decide that question, the cases to which I have already referred are sufficient authority to show that the Commonwealth Parliament has no power to give him that discretion. Are we to sit in a judicial capacity to decide the question? The cases mentioned show we have no right to constitute ourselves a judicial tribunal. How are we to sit? Are we to act arbitrarily? Are we to do what is done when a member of thi" chamber is suspended? In such cases we bring in the judge, and the jury, without, hearing the evidence, files into the chamber. The question is put, and the jury, without having heard any evidence for or against the suspension of the member, proceeds to determine the issue. I am not going to callow the Premier of South Australia, for instance, to be tried in the circumstances in which I have seen members of this chamber tried. I am not going by my vote or my voice, to assist Parliament to do what I' know is wrong. This offends a basic principle. The people decided that the judicial powers of this Commonwealth should be absolutely removed from the political atmosphere of Parliament; that all men should have the right to enter the pure, unadulterated atmosphere of the courts and there to fight their case. The resolutions for which this bill provides may be adopted beforehand in the party 1,0 nm. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> had to stand his trial - I am not for a moment supporting a policy of repudiation - he would first bt- tried within the confines of the Nationalist party room, and effect would then be given in Parliament to the decision so arrived at. </para>

                <para>The framers of this legislation will be sorry for it long before two years have elapsed. The New South Wales Government will not go to the High Court, nor will the Commonwealth Government, because it cannot unless the New South Wales Government elects to go there. The New South Wales Government will exercise its right under State law, and the unfortunate taxpayer, without any indemnity whatever, will be forced to foot the whole bill. Every publican in New South Wales whose hotel licence falls due on the 31st March will, probably, be prosecuted by the Premier of New South Wales for sly-grog selling if he does not pay his licence-fee to the State before that date. Every taxpayer who has to meet his State income tax on a certain date will be forced to pay to the Commonwealth, and an equivalent amount to the State, or forfeit his right of appeal - a right which cannot be affected by ti- is legislation. There is not even that sense of justice in this legislation that the taxpayer is indemnified for any loss incurred in a fight that is not his. An hotel licensee who is prosecuted by the State for sly-grog selling, because he has paid his licence-fee to the Commonwealth, but has not paid to the State what its licensing laws require, will be in danger of losing his licence. It will be he who will appeal to the High Court. The Commonwealth will have his money. What will be the position of the defaulting Premier who collects the tax from the man who is prepared to pay twice .rather than risk litigation, if, after eighteen months, he is put out of office? What will he do with the revenue he collects during that eighteen months? Will he leave it in the Treasury, or will he spend it ? Let us suppose that he makes default. What will be the position if, later, it is found that this legislation is <inline font-style="italic">intra vires</inline> so far as the Commonwealth is concerned. The money will not be in the Treasury. That is why I tell the Senate  that not only is this legislation absolutely obnoxious to every principle of British jurisprudence, but that it will recoil upon the heads of those who seek to place it on the statute-hook. </para>

                    <para>. - It is to be regretted that we have to discuss this measure in an atmosphere inappropriate to calm and cold deliberation. Certain important principles emerge from a consideration of the law which we are attempting to enact. I regard this measure as being of the greatest possible importance to the financial future of Australia. Unless the Constitution empowers the Commonwealth to deal in a summary way with the position which has arisen, the Commonwealth must either seek and obtain fresh powers at the hands of the people, or Australia will be undone. Various suggestions have been made. I shall endeavour to deal with them first in principle, and later 1 shall touch on the constitutional aspect to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> has referred. </para>

I shall endeavour to show that, as regards nations, and the necessity for urgent measures on behalf of the Crown, there is nothing new in principle in what is proposed in this measure. Certain remedies are sought by it on behalf of the whole of the people of Australia against a defaulting State. The methods to be employed are as old as the common, law of England itself. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> would have us believe that, in effect, there is to be an execution first, and a trial later. To some extent that may be so; but the trial is there - the judicial power is preserved and respected. I submit that the method which it is proposed to adopt is well known and constantly employed. </para>

                        <para>- The principle is well known in British jurisprudence as a Crown remedy. I am not so bloodthirsty that I would execute anyone ; but I am sufficiently patriotic to realize that it is necessary for the Crown to obtain revenue. </para>

                <para>British jurisprudence throughout the centuries has realized the necessity of preserving the solvency of the nation. The nation has no means of financing itself, and of fulfilling its obligations to those to whom it is liable, other than through its revenues. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> referred to the collection of customs and excise revenue, as well as income and land tax. We are familiar with these things. Honorable senators know that in the event of a dispute, the money is collected first, and that later the amount of the liability is determined. That principle has been in operation since the time of Edward I. It is obvious that the necessities of the Crown require some such provision. I emphasize that the right of trial is not being denied to any one. The procedure to which I have referred was known as the writ of extent at common law. It afterwards received statutory recognition at the hands of the British Parliament; it was adopted and controlled by the Court of Exchequer of England which controlled the proceedings in reference to the Crown revenues of the Motherland. </para>

                    and other honorable senators referred to this measure as an outrage on the principles of British jurisprudence. That is so much moonshine; because this outrage - if it can be so called - has existed for centuries. Every fiscal law contains similar provisions. Honorable senators know that in the case of succession duties a title is not obtained, nor is probate released, until the revenue demanded by the Crown has been paid. They know also that goods cannot be released from the Customs House until the duty has been paid. They know too that the Income Tax Commissioner cannot be held off; that the taxpayer has to pay and that having paid, he has an opportunity of testing the question as between the Crown and the subject.

                        <para>- I shall deal presently with the constitutional aspect, which seems to be disturbing the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Barnes).</inline> I repeat that there is nothing new, or foreign, in this legislation. It applies certain principles as between the Commonwealth and the States, and it gives the States certain protection. It is an application of an old fiscal doctrine to the present position. It is the application of the ordinary law to a special set of circumstances. Before I conclude, I hope to show that there is justification for what is proposed. Fortunately, it has never previously been necessary for us in Australia to explore this branch of legislation, because under our taxation laws as well as our succession duty laws that principle has been accepted as a matter of course. In those cases no one seems to have recognized the application of this principle. With other honorable senators I deplore the necessity for this legislation. With other honorable senators I deplore that, because the Premier of one of the States has sunk to such a low level of public rectitude, it is necessary ito pass this legislation to compel him to honour his obligations under the Financial Agreement. I think I can safely say, that the application of the principles contained in this bill will not imply a denial of the judicial power of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> has touched upon that point before. He knows, as well as I do, how unwise it would be to disclose the legal opinion upon which it bases this legislation, seeing that the Commonwealth may be forced to embark upon litigation in this matter. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bae</inline> said yesterday, that he, as one citizen of New South Wales, would be prepared to rebel against this measure. One of his colleagues repeated that threat to-day. I, therefore, claim that, since we are threatened with all the pains and penalties of an action in the High Court, which will be asked to declare this legislation unconstitutional, we are perfectly entitled to refuse to disclose the opinions of our legal advisers. In this matter we are in the same position as any other litigant. In the jurisdiction of discovery, a litigant is not obliged to disclose the opinion of his solicitor or the advice of his counsel. The honorable senator knows very well that to place one litigant in an advantageous position, either by way of discovery or by means of questions in this House, is not the proper step to take. </para>

                        <para>- I should like to believe that the honorable senator and his colleagues were with us. I can only judge them by their speeches, and I cannot help feeling that while some belong to what may be described as the pale-red party, others are tinged with a redder hue. For the moment, those of the pale-red party appears to be timorous about .associating definitely with their colleagues of the deeper red, but it looks as if they are almost prepared to take the plunge. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> says, "We are with you." I like my allies to be a little more fervent in their advocacy of our cause. I like them to be a little more definite in their assurances that they will support us in our determination to preserve intact the armour with which we are invested, so that we may the more effectively champion the cause for which we stand. In short, I like them to be a little more faithful to the principles of justice as between the Commonwealth and the States. I certainly do not like to hear them declare that, although they do not approve of the action of the Premier of the defaulting State, they intend to resist, even by force, the law which this Government proposes to invoke to secure redress on behalf of the other States. That attitude implies the presence of a rebel in our midst - a rebel who intends to resist the forces of law and order. </para>

                <para>Yesterday we were told that there will lie civil strife if action is taken under this legislation, the purpose of which, after all, is merely to compel the Premier of New South Wales to honour his obligations. There was no qualification whatever about <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae's</inline> utterances, nor was there any qualification in the speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn,</inline> his colleague, this afternoon. The latter declared that he would stoutly defend the action of the Premier of New South Wales who, by his infamy, has injured so severely the people of New South Wales and the other States as well.  His  repudiation of an honorable contract has imperilled the credit of the Commonwealth. Of course, he knows exactly what his action implies, and I suggest that there is a fell design behind it all. In the course of a few months - in November next to be exact - New South Wales loans, amounting to many millions of pounds, will mature in London. What likelihood is there of the renewal of those obligations, even with the backing of the Commonwealth, if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> is allowed to jeopardize our financial stability by dishonouring contracts entered into by his predecessor and which he verbally undertook tn observe ? </para>
                <para>Notwithstanding the militant attitude of Senators Rae and Dunn, honorable senators opposite must, if they have the interests of Australia at heart, range themselves behind the Government in it? effort to restore order out of chaos in our financial affairs. </para>
                <para>It has been suggested that, instead of taking the course contemplated under this bill, it would have been simpler and more satisfactory to repeal those provisions of the Judiciary Act which forbid certain remedies being applied against a default ing State. One appreciates a point like that. As a matter of fact it received careful attention at the hands of the Government. We thought that if Ave eliminated those provisions of the act in question Ave should be able to levy toll by a direct process of execution ; that we should be able to attach the persons of some New South Wales officers and control the funds. But we found that if we did that the process would be a very tedious o.ne, and would enable the defaulting Premier to postpone a final decision for many months. We can only judge <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> by his past. We have good reason to know that it is not his habit to fulfil his public obligations, so we can only assume that, if we adopted the procedure suggested it would be many months before the cause would come to trial. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> knows as well as I do that when a solicitor receives instructions to delay the day of trial it is his duty to take advantage of every procedure open to him. I undertake to say that if I were so instructed by a defaulting State, I should be able, following the ordinary procedure of the Judiciary Act, to delay the trial for many months. The previous Administration had some experience in this matter. It is commo", knowledge that when it took action to recover interest payments from NewSouth Wales last year, it was held at arm's length for four weary months. </para>
                <para>What is the question that will be brought to trial? Is it not the solemn obligation of the New South Wales Government, under the terms of the Financial Agreement, and is not that known to both parties? What need then is there for any quibbling about the issue? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> has made it plain that he doe3 not intend to stand - up to his obligations. The only thing which the various State Premiers had in mind as likely to cause any dispute when they were considering the Financial Agreement </para>
                <para class="block">was the loan flotation costs. Accordingly, the agreement  provides that the certificate of the Auditor-General shall be final and conclusive, as against every State or the Commonwealth as the case may be. The fact that the indebtedness of an individual State might be a trial issue never entered their minds. Certainly no one dreamed then that any State Premier would be guilty of repudiation. The obligations of the various States to the Commonwealth under that agreement are well known. Therefore, the Government is resolved that in this action against New South Wales there shall be no undue delay and no procrastination, which may imperil the financial position of the Commonwealth overseas. We believe that this legislation provides the only sure remedy. We have no time for this so-called new economic thought, .this insanity of repudiation about which we have heard so much of late. That is not the way to secure relief from the burdens that oppress us; that is not the way to ensure a reduction of interest charges. And, certainly that is not. the way to re-establish the credit of the Commonwealth or the States. T.l*e adoption of that mad policy would bring ruin to the people of this country. The adoption of that course would lead us into a more difficult position. I read in one of the Sydney newspapers this morning the statement that overseas investors already were becoming alarmed concerning the New South Wales loan which falls due next November. Why? Because action of this sort has to be taken to compel that State to fulfil its obligations. The foreign money-lender cannot be coerced, or influenced in the direction of a reduction of interest, by the repudiation of our obligations or a refusal to pay what we justly owe. </para>
                <para>I again stress the point that in reality there is no question to try. These obligations are well known. The only reason why, in this measure, the right of application to the High Court is preserved is so that it cannot be said that we are taking away from anybody the right of trial. If the suggestion of the Lender of the Opposition were adopted, only empty action would follow, because there is nothing substantial to determine. The legal proceedings would drag their weary length for months, merely in order that one State Premier, who does not possess the confidence of his own people, might prolong the period of his default to his own political advantage. </para>

                        <para>- It will be sudden and sharp. What possible defence could the Premier of New South Wales have had for the action that was brought against him last year by the late Government? He had no defence; yet he held that Government at arm's length, kept it out of the courts for four months, and by various tedious processes that are familiar to the legal profession, could have kept it out much longer. The action by the Scullin Government was only make-believe, because it did not propose to remove from its path the obstacle represented by section 65 of the Judiciary Act. It could not do anything while that section remained in the act. Even if the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> were adopted, what question would be tried? In reality, there is no question. It is merely political humbug to suggest that there is. The only effect would be to postpone the time when the State of New South Wales was compelled to face up to its responsibility. </para>

Might not that lead to the condition of affairs which a bloodthirsty senator opposite suggested would be brought about if this legislation were passed? </para>

                        <para>- My friend yesterday preached the doctrine of adopting the old Supreme Court procedure of issuing execution and attaching various State servants. Which method would be the more likely to be attended with disturbance? I can visualize the friends of the Soviet Republic carrying their fiery banners, and defending the Premier of New South Wales against the incursion into their field of the forces of the Commonwealth. Is that a fitting kind of remedy for one State to employ against another, or for the Commonwealth to employ against any individual State? The appropriate remedy is that to which I have referred, because it will make for a peaceful execution. It might have been possible, under the existing powers, to have appropriated the revenues of the State, and to have compelled it to fulfil its obligations. My right honorable friend, the Leader of the Government <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> has pointed out that they have appropriated or charged their own revenues for the purpose of paying the interest on their stocks. Have honorable senators forgotten that under the Financial Agreement every State which is a party to it could seek relief against any defaulter? That shows the care which was exercised in the framing of this legislation, in the interests of every State in the Commonwealth, to keep the country's credit good. </para>

                <para class="block">There the very point arises which is covered by our legislation. The individual's lands were taken because he had not done something. The principles laid down in that decision are in keeping with those embodied in the bill before the Senate. They are well settled in law. The right of distress in the case of Crown rents is an old-established one. The point has been taken in the courts that it is necessary for the safety of the public revenue. In another connexion I shall show how important it is that that principle is preserved, and how I think it was embodied in the alterations made in our Constitution. </para>
                <para>T have already endeavoured to indicate  that this is no new form of remedy. The Crown's priorities have always been protected in every respect, and it is only in pursuance of the principle that " the safety of the realm is the highest law " that this bill has been drafted. That  is the policy which must be applied in construing the Constitution. I place the alteration of our Constitution as effected by section 105a on the highest possible plane, and presently I shall proceed to deal with that point. For the moment I pause to repeat that the remedy sought is not unknown to the law as commonly applied in this country and the Motherland, and has had recognition in the United States of America, as T have just indicated. It is impossible otherwise to safeguard the revenue of the Commonwealth as it should be safeguarded to enable the  performance of the duties imposed upon it by the terms of the Financial Agreement. It is said that we are violating the spirit of the Constitution, and not acting in conformity with it. We must consider the extent of the power granted to the Commonwealth Parliament under section 105a, but, before doing so, it is material to remember that laws made under the Constitution do not merely bind the States. They are also binding on the courts, the judges, and the people of the States, notwithstanding anything contained in any law of any State. The people of a State are not merely the subjects or citizens of that State. They are also subjects or citizens of the Commonwealth. I have already shown that this is no new remedy, no entrenchment on the judicial power of the Commonwealth. I have shown also the absolute hopelessness of placing the Crown in the position in which it. would be placed by an ordinary suit at law. That it is too ridiculous to contemplate such a thing is shown by the experience of the United States of America, and by our own experience. </para>
                <para>The Scullin Government meandered along for four months, and was not able to get a hearing before the courts. Mort' important, however, from the Australian point of view is the question of whether we are violating or carrying out the provisions of the Constitution. This bill does not contemplate any alteration of the agreement. We are legislating to carry out the agreement. There is no suggestion of any alteration of its terms. We contemplate certain judicial action, and the suggestion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Halloran</inline> that we are going behind the back of the court is not in line with the provisions of the bill. The court will have just as much play in respect of the revenues we are collecting under this bill as it has with regard to revenues we are collecting under excise customs or land taxation measures. We are not seeking to evade any decision of the court. As a matter of fact, we court an immediate decision of the judiciary to ascertain whether the arm of the Commonwealth Parliament, acting on behalf of the people of the States, is palsied or not. Let me point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> that since section 105a has been included in the Constitution there has been no expression of opinion by the High Court as to how far it carries the Commonwealth. It therefore becomes necessary to examine the section with some care to see what has been done. Section 51, defining our powers, does not, apply. Section 105a was a solemn obligation entered into between the States and the Commonwealth. The Financial Agreement was ratified by the people of the whole of Australia, and it contains within it the exact language to be employed in the alteration of the Constitution.

                        <para>- What clearer language could be employed than that in sub-section 2 which provides " That the Parliament may make laws . . ." Sub-section 5 of section 105a is binding upon the Commonwealth and the States without any limitation. The powers provided in that section are necessarily comprehensive in order to safeguard the tremendous interests involved. This section of the Constitution is of greater importance than any which the High Court has ever had to consider. It is, as some honorable senators have said, a power absolutely without precedent, and was inserted with the object of safeguarding the interests of the nation. How can it be said that the Government is not proceeding along the right lines when we consider the extensive powers granted under sub-section 3 of section 105a? If a State should fail to carry out its obligations under the agreement the Commonwealth has the power to intervene. In this instance we are leaving ourselves in the hands of the High Court which, if necesary, will decide whether our action is constitutional. It seems idle to suggest that this measure is contrary to the spirit of the Constitution, and that under the agreement only judicial action was contemplated. This Parliament would be recreant to its trust if it did not legislate in the interests of all the States and endeavour to bring a defaulting State to book. Section 105a gives a power to this Parliament which it is expected to exercise. Those who framed this amendment acted with due caution. <inline font-style="italic">[Extension of time granted.]</inline> The High Court is, of course, jealous of its judicial powers, but that court will also have due regard to the powers possessed by this Parliament. The Crown is the representative of the people, and the application of these principles to which I have referred will doubtless impress upon the court the view that no restrictions are placed upon the powers of the Parliament in this regard. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> suggested that the ordinary legal rights of a litigant are not preserved to the States; but the rights of a litigant under a land tax, income tax, excise, or similar act are preserved to the States. The honorable senator also suggested that this Parliament should not constitute itself a judicial body. Nothing of the kind is intended. All that this Parliament proposes is to make laws for giving effect to the agreement, and to apply old principles to modern acts in the interests of the people of Australia. </para>

                <quote>
                    <para>The second fallacy in the defendant's argument is in the use of the expression " sovereign State " in relation to a State of Australia. Before the great struggle of the American union for existence, costing uncounted lives and treasure, that expression was not uncommon in the United States. And that, despite the warning given by <inline font-style="italic">Story</inline> J. in his work on the <inline font-style="italic">Constitution.</inline> He says: - "In the first place, antecedent to the Declaration of Independence none of the colonies were, or pretended to bc, sovereign States, in the sense in which the term ' sovereign ' is sometimes applied to States. The term ' sovereign ' or  sovereignty,' is used in different senses, which often leads to a confusion of ideas, and sometimes to very mischievous and unfounded conclusions," (par. 207). The conclusion to which we were invited to come in interpreting the Constitution upon the assumption that New South Wales is a " sovereign State " would be both mischievous and unfounded. The term " sovereign State " as applied to constituent States is not strictly correct even in America since the severance from Great Britain (see <inline font-style="italic">Story,</inline> par 208). Still further from the truth is it in Australia. The appellation " sovereign State " as applied to the construction of the Commonwealth Constitution is entirely out of place, and worse than unmeaning. </para>

                <para class="block">What does this so-called sovereignty mean? The States have charged the Commonwealth Parliament with the duty of enforcing the agreement. Whatever the rights under the agreement may be, on the Commonwealth devolves the responsibility of carrying out the agreement. The Commonwealth is placed in the position of stake-holder for Australia. Under the Financial Agreement the Commonwealth has accepted certain obligations in respect of sinking funds, future borrowing, and conversions. Surely the body which has accepted those responsibilities" should have the widest possible powers. However we may play on the words contained in sub-section 5 of section 105a of - the Constitution, it is abundantly clear that the States intended that this Parliament should have that power; and by their acceptance of the alteration of the Constitution the people implemented that intention. Looking at this matter as Australians ought to do, and realizing that it is practically the ground-work of our national existence, we are forced to the conclusion that the Parliaments of the States, as well as the people of the Commonwealth generally, intended that the power which we are now seeking to invoke should be vested in the Commonwealth Parliament. </para>

                    <para>. -  During this debate the Premier of New South Wales, which State I represent in the Senate, has been so vilified by some honorable senators, that I feel it incumbent an me to offer some defence on his behalf. I must confess that I have been surprised at the tone of this debate. Throughout it there has been evidence of an intense hatred of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. La-rig. Senator Foll,</inline> while criticizing the Government of New South Wales, offered apologies on behalf of Queensland, stating that the troubles confronting that State were of such a nature that its Government had no control over them. At a Premiers Conference held in Canberra, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Barnes,</inline> the Treasurer of Queensland, when asking the Commonwealth for financial assistance, expressed confidence in his State, and his belief that it would not be necessary to reduce wages or interest. He thought that a little consideration from the banks would enable Queensland to pull through. Twelve months later, at a conference held in Melbourne, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce,</inline> the then Prime Minister, said that he thought that Queensland appeared to be in a hopeless position. He asked <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Barnes</inline> what Queensland intended to do the following year. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Barnes</inline> replied that he did not know. In studying the minutes of that conference, I find that various States received financial assistance from the Commonwealth. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McPhee,</inline> the Premier of Tasmania, asked for a mere £80,000 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> informed him that he could have half that amount. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McPhee</inline> said that that amount would not bc sufficient, and that before accepting it he would have to place the matter before his Cabinet. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> then told him that he could take it or leave it. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McPhee</inline> took it. </para>

In the light of the resolution recently passed by the Tasmanian House of Assembly, it will be interesting to see how honorable senators representing that State will vote on this measure. I hope that they will be true to their political faith, and follow their leader, right or wrong, as I myself would do. In view pf the difference of opinion which exists among legal authorities and others regarding this vital measure, I move - </para>

The amendment, if adopted, will enable the Government to reconsider its attitude. The proper course is to appeal to the High Court for guidance with regard to the constitutional objections that have been raised against the bill. If its decisions proved to be favorable, the Government might then be justified in proceeding with it. This Parliament has made one serious blunder since I have been a member of it. Some years ago, in Melbourne, it passed the Crimes Act, which provided for the deportation of certain people; but that legislation proved to be ineffective because of a decision of the High Court. To-day we are in a somewhat similar position. Eminent members of the legal profession are not agreed upon the constitutionality of the bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> has assured us  that he has had the opinion of King's Counsel, that it is unconstitutional, and the Acting Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLachlan)</inline> this afternoon endeavoured to persuade us that legal opinions obtained by the Government approved of the course now being taken. As a layman I contend that, if there is the slightest doubt about the matter, the Government should first approach the High Court, so as to save the taxpayers from being involved in heavy costs following litigation between the States and the Commonwealth. </para>

If, as a nation, we endeavoured to do what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> has done in New South Wales, and if we refused to pay interest on our overseas debt, the people to whom we owed the money would not be without their remedy. We should have to continue exporting our surplus products, and these would be seized in settlement of claims against us. In all probability also they would decline to have any further transactions with us unless we mended our ways and agreed to pay our just debts. </para>

                <para>No one will deny that our position is a desperate one. Australia, with a population of six and a half millions, cannot go on indefinitely paying about a million pounds a week in interest on borrowed money. Other nations that were involved in the Great War are in much the same position. All are struggling under burdens that are proving too great for them. The only way out, in my opinion, is for the League of Nations to formulate proposals for the cancellation of all war debts, so that the people of all countries concerned may start afresh. I firmly believe that this course will be necessary in the not distant future. Something must be done to give relief. </para>

                    said yesterday that the confidence of overseas investors in Australia had been so rudely shaken by the attitude of the Premier of New South Wales that the credit of a central African State, peopled by blacks who wore little more than a loin cloth, was on a higher level in the London market; that this African native State could borrow money at a time when Australia could not. I hope it will be a long time before we are able to borrow money in London, because our policy of borrowing overseas has got us into our present difficulties. Instead of depending on our own credit resources, and raising in Australia all the money required for developmental purposes, we have always been too eager to borrow abroad.

                        <para>- There may be something in what the honorable senator says. Perhaps the eminent legal gentlemen who advised the Government on the constitutional aspects of its proposals are looking forward to the time when they will be earning big fees arguing before the High Court cases arising out of this legislation. Perhaps this explains their disagreement on many of its vital principles. Why should the taxpayers' money be squandered in litigation, when all doubts as to the constitutionality of the bill could be settled by a reference to the High Court? The Government should postpone further consideration of the bill with a view to an appeal to the High Court, which is the highest tribunal in the land, to determine the issues involved. Even if the Government takes action against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang,</inline> and is supported by a High Court decision, how will it compel him to pay his debt to the Commonwealth? What will happen if he advises the taxpayers of his State not to pay taxation to the Commonwealth Government? The prospect is not a very comforting one for the taxpayers of Australia. It should not be necessary to take action to compel any Government to pay its just debts. Each State should pay its proportion voluntarily. I urge honorable senators to avoid doing anything that will drive the Governments of New South Wales and the other States into the High Court, and involve them in heavy expenditure. They already are staggering under a burden that they find difficulty in carrying. Let us not add to it by passing a measure that will probably prove to be unconstitutional. </para>

                    <para>. -  An appropriate short title for this measure would be " A bill for an act to try to make an honest man out of one who is dishonest." There is an old saying, however, that people cannot be made moral by act of Parliament. It would thus appear that we are faced with a hopeless proposition. The amendment proposes to delay the passage of the measure for a period of six months. With all due respect to its mover, I submit that the matter should be settled at once. </para>

                <para>It has been frequently stated. that the provision for the making of laws to carry out the Financial Agreement was an after-thought, and that it stretched the agreement beyond its original meaning. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne,</inline> last night, referring to this aspect of the matter, made a point that was deserving of more attention than it received. He showed that the provision relating to the making of laws for the carrying out of this agreement is in the forefront of the schedule to the act, proving that it was one of the principal thoughts of those who made the agreement and passed the legislation giving effect to it. The wording - </para>

                    <para>Whereas permanent effect cannot bc given to the proposal in the scheme unless the Constitution of the Commonwealth is altered so as to confer on the Parliament of the Commonwealth power to make laws for the carrying out or giving permanent effect to such proposals -  establishes the fact that this was no afterthought and no straining of the meaning of the agreement. I am not a lawyer, thank goodness, and therefore am not greatly concerned as to whether this measure is constitutional or not. Even if I were a lawyer, and gave a decided opinion, that opinion would not be worth very much, because I should not be the final arbiter; the matter has to be settled by the highest legal tribunal. I am considering the matter from a purely layman's point of view, as well as in the light of the fact that this is the States' House and that we are expected to look after their interests. I am not here to represent the interests of any other State; my particular concern is the interest of Western Australia. </para>

Speaking from memory, I believe the average payment throughout the Commonwealth at that time was £3 12s. a head, and that the payment made by Western Australia was £5 odd a head. That, I consider, completely answers the charge that we are always knocking at the door of the Commonwealth for assistance. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot say where it comes from. I know that the fortieth ordinary lottery has been drawn, and that the third special bridge lottery has been fully subscribed. This has been going on while the rest of the Commonwealth has been called upon to pay the just debts of that State. It would be immensely to our liking if we could borrow money at a very low rate of interest. The point that I wish to make, however, is that nobody has yet come along and said, "I have £4,000,000 or £5,000,000; I would like you to take it and do what you can with it, paying me interest when and how you can." The State of New South Wales, like almost every other State, went on its bended knees and begged these people to lend it money. Yet the Premier of that State now says that he cannot pay the interest which is due on the money thus borrowed, because to do so would be to interfere with the standard of living of his people! He borrows from people whose standard is not half as good as that of the people of New South Wales, and uses the money to maintain that standard, yet refuses to pay them the interest which is due to them ! That is playing the game very low down. If the Commonwealth Government does nothing but bring the matter to a head, and sees that it gets its just rights under the agreement, which .was not only entered into quite freely by the States, but also approved of by the people at a referendum, something will have been gained. Governments frequently do things which the majority of the people do not approve, but in .this case we have something which has been approved not only by the governments of the States, but also by the people of the States. In no circumstances can people cavil at the Financial Agreement. But I do not suppose that one-quarter of one per cent, of the people ever dreamt that a government, having signed the agreement, would not honour it. When, in 1914, the German Chancellor referred to the Belgium Treaty as a scrap of paper, the whole civilized world was horrified. Yet that is what is  occurring in Australia to-day. We have a government saying, "Yes, we signed that agreement', hut we do not propose to honour it ". This legislation cannot be proved to be unconstitutional until it is passed and put on the statute-book. We could not first call upon the justices of the High Court to give their opinion upon the constitutionality of a measure, and then proceed to pass it. The whole structure of the Commonwealth will crash if New South Wales does not honour its obligations, and the sooner we know where we stand, and whether the people of Australia are behind the Commonwealth Government or not, the better for all concerned. I shall support the bill in the hope that the Government will see its way clear to amend clause 6. </para>

                    <para>. - I should not like the second reading to pass without expressing my general view upon this bill, more particularly because at the last election so much was made of this particular question, and because the verdict of the people on the matter of honouring obligations, standing up to financial contracts, and maintaining the soundness of finance, was very clear indeed. I do not wish to draw undue attention to my own State. As a matter of fact, in this debate I think there has been too much talk of States, and too little talk of the interests of Australia as a whole. Personally, I am most sympathetic with Western Australia and Tasmania, which have had very hard treatment, particularly Tasmania, as a result of federation ; but I draw attention to my own State because I know the position there, and because, apart from the speech of the Acting Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLachlan),</inline> all the remarks so far offered in connexion with this measure have come from honorable senators from South Australia who are opposed to the Government. The verdict of the people of South Australia at the last election was nearly two to one in favour of this Government. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> was returned at the head of the poll with an enormous majority, and I do not think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> and his colleagues will question my claim that if they had gone to the poll at the last election, they would have bitten the dust as their fellows- did. </para>

                        <para>- Any State or country which drops a man like <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Glasgow does so to its very great loss: I think honorable senators on both sides will agree with me in saying that. I* any ease, the defeat suffered by the Queensland senators was a very small one, and was attributable to many factors, among them the fact that for some years there had been a Nationalist Government in power in the State. I was, however, speaking about South Australia. The answer of the people in that State was unqualified and most direct. It was that the Premier of New South Wales and his Government should be dealt with in as effective a way as possible. Although I am pleased to do so, I am not pleased that we should have to raise antagonism between the Commonwealth and any State, particularly the greatest and oldest of all the States. Undoubtedly there has been extraordinary delay and procrastination, repudiation and default, on the part of the Premier of New South Wales, and the time has arrived when the matter should he dealt with firmly. </para>

As our Standing Orders provide that the Senate must intervene when senators quarrel, it might be necessary for the whole of the Senate to adjourn to Sydney or wherever the trouble was taking place, to separate the combatants. I do not think, however, that there will be any need for that. As I read the situation, the Premier of New South Wales has fought his fight; he has carried out his bluff to the very end in a way which would not be possible to any man except one of considerable courage.  His  bluff, however, is now being called. He is being taken on by a stronger man, and, as usually happens in such cases, the bully will probably give way. </para>
                <para>On the question of lawyers <inline font-style="italic">versus</inline> laymen, very much referred to in this debate, I should like to say with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carroll</inline> and others that it is impossible for the layman or even the ordinary legal practitioner to form any idea of what is the value of conflicting opinions. You cannot say that because a man happens to be a King's Counsellor, his opinion is of equal value to that of another King's Counsellor. There are specialists in different branches, whether it be libel, criminal or constitutional law. The opinion of a man who may be a first-class legal practitioner in the law of libel may not really be very sound on constitutional questions. </para>

In this case, faced with a difficult problem, and desirous of acting within its powers and constitutional rights, the Government would naturally not be anxious to put on the statute-book a measure likely to be attacked and defeated, and I have not the slightest doubt it would take the opinions which appeared to it to be the most valuable in the whole land so that if a case were taken to the court the decision would be in its favour. That is the inevitable course for the Government to follow, and any one who knows the ability of the present Attorney-General must surely realize that his opinion in itself is one of the most valuable of all constitutional opinions in the whole of this country. </para>

Even so, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> will agree that it is possible for the best of lawyers, jurists, medical practitioners or clergymen to make mistakes. It is human to err. The best we can do is to select the men who are most likely to guide us correctly and to follow their judgment. If they are not right - I stress this point - the High Court will undoubtedly rule them to be wrong. That will not be to the benefit of the Government or of those who have advised it; but personally I do not anticipate that that' will occur. After making due allowance for human errors, it is probable that those who have carefully drafted this measure have done so in order to give the Government the maximum power without exceeding its constitutional rights. The High Court will decide the matter when it comes before it. Honorable senators are aware that certain amendments have been made to the measure since it was originally introduced which, to a certain extent if not entirely, obviate the objections which might have existed, and which no doubt did exist, to clause 6 as it was originally drafted. The effect of it is, in fact, that while urgent action can be taken, and no doubt will be taken, the whole matter is subject in a very short time to review by the High Court. </para>

                <para>I hold that we should take any action within our constitutional powers, that is, which the Government considers is legal, even if that action is unusual. Delay is dangerous. It was most desirable that this measure should be drafted in such a way as to enable action to be  taken at the earliest possible moment. The Scullin Government commenced proceedings in the High Court about a year ago, and nothing whatever eventuated from those proceedings except that, according to the statement of the Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Greene)</inline> a huge pile of correspondence and documents has accumulated. The case was eventually withdrawn from the High Court after some months, but no progress was made. </para>
                <para>At the recent general election the people definitely stated what they wanted done, and the Government is, therefore, justified in taking action with as much rapidity as is possible. The Acting Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLachlan)</inline> said that, when a fire was in progress it was useless for any one to wait for authority to give the alarm. In this connexion I again quote the Latin saying that if one's neighbour's house is burning one must look after one's own. That is the position in which Australia is to-day. Even States so far removed from the centre of administration as Western Australia find that Now South Wales is being set on fire by its Premier. I suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> that it is not sufficient to sit in one's studio when there is a fire next door and write a letter to a newspaper saying that the firemen are infringing their rights by trespassing on your property, and may destroy your flowers. In cases of emergency it is useless to stand idly by and say that at some future time the action which is being taken -may be of danger to a particular State. We have to deal with the danger while it exists. </para>

                        <para>- The fire has already been lit. The honorable senator suggests that I am carrying fire into New South Wales. The facts on their face provide a contradiction. I have not indicated any desire to carry fire or firearms into New South Wales. On the contrary, I say to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae,</inline> who spoke in unequivocal terms as to the way iu which they would fight if necessary in the interests of the State which they represent, that they think only of their State and not of the Commonwealth. </para>

                <para>I remember reading many years ago of an incident in Great Britain in the early days of the late Joseph Chamberlain - he was somewhat of a republican when he was young, but he learnt wisdom later on - when a good many republicans were threatening to march upon London. Chamberlain, I think, made some speeches, and Lord Salisbury, speaking in the House of Lords, invited him to lead the fiery insurgents, in which case, he said he would certainly get his head broken. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> accepted the invitation on the condition that Lord Salisbury led the other side, in which case, he said, if his head were broken it would be broken in very good company. I could not help thinking of that when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> and the Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Greene)</inline> were composing their differences; hut I do not think it will be a case of broken heads in this instance. </para>
                <para>I now come to a question of some importance, which, in some respects, is causing the greatest difficulty to those who do not find themselves able to vote for the bill. In their case it is a question of State interests. I am opposed to unification. My sympathies are, naturally, with the smaller  State3,  which have had very little satisfaction out of federation. I do not in any way speak as a unificationist; I have no desire to see unification brought about. I do not think that any of the smaller States desire unification, particularly at this time when one considers the enormous population of New South Wales and Victoria, as contrasted with that of the less populous States. It is in. the interests of the less populous States to pass this bill. It is an indication to them that the Commonwealth is defending, not only its own interests, but also the rights of the smaller States, and how honorable senators like two of my friends from Western Australia can say that when, in effect, they are voting for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang,</inline> they are studying the interests of their States- </para>

                        <para>- Then I withdraw the statement; I was merely trying to indicate that, whatever may be the intention of those honorable senators, that, in effect, would be the result of their voting against this bill. They do not desire to do so; but they are ranging themselves with those who are either definitely in agreement with the policy of the Premier of New South Wales, as in the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn, Senator Rae</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mooney,</inline> or with the official Labour party. I listened carefully to most of their speeches yesterday and to-day; but I do not know exactly the point of view of the members of the official Labour party. They said a good deal to the effect that they do not agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang,</inline> but they would oppose the bill. It appeared to me that the Lang supporters in this debate were far more logical, even if far more undesirable - I say that without any offence - than the members of the official Labour party. I have no desire to be offensive to the representatives of Western Australia in this chamber, but I believe that in voting against this bill they are doing something which is intensely, although not intentionally, hostile to the interests of their State. </para>

Those who contested their seats are in a better position to know what the people want, and even my friends from Western Australia, who are opposing the bill - I say this without offence - were not before the people at the last general election.

Every one will recognize that there is a possibility of it being used, as a step towards unification, to which I am opposed. Battles, however, cannot be won without losing men, or to express the idea in a more humorous way, I may say that omelettes cannot be made without breaking eggs. We are bound to take some risks in every fight. </para>

                <para>Reference has been made to the restoration of confidence, both in Australia and overseas.. Confidence will be promoted by the measure which we passed a few days ago, as well as by that now before us. It is not fully realized in Australia how little people overseas think of the State divisions, which mean so much to us. The people of other countries do not know us as residents of New South Wales, Western Australia, Tasmania, or any of the other States, but as Australians. For that reason, when any State of the Commonwealth defaults, repudiates, or does anything which in the opinion of the world generally is discreditable, the whole of Australia suffers. In the circumstances, it is essential that the Commonwealth as a whole, should, as 'some of the States have done, dissociate itself from the defaulting State, and take such action as is possible to safeguard present and future investors. We cannot tell how long the effect of these repudiations will last. Professor Morison, of Harvard, in his <inline font-style="italic">History of the United States of America,</inline> writes - </para>

                    <para>The panic of 1837, and the hard times that followed, made it impossible for some of the States and corporations to meet their obligations. ... A suspension of interest payments on the Pennsylvanian bonds, in which Sidney Smith had invested, caused his famous outburst against, a nation with whom no contract can be made because none will be kept, and his facetious proposal to divide the raiment of Pennsylvanian visitors in London among the creditors of their State. Pennsylvania eventually paid every penny due, with interest; but as late as 1845 the interest payments were still suspended on the bonds of seven States, two of which, Michigan and Mississippi, repudiated. Since the non-stability of States was protected by the eleventh federal amendment there was no way of forcing them to pay up. These financial vagaries, and Dickens' literary exploitation of them, made the task of preserving Anglo-American peace in the early forties much more difficult. . . </para>

                        <para>have spoken longer than I intended. My excuse is that this bill is of vital importance to the Commonwealth. Grave difficulties exist as between the Commonwealth and a State, and it is impossible at this juncture to say what the result of the passing of this measure will be. I have not the slightest doubt in my mind - and in that there is some satisfaction - that the action which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carroll</inline> and others, including myself, propose to take in the interests, not only of the Commonwealth, but also of the separate States, as well as to preserve Australia's credit and reputation overseas, is the only possible action for us in the circumstances. </para>

                <para class="block">This legislation is a tilt at the Premier of New South Wales <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lang).</inline> The arguments advanced by Ministers and their camp followers have made it plain that it was conceived in hatred of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> and his political friends in New South Wales, but it is so far reaching that representatives of the other States are now somewhat concerned about future possibilities. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes</inline> this evening endeavoured to persuade honorable senators that it had received the endorsement of the electors recently. I am prepared to lock political horns with the honorable senator in rebuttal of any statements of that nature. I deny that the people gave the Government a mandate to introduce this class of legislation. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carroll</inline> also reminded us that we were sailing through an uncharted sea and without a compass. </para>

                <para>SenatorRAE (New South Wales) [10.9] .  - There is a very good reason why the amendment should be adopted. The Government proposes to limit the operation of the act to two years, the reason, I understand, being that a number of honorable senators have expressed the fear, which I believe to be groundless, that while it might be a very desirable weapon in the hands of a Nationalist government, it would be a dangerous power to place in the hands of a future Labour government, which might, so they say, force the smaller States to accept unification. During my second-reading speech, I made it clear that I, for one, would scorn to attempt to " sneak " in unification by such a stupid and grotesque method. But since the Ministry has determined to limit the act to a period of two years, it is only logical that we should endeavour to make its operation synchronize with the life of the Government which introduced it, which period, I hope, will not be long. But be it short or long, the act would cease to have effect with the defeat of the Government, and everything in the garden would be lovely. </para>

                    <para>. - I am opposed to this clause, because in my opinion it constitutes a distinct breach of the judicial power of the Commonwealth. It proposes to take out of the hands of the judiciary the determination of a question that should be left to its decision, and to place it in the hands of an officer of the Public Service - certainly an officer of some standing, but not equal to that of the judiciary. It seems to me to override and to place a slight on the standing of the court. In my opinion the court is the only qualified body which should appear in this matter. </para>

                <para>Even if the bill should be carried without any amendments, other than those desired by the Government, I very greatly fear that it will not carry the Government one step forward. It cannot be expected that the States, particularly the one that has been under review during the debate on this measure, will take this kind of thing lying down. The Acting Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLachlan)</inline> said to-day that, as a legal man. if he were entrusted with the task, he would undertake to hold up this business for two years. Does any member of this Parliament believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> will sit down quietly and submit to the dictation of a person who has not the standing of a court? If the Government thinks that either <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> or the Premier of any other State will accept this without a protest, it is greatly mistaken. The States will invoke the aid of the best legal talent available. There is plenty of it waiting to be employed, and it will gladly pick this very juicy plum. There are legal luminaries who could hold up the matter for 200 years if they lived that long. The Government will find itself in conflict with, not only the State which has been brought prominently into the picture, but every other State in the Commonwealth. In all probability Hew South Wales will take up the gage of battle, and will have the financial and moral backing of all the other States. </para>

I wonder what the people whom they represent, and whose rights they are supposed to safeguard, will say to them when they feel the effect of this legislation? Every State will be brought under the lash to the same extent as that State against which the Commonwealth now desires to take drastic action. No one knows when another State will have to juggle with its finances so as to keep faith with its creditors. The Commonwealth Government will then be called upon to pay what is due, so as to avoid default. </para>

                        <para>- My argument applies to both of those clauses. If any other State should find itself in the position that was occupied by New South Wales, it will have to rely upon the Commonwealth to discharge its obligations, and the Commonwealth will have to do so without waiting to put into operation any other machinery. This is not a shadow at which I am sparring. Every piece of machinery at the disposal of the Governments of the States will be used to fight the Commonwealth if it endeavours to act in the manner proposed by the bill. We should be deluding ourselves if we thought that anything else would happen. The States would fight to the last ditch to preserve their rights, and would be justified in doing so. The States are as much entitled to their own opinions as we are to ours. The people in the States are Australians as much as we are. However, it is futile for the Opposition to fight this issue. Our responsibility, seeing that the numbers are against us, is to place on record our protest against this method of carrying on business. </para>

                    <para>. -  The whole of the  trouble, and probably the greater part of the unconstitutionality  of this bill is embodied in this clause. If the amendment is rejected the High Court decision  will  operate as a charge upon all the revenues of the States. That means that in every department of the State where revenue  is collected the Commonwealth will be  able to raid the coffers of the State, Commonwealth officials will be able to enter the State like an army of invaders, turn out the ordinary officials, take their places in the departments and run the  show.  It is a proposal for a kind of forceable fastening of the State to the chariot  wheels of the Commonwealth. The  Commonwealth can thrust any duty it likes upon the public servants of the State, and can penalize them if they refuse to obey  the  behests of the Commonwealth. The people of the State will be reduced to a condition of absolute servitude. The proposal is not only preposterous, but also  abominable and detestable.  I  do not  care about the constitutionality of the measure. I condemn its vindictiveness and injustice. No one has shown that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> has said he would not pay. I  challenge  any honorable senator to  bring  forward any written or printed document showing where he has said that he would not pay. I also challenge those who declare that the other States are paying what New South Wales is not paying. I venture to say that no other State  has  paid a penny. When the Commonwealth agreed to hold itself responsible for any debts unpaid by New South Wales, it arranged with the Commonwealth Bank for the necessary financial credit, and it is all " tommy rot " to say that  the other  States have been bled in order to support New South Wales, or that New South Wales is loafing on them. </para>

                        <para>- Technically they may be carrying their proportion of the liability, but it is a phantasy of the imagination to say that any other State has paid a red cent on account of the default of New South Wales. It will be an incentive to civil turmoil and even civil war by reason of the resentment that will be shown by an overwhelming majority of the people of New South  Wale3,  who, even if technically responsible for the actions of the Government which is in power are not individually responsible for what has occurred. Whatever a State Government may do, whether it is right or wrong, the people of that State should not be penalized and humiliated for something beyond their power to alter. This Government can, if it likes, proceed to accentuate its spleen and venom against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang.</inline> Instead of intensifying its bitterness it should adopt the phrase which is sometimes on their lips, " Come, let us reason together." Instead of doing that it is invoking the law to compel one State in particular, to accept its dictation as to how the revenues of the State shall be handled. It is not a question of whether <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> has the money to pay. It gives this Government, as the representative of a faction or a class power, constitutionally or otherwise, to reduce the standard of living in New South Wales, by abolishing the basic wage and child endowment- </para>

All the institutions peculiar to that State will be at the absolute mercy of this Government. It gives its representative the power to inquire in the minutest detail into the private lives of the people, and into matters of trade and commerce, with which it has no concern. This measure has been submitted to bring humiliation upon New South Wales and its people, and I repeat what I said on a previous occasion, that 1 shall be prepared to fight if necessary by armed force side by side with tens of thousands of people in New South Wales to prevent such an intolerable invasion of the natural rights of the citizens of a free State. </para>

I invite honorable senators to study the concluding words of this clause. Unification does not enter into the matter. Studying this question from the view-point of all parties to the Financial Agreement it will be seen that the Commonwealth Parliament is entrusted by the States with the right to pass theneccessary legislation to carry out the agreement. There is no doubt about our justice and equity. We proceed to immediately place ourselves in the position of a preferential creditor even over any Stale which may have claims against another State.Is that acting fairly between the parties? What of the rights of those who have entered into railway and other contracts with the Government of New South Wales. Are not those contracts as sacrosanct as the contracts referred to by the Government? Are not those who have entered into contracts with the New South Wales Government entitled to see that their contracts shall be observed ? By what moral or legal right can we claim under the agreement that we have the power to declare ourselves a preferential creditor? The Acting Attorney-General referred to certain old-time processes and to preferential claims. Wherever there has been a preferential claim by the Crown there has been a condition precedent to the position before the obligation occurred. Contracts have been entered into between private individuals and a State and between States. These States have rights which at any time may be enforceable at lav. This is the Parliament that is supposed ro hold the scales evenly between the parties to the contract, but which now legislates in its own interest and to the detriment of one party to the agreement. What will be the position of a business man or a farmer who has a claim against the State? Their claims can be satisfied only after the Commonwealth has settled its claim. If this is not the most pronounced step towards unification that has ever been taken, I do not know what is. If I can be shown any such legislation enacted by a Parliament which, in effect, is in a fiduciary position, I shall' he surprised. The Commonwealth and the States entered into an agreement. </para>

                        <para>- The State is liable in respect of obligations, incurred intrastate and interstate; but this Government now says that it does not matter if those contracts are repudiated. The Minister cannot deny that under this provision the Commonwealth becomes a preferential creditor. The Commonwealth is a party to the agreement, and it is entrusted with the right to pass legislation, for carrying, it out. Notwithstanding that the Commonwealth now contends that if it is suffering as a result of something done by New South Wales, all other contracts must be defaulted in Order that its claim may be met. It is a most iniquitous provision. The New South Wales Loan Acts, to which the Minister referred, relate to a condition precedent to a person lending the money. This is dealing with contracts that have been in existence for years. </para>

                    <para>. -  I support the amendment, which I consider to be most reasonable. Unanimity in federal matters is most desirable. At the present time, there is a prejudice against one State. I would not attempt to violate the Standing Orders by referring to motions which have been carried during the present session: but I remind the Senate that in times long past', an honorable senator who committed an offence against the Standing Orders, and was thereupon named, was sometimes condemned on a strict party vote, in which members who had no knowledge of the cause of the trouble took part. That sort of thing happened years ago, and it may happen again A resolution affirming that certain debts are due by a State should not be the result of a decision arrived at by members of a political party who are so prejudiced that they will take almost any action to accomplish their desires. The only way in which we can avoid such things is to provide that' the verdict shall be unanimous. If the members of both Houses decided unanimously that a certain course should be adopted, it would indicate the ushering in of a new era of perfect brotherhood, and therefore the amendment should meet with ready acceptance by all sections of the committee. This measure is supposed to be for the supreme good of even the State of New South Wales, and what could be more logical than to say that the representatives of the people should be unanimous in regard to the action to be taken? </para>

                    - I have been endeavouring to do so. I wish to point out the advantages that would result from acceptance of the amendment. This would prevent any dispute arising over the financial arrangements to bc effected under the measure. Instead of different methods being adopted from time to time for meeting a situation brought about by the default of any State, valuable guidance would be afforded by the expression of the unanimous opinion of both Houses on the matter.

                <inline font-style="italic">very</inline>
                brief appeal to the Senate to reject this clause. At the outset of my remarks, I wish to enter the strongest possible protest against the suggestion that has been made by honorable senators supporting the Government, that those of us who are opposed to the clause on the ground of its unconstitutionality are allying ourselves with the Lang party and the Lang plan. We are entitled to our opinin. It is my firm conviction that the passing of this clause will immensely strengthen

                hand. I put it to supporters of the Government that if this clause is declared by the High Court to be unconstitutional the position of the Commonwealth Government will be very greatly weakened, and
                <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang's</inline>
                position tremendously strengthened. Holding this view, we are in duty bound to give expression to it. I listened this afternoon to the speech of the Acting Attorney-General
                <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLachlan)</inline>
                who did not quote one single authority in support of his contention that the clause is constitutional, and I must confess that his speech did almost more than anything else to convince me that not only is it unconstitutional, but that the Government itself has very little confidence in it. The other day, I stated that an eminent Sydney barrister, whose name 1 was not at, liberty to disclose, had given an opinion directed against the constitutional authority of this clause. I am now able to direct attention to an opinion, given in a series of informative articles published in the public press by
                <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Norbert</inline>
                Keen an, K.C., a leading barrister in Western Australia. That gentleman was, for a long time, Attorney-General in the State Government, and on more than one occasion has been retained to go to London to plead important cases before the Privy Council.
                <inline font-style="italic">No</inline>
                one who knows him would for a moment think of associating him with anything in the nature of repudiation.
                <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Keenan</inline>
                says, very definitely, and gives his reasons for his opinion, that the Government made an error when it failed to pay New South Wales' interest obligation on the due date. He also asserts that this clause overrides the Constitution insomuch that it usurps the judicial functions of the High Court. On the point raised by
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan,</inline>
                he says most definitely that
                <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline>
                has a case - it may not be a good case, but, in
                <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Keenan's</inline>
                opinion, he has a case. Honorable senators will remember that
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan,</inline>
                this afternoon, endeavoured to persuade us that there was no case for the court.
                <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Keenan</inline>
                holds the contrary view, and his opinion is, I submit, entitled to respect.

                    <para>- Surely that is begging the question entirely ! It is not a matter of providing loan money for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang;</inline> that money is provided for the States. If the honorable senator is as familiar with the Financial Agreement as he should be, he must know that unless the Commonwealth provided loan money for New South Wales it could not do so in the case of any other State, because each State is entitled to a certain proportion of the amount available. I am speaking of the amounts that the Commonwealth would have to provide either for or on behalf of the S.tate of New South Wales. Had the honorable senator stated those amounts fully and freely, his alarming assertion that if this hill were not passed, the Commonwealth would have to find £11,250,000 each year-to meet <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang's</inline> obligations, would have fallen on deaf ears. </para>

            <para>We are told that one reason for this particular clause is to avoid delay. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene</inline> says that, without the passage of the bill, the Commonwealth could not retain these moneys. Why? At the best, if it retained them in full all that Lang could do would be to proceed against it for their recovery; and there would be as much delay involved in his obtaining a judgment against the Commonwealth as there would be in the Commonwealth obtaining a judgment against him. Any decent-minded man in this community would applaud the action of the Commonwealth in withholding from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> every penny it was supposed to pay to him, so long as he was under any obligation to it, and was defaulting in his payments. Therefore, I say that the honorable senator is attempting to scare the Senate and the public when he says that without this bill the Commonwealth will be compelled to provide, on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang's</inline> behalf, £11,250,000 per annum. </para>

Under this year's Premiers plan the Commonwealth had to provide for the State of New South Wales the sum of £12,000.000. Under next year's plan, it will certainly have to provide a sum that would go a long way towards meeting the £11,250,000 of oversea obligations.

                this afternoon endeavoured to establish an analogy between the case of the Crown recovering taxation from an individual and the Commonwealth recovering a debt from a State. I submit that there is no analogy whatever between the two cases.' The honorable senator also said that it was the duty of the Government to test its power. To me, that suggests that there is a strong element of doubt in the mind of the honorable senator himself, as to what are the powers of the Commonwealth in this connexion ; and I contend that a. very serious risk is being taken if the Commonwealth embarks on this business without knowing exactly what its powers are. The suggestion that because, under section 105a of the Constitution, an agreement made between the parties is to be superior to the Constitution, does not carry us one step further. That surely cannot mean that a law which this Parliament chooses to pass, ostensibly to carry out this agreement, can itself be superior to the Constitution. The honorable senator made no attempt whatever to answer the argument that I advanced that this particular clause is entirely contrary to that portion of the Constitution embraced in sections 71 to 79, dealing with the judicial powers of the Commonwealth and specifically vesting those judicial powers in the High Court. It is not a question of what might happen in the direction of bringing about unification. If the bill should be carried and become law, and then be held to be constitutional, those honorable senators who support it will live to regret the day when the precedent was established of this Parliament - governed, as it always will be, by one party or another - usurping the functions of the High Court and taking unto itself judicial powers. The Acting Attorney-General
                <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLachlan)</inline>
                quoted certain United States of America cases. I asked, by way of interjection, whether he was referring to a case of the federation against a State, and the honorable gentleman's reply was " I think it is a case between two States". Then he read something which conveyed the impression that it was a case of a State against an individual for the recovery of land tax. How can a case of a State against an individual to recover a tax be held to have any bearing whatever on a case between the Commonwealth and a State under the Federal Constitution, in which the rights of both parties are definitely laid down and the judicial power is specifically preserved to the High Court in order to protect alike the interests of the Commonwealth and the States?

                        <para>- I would do anything to persuade the right honorable gentleman. Unless I gave the assurance, I should have no chance of securing the postponement of the bill; therefore, I willingly give it. If the numbers are stacked against us, there is no hope of having our view considered, and we might as well not continue the debate. There is no doubt that this line of cases clearly establishes the reason for the fact that the Government has not been able to produce one opinion of note in support of this legislation. Everybody knows that when it was first proposed, certain opinions were given by eminent members on the Government side, which led to a considerable watering down of the proposal. If the opinion is sound, why did not the Government go on with it? But the Government knows that this particular clause is not sound, and I appeal to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> to tell us the real truth about it. I do not care whether he says it is the opinion of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. X.</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Z.</inline> ; let him quote one opinion in support of the validity of this provision. He cannot. Another place has decided that this bill is to go through, and we must allow it to go through, because we are not able to convince honorable senators opposite. All we can do is to enter our protest. But when the matter goes before the High Court, and this provision is declared <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires,</inline> honorable senators will remember the words of wisdom that have fallen from the lips of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch.</inline></para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator claims to be very solicitous that Ave should not strengthen <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang's</inline> position, hut he has a peculiar way of showing his fear in that regard. This clause will provide means for ascertaining whether the Common- wealth has the power we claim it has, and which it is desirable it should have. I have no doubt on the point from the opinions furnished to the Government, ever since this trouble started. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> claims that I have <inline font-style="italic">.not</inline> produced any authority, and he has produced no single authority to the contrary, because there is no precedent for this. No judgment of the High Court, hitherto given, can be applied to section 105a of the Constitution. If this petty view is to be taken of the finances of Australia, if the financial fabric upon which the sovereignty of Australia rests is to be subordinated and there is to be a denial of every other power, but the judicial power, I can only say that it is a very narrow construction to place on section 105a. Already in this legislation, Ave have bowed our heads to the judicial power in a manner which Ave think is sufficient for all purposes. If or instance, Ave compel the Attorney-General to apply to the court within a limited time. He may apply at once; he probably will; but even if that application were not necessary, I still think that this provision would be well within the power intended to be conferred by section 105a. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> says that because the case in the United States of America, which I cited, was between the State and an individual, the State had nothing whatever to do with it. He could not have heard the observations I read from the judgment, embodying the principle contained in this clause and pointing to those other principles which underlie the whole law in this regard. I do not know why the honorable senator is so perturbed. We have a sacred duty to perform for the people of this country. We are advised by counsel that this is the proper way to exercise our powers under section 105a, and on behalf of the people of all the States we must exercise them whatever obstacles may be put in our path. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> has suggested that we might have withheld some moneys to which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> was entitled. It would be a most immoral thing to do. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> is entitled to moneys obtained on his behalf from the banks and other financial institutions, it is our duty <inline font-style="italic">qua</inline> trustees to pay them to him. To suggest that we should put up a fictitious class of defence and spar with him in the courts of law is to suggest an improper attitude for the </para>

                <para class="block">Commonwealth to take up, and one to  which  I,  at  any rate, would not be a party. By engaging in legal acrobatics  of  that kind and using all the technical means  at  our disposal to  do  so, we should  be  bringing ourselves down to the level of the man who is misleading New South Wales at the present time. If the Crown stands for anything at all  it  stands for integrity and honour, particularly in  the  administration of  Such  an agreement as the one we are now endeavouring to enforce. No legal decision has been given negativing the position which the Commonwealth Government has taken up in regard to section  105a.  I do not make available the legal opinions the Government has obtained, because I do not wish to put a weapon in the hands of the opponents of this legislation, who desire by every means in their power to prevent the Commonwealth from asserting the rights of the States. Whether  it  was right  or  wrong to pay over the  £243,000,  it was done in accordance with a practice which  has  been set up, I understand between the Commonwealth and the States for Ever so long. It may not be strictly within the terms of the agreement. It is provided in the agreement that payments shall be made by an arrangement arrived at, from time to time, between the Commonwealth and the States. While literally the position may be as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> suggests, the facts  are  that  the  Commonwealth passes the money over to the States because the States know their overseas indebtedness  and  where the money has to go. They know the institutions into which it has to pass, and who  are  the bondholders. If the Commonwealth Treasury officers have erred in not giving  the  strictest interpretation to that provision it has been to the advantage of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang.</inline> He received the  £243,000,  and  the  truth is that he " pouched " it. He should have returned it. In the course of business between the Commonwealth Treasury and the State authorities that course has been adopted in respect  of  overseas money because the records are in the hands of the States. Conversion has not yet taken place in regard to those loans. Whatever the Commonwealth  did  the States  Were  parties to it. Personally if I were administering the act, I should not adopt that practice  even  to facilitate business. I view this from a legal stand point, whereas commercial men may study  it from  the view of convenience. </para>

                    <para>. -  I  am  more than ever convinced of the reasonableness of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatchs</inline> proposal. Ever since this measure was introduced in another place amendments have been produced in very large numbers, many of which have been submitted by the Government itself. The manner in which the measure has been amended since it was first drafted shows that it has been ill-considered, and that it would not matter very much if a delay of three or four months occurred to enable its provisions to be thoroughly investigated. The amendments which we have submitted have been with the object of taking the sting out of the measure. It would appear that the Government has been in such mad haste to get it on the statute-book that it has submitted what is an unfinished product for our consideration. Experience shows that measures amended by a government, as this one has been, are practically useless when brought into operation. The Acting Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLachlan)</inline> in endeavouring to defend this clause referred principally to the supremacy of the Commonwealth. All that he said consisted of what I should term legal sob  stuff.  He did not prove anything. It is not a question of the supremacy of the Commonwealth or of the welfare of the States, but of whether  this  is the best way  in which to protect the  interests  of  the Commonwealth. All sorts of side issues have been introduced. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> suggests that if this clause is passed in its present  form  it  will  strengthen the position of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang,</inline> and probably operate in his favour. The clause is  so  unjust that I am not prepared to support it merely if it may incidentally help <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang.</inline> I am heartily  in  accord with the proposal to reject the provision. It is doubtless unconstitutional, and is in itself inherently unjust having regard  to the  way  in  which it deals with the subject it is supposed  to  cover. </para>

To give honorable senators an example of the dangers, I saw an opinion expressed in the Melbourne press by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Quick, in which he referred to Clause 5, although he did not, know anything about clause 6. What is the objection to allowing the parties to the agreement the right to say whether this measure shall be used against any State by the partner entrusted with the enforcement of the agreement? The other States which are interested in a defaulting State meeting its indebtedness should be consulted before action is taken under this clause. </para>

                    GEORGE PEARCE  (Western Australia - Minister for Defence) [12.11 a.m.]. - The Government's reason for opposing this amendment is that the States have already given their consent. That consent, which is embodied in the Constitution, was endorsed by every State Parliament, and by a majority of the people in the States. Under it the Commonwealth Parliament is given the power to carry out this agreement. If the States were again approached, they would tell us to study the Constitution.

                    desires is that the consent of all the States shall be obtained before the Commonwealth proceeds against one State without the  sanction of the High Court. For the Minister to say that the States have already given their consent is the most specious pleading I have over heard. The States have never given their consent. I say, without fear of contradiction, that had this clause been inserted in the Financial Agreement not one State representative tive ve would have signed it. I repeat chat not one State would have signed the agreement' had it contained such provisions. It is ridiculous and misleading to say that the States have given their consent to a procedure that not one of thom ever contemplated.

                    lias said, this bill has been ill-conceived and badly drafted. Already we have dealt with a number of amendments, and within the Inst half-hour notice of ti further amendment by the Leader of the Government
                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline>
                    has been circulated. One section of the Opposition was given a copy of the proposed amendment, but the right honorable gentleman* did not extend the same courtesy to the group with which I am connected. 1 am not greatly concerned about the heated interjections of the Acting Attorney-General
                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLachlan),</inline>
                    for I know that in Australia there are many legal gentlemen whose knowledge of the law is equal to las. The bill may be likened to Joseph's coat of many colours. Honorable senators may remember that Joseph was the favourite son of his father, but that his brothers were jealous of him, aud cast him into a pit.

                        <para>- I can imagine that news of the defeat of the bill would be most pleasing to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang,</inline> while unwelcome to the Government and all in the community who stand for straight behaviour find honorable conduct. The thing that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> likes least is that which we ought to do. And the thing that he likes best is that which we should like least. It is u sad pass to come to, but what can be done ? It is evident that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang's</inline> supporters in this chamber disapprove of the measure, because they sec in it a chance to corner their leader and make him face the music. The purpose of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly's</inline> proposal is to take from the bill whatever merit it possesses. He proposes that the other States shall be consulted. What would happen in the event of one of them disagreeing with the others? Would not nil the machinery created by this bill come to a standstill? If the efforts to defeat this bill succeed, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> will throw his hat in the air. In order to give him no cause for jubilation, we should determine that it will not be defeated. The time has come for a fight to a finish between those who believe in honesty aud those who stand for dishonesty and miserable deception. The sheep and the goats must be separated. Are we to allow <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> metaphorically to wipo his feet on the Federal Parliament? Yesterday, I quoted the words of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Pollock, who said,. "What is the law?" He realized that the law is surrounded by so many pitfalls that the best lawyer in the land does not know where he stands in relation to it. This measure puts the Federal Parliament in a position of authority, in which it can defend the best elements in this country. Unless we defend those elements, we have no right to be here. Knowing that the law is surrounded by pitfalls, we should be careful when framing our legislation not to take a course which will lead to disaster. So far as I am aware, no British community has ever previously been called upon to face the position which New South Wales will soon have to meet. </para>

                    <para>- I have already shown that the purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the States shall be consulted before the central government takes any action. It is quite conceivable that one State having the same political complexion as another State which has defaulted or otherwise offended, and has become liable to action under this legislation would, if afforded the opportunity to pass judgment, cast its vote in favour of the defaulting State.

                    COLEBATCH (Western Australia) [1.23 a.m.].- A good deal has been said in this debate about authorities; or the absence of authorities in favour of this very extraordinary clause. In support of the amendment and to show how extraordinary the clause is, I purpose quoting from an authority who, I believe; will be accepted by every honorable senator, as foremost among constitutional authorities in Australia. Certainly from my own point of view, as far 'as I can judge, from a literary stand-point he is by far the most attractive. If honorable senators will turn to page 308 of

                    <para> The Constitution, which has committed legislative and executive" powers to their appropriate organs, vests " the judicial power of  the Commonwealth" in courts (section 71). It thus becomes necessary to determine what is meant  by  this expression, since the separation of powers  in  the Constitution imports that whatever is included in the grunt, may not be exercised except  by  the courts as constituted under the Constitution. </para>

But, though there may bc others than those mentioned above (disputed elections and. qualifications of members; the grant and withholding of licences; the jurisdiction of courts martini),  it  may bo accepted as a general rule that the separation of powers in the. Constitution imports within the range of Commonwealth action that the legality  of  any governmental action, or the existence of any right, or the liability to any penalty, cannot he determined elsewhere than in the courts. </para>

                    <para>The rule which assigns the judicial power of the Commonwealth  to  courts is thus a safeguard against arbitrary -power more important than at first appears, and importing restrictions upon the power  of  Parliament  more  extensive than is  at first  realized. It is not merely that the legislature may not constitute itself or any other body unauthorized  by  the Constitution, a court of justice with functions which might be validly performed  by  a court regularly constituted, i.e., the determination, after hearing, of rights according to law. If this were all that is imported  by  the separation of powers,  it  would bc of small importance legally, for a power  of  this nature is very rarely usurped  by  a legislature. The temptation to which legislatures arc liable,  to  which American legislatures have succumbed, and which American courts have met  ky  the allegation ' of an invasion of judicial power, is to apply a new rule to past acts or events, or to deal with a specific matter of injury or wrong independently - of all rule. However mischievous or dangerous may be <inline font-style="italic">ex post facto</inline> laws and <inline font-style="italic">privilegia,</inline> their very mischief lies in the fact that they ure something other than judicial acts; that what should have been done  in  a judicial way and according to law, has been done  by  the assumption of arbitrary power. The grant of judicial power to a special organ means that if the matter be one which from its nature is proper for judicial determination alone, the legislature cannot deal with  it  otherwise, or authorize any one, even a court  properly  constituted  to  deal with  it  except in the way of adjudication. </para>

                    <para>. - The purpose of the bill, if it has any, is to outline certain action that has to be taken in the event of default by a State. When that action has been taken, the High Court can be called upon to determine whether it is legal or otherwise. The alternative proposed by the cheap advisers of the Government is that the bill should not be passed, but that the ordinary processes of law should be resorted to instead. As has been pointed out many times, the adoption of that course would involve delay, and we may have a Warren Hastings case over again - seven years to wait. The culprit in this case wants either delay or doom. If he can secure delay, he will postpone his doom. We cannot afford to delay, and for that reason I support the bill. Meanwhile we ave abreast of the difficulty that this act will be challenged in the law courts. Senators Colebatch and Daly again and again have put the question: "What has happened in cases where a sovereign State has had a judgment recorded against it?" As I have already reminded them, there never was such a case in the British Empire. But there are cases on record in a sister federation, whose Constitution formed the basis of our own. I refer to the United States of America. I propose to show what occurred when a sovereign State was made a litigant in a court of justice, and writs of execution were issued against it. Last night I mentioned the case of the State of Pennsylvania, which had a judgment recorded against it. An officer of the law sought to execute the judgment, and there wa3 a collision between the militia of the State of Pennsylvania and the federal powers; hut rather than have bloodshed, the State paid its bill. Then, in the case of <inline font-style="italic">South Dakota</inline> versus <inline font-style="italic">North Carolina</inline> a crisis developed, and again the offending State paid up. The third case is the historical one of <inline font-style="italic">Virginia</inline> versus <inline font-style="italic">West Virginia.</inline> Those are three cases in which the States either paid up or compromised rather than have bloodshed. But the essential question is, what would happen if a State resisted? There is another case which illustrates what may happen when a writ of mandamus or execution is obtained and the State is prepared to defend itself rather than respond to the order of the court. I quote the following from page 1443 of <inline font-style="italic">Willoughby on the Constitution of the United States: -</inline></para>

                    <para>This, in fact, it has been seen, was the action asked by Virginia at the time of its last appearance before the Supreme Court. The objection to the issuance of such a writ, which immediately presents itself, is that it would command the performance of an act essentially discretionary in character. This objection Professor Powell has sought to meet, in the article to which reference is made at the beginning of this chapter. Ho there points out that, under such an order, the legislature would still be free to exercise its discretion as to what means should be provided for the payment of the judgment, namely, by an issue of bonds, or by a tax; and, if by bonds, what kind of bonds; and, if by a tax, what kind of a tax. </para>
                    <para>It is worth while to indicate that, should a mandamus be issued by the Supreme Court to a State legislature directing that it levy a tax, there would be great difficulty in compelling obedience to it. Should the mandate not bc obeyed, against whom would contempt proceedings be instituted? Would all the members of both Houses of the legislature be held to be in contempt even though a minority in both Houses, or even a majority of one of the Houses, had voted in favour of the required legislation? In other words, would the court feel justified in holding in contempt individual legislators, who had, so far as they were individually able, voted for the action required of the legislature by the court's mandamus ? Or, what would the action of the court bc if the two Houses should refuse to agree upon an identical measure, but each of them should approve measures, adequate for the purpose in view, but not identical - for example, one House approving a measure providing for a bond issue, and the other House a measure providing for the levying of a tax. </para>

                <para class="block">There is a whole host of pitfalls discovered by the American Supreme Court, which beset the pathway of people invading a sovereign State - an action which the court has justly decided they are not entitled to take. Where do we stand in the matter? We propose to take what I consider to be the proper course in collecting the revenue that properly belongs to us. The alternative is to get an order from the court and try to collect, but our efforts would fail if the authority of the court counted for nothing. It is of little use to talk about the respective spheres of the legislature and the judiciary when the vital thing is what can the State of New South Wales do. It can snap its fingers if the federal authorities sends its sheriffs within its borders to collect money under the authority of a court order. The only authority that can have any effect is that given by this bill. I wish to correct what I have said previously. It took the State of Virginia 45, not 25, years before it could get final judgment against a portion of its former territory, West Virginia. Are we to face that possibility? On the strength of the West Virginia judgment New South Wales could snap its fingers at the Commonwealth if any procedure were adopted other than that provided for in this bill. </para>

                    <para>. - We are indebted to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> for strengthening the case against this bill. It can truthfully be said that a great many drawbacks in the working of the Australian Constitution are due to the attempt to blend the British system of Government on to the American system. Our Constitution is by no means a replica of the American. But the point which emerges from what the honorable senator has said is that the servants of a State are responsible only to the State legislature. Any attempt on the part of the Commonwealth to collect funds from a State need not be implemented by State officials. Instructions from the State Government that they are not to carry out orders given by the federal authority  must be obeyed by those State officials. The only alternative for the Commonwealth would be to substitute Commonwealth officials to collect the various revenues of the State, and get access to the documents in the various departments engaged in the collection of revenue in the State. Just imagine what turmoil and chaos would result. The people liable to pay money to the State might refuse to pay to the federal authority, or if they paid to the federal authority, might be frightened of subsequent prosecution by the State for not having fulfilled their responsibility under the State law. Fearing that possibility, many might decline to pay either the Commonwealth or the State, and would thus lay themselves open to prosecution by either authority or both. There is, however, a better alternative to that chaotic possibility. Let the Commonwealth approach the State peacefully, asking, "Why cannot we reason out this matter quietly? How do you propose to ' meet these liabilities and adjust your revenue and expenditure?" No evidence has been brought forward to show that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> would offer any obstacle to such a peaceful understanding. But this Government is evidently determined to make political capital out of the fact that New South Wales has persistently maintained certain social services and standards of living. During the elections, and since then, every member of this Government has openly declared that such things as the basic wage, payment of widows' pensions and child endowment must be broken down. Ministers are out to kill Langism, with which they couple such things as wages and pensions. I think it is time they dropped that attitude and realized that they have no right to dictate how a State shall meet its obligations. When the Premiers met and agreed to reduce their adjustable expenditure by a certain percentage it was distinctly laid down, I believe at. the instance of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang,</inline> that each State should be free to adopt the method by which it would reach that reduction. It is, therefore, no business of the Commonwealth Government or of any Commonwealth authority to- say to the Government of New South Wales, "You must reduce your basic wage and widows' pensions ". It is the resistance to that attempt which is the foundation of the defence of the Lang Government that some of us are making. We will not accept dictation from any party as to how this reduction shall be effected. If the Commonwealth persists in exercising what it believes to be its dominant power as expressed in this clause, it can only do so at the expense of creating turmoil and financial chaos, and, possibly, in the last extreme, civil war. The object of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly's</inline> amendment is to give the States the right to express an opinion concerning the action of the Commonwealth Government towards a defaulting State. It has been pointed out in this connexion that if one State dissented from the action proposed it would invalidate the proceedings. It is evident from the information which has been brought out during this discussion in committee that certain States would not favour drastic encroachment upon State rights in order to secure the payment of money alleged to be due by one State. Much can be said in favour of the proposal submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly,</inline> but if it is rejected, a good case has been made out in support of the rejection of the clause, and allowing the proper legal course to be followed. This, it is said, may lead to interminable delay, but no evidence has been adduced in support of that contention. If we follow the course which the Government proposes, obstructions will be raised by the State Government concerned. The Commonwealth Government's proposal will doubtless lead to endless litigation which could all be avoided by a friendly conference between the parties. One can easily imagine the delays which are likely to result from following a course based on a measure so ill conceived and so hastily drawn up as' is this bill. That the Government is not yet satisfied with the bill can be seen from the numerous amendments moved since it first reached the committee stage in another place, quite apart from those circulated here. While this may appear immaterial to some honorable senators, it is the details of a bill which determine whether it is or is not, workable. If the amendment is rejected, I trust that the clause will be negatived'.  &gt; </para>

If it means what I think it does, then it is particularly objectionable, because it appears to provide that the Commonwealth may keep on nibbling at the revenues of the States. If there is not enough revenue in one direction, the Commonwealth can get it elsewhere. The amendment appears to have been drafted with the object of harassing the States. Why not provide that the Commonwealth may take the whole of the revenue of a State which does not meet its liabilities? </para>

                    <para>. - I am grateful to the Opposition Whip <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Hoare)</inline> for having brought this amendment under the notice of the group with which I am associated. Far be it from me to accuse the Leader of the Government <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> of discourtesy; but the fact remains that he did not supply this group with a copy of his amendment. I submit that every honorable senator is entitled to receive in advance a copy of every amendment proposed by the Government. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> that it would be as well for the Commonwealth to take from the revenue of a State all that it needs to meet the debt of that State, rather than take it piecemeal. It may be that the time-payment system so popular in business circles has been embodied in this amendment. Even the State Commissioner of Taxation in New South Wales, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McMahon,</inline> has expressed his willingness to meet taxpayers who have not the ready cash to pay their taxes in a lump sum. It may be that the amendment was hastily drafted, but surely there are sufficient typewriters in the building, and persons to operate them, to enable copies of it to be supplied to every honorable senator. The Government is out to destroy <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> and New South Wales. I challenge it to get on with the job. It would take more than the 500,000 persons who are unemployed in Australia to-day to follow the tram conductors along the footboards of the trams and the collectors of revenue in the several departments of the States in order to obtain from them sufficient revenue to satisfy the debts of the State. I support the further amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae.</inline></para>

                    <para>. - The Leader of the Government <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> may claim that his proposed amendment would prevent more revenue from being taken from the State than is required to meet its debt, but it would not have that effect. The Commonwealth Government, in confiscating the revenue of a State to meet its debts, need not tap every source of revenue at once. Revenue could be taken from one source this week, and from a different source next week, and so on. Rather than prolong the agony, as would be the case under the amendment of the Leader of the Government, I have moved my further amendment to enable prompt action to be taken. </para>

                    <para>.~ Will the Leader of the Government <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> take honorable senators into his confidence and tell them who is the author of this last-minute amendment, which can best be described as a scientific garnishee order? It is scientific in that it proposes to take a little at a time of the various revenues of the State. I have not had a legal training, but I have some knowledge of human nature, and I think that I understand the intention of the Government. So long as I am able, I shall fight for justice for the States, whether it be New South Wales, Tasmania, Western Australia, or any other State. I challenge the Leader of the Senate to state who is the author of this amendment. </para>

                    <para>. - We are now approaching the consideration of the most extraordinary provisions in the  bill,  and I  invite  honorable senators to pay particular attention to them. The clause under discussion is futile. Take the case of an hotelkeeper whose  license  falls due on the 31st March, or a taxpayer liable to pay income tax. Is  it  contended that this provision can affect any condition precedent to the granting of an hotel licence or the preservation of the taxpayer's right of appeal? The licensing laws of New South Wales demand as a condition precedent to the granting of a licence, that the applicant shall pay the prescribed fee. Similarly, if an income taxpayer wishes to appeal against his assessment, he is first required to pay. I am taking objection now, because clauses 9 to  12  are even more obnoxious and should also be eliminated. This clause is, to a certain extent meaningless, but  it  is the preamble to more obnoxious provisions which follow. It is sheer hypocrisy to pretend that no action can lie against taxpayers who comply with this clause, because  it  does not relieve them or confer any rights upon them. If an hotelkeeper  did  not lodge the prescribed fee, on the due date,  or  the day following he could be prosecuted for sly grog-selling. There should be an indemnity clause in the bill to protect these people, and at the right stage I shall move for the insertion of such a provision. </para>

                    bases his argument on the assumption that this bill will be declared unconstitutional. It would be as well if he remembered that, when it is assented to, it will be the law of the Commonwealth. If a citizen of New South Wales complies with it,  he  cannot be damnified by the Government of that State or anybody else. If it proves to be a good law, and we say it is, it must over-ride a State law, whether relating to the payment of licensing fees or income tax. Any payment made under this law will relieve the taxpayer from any penalties under a State law, because the Commonwealth enactment will be the superior law.

What I . attempted to point out, and what, in answering, he avoided, was, that there is no conflict between this legislation and the State law requiring certain fees, as a condition precedent to the granting of a licence or the right of appeal against taxation assessment. </para>

                    <para>- The Government might take this important point into consideration, even assuming that this legislation will be declared to be constitutional. If the Commonwealth, under this law, has power to seize money in the hands of a taxpayer, it would make it much easier to administer, and enable the accounts of the Commonwealth and the State concerned to be kept in much better order, if the Government could see  its way clear to accept an amendment to make the State collectors of revenue responsible for payments to the federal authority. If the Commonwealth can exercise authority over the citizens of a State, surely it can exercise authority over its officials also. Nothing is more likely to offend the people of any State against whom this legislation may be directed than the uncertainty about their payments. A proclamation might be issued quickly, and immediately a large number of taxpayers liable to pay taxation to the State would, in the absence of any indemnity provision, be uncertain as to their position. The Government should endeavour to collect what revenue may be demanded under this legislation in a way that will give least offence to the people. Men who pay land rents to the Crown should not be made bailiffs for the Commonwealth, because that class of taxpayer sends his cheque to the State department. That may be one of the specified revenues. </para>

                        <para>- How is the payment to the Commonwealth to be entered up in detail in the books of the State? How are Commonwealth officers to give receipts that will ensure to settlers the freehold of their property when their payments are completed? How are they to protect the numerous pastoral leases upon which payments may be made? How is the State to be protected in regard to payments of which it may not have detailed information ? I have had to collect many revenues for different departments of State, and even when I have had all the books in my possession have experienced the greatest difficulty in ascertaining the items to which the payments should be allocated. Many persons do not send their accounts with their payments. If the money goes to a Commonwealth collector instead of to the respective State departments, I am sure that, from a bookkeeping point of view, very great confusion will be caused. </para>

                </continue>
                <para>That, however, is not my principal objection. The State collecting officers are few in comparison with the huge number of taxpayers. If the Commonwealth has this power, it could be directed against the ordinary receiver of revenue for the State, who is accustomed to receiving these moneys and entering up the payments as they are received. He could forward the aggregate amount to the Commonwealth. The taxpayer is very much oppressed in every direction. He has sufficient difficulty in finding the money to pay his taxes. He wants to be sure that it is properly credited, and that he will not be subjected to the risk of having to pay twice. If my suggestion were adopted, the Government would make this legislation very much more effective, particularly as many State officers are already sworn to the service of the Commonwealth. </para>
                <para>I hope that the Government will consider my proposal. I am sure that it would make for better and cheaper administration, relieve the taxpayer of many harassing conditions, and render far less likely the raising of any question as to the amounts paid being properly credited in the books of the State. </para>

                    quoted a case in the United States of America, in which, apparently, the Supreme Court held that even in a successful suit against a State the officials of the State could not be compelled to take action against it. I am not prepared to say whether that law would hold good here. I understand that the legal position has been inquired into ; but if it is not clear it could be further investigated. I remind the honorable senator that all over New South Wales there are Commonwealth officials, such as postmasters and others. This, we hope, is only a temporary arrangement, and that it will not last long. The intention is merely to keep a record of the payments that are made, and to hold the money in trust until the matter is adjusted, when the records of payments may well go to the State, where they can bc placed in their proper order in the different departments. For the time being, this matter will have to be carried on by officers who are directly authorized by the Commonwealth.

                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLachlan)</inline>
                    to give serious thought to the propositions that I am about to put up. In the first place, he will notice that the words employed are " the burden of proving any allegation." We know that that has been judicially interpreted to mean " proving beyond all reasonable doubt." Let us assume that a taxpayer is called upon to establish the proposition that he has not broken the law by making a payment to the State after a certain date. If he calls a State Treasury official to give evidence on his behalf, what will happen? If the Acting Attorney-General had the task of advising that official his advice would be, " Simply reply that any answer you might make might tend to incriminate you." The mere production of a receipt by the defendant would not of itself be sufficient proof that he had made the payment to the Commonwealth. I might send a cheque by post and receive a receipt, but unless I knew the signature of the person signing the receipt it would not be prima facie evidence. The only way in which I could prove that the payment was made before a certain date would be to call on the man who receiver the money to give evidence on my behalf, or, at least, prove the signature. In view of clause 12, the official might refuse to answer questions on the ground that it might tend to incriminate him. The taxpayer should not have this burden placed on him.

                    PEARCE (Western Australia - Minister for Defence) [3.7  a.m.].  - During the currency of a proclamation, the taxpayers must pay to the Commonwealth. If a taxpayer says that be has already paid his taxation to the State, he has committed an offence only if the payment has been made after the issue of a proclamation. The burden of proving that he has not done so rests on him.

                    COLEBATCH (Western Australia) [3.9  a.m.].  - The clause, unfortunately, is too clear. If the proclamation is issued on the 1st April, a most appropriate date, the taxpayer who has paid his State tax on the 2Sth March will be quite free, but if he has not seen or heard of the proclamation, and pays on the 2nd April, he is again obliged to pay to the Commonwealth.

                    <para>. - During the war, many men were living in such remote parts that they had no idea that a world conflict was in progress. I have been in places where I have not seen a newspaper for weeks. We boast that one of the elements of British justice is that a man shall  be  regarded as innocent until his guilt is proved, but bit by bit we are whittling away that principle and placing on the individual the onus of proving his innocence. This law is worthy of the Kaiser ; it is Prussianism in the extreme. Those who talk about democratic British freedom should be the last to tolerate this kind of legislation. The onus of proof is placed upon innocent citizens, many of whom are totally unacquainted with such proceedings, and they will be harassed, and to some extent, robbed, in having to meet the expenses of proving their innocence. This clause is another striking instance of the infamy of the whole business. There are thousands of citizens who will know nothing about the penalties prescribed under this measure. The average taxpayer does not walk about with acts of Parliament, for which he has to pay, in his pocket. Even if  he  did, and they were drafted as this one is, it would be impossible for him to understand them. Taxpayers forward their remittances through the usual channels, but now, by this artificial and wholly unjustifiable means, they are to be made criminals. This abomination is being foisted upon the people by a Government with a brutal, ignorant, unthinking and prejudiced majority. </para>

The fact that a proclamation is to be issued will be announced in practically every newspaper in Australia, particularly in those published in New South "Wales, and it will doubtless be broadcast by wireless throughout the Commonwealth. In that way there will be sufficient notification that certain revenues, which formerly were paid to the State, now have to be paid to the Commonwealth. In these circumstances, it is unlikely that any taxpayer will be unaware of the publication of a proclamation. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not agree with the contention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator DuncanHughes</inline> that practically every taxpayer will be aware that a proclamation has been issued. In many isolated parts of the Commonwealth a mail is received only once in every three months, and in such places wireless is not installed. Many settlers who send in their land rents twice a year will follow the course which they have adopted in years past, without waiting for an account from the Crown. It is essential that such persons should be notified by the Government that they are expected to send revenues which previously have been paid to a State department to a specified Commonwealth representative. </para>

Some isolated portions of New South Wales are, owing to the policy of centralization, denied adequate railway, telephonic and mail services. This legislation has Australian-wide incidence.

                <para class="block">The adoption of such an amendment would afford some protection to the taxpayer who would receive a definite notice from the Government before the obligation was placed upon him of sending his taxes to the Federal Government. He would receive an official communication instead of being informed of the issue of a  proclamation by a chance conversation in a bush " pub " or on a street corner. Information passed on in that way is often inaccurate, and may involve the taxpayer in costs, which he should not be expected to meet. The security of a settler's home and adequate provision for his family depend largely upon the liquidation of his liabilities in a proper way. I hope that the Government will accept the amendment for the protection of the taxpayer. . If the Commonwealth is to take these moneys, it should take them from the Receiver of Revenue for the State, rather than from individual taxpayers. </para>

                    GEORGE PEARCE  (Western Australia - Minister for Defence) [3.31 a.m.]. - This matter was raised in another place. When it was pointed out there that a person who had unwittingly paid the State might be prosecuted for an offence, clause 20, which deals with penalties for offences, was amended to provide that the consent of the Treasurer in writing must be obtained to every prosecution. I submit that that is a better way of meeting the situation than that which the honorable senator has suggested.

                    <para>. - I hope that the committee will vote against this clause, which is a further instalment of that to which we objected in a previous clause. It throws the onus on the innocent taxpayer, making him responsible for the indifference and callousness of the Federal Government, which is not prepared to do its own work. In a State the size of New South Wales, carrying a fairly large population, not one or two, but thousands, of citizens will be liable to be penalized for offences which they have unintentionally committed. When so many are liable, some will be caught. Even those who want the substance of the bill should not load it with iniquitous provisions which will do an injustice to thousands of innocent citizens. The clause creates artificial offences, and makes criminals of innocent people. Any one with a spark of democratic feeling in him ought to vote against it. I protest against this legislation, and hope that honorable senators opposite will not blindly follow their leader, but will do something to save this Parliament from the infamy which will cover it if this legislation is passed in its present form. </para>

                    <para>. - Almost a miracle is being effected by this amendment, which makes the clause even more wicked than it was in its original form. I thought it was impossible to conceive of anything worse. Payment of money  to  any but a federal authority is prohibited, and the onus is cast on the individual. The amendment shows that even the lowest depths of iniquity can be reached in a fiendish desire to penalize every person who can be brought within the  scope of  this measure. The clause is iniquitous from beginning to end. In what way can the interests of the Commonwealth be served by such a provision, and in what way can the revenue to be derived from the operation of this legislation be increased by such a wicked proposal which seeks, by every possible means, to bring more and more people into the octopus-like clutches of the Commonwealth authority? The designed cruelty and callousness, of this clause is remarkable, but, apparently, there is even worse  to follow. I enter my emphatic protest against the clause, and hope it will be rejected. </para>

            <para>SenatorRAE (New South Wales) [4.7 a.m.]. - This clause is a long and a very important one, but it is totally unnecessary, even to those who want the original bill. After providing all sorts of ways in which individual taxpayers can be compelled to pay their money into federal hands, it goes a step further and tries to rub the dirt in more than ever by stipulating that, in addition, any other funds that come into the possession of the Commonwealth authorities shall be impounded and used practically as they think fit. It is almost incredible that such confiscatory legislation should be introduced into this Parliament. It is provided that the State shall not be in any way indemnified for the expenditure of money for which, in the judgment of the court, it is not liable. The whole measure is an incredible swindle on the State. It may have money paid to it for specific purposes; yet the Commonwealth is empowered to impound it. I hope that honorable senators will recognize that this is wholly inexcusable and will vote against the clause. </para>

                    <para>. - If I did not know that Ned Kelly was dead, I should be inclined to think that he had been consulted in the drafting of this clause. Does it mean that whatever moneys are due to the largest and most populous State in the Commonwealth are to be impounded? During the years 1929 and 1930, taxation and other revenues to the amount of £25,000,000 were paid on behalf of New South Wales into the Commonwealth Treasury. If my interpretation of the clause is correct, I suggest to the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> and his Cabinet colleagues that at the first appropriate opportunity they place a wreath on the grave of Ned Kelly. New South Wales is the foundation State of Australia. It has two-fifths of the total population, and contributes the huge amount I have mentioned to the revenues of the Commonwealth; yet, because there is a difference of opinion between its Premier, and the Prime Minister of Australia and his Government, any moneys due to it of which the Commonwealth has control are to be withheld, including its proportion of the loan moneys that may be allocated from time to time to the different States. We must vote solidly against such a provision. </para>

                <para>SenatorRAE (New South Wales) [4.25 a.m.]. - The marginal note to this clause should be "authority to rob banks ". The confiscation, which might extend to trust accounts, is likely to lead to very serious results, but of course reason is wasted on unreasonable persons, and, like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn,</inline> I feel inclined to content myself by recording my protest against this clause. But I regard it as my duty to do everything possible to expose the iniquities of this measure. The party opposite, which has always talked about the inadvisability of nationalizing banking, has now discovered what I regard as a good move. It does not matter who owns a bank so long as one can seize the funds in it. That is just what this clause authorizes. I should imagine that the various sources of revenue which the Commonwealth will have power to impound should provide ample means to meet any claims that may possibly fall due without the necessity for seizing money held by banks. I realize that it is no longer possible to seize money held by the banks for private persons. A proposal to permit that to be done was in the original bill, but was deleted in another place. Some of the worst corners of the Government's proposal were wiped off in another place, but still it is bad enough, framed as it is to meet the exactions, of a gang of pirates. </para>

                <para class="block">Although this amendment is somewhat lengthy, it is really a drafting amendment. It is proposed that the words which are being omitted from sub-clause 1, be inserted as sub-clause 3. The object is to give the Governor-General power to revoke a proclamation when he thinks fit. even if the Auditor-General has not certified that the liabilities of a State have been discharged. Cases may arise where a State may make arrangements with the Commonwealth, and it is to meet such cases that the Governor-General is given power, if he thinks fit, to revoke the proclamation. </para>

                    <para>. - I am not opposing this amendment, but I draw attention to the fact that the Government, in its effort to improve this measure, has again shown the crude manner in which it was originally drafted. It has been a hasty job, done for the specific purpose of penalizing one State. The bill is full of anomalies and contradictions, and even at this stage the Minister is fishing out further amendments to insert here, there and everywhere. It is evident that the bitter protest which has been made concerning this measure has been fully justified, and that the embellishments of the Government will, in the end, make it unworkable. </para>

                    <para>. - I support the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly.</inline> It is unthinkable that we should legislate to make a State whose revenue has been taken from it, pay the costs incurred by the robber in collecting that revenue. The further amendments which have been moved by the Leader of the Government show clearly that the bill has been ill-conceived and badly drafted. I hope that honorable senators will see the injustice they are asked to perpetrate, and will vote for the amendment. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline> was not sufficiently severe in his denunciation of this iniquitous provision. This paragraph out-Herods Herod. One can hardly imagine such a provision being incorporated in any measure placed before this Parliament. It is almost unbelievable that such dishonesty could be contemplated by an Australian Government. Even a person with the most elementary sense of justice must realize that a government which wrongfully takes the revenues of another government, has no right to reimburse itself for the expenditure incurred in confiscating property to which it is not entitled. Either the Government is not in its right mind, or it has no sense of honesty. I cannot understand how honorable senators who talk of the evils of party government can follow a ministry which would drag Parliament down to such depths of degradation. </para>

Since the Government proposes to sabotage every taxpayer in New South Wales, it might be persuaded to go further and accept my amendment, which is in keeping with its policy. State officers, if they disobey State laws, are to be branded as criminals. There must be something " rotten in the State of Denmark " when legislation of this nature can be passed through this Parliament, merely to coerce the Premier of New South Wales to do something which is contrary to his declared policy.

It is not fair to ask the individual taxpayer to shoulder the whole of the responsibility when the Commonwealth forbids him to pay moneys to the State. If, as a result, he suffers loss, the Commonwealth should indemnify him. This is another appeal to the Government by those who sit en this side, to preserve the rights of the unfortunate taxpayer, who is probably the least blameworthy of any of the parties connected with the unfortunate drama which has led to the introduction of this legislation. </para>

                    PEARCE (Western Australia - Minister for Defence) [5.17 a.m.]. - I regret that the Government cannot accept the amendment. We have given it considerable consideration. If such an amendment were accepted it would practically offer an inducement to the Premier of New South Wales immediately to double, treble, or quadruple, all the penalty sections of his taxation and other measures. It would be a case of " Heads I win, tails you lose " against the Commonwealth Government. Assuming that action ' was taken to invalidate this bill when it became an act, and the suit failed, the penalties imposed by the State could not be recovered, and the taxpayers would not suffer. If, on the other hand, the sections of the act under which these penalties might have been imposed were invalidated,
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline>
                    would then be able to recover those trebled and quadrupled penalties from the Commonwealth. In view of the attitude that this gentleman is taking up, one can see what a splendid inducement it would be for him, first of all to test the validity of the act, and, secondly, to build up the penalty sections in all his acts. Are we to assume that the Government of the State is going to mulct the taxpayer who, to the best of his belief, complied with the law at the time? There is no doubt that, until this law is invalidated, it takes the place of the State law. Therefore, the taxpayer who. pays to the Commonwealth while it is in existence, merely obeys the law of the land. Yet we are asked to assume that the Government of the State, which in other respects we are told is the best guardian of its citizens, its taxpayers, and its interests, will suddenly become the tyrant and the villain of the piece, and insist on its pound of flesh with respect to all penalties, despite the fact that those penalties were imposed, not because of any malfeasance on the part of the citizens of the State, but because they obeyed the higher law of the Commonwealth which was in existence at the time. It is not paying a very high compliment to the Government of the State to assume that it will act in that way. 1

                        <para>- I suggest that the damage against which they were to be indemnified would be damage done to them by the deliberate act of the State. Yet we are asked to believe that this measure constitutes an invasion of the rights of the State ! It is rather peculiar to say in one breath that the State will adopt that attitude towards its own people, and in the next breath to speak of it as the defender of the rights of its people. I do not think that any State Government would act in such an extraordinary fashion towards its own citizens whose only offence was that they had obeyed the law of the land for the time being. </para>

                    <para>- The arguments of the Leader of the Government might have some validity were it not for the fact that the Government has deliberately included in this measure clause 12, which makes it a criminal offence for any person to give or to offer any indemnity. These wonderful Christian legislators practise the refinement of cruelty when they refuse to allow the State to indemnify any of its own citizens, and at the same time themselves decline to give that indemnification. That establishes beyond the shadow of a doubt, beyond the possibility of refutation, the fact that this is a vindictive attempt to penalize the individual citizens of New South Wales, and not merely J. T. Lang. </para>
