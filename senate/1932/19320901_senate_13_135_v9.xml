                <para class="block">In another place this afternoon the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> is presenting the budget. In the ordinary course of events, the annual Estimates do not reach the Senate until the close of the season, and come to us in the form of an appropriation bill. By that time, the principles contained in the budget have been worn threadbare by constant discussion. Early in the history of this Parliament, it became an established practice that the Leader of the Government in the Senate should lay on the table of the Senate copies of the Estimates and budget papers and move " that the papers be printed " in order that honorable senators might have an opportunity to embark at once upon a discussion of the general principles embodied in those papers. In that way honorable senators are enabled, simultaneously with members of another place, to express their views upon the financial policy of the Government of the day as disclosed in the papers. The bills that arise from the budget come tous, as they come to another place, in separate measures. I make these few remarks for the benefit of newly elected senators. </para>
                <para>While I do not propose to make an exhaustive review of the events of the past two or three years, it is necessary to make some reference to them in order to realize clearly the perilous position in which Australia recently stood and from which sheis now emerging. </para>
                <para>The national income had decreased from £650,000,000 to at most £450,000,000 per annum, largely as a result of the position of our overseas trade and the fall in the prices of our primary products. </para>
                <para>Government deficits, Federal and State, had assumed proportions never before experienced, the actual deficits for 1930-31 amounting to over £27,000,000, and the estimated deficits for 1931-32 to £40,000,000. Overseas loans which had for ten years averaged nearly £22,000,000 per annum ceased completely, and we have been unable to raise loans in the local market at reasonable interest rates. </para>
                <para>The turning point in national affairs was the adoption of the Premiers plan, of which the outstanding points were a reduction of 20 per cent. in all adjustable Government expenditure, including salaries and wages, and a reduction of 22½ per cent. in rates of interest on Government loans. </para>
                <para>To add to the difficulties of the position, the late Government of New South Wales did not take the necessary measures to comply with the Premiers plan, with the consequence that all governments were embarrassed in their efforts towards reconstruction. Fortunately the action taken by this Government enabled that position to be cleared up. </para>
                <para class="block">EvidencesofRecovery. </para>
                <para>As against the evidences of depression it is heartening to consider the steps which have been taken to retrieve the position and the evidences of recovery which may now be noted. The deficits for 1931-32 which were estimated at £40,000,000, were actually brought down to £20,147,000, of which £13,570,000 represents the deficit of New South Wales. The estimated deficits for 1932- 33 have been reduced to £9,000,000. The £596,000,000 conversion loan has been carried through, providing savings of £6,500,000 per annum in the interest bill. </para>
                <para>Bank and private interest rates have been materially reduced and this process is continuing. Reductions in expenditure and increased taxation have assisted in the advance towards balanced budgets. Cost of production has been reduced and the cost of living index figure reduced from 1866 in 1929 to 1477 in 1931. The adverse trade balance - merchandise only -of £33,000,000 sterling in 1929-30 has been converted into a favorable balance of £31,000,000 in 1931-32. </para>
                <para>As further evidence of recovery the rise in the price of our stocks, both in Australia and overseas, is distinctly encouraging. </para>
                <para>Commonwealth 5 per cent. securities in London and New York fell to £55 15s. and 35 dollars respectively during the latter part of 1931. These stocks are to-day quoted at £110 10s. in London and 71¾ dollars in New York. </para>
                <para>Commonwealth stock on the local market has greatly appreciated, as is evidenced by the following table: - </para>

                <para class="block">A group of sixteen representative companies with paid-up capital of approximately £30,000,000 show an appreciation of over £5,000,000 in the market value of their stock in two mouths. </para>
                <para>The telephone service provides an indication of general business conditions. In July, 1931, there was a decrease of 2,374 telephones in use, but from the date mentioned a consistent recovery has occurred, and in July, 1932, an actual gain of 88 telephones in use was recorded. </para>
                <para>Bank and private interest rates have been reduced. </para>
                <para>Primary production has experienced a heavy increase during the last few years, and the wool clip for last season was 950,000,000 lb., a figure almost equal to the record of 1928-29. </para>
                <para>The gold-mining industry has received considerable encouragement owing to the high price of gold, the mint price at present being £7 6s.11d. per fine ounce. Production promises a still further development in the future. </para>
                <para>An event of considerable importance to Australia was the departure of Britain on 21st September, 1931, from the gold standard. The fall in sterling led to an increase in sterling prices, which helped in a large measure to offset the fall in gold prices of our primary products. The benefit to Australian producers of this movement is obvious. </para>

                <para>After Britain went off the gold standard in September last, the London balances of our trading banks and of the Commonwealth Bank began to accumulate rapidly, causing apprehension of a fall in the exchange rate with serious loss to the banks. Ultimately the Commonwealth Bank made an agreement with the trading banks to purchase surplus London funds and accepted the responsibility of fixing the exchange rate from time to time. This arrangement is still in operation. </para>
                <para>The power of the Commonwealth Bank to fix the exchange rate is not fettered in any way by legislation ; but the bank is, of course, influenced in this matter by those trade conditions which determine the amount of funds which are available. </para>
                <para>The Government strongly adheres to the declaration of its policy with regard to exchange made after the Premiers Conference in April last, and will not interfere with the Commonwealth Bank in its control of the exchange rate. The Government has been, and is still, prepared at all times to assist the bank to control the rate in the best interests of all sections of the people. </para>

                <para>The question of unemployment has been the most important subject discussed at the Premiers Conferences which have taken place since the Government assumed office. As a result, a special winter relief loan of £3,600,000 was arranged, of which the Commonwealth is finding £1,800,000. In addition, a plan is being evolved designed to employ taxation, which is at present used in the relief of unemployment, towards creating employment on useful and reproductive works. It is hoped to finalize this plan when the next Premiers Conference meets. </para>

                <para>The Government has inaugurated an extensive revision of the tariff, based on the recommendations of the Tariff Board. The prohibition of importation of specified items has already been repealed in 54 out of 78 items. Action "is now being taken for the total removal of the prohibitions. The special duty of 50 per cent, has already been removed from 22 out of the 58 items affected. Action is now being taken to remove the duties from a further seventeen items. It is considered that it will not be long before the whole of these restrictions on trade have been removed. Reference will be made later to proposals for decreased duties in respect of a number of classes of goods. Further revision of the tariff will be undertaken later. </para>

                <para>The public debt of the Commonwealth has increased by £2,568,000 during the past year. This is due to the issue of treasury-bills to cover wheat bounty, and the increased liability due on government loans as a result of the conversion, these items being offset to a certain extent by the redemption of treasury-bills issued for other purposes. An adjustment has also been made by the Commonwealth taking over £7,597,783 of States' debts in pursuance of relief granted in 1925 and 1930 on account -of losses in connexion with soldier settlement. The amount made available for the reduction of Commonwealth debt during the year was £3,373,000. </para>

                <para>The estimate of cugtoms and excise revenue has been reduced in view of the results of the Ottawa Conference and of tariff reductions. A tariff schedule will be introduced making provision for decreased duties in respect of matches, cotton tweeds, knitted piece goods, wool piece goods, certain types of apparel, towels, galvanized iron, pipe fittings, dairy coolers, pasteurizers, &amp;c.,certain classes of machinery, static transformers, fire bricks, sheet glass, cutlery cases, and the removal of deferred duties on pipes and tubes, and vessels of over 1,000 tons. It has also been decided to exempt a number of articles from the operations of the sales tax and from primage; this will result in a reduction of the receipts from those sources. The exemptions are chiefly in connexion with agricultural, pastoral, dairying and mining requirements. No new taxation is proposed. </para>

In addition to the reduction of rates, steps are being taken to deal with cases of fraud, and it isalso proposed to effect an amendment in the pensions law to provide that the amount of pension paid shall be a first charge against the pensioner's estate at death. It is also proposed that the pensions shall be a charge against property should the pensioner at any time become possessed of property which cancels the right to receive a pension. </para>

                    <para>The Government is very loth at any time to ask either House of the Parliament to disapprove a determination of the Public Service Arbitrator. There are, however, special considerations in regard to this particular determination, as honorable senators will see as I proceed. The Public Service Arbitrator himself draws attention to the fact that he has made his determination because Parliament has not expressed its particular will on this subject. </para>
                    <para>These determinations  relate to the salaries of adult officers occupying positions of messenger, normally filled by minors. The Public Service Board reported to the Government that some hundreds of officers who had been appointed as boy messengers had reached 21 years, and that no positions suitable for adult employment were available for their absorption. The .board pointed out that the number was rapidly increasing, and that during the next five years about 2,900 lads would reach adult age, of whom probably only 1,500 could be absorbed in adult positions. </para>
                    <para>Under the then existing conditions they had necessarily to be paid as adults at a rate of £1S2 per annum while 'the salary of a boy messenger, on appointment, was £74 per annum. </para>
                    <para>The retention of these adults in positions which ordinarily would be filled by boys would involve an approximate expenditure during five years of £750,000, and of £1,100,000 before the situation became normal. </para>
                    <para>The board suggested consideration of three courses - </para>

                    <quote>
                        <para>As recently as July, 1931, the Commonwealth Parliament in the Financial Emergency Act 1931, specifically re-affirmed this principle by providing that no adult male should be reduced below the basic wage. This decision is so recent and so definite in its pronouncement that, in my opinion, action contravening that expressed intention should not bc taken without the specific assent of Parliament. On this main ground I have decided to approve of the application before me with retrospective effect from the 17th March, 1932. This will have the effect of restoring to full operation the principle of the payment of the service basic wage to adult males. Parliament, if it thinks fit to depart from this principle, will disallow my determination. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>In effect, the reason for the arbitrator's determination is that Parliament has not expressed assent to departure, in the cases in question, from the  principle  that no adult male should be reduced below the basic wage. But Parliament has already seen fit to depart from this principle. The regulation which the arbitrator's determination seeks to annul prescribed a reduction in the cases of certain adult males below the basic wage. That regulation (Statutory Rules 1932/27) was laid before Parliament as prescribed, and was not disapproved. Non-disapproval by Parliament of a regulation is an endorsement by the Parliament of the terms and conditions of that regulation. It cannot be contended that Parliament was not thoroughly aware of the position as the regulation was the subject of discussion  on the 16th and 17th March, 1932, <inline font-style="italic">vide Hansard,</inline> No. 7. </para>
                    <para>Since the arbitrator made his determinations, the situation has been again carefully reviewed, and with every allowance for wastage in the Service and all other conditions for absorption of these officers in adult positions, there will still be a large number necessarily retained' in junior positions. It is estimated that, despite absorption wherever practicable, there will, at the end of five years, be at least 1,300 not provided for. </para>
                    <para>It will bo recognized that this position is most unsatisfactory, and it is now necessary to consider - 1.Whether the arbitrator's determination is to be permitted to operate and the officers be retained with payment at the adult wage to young unmarried men for performing the work of boys. </para>
                    <para>As previously mentioned, this will call for additional expenditure of from £185,000 to £200,000 over the next five years. </para>

                        <item label="2.">
                            <para>Whether the arbitrator's determination is to operate, but consequent; thereon action be taken to dismiss all adults for whom boys' work only is available. </para>
                        </item>
                    </list>
                    <para>Financially, this would be the preferable course. During the next five years £500,000 would be saved, but with great hardship, not only on the officers themselves, but on their families. To add to the number of adults unemployed is also undesirable at the present juncture, even though it would mean that a like number of boys would find employment. </para>
                    <list type="decimal-dotted">
                        <item label="3.">
                            <para>Whether the determinations should be disallowed, permitting the officers to remain in the Service but with salary at the rate for age 20. </para>
                        </item>
                    </list>
                    <para>In all the circumstances the last course is regarded as the most desirable for adoption. </para>
                    <para>The payment of an adult' basic wage fundamentally presupposes performance of adult work of some kind. But here there is no such factor. From causes beyond control, the Service is foundwith more adults than can be placed in appropriate positions. The question for decision is whether, in the peculiar circumstances, the community should be asked to pay a very large sum for the retention of overpaid officers or whether such officers should accept something less than adult rates, or be discharged. </para>
                    <para>The wages that would be payable, that is, based on 20-year age rate, are sufficient to keep the officers concerned. In these days suitable board and lodging for these young single men should be obtained from 25s. to 30s. per week. A telegraph messenger in receipt of salary of £136 and paying 30s. per week for board and lodging would have £58 per annum for other purposes - a considerably higher margin over living  costs  than is enjoyed by many in the community in these times. </para>
                    <para>There seems, therefore, on the broad grounds of what is best for the community as a whole full justification in the circumstances facing the Government for action in the direction of disallowing the determinations. </para>
                    <para>It is proposed, therefore, to move for the disallowance of the two determinations concerned- Nos. 6 and 13 of 1932. If the  determ  inations were to be continued, the only alternative to the Government would be to discharge the men affected and replace them by boys, because they are doing work which in most cases is boys' work. </para>

                        <para>. - I am somewhat astounded that a motion should  be  moved to disapprove of the determination  of  a tribunal constituted  by  the Government  to  deal with a very important public function, and which  sofar  has carried out its duties in a thoroughly constitutional  way.  The effect  of  the determination  of  the Public Service Arbitrator has been  to  restore  to  certain members  of  the Public Service who have reached the age of 21 years the basic wage which had been refused  to  them on the ground that the Government could not provide them with work entitling them  to  the payment  of  such a wage. In all conscience the basic wage is little enough. If the Government sets the example  of  paying  to its  employees less than the basic  wage,  it is an invitation  to  all employers in the country  to do  likewise with the possibility that  we  shall have half the population living on less than the basic wage. </para>

The Government will do no good by reducing the wages of people in its employment and forcing them to depend largely on the rest of the people. An element in the community which I regard as the worst, believes that the lower the rates of pay, the more prosperous the country will become. I trust that such is not the policy of the present Government. If it is, the sooner the people have an opportunity to express their disapproval the better. The Public Service Arbitrator took considerable pains to investigate the case submitted to him ' by the employees before he made his determination. I cannot understand why the axe should be laid on the neck of one of the most capable men in the service of the Commonwealth. The basic wage, as it stands to-day, gives people nothing more than the opportunity to drag, out a miserable existence, and I trust that the Government will give this matter serious consideration before adult officers are deprived of the basic wage. In any case, I am satisfied that there will be a storm of discontent.

                    <para>.- I listened with much interest to the speech delivered yesterday by the right honorable the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Sir George Pearce)</inline> concerning the decisions of the recent conference at Lausanne to deal with war reparations. It is claimed that the conference resolutions will mean much to the people of not only Australia, .but also other countries who are suffering from the burden of war debts and reparations. The British delegation, I understand, was anxious that the decisions should be pushed much further than was possible under the Clr- cumstances,  and I believe it is generally agreed by all who have given thought to the subject that the. world would be in a much better position if all war debts and reparations were abolished. For this reason, I am hopeful that another conference in the not distant future will pave the way to. the cancellation of these burdens. There is, I believe, a considerable body of public opinion in all countries in favour of this course. The cancellation of war debts would benefit Australia as much as any other country because it would remove the disabilities under which practically all nations are suffering, and give a much needed stimulus to trade. Everyone now is convinced that it will be impossible for the people of the world to carry the existing burden very much longer; that if the various countries are to get out of their existing difficulties, war debts and reparation burdens must be abolished. I am living in the hope that leading statesmen in all civilized countries will, before long, succeed in moulding public opinion to ensure the adoption of this course. </para>

                    <para>.- I listened with attention to the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Greene)</inline> yesterday when dealing with the results of the Imperial Economic Conference at Ottawa, but, in the absence of definite information with regard to the specific matters mentioned in the agreement, I find some difficulty in discovering whether we have actually gained anything from the work of our delegation at that important gathering. Wc have seen in the press references to the decisions, and have heard -a number of speeches from public platforms, telling us of the great benefits that will accrue to Australia from Ottawa, but frankly I must confess that I fail to see that Australia has obtained any material advantage from the 'conference. All details, we are told, are to be withheld until after the return to Australia of the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett).</inline> Until he tells us precisely what has been achieved, we must be, to some extent, in the dark. We have been informed that the conference agreed to some kind of secret formula upon which preferences in trade matters are to be given to the respective countries in the British Commonwealth of nations. From the somewhat vague information at our disposal it would appear that Australia has given away a great deal. For instance, the Australian delegation, I believe, gave an undertaking that the Commonwealth Government would not take action to increase tariff protection in certain directions, but would make an attempt to restore the tariff to the position which existed prior to the revised schedules brought in by the Scullin Government. That tariff did a great deal for Australia, and if the policy of the Scullin Administration had been carried on by the present Government we should have been in a much better trade position to-day. Under the increased protection given by the Scullin Government, many people with money to invest were encouraged to erect factories and to embark" upon enterprises that gave remunerative employment to tens of thousands of our people. I regret that the present Government, early in its career, interfered with the tariff proposals of the previous Administration, and that it intends to go still further in that direction. That will mean serious losses to those who, during the Scullin regime invested their capital in industrial enterprises, and will also lead to an 'increase in unemployment. In the absence of precise information concerning the decisions of the Ottawa Conference, it is impossible to say very much about that historic gathering. We must await the return of the Minister for Trade and Customs, who, we are informed, will tell us what really was done at Ottawa. Until we have that information we shall not be in a position to pass judgment upon the bargaining which took place at Ottawa between Great Britain and Australia, and the other dominions pf the Empire. </para>

                <para>I ask honorable senators to come tomorrow prepared to discuss the budget proposals and the motion in relation to the Lausanne Conference. I realize that it would be unfair to ask honorable senators to discuss these subjects to-day, since they have not yet had an opportunity to study the papers ; but they will have some spare time to-night. Later in the session the Government may have to pass related measures through the Senate somewhat hurriedly, and honorable senators may then feel that they have been deprived of an opportunity to discuss them fully. I trust, therefore, that while government business is in the process of incubation, honorable senators will avail themselves of this chance to discuss the matters in which they are particularly interested. </para>

                    <para>. - I bring under the notice of the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Greene)</inline> one of those little impositions which are placed on the people of Australia from time to time. I have here a pencil which is sold throughout Australia in most attractive packages. It is called the " Kookaburra " pencil, and is manufactured by the Swan Pencil Company. On the package is a picture of a kookaburra, which is sufficiently attractive to make it appeal strongly to any Australian child. On the back of the packages sold in Western Australiathere is also a trade mark which is a picture of a white swan - not the black swan on a yellow background,, which is the emblem of the Dominion League of Western Australia. If, however, we examine the label carefully through a microscope, we find under the words " Swan PencilCo." the word " Bavaria ". The pencil itself is marked " Kookaburra ", and bears the words "Made in Germany". Obviously, the package is got up in this way in order to deceive Australian purchasers. The Customs Department has power to prevent frauds of this kind from being perpetrated on people who desire to use Australian products, and look for an Australian name or emblem to help them to do so. I am not one of those persons who object to pencils or other articles being imported into this country - indeed, I should like to see more imports in return for our exports, particularly from Great Britain - but I do object to imported articles being offered for sale in a way calculated to deceive purchasers as to the country of origin. On that ground, I ask the Minister to bring this matter under the notice of thecustoms authorities. </para>

I agree that it is reprehensible that articles not made in Australia should bear distinctive Australian emblems which make it appear that they are of Australian origin. At the moment, I am not certain what action the Government can take to prevent this kind of thing; but all honorable senators will agree that emblems which are distinctly Australian should be reserved for use in connexion with Australian goods. I am delighted to acknowledge <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> as a convert in this connexion, for I have always regarded him as a champion of champions of foreign goods. I shall have the matter he has raised looked into with a view to ascertaining what can be done. Should it be found that action cannot, be taken directly, through the customs, it is probable that the situation can be met by so administering the Trade Marks Act. as to preserve distinctive Australian emblems for use in connexion with Australian-made goods. </para>
