                <para>The delegates attending the conference ofsub-branches of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Aus-  tralia, which was held at Newcastle were of the opinion that if a soldier, or the widow of a soldier, vacated a property, there should be mutual consent to the vacation on the part of the purchaser and the Commissioner. They pointed out that it might become necessary for the purchaser of a war service home to vacate a property in, say, January, whereas the cancellation of the contract might not take place until eight or ten months later. The delegates felt that, in such a case, a heavy burden would be placed upon the purchaser. Yesterday, I read a number of resolutions which were agreed to at the conference to which I have referred. This morning I received a letter from the Cessnock sub-branch of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia. Cessnock, which has a population of about  30,000  persons, has an active branch of the league - perhaps one of the most active in Northern New South Wales. The writer of the letter to which I have referred states - </para>

                    <para>. -  Proposed new subsection  1a  of section  36  is a replica of regulation  17,  which was held to be <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires.</inline> It is now being placed in the statute in order to give it legal effect. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline> referred to certain resolutions which were carried by a number of returned soldiers at a conference at Newcastle. Those resolutions were, later, submitted to the controlling body of the returned soldiers' organization in New South Wales, and were rejected. When the honorable senator realizes what this bill aims at, I feel sure that he will not persist with his amendment. Even now mutual agreement must exist before anything can be done. If the purchaser of a war service home vacates the property, and the Commissioner does not agree, the contract is not cancelled ; but if the Commissioner does agree, the contract is cancelled. We must assume that in cases in which the Commissioner refuses to cancel the contract, he has good reasons for his action. Under the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn,</inline> the purchaser will be in no better position than he is to-day. </para>

                    <para>. -  This clause gives me an opportunity to mention a matter which I was unable to bring before the Senate on the second reading.

                </talk.start>
                <para>Avar  service homes. Some of them approached me and asked that I should urge on the then Government the desirability .of extending the time for repayment from  25  to  40  years. Most of the war service homes built in Queensland are constructed of wood, and, consequently, the period for repayment is  25  years as against  40  years in the other States where the buildings are mostly of brick and other more durable materials. They pointed out that men still in -receipt of their 'ordinary wages could continue to meet their obligations, as they had done  hitherto, hut that men on short time, or out of work, could not do so. A little later, I, in common with other honorable senators from Queensland, received a request from various branches of the returned soldiers league in Queensland making similar representations.. When I placed their representations before the then Government, I was informed that, in view of the necessity for obtaining all the revenue possible, the request could not be acceded to. The present is an opportune time for this matter to be considered. I shall not move an amendment to extend the period for repayment; I merely ask the Minister to bring this matter before the committee of inquiry which is to be set up. Agreement to this request, while not affecting the revenue to any great extent, would confer a great boon on the occupiers of war service homes in Queensland. I bring this matter forward now in the hope that something will be done in the direction indicated. </para>

                    <para>. - I support the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thompson,</inline> who has urged an extension of the period for the repayment of advances made' to the purchasers of Avar service homes in Queensland. These homes, which are built of well-seasoned timber, and have been faithfully constructed under expert supervision, will last much longer than 25 years. The returned soldiers in Queensland feel that they are placed at a disadvantage in comparison with their comrades in the other States in that the period for the repayment of advances made to them for their homes is shorter than in the other States. I hope that their views will receive the careful consideration of the committee that is to be set up. If the Government cannot see its way to extend the period for repayment to 40 years, I urge it to extend it by at least ten years, making the full term 35 years, so that the purchasers of these homes may beable to meet their obligations. </para>

                    <para>I thank you very much for your courtesy in forwarding a copy of the proposed amendmentsto the War Service Homes Act. They were placed before my committee at their recent meeting held on the 7th March, and were severely criticized: and during the discussion that ensued it was pointed out that the several amendments proposed were all to the benefit of the Commissioner, and that no benefit would be derived by the occupiers. </para>

                    <para>The amendment to the War Service Homes Act. a copy of which was forwarded, was dealt with at our last general meeting. Some very scathing remarks were made on the Government's action in springing such financegrabbing legislation at a time when diggers, in common with other struggling house-owners, or I should say, ex-house owners, are seeking some measure of relief from the burdens which arc so much in evidence at present. I. was instructed to request you to voice the strongest of protests against the adoption of such amendments as outlined by the Minister in question. I feel confident that you will require no urging, and that our interests can well be left in your care. Expressing our sincere appreciation of your constant vigilance and efforts on our behalf. </para>

                <para class="block">I assure the Minister that there is no desire to split straws in the interpretation of the various provisions of the bill. The resolutions of the Newcastle conference were the result of a careful consideration of the measure, so the representations made are entitled to respect. To overcome the difficulty, I suggest that the further consideration of the bill be postponed, and an invitation be sent to the  president  and secretary of the State executive, and perhaps also to a delegate from the northern districts of New South Wales, to ascertain definitely the views of returned soldiers on this proposal. Failing acceptance of this suggestion, we shall be obliged to push the amendment to a division. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson</inline> has asked what are the views of the parent body on these proposals, and the Minister has informed us that it has offered no objection. Apparently this informationhas just been conveyed to the Minister by a departmental official. I do not know what are the views of the parent body and, apparently, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson</inline> also is ignorant on the point. This being so, what objection can the Minister offer to my suggestion that further consideration of the bill be deferred until he has had an opportunity to consult <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dyer,</inline> the general <inline font-weight="bold">president, Mr. Robb,</inline> the New South Wales State  president,  and other representatives from the northern districts of that State? The Minister says that only the Cessnock and Newcastle sub-branches are making this appeal. I disagree with that statement, which, probably, has been made off-hand without a complete knowledge of the case. The whole of the branches comprised in the northern portion of New South Wales were called together by an executive minute of the State Council of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia. They met in Newcastle under the chairmanship of the State  President,  those present including two State councillors, the State secretary and ten delegates representative of all the sub-branches. The whole of their deliberations were directed towards this provision. I appeal to the Minister to hold over the clause to see if anything can be done to meet their wishes. </para>

                    <para>.- Sub-clause 2 appears to me to involve the return of our old friend " retrospective legislation " in a somewhat acute form. The amendment made by sub-clause 1 is, by subclause 2, deemed to have operated from the date of the commencement of the War Service Homes Act 1918, and thus will have- retrospective operation over a period of fourteen years. I , am generally averse to retrospective legislation even for a short period, and I imagine that no one would be in favour of so long a time as fourteen or fifteen years. We all know the course which these cases usually follow. The Ministry introduces legislation which is incorrectly worded to effect the purpose desired. In some cases, it may prefer to bring in a bill in general terms, leaving its operation to be made effective by regulations. I gather that in this particular case, the regulation that was issued was held to be <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires.</inline> Naturally, that case is exempted from the terms of the alteration. But the alteration is made to date back so as to embrace and to govern every other case that presumably has occurred within the last fourteen years. If that be so, I should like to know whether many cases are affected, or a large sum is involved. Those considerations, of course, do not lessen the undesirability of retrospectivity, though I admit that it is an impossible task to re-open all cases that have arisen over a period of fourteen or fifteen years, and that have been decided under the belief that the law was what it was subsequently shown not to be. The Government should stand by any law that has been enacted, and not seek years afterwards to make alterations dating back to its enactment. </para>

                    <para>.- I intend to support the clause as it stands. I cannot see that the proposed amendment has very much bearing on it. I agree with the Minister that, in the first place, an agreement must be arrived at before the contract can be cancelled. I hope that we shall have an assurance from the Minister that a returned soldier who happens to be out of employment will not be evicted from his home, and that the good relationship which existed between him  and the  commission during the regime  of  the last Government, will continue.  In  those circumstances, no great hardship will be imposed upon him. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>I  have listened attentively  to the  honorable senator who moved  the  amendment. It appears to me that  the  correspondence which he has  read  discloses not so much a valid objection, as the fear of something that might be done. I am at a loss to know what is to be feared. The only fear that these men can have is that they may be turned out of their homes. The commission must be given some protection. I presume that there are cases in which the occupants neglect the homes and allow them to fall into disrepair, with the result that upon vacation they are not of very much value. The bill provides that the expenditure by the commission upon repairs, chargeable to the occupant, shall not exceed £40. I cannot apprehend any great hardship being caused, so long as the Minister will give the committee the assurance that humane treatment will be meted out to returned soldiers or their dependants. </para>

                    to retrospective legislation. That honorable senator deserves credit for his exposure. He has raised a very important point, and I appreciate his action very much. But what I wish to refer to more particularly, is the quibble in regard to the word "mutual." When a returned soldier walks into the office of the Commissioner, he does not merely smile, shake hands, and walk out again. Why should we split straws in the interpretation of the word "mutual"? If there is nothing in the mind of the Minister, what is wrong with his acceding to my request to hold up this clause until the opinion of the State executive of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia is obtained? I believe that he has not correctly interpreted the amendments that are desired by the convention which was held in Newcastle. The Government is not likely to allow the charge to be laid at its door that it has placed returned soldiers, with their few sticks of furniture, on the roadside, and has made it necessary for them to tramp the highways and byways. I do not think that any Australian Government would do that, realizing the great services which the men concerned rendered to the country during the dark days of the war. I again urgethe postponement of these particular amendments until the Senate meets again.

            <para>SenatorRAE (New South Wales) [12.6].  -  It is obvious that if a soldier vacates his home because of his inability to meet the payments falling due to the War Service Homes Commissioner, it is impossible to recover from him the cost of repairing the premises he has left. The constant need for amendment of much of our legislation is due to the fact that we load our acts with impracticable conditions. Is it not clear that it is impossible to demand from a person who has vacated his house through inability to keep up his payments, the cost of any renovations effected to the house after his departure fromit? </para>

                    <para>.- It is as much in the interests of the purchaser of a home as it. is in the interests of the War Service Homes Commission that the commission should have the power given in this proposed new sub-section to charge the purchaser or borrower with the cost of repairs to a houseof which the commission has resumed possession. Theobject is to put the house in a tenantable or saleable state  of repair so that a buyer may be found for it at a reasonable price, and so that  the commission need not be put in the position of having to sacrifice it owing to its not being in a state of repair. This power will enable the Commissioner to function in the interests of all parties. When the price realized from the sale of a property is below the amount due by the purchaser to the commission the former gets nothing, and, as a matter of fact, is involved in a liability, but if the sale price is more than the purchaser's liability to the commission the purchaser is entitled to the equity. A buyer of a property is mostly influenced by its appearance upon inspection. If £40 is spent upon it the value of a home is enhanced and the Commissioner gets a better price for it. The soldier is thus protected. He has a better chance of getting some equity than he has if nothing is done to renovate the premises which he has vacated. This provision is also obviously in the interests of the revenue of the country. </para>

                    <para>. - I quite recognize the force of the Minister's contention that it is advisable to keep vacated premises in good repair, but that does not dispose of the fact that in numerous cases where homes are vacated by the borrowers and resumed by the Commissioner, the trouble is due to the inability of the occupiers to keep up their payments. In that respect they have proved to be failures, yet it is now proposed to load them with a liability. That liability is certainly limited to £40, but £40 is a little fortune to a man who has nothing, or has only a small chance of earning a decent wage. </para>

                    <para>. - Although there is a good deal in the contention of Senators Rae and Dunn,. I fully appreciate the difficulty of the Acting Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLachlan).</inline> Will the Minister consider the granting of relief to a returned soldier who is compulsorily sold up under the principal act, and, as a result of such sale, has no financial return due to him ? I appeal to the Minister to consider that proposition since the provision of war service homes is only a portion of the general repatriation scheme of the Commonwealth Government. Men who have been settled on the Murray and other lands are in a similar position to those provided with war service homes in "the metropolitan area. Settlers on Murray lands have had approximately <inline font-style="italic">£2,000,000</inline> written off their liabilities, and while their individual financial responsibilities have been proportionately written down, the man in the metropolitan area who has also been repatriated has had nothing written off his liability. It seems unfortunate that returned soldiers whom the Commonwealth Government set out to repatriate have, owing to unemployment and other causes, been compelled to give up their homes after spending possibly £50 or £60 upon them, and that by reason of a deflation in land values their properties are now worth considerably less than when they were acquired. In addition to making that loss, they are now being asked to meet the cost of repairing their properties, which may amount to £40, and is additional to the amount they have already lost. I think that the Government should be entitled to claim up to £40 in respect of any amount due to the returned soldier occupant after a successful sale had been effected; but I contend that if we are to have this portion of our repatriation scheme consistent with the land settlement scheme under our general repatriation policy, we should not compel a returned soldier occupant of a war service home, who does not receive any amount from the Commissioner in respect of the sale of his home, to pay a sum such as that provided for. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> would withdraw his amendment, the Minister might consider the addition of these words to the proviso - </para>

                        <para>- I appreciate the point that when a contract is cancelled the liability of the returned soldier occupant to the Commissioner ends. The commission may enter upon and take possession of a property, and after effecting what repairs are deemed necessary may sell the property. But there is no reference in this proposed new sub-section to any cancellation of the contract. In order to overcome the difficulties which the Commissioner encountered in the Davies case, he desires provision to be made, that he shall not waive his right to treat the contract as a continuing contract. </para>

                        <para>- The mere fact that the Commissioner enters into possession does not cancel the contract of tenancy. Is the Minister satisfied that the act of the Commissioner in entering upon and taking possession of a property constitutes a cancellation of the contract or a waiving of the rights of the purchaser? If the Commissioner cancelled the contract in the first place, obviously it would be an anomalous position to compel the tenant after cancellation to pay the cost of repairs. It seems to me that under the proposed new sub-section, it is possible for such an interpretation to be placed upon it. Even though a loss of £50 may have been incurred by the purchaser or borrower, he may still have to pay an additional £40. I believe that a similar point was taken by an honorable member in another place, when the Assistant Minister in charge of the bill said that if there was anydoubt in such matters, it was not the intention of the Government to compel a returned soldier occupant to pay such amounts, unless money was due to him as a result of the sale. </para>

                        <para>- I think not. The principle upon which the principal act is drafted is occupancy by the returned soldier.. Owing to economic and other conditions, many changes have occurred since the principal act was passed, and soldiers' homes are now vacated in circumstances I have mentioned. The Government desires to meet the position brought about in the Davies case, and to give the Commissioner the right to take possession in order to effect repairs. I am assured that if there is not a surplus after the sale has been effected the Commissioner does not recover from the borrower, and if there is, the soldier is refunded any amount due to him after necessary costs have been met. In these circumstances, the purchaser or borrower has it both ways. </para>

                    <para>. - I support the amendment. Honorable senators may know of a scheme of land settlement for returned soldiers which has been inaugurated by Canon R. B. S. Hammond, of the Church of England. On the banks of the Nepean river, in the Penrith district, numbers of returned soldiers have taken up blocks of land comprising from three to five acres. Some of them may be purchasers of war service homes. Let us suppose that while working on their blocks, their homes are destroyed by a cyclone. Would the Commissioner regard the cyclone as an act of God? </para>

                    <para>. - I am advised that when a home held on mortgage is resold by the commission any surplus is paid to the borrower when the new purchaser creates the necessary margin of security. This is provided for in section 36, sub-section 2. If a loss occurs, the commission does not recover from the borrower, but shoulders the loss itself. When a contract of sale is cancelled the interest of the purchaser in the new home thereupon ceases. He is not held liable for any loss, nor is any surplus paid to him. If the purchaser's deposit and principal repayments equal 10 per cent. of the capital cost, the whole of the surplus on resale is set off against the arrears of instalments. If the purchaser's deposit and principal repayments do not equal 10 per cent. on the capital cost, the surplus on resale over the original loan to the extent of the purchaser's deposit is set off against the arrears of instalments. I submit that the department deals in a very generous way with returned soldier occupants of war  service homes. I also emphasize that the act, if this amendment were inserted, would be utterly impossible to administer. The frequent assessments would involve the department in tremendous cost without satisfaction to any of the parties concerned. I, therefore, suggest the honorable senator should not press his amendment. </para>

A court would not enforce a claim of the department unless it could be shown that the debtor was able to pay. It may, however, be explained that while a purchaser might not be in regular employment, he might still have an income by way of pension, allowances, &amp;c, equal to the basic wage. The amendment is not necessary, and I mustoppose it. </para>

This would remove the Minister's objection to it. He has toldus that payments are not enforced unless the occupants are in. a position to meet the claims. If this is the policy of the Commissioner, no harm could be done if we inserted in the bill a provision giving specific protection to unemployed occupants of war service homes. </para>

                        <para>- These amendments have not been conjured up by me and my colleagues for the sake of limelighting; they have been suggested by the returned soldiers themselves. There must have been instances in which they felt aggrieved by the lack of these provisions, or they would not have suggested their incorporation in the act. When a large body of delegates from different branches meet in conference, any proposal that is of no advantage to them is immediately scouted. It is only reasonable to suppose that, if this has been the practice of the commission that body would not be shouldered with any further responsibilities if it were enacted. The Minister might have sufficient graciousness to please this large body of men, by giving legislative effect to what, he avers is the practice of the commission. </para>

These amendments have not been drafted in dark corners in this building; they express the wish of returned soldiers who met in conference to consider the operation of the act. Every honorable senator will agree that those who are charged with the administration of war service homes have always been prepared to do whatever they could for any returned soldier who was down and out. But if this provision were included in the bill, returned soldiers would have the assurance that they were safeguarded by act of Parliament. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable senator has heard my views once, and I shall  not repent them in detail. This sub-clause is of considerable importance, in that, with respect to any returned soldier who has not been so fortunate as to have had the test case decided in his favour, it will operate back to the time of the passing of the original act. I await the reply which I invited earlier from the Minister. As I read the clause, it does not appear to be just. Often, in another place, I had cause to refer to retrospective legislation. As a general rule, I do not like it. It is not fair to invoke the law in favour of the party which is passing the legislation. I remember that, years ago, in another place, the present Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> and I repeatedly opposed such legislation : some excellent speeches by him on this subject can be found in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> for 1923 or 1924. It appears to be that the passing of this clause may cause hardship to a considerable number of people. Indeed, there may be some persons who waited for the test case, to take advantage of it if it should happen to go their way. As I understand the position, the court has held that a regulation which was sought to be imposed was, in fact, invalid, and the purpose of this sub-clause is to declare that notwithstanding the decision of the Supreme Court, the regulation shall, in fact, be valid from the time of the passing of the act. " The regulation is to become part of the act itself. I know that the general custom on such occasions as this is to invoke the moral right that, as a certain thing was intended to be laid down by regulation, the taxpayer or the person affected ought to pay the amount required from him. But in this instance we are dealing with legal rights, and I cannot justify carrying back the law for fourteen years, and setting it in motion against a number of people whom it must detrimentally affect. </para>

                    <para>. - No one has a greater abhorrence of retrospective legislation than I have, but until regulation 17 was declared <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires</inline> by the court it had been in force for very many years, and all contracts between the "War Service Homes Commissioner and purchasers or borrowers had been made in the belief that it was good law. The regulation provided that, notwithstanding the cancellation of any contract of sale, the Commissioner could sue for and recover any instalment of purchase money or any other money which became due under the contract at any time prior to the date of cancellation. As honorable senators will see, a similar provision has been embodied in proposed new sub-section 1a. Thousands of pounds have been paid by various purchasers to the Commissioner under the belief that this regulation was good law, and its validity was not questioned until December last, when the matter was taken to the Victorian Full Court by the <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Davies,</inline> whose rights are preserved in the latter part of the clause. Judgment was given on the 19th December, 1931, and we propose to give <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Davies</inline> the benefit of it, but to exclude others. This litigant undoubtedly took advantage of the law-, but all the other people who made contracts with the Commissioner believed that they were contracting under the provision contained, in regulation 17. If the proposed new sub-section were not made retrospective it would enable all past transactions to be re-opened, and would prevent the recovery of other moneys due to the Commissioner by .various occupants of houses. </para>

I venture to suggest that if the Senate took itself back to the time when it was originally legislating and these regulations were being framed it would have legislated as now proposed. </para>

                    <para>. - I agree with the Minister that when it is obvious that the intention of the Parliament has not been sufficiently and clearly expressed in language which leaves no doubt as to what its intention was, no hardship is inflicted on any person if, as the result of an interpretation of that legislation by the court, it is found necessary to employ other language to make the intention of Parliament clear and to make it retrospective. On many occasions in respect of our income tax law, and other legislation, the previous Government, despite the violent opposition of certain other honorable senators who now form the ministerial party, passed similar retrospective provisions. As the Minister has given us his assurance that this particular provision is not intended for the purpose of instituting any newpractice, and that it is simply required to protect the War Service Homes Commission, and prevent any one from taking advantage of what now appears to have been an obvious flaw, I think that we should agree to the provision. I cannot see the force of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn's</inline> argument. If Parliament would have passed this law, as it understood it was passing it prior to the decision in the Davies case, there is only one logical conclusion to come to, and that is that no hardship can be inflicted by putting the law back to what it should have been. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. We may be setting up two classes of borrowers. When Parliament is of opinion that a retrospective provision is necessary because of the fact that it would have enacted it at an earlier stage, and was, indeed, under the impression that it had already done so, no injustice can be done. I have already mentioned previous instances. </para>

                        <para>- Possibly, but the Privy Council, if it had been appealed to, might have discovered that no such slips had occurred. Except in certain cases the High Court is our final court of appeal, and we must accept its decisions. But, in doing so, if we believe that the language in the original law did not adequately express the intention of Parliament, it is manifestly our duty to alter it, and also make the alteration date back to the time when the law was originally enacted. On the assurance of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> that it is not intended to institute any new procedure, but simply to carry out the practice followed in the past, and concerning which there has been no complaint, I think the mover of the amendment might justifiably withdraw it. I cannot see my way to support it. </para>

We have had frequent examples of that class of legislation, not only in the Federal Parliament, but also in State legislatures. A taxation commissioner having lost a case before a court, has straight away applied to Parliament to amend the law and make it retrospective. I have always regarded such legislation as obnoxious and, unless the Minister can put up a better case than he has this afternoon, I shall certainly vote for the amendment. </para>

I have in mind an occasion on which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lawson,</inline> who was absent from the sittings of the Senate during the debate on the second reading of a measure dealing with the sales tax, set forth the Victorian viewpoint at the third-rending stage. I do not say that you, sir, were actuated by any spirit of vindictiveness - that is far removed from my mind - but I should like to know in what way I was out of order when I attempted to speak to the third reading. </para>
