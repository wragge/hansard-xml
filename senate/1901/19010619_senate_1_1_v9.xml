                        <para>- The only explanation I can give to the honorable senator is that in adopting that form in the enacting clause of the Bill we are following the first section of chapter I. of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act. "We cannot be said on this occasion to be departing from any precedent because there is no precedent. This is the first Bill which has been brought forward in the Senate. The first section of chapter I. of the Constitution Act says the Parliament shall consist of the Queen, a Senate, and a House of Representatives. I think it is the correct course, having in view that section of the Constitution, that we should adopt the form of the enacting words which I now propose. </para>

There was trouble between the two Houses as to which House should be recited first. The House of Assembly, so far as Money Bills were concerned, undoubtedly thought that it should take precedence over the Legislative Council, and so, to get rid of the difficulty, the Right Honorable Charles Cameron Kingston, altered the form, and we have the most simple enacting clause which it is possible to conceive.

It is a great deal better to prevent any trouble occurring between the two Houses, and therefore it is quite sufficient to use the enacting form in this Bill. I shall certainly oppose the addition of the words to be proposed by the Postmaster-General. It will be a great deal better for us to follow the exceedingly simple form used in South Australia. We can leave out the words . " the advice and consent " of the two Houses, and " the authority of the same as follows." This form is suitable to the work we have to perform, and there is not the slightest necessity for us to have a more elaborate enacting clause. </para>

                        <para>- Or is it the idea that they will not be able to waste enough of printers' ink or something of that description? Or do they want to adopt the same forms as the legal profession generally do - to put as many words as possible into anything so as to increase the cost ? I cannot understand why even the Government take up this idea. Nor can I understand the anxiety of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> in endeavouring to make this clause more complicated than it is. The first section of the Constitution is really a definition of what the Parliament is, and when we say " the Parliament of the Commonwealth," either we mean the King, the Senate, and the House of Representatives, or we mean the King, the House of Representatives, and the Senate. I agree entirely with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> that if we leave th,e form of the clause as it is, no possible conflict can arise between the two Houses as to which of them should be mentioned first. And as so many thin skinned persons have got into the position of senators. or representatives, we should be as guarded as possible, and give as little cause of offence as lies in our power. </para>

                    <para>- Some amendment is necessary. I do not think the words " the Parliament of the Commonwealth " are enough in themselves, because they assume that the Parliament of the Commonwealth is omnipotent, whereas, of course, we know it is not. It is simply an assumption of authority which we in no way possess, and which I should think we in no way wish to assert. It seems to me that the motion of the Postmaster-General puts the proposition in very terse terms. He might have said "the King's Most Excellent Majesty and the Parliament of the Commonwealth." </para>

                    <para>- I think we all feel indebted to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> for, on more than one occasion, keeping us alert to constitutional matters that require adjustment if we are to proceed on right lines, particularly in connexion with the Senate which is a new House, constituted on a new basis, and exercising functions which have not hitherto been associated with the ordinary Upper House to which we have been accustomed. It is not likely to be of great service to a debate on a matter of this kind, that my honorable friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor's</inline> exquisite powers of sarcasm should be used in referring to honorable members of this or any other House as " thin-skinned persons." I do not know whether my honor able friend's skin is of the rhinoceros type, but 1 think remarks of that kind would be very much better omitted when we are discussing  constitutional matters which may be of more or less importance. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir John</inline> Downer seemed to think that I was in error - because it is not likely that he would be in error on a matter of this kind - but the English Constitution, as 1 have always understood it, recognises it as a principle that " the Parliament," however we may phrase it, does include the Sovereign as well as the two Houses. We have also in our Constitution a legal recognition of that constitutional principle in terms beyond mistake. Section 1 of chapter 1, dealing with the Parliament, expressly says that the legislative power of the Commonwealth shall be vested in the Federal Parliament, which shall consist of p the Queen, a Senate, and the House of Representatives. Now, I think that my honorable friend - and this is an Act containing a great many Sections, so that none of us can afford to speak with too great confidence about it without reference - must have overlooked that provision when he doubted whether, as far as the Constitution is concerned, the Sovereign did form part of the Parliament. I venture to think also that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> took a rather mistaken view on this point, because of course the power of enactment under the English Constitution - I think the President will bear me out in that - is supposed, under the time honoured constitutional rules, to be vested in the Sovereign. The Sovereign legislates but " with the advice and consent of the Lords spiritual and temporal and the Commons in Parliament assembled." But the legislative power is vested theoretically at least in the Sovereign.' On the other hand, here the legislative power is vested in "the Parliament," which, by definition in our Constitution, includes the Sovereign and the two Houses. The question, then, is simply whether we are to use in the clause under discussion the term defined - and which for shortness cannot be surpassed - in the section of the Constitution which I have taken the liberty of reading to the Senate. The question is whether the words - </para>

                        <para>- They are both right. But "The Parliament" has the advantage of shortness, and the advantage of being clearly defined in the section of the Constitution. Therefore,, so far as individual preference is concerned, I should prefer to adhere to the enacting clause as it stands in the Bill, and to always preserve it. I think it is neater, it is constitutionally accurate, it is free from all doubt because the Constitution itself has defined it, and we cannot go to a better authority than the Constitution, which has been framed in order to secure brevity. So&#62; that if we use the expression " The Parliament," we get brevity, we get lucidity, and if we have any doubt at all as to what is comprehended in it, we have it fully explained in section 1. It would be well to have uniformity, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> said,, but that uniformity should be in the direction adopted in the Bill. </para>

                    <para>- From the eloquent explanation which we have heard from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Josiah</inline> Symon, it seems that it is perfectly permissible toÂ» use either expression. It appears to me that it would be much better on this occasion to accept the proposal of the Government.. Unfortunately there are not a few persons in Australia who would take advantage of any opportunity 'to say that Parliament was all powerful, without reference to the King's Most Excellent Majesty. On. that ground and because we should take every occasion to show that we are part of the British 'Empire, I shall support the Postmaster-General. </para>

                    <para>- I am. inclined to think that the particular clause under discussion ought to stand as it appears. I had not the advantage of being; present when the Postmaster-General gave his reasons for the proposed alteration, but as far as I can see, it is not possible to give, any valid reason for that alteration. Our ideas with regard to Acts of Parliament;, are that they ought to be expressed in as. clear English as possible, and with as. little redundancy as possible. If that be the case, the phrase, " Be it enacted by the- </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia " appears to me to be as expressive as and to be much more concise than the alteration proposed by. the Postmaster-General. If we adopt the amendment I consider that we shall be taking a step in the wrong direction, and instead of shortening our Acts, and of making them clearer, we shall be needlessly dragging them out and making them- more and more involved. With regard to the question raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir John</inline> Downer, and I think also by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> - although I could not catch exactly what the latter honorable senator said - there appears to be some little doubt in the minds of certain gentlemen as to the loyalty of Australia to Great Britain. I think we may set honorable senators' minds at ease on that point. We are all loyal to Great Britain, I hope. AVe are all loyal also to Australia, but I think we owe some little loyalty to ourselves. AVe ought to ask ourselves this question - " Who is it that governs Australia? Is it the people of Australia, or is it some power outside of Australia <inline font-style="italic">1"</inline> That is the question that we have to ask ourselves. With regard to the position of the King in the Government of Great Britain, that has been defined by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Josiah</inline> Symon, but I suppose that senators know just as well as I do that any interference on the part of the King with legislation passed by the British Parliament would be resented by the people of Great Britain, and would not be permitted. The power to veto is a fiction, and it is permitted to exist only because it is never used. Do honorable senators riot know that ? Do they not also know that if any power outside of Australia attempted to interfere in the internal affairs of Australia, that that action would also be resented ? It would be resented <inline font-style="italic">hy</inline> me, at any rate, and I trust it would be resented by every honorable member of the 'Senate. AVe are a self-governing community in every sense of the word. </para>

                        <para>- I understand that perfectly. The point I am making is that the terms are practically synonymous. We can either use one or the other. No doubt the Postmaster-General was not correct when he inserted the words " the Parliament of the Commonwealth." He really should have inserted the words "the Federal Parliament," or else the words he now proposes to substitute. </para>

                    (Western Australia).I can quite understand a layman not grasping the distinction that has been pointed out by

                    but I can hardly understand a member of the legal profession being unable to appreciate the distinction, as in my opinion it undoubtedly exists. As
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline>
                    has pointed out, the, definition that is contained in section 1 is a definition for the purposes of the Constitution Act only. If that definition were contained in the measure which we are about to deal with, which defines a number of terms which, whenever they are used, will have the interpretation therein given to them, then no doubt " the Parliament of the Commonwealth" would be sufficient. I think,
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline>
                    that
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline>
                    is quite right, and that " the Parliament of the Commonwealth" means, nothing, because there is no definition of. the words "the Parliament of the Common* wealth," unless it is used within the four corners of the Act for the purposes of which that definition is given. Therefore, it seems to me quite clear that either the words that have been suggested by the Postmaster-General, ' or the words " the Federal Parliament " should be substituted for the words "the Parliament of the Commonwealth . "

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator DRAKE</inline>
                    (Queensland - Postmaster-General). - I am very much surprised that so much debate should have arisen on this small matter. The fact of the matter is that a number of Bills have been drafted, and with this one exception the term that has been used is the term that T. propose to introduce now -
                </para>
                <para>The King's Most Excellent Majesty, and the Senate and the House of Representatives of the Commonwealth. </para>
                <para class="block">This particular Bill, through an accident, was drafted in a different way, and a different expression used. I found on looking up the matter that it could not be altered in committee, and therefore it was necessary to ask the Senate to make it an instruction to the committee that that alteration should be effected. An alteration of this kind in the enacting words is generally considered so unimportant that it might almost be made by the Clerk at the table. My friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best,</inline> is quite right in what lie has said in regard to the term " the Federal Parliament." If these words are not to be used, the words " the Federal Parliament " certainly should be. Why should we depart from the form that has always been adopted in every English community of mentioning the reigning monarch in the enacting clause <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> In Great Britain the words used would, I think, be - "His Most Gracious Majesty by and with the advice of the Lords temporal, the Lords spiritual, and the Commons." That is because under the British Constitution it is a moot point as to whether the Monarch is part of the Parliament. Under our Constitution there is no doubt whatever on the point. In this first section it is made perfectly clear that the King is part' of the Parliament. The Parliament consists of the King, the Senate, and House of Representatives, and when we are presenting a Bill for the assent of the Governor-General, as representative of His Majesty here, we are not to be guided by the term that is used as a short definition in our Constitution Act. The Constitution Act simply provides that in that Act the expression " the Parliament," or " the Parliament of the Commonwealth," shall be used throughout as meaning the King 'and the Senate and the House of Representatives. But when Ve go to the representative of His Majesty here to present a Bill for his assent, surely it is right that we should follow the British practice of putting in a inference to the King's Most Excellent Majesty, the King being part of the Parliament that enacts the measure. 1 would draw attention again to this first section of our Constitution Act which says that the legislative power of the Commonwealth - that is the important point - the legislative power of the Commonwealth resides in the King and the Senate and the House of Representatives. I say therefore that the enacting words which I propose to substitute for those in the Bill are exactly accurate and cannot be improved upon. Those who are opposed to the alteration admit that the words are, at all events, as accurate as the others. If so, what remains ? There is not the slightest shred of an argument except that the words " the Parliament of the Commonwealth " do hot occupy quite as much space as the amended form. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> has shown clearly that the expression " the Parliament of the Commonwealth " is inaccurate. Therefore I can see no reason for objecting to the motion. </para>

                        <para>- I see that is so - I was misled by an inaccurate marginal note which calls it a preamble. It is really the recital of the enacting clause. This is, of course, a . question of the very highest importance, because we are laying down the lines upon "these matters of our constitutional procedure. Everything is new, and it is possible that some considerable discussion may be raised as to the introduction of these words, looking at the powers of the Senate under the Constitution. The earliest moment available should be set apart to most effectually deal with it. I ask, for our guidance, whether it would be better to deal with-it on the second reading or by an instruction when going into committee, or whether it could be sufficiently dealt with in committee. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think the committee can deal with it without an instruction. I think the same course should be adopted as we followed in connexion with the Post and Telegraph Bill. It is a well-understood rule of Parliament that a committee can only act within the powers delegated to it, and the enacting part of a Bill is not delegated to it. instructions will, therefore, have to be given to the committee to deal with it. </para>

It contains a clause which, in my humble opinion, is distinctly contrary to the provisions of the Constitution, and it contains items which should not be set forth in a Bill of the kind. In other words, the power of the Senate to amend those items is taken away by their inclusion in an Appropriation Bill, which, speaking generally, the Senate has no power to amend.

                        <para>- I have no desire to do anything that is in any way inconvenient either to the Postmaster-General or any one else. But I could not see how this question could be raised except as a matter of privilege. No doubt we might throw out the Bill altogether ; but we do not desire to do that, seeing that this is the first Bill of the kind to be introduced into the Parliament of the Commonwealth. All that my motion is intended to do is to place on record the fact that, though we allow the Government to pass a Bill which contains, in our opinion, what it ought .not to contain, we do not commit ourselves to the precedent in any way. That is the sole object of the motion, and I have mentioned it now in order that my right of moving it as a matter of privilege may be established. I understand that if one desires to move on a question of privilege, it must be done immediately the question arises. Consequently, immediately the Minister put the Bill on the table, I rose to protest against provisions which, in my opinion, should not be in it. So long as my right is preserved, I am quite prepared to allow the motion to stand over until such time as the Government have time to consider it, and the Senate has time to look into the matter. </para>

                        <para>- Perhaps by permission of the Senate notice could be given. It is not a question that so much concerns the Government as it concerns the right of the Chamber itself. I would ask you, sir, to consider, if you would, whether the clause containing the words " for the purpose of appropriating a grant made by the House of Representatives " is not in substance a preamble I do not ask for any ruling now, but I would like you to consider the point. </para>

                        <para>- The position is this. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> moved that the Bill be printed and the second reading be made an order of the day for to-morrow. Before that was put, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ewing</inline> rose to speak to a question of privilege, and he was perfectly justified in so doing. If it is a question of privilege, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ewing</inline> was quite right in raising it at once, because, in order to give him the right to move a motion, without notice, the question must suddenly arise. He stated that it has arisen by the laying of this Bill on the table. I would suggest that it would be more convenient if he brought this matter forward to-morrow. I think the Senate will concur that although perhaps it might not be strictly correct to say that the matter suddenly arises tomorrow, still having brought it forward now he has preserved his right and might be allowed to bring it forward "to-morrow. </para>

                        <para>- It could be recommitted ; but we have two Bills running side by side, and it is hardly safe to assume that the one will become law without alteration. But, entirely apart from that, I am still of opinion that it is desirable that the last two lines should be retained, because the clause in the Acts Interpretation Bill does not apply to a case of this kind, where the head of the department is giving instructions to his officers. The term " instrument" or regulation used there, I think, scarcely contemplates an instrument that is made by Act of Parliament or regulations that are made and have the force of law. If honorable senators will turn to the clause relating to regulations they will see where the clause of the Acts Interpretation Bill will come in. Power is given to make regulations, but nothing is said about rescinding or revoking or amending them. That power is implied. It is desirable - I think necessary - that in this Bill the power to revoke any instructions to officers should be distinctly given. </para>

                    <para>- - I would like very seriously to put it to the Minister whether this is not really reducing legislation to a very low level. I mean that to put in a clause in a solemn Act of this Parliament that these unfortunate messenger boys by virtue of statute sholl, at the age of eighteen years, retire from the service, unless, of course, in the meantime they are transferred to a better position, is really quite unnecessary. There are some other provisions which might well be left out, but this one is purely administrative. Surety, it does not require an Act of Parliament to enable the head of the department to make a rule in the ordinary service that messengers, when they reach the age of eighteen years, shall no longer be messengers, and they must go if they do not get any other position. Of course, there is no need of the latter portion of the clause, because, if they are transferred, there is no necessity for the application of the provision. It is really reducing our legislation to a very petty position to enact that a messenger boy in the telegraph service must retire on attaining this age. I think we ought to omit the clause. </para>

                    <para>- It certainty strikes one as being very extraordinary that the committee should deliberately enact that a person should retire from a service when he does not occupy the position which is designated. In other words, the clause states plainly that he has to retire providing he is not somewhere else. I think the latter part of the clause at least should be struck out if the clause itself is not negatived. How can we gravely enact that a lad shall not be a telegraph messenger when he is already something else ? </para>

                        <para>- He might be a small light-weight who would make a very good messenger all his life. He might not have become very large or robust as he has got on in years, but he might still be useful as a messenger when perhaps his physical condition would not fit him to endure more severe physical strain. I agree as to the desirability of leaving the exercise of a power of this kind in the hands of the Minister or the Cabinet. </para>

                    <para>- It is in the interests of these young men that I think a clause of this kind should not be inserted. It is too great a risk for a young man to run. Suppose there is nothing for him to go to. Is he to be turned into the street after having given four or five years of service? It is a serious hardship to impose on a young man. I would much rather see the matter left in the hands of the Minister and his subordinate than have it made a hard-and-fast rule that a youth must go. I have seen hardships of that kind occur, and I certainly do not wish to see them repeated. </para>

                    <para>- In my opinion the committee will make a very great mistake if it omits the clause. When a boy enters the service, and a provision of this kind is law, it means that the contract he makes with the State is that he can only remain, until he is eighteen years of age. In the meantime, therefore, he has to secure for himself some other appointment. If the section, were not in the Act, and that boy were permitted to remain, gradually he would become 20, 25, 30, and 40 years of age, with the result that the Government, to its disgrace, would have men in its service who, probably, in the meantime had got married and had reared a family. </para>

These boys, if permitted to remain, remain at this minimum salary for a very considerable time. Perhaps in the meantime they become married men with families, and I was pointing out that the disgrace is that the Government have in their employ married men with families, at from 15s. to 16s. per week-. </para>

                    <para>- I think it is beneath us altogether to pass a law of this sort. Surely we ought to allow some little elasticity in matters of this kind, and although there may be cases of hardship such as have been alluded to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> - cases in which married men have been receiving messenger's pay - yet I do think that to put in an Act of Parliament a hard and fast rule like the laws of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be altered in any circumstances, is tying the hands of Ministers' unnecessarily, and- inflicting a considerable amount of hardship on the individual messengers. Cannot we leave it to the Minister to say that in certain circumstances he shall allow these messengers to continue in the department for six or nine month's longer, or even for a year or two years as the case may be, instead of passing a law which binds him to dismiss these lads at eighteen years of age, willy nilly, without any consideration being given to any specific cases at all? If we sanction such a provision the Postmaster-General would not be able to retain them for a single day after they reached eighteen years of age, although he might then have had some billet for them. The thing is absolutely preposterous. It is preposterous to put a provision of this sort in an </para>

                <para class="block">Act of Parliament when the matter could be better dealt with by regulation. The clause is not necessary at all. The Minister when employing telegraph lads can give them due notice that they are entering into a contract, and that he will have the power when they arrive at eighteen years of age to say that their services are no longer required. But do not let us make a hard and fast rule by which the Minister is powerless to keep them in the service a clay longer. He may turn them out - at a time when work is very scarce - practically to starvation. It is a great deal better to leave these tilings to elastic regulations, and to the discretion of the Deputy Postmasters-General throughout the Commonwealth than to insert in a solemn Act of Parliament that these boys must go when they are eighteen years of age. </para>

                    <para>- I agree with all that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> has said. I think there is another view that might be taken of the position that the Postmaster-General and the postal authorities would occupy if this clause were allowed to remain. The postal authorities would be quite at liberty to take on as many, boys as they liked to put in the service, because at the age of eighteen years all those whom they did not require would be got rid of. But if this clause were struck out the postal authorities would be very careful as to the engagement of boys under eighteen years of age to carry on the messenger work, because they would have no special command by this Bill to discharge them when they arrived at that age. I think it would be far better if the clause were struck out, and a little discrimination exercised by the postal authorities in the engagement of their boys, so that when those.boys arrived at eighteen years of age there would not be so many to dismiss. </para>

                        <para>- My honorable friend's encouraging "hear, hear" confirms me in the position I take up. If influence is brought to bear in respect of a number of lads in the service of the Telegraph department, then a weak Minister would be able to say - "I cannot interfere. I am bound hand and foot, and must do as this inexorable law compels me to do.These boys must go into the street even though they go practically to a state of starvation, because I am powerless." I do not think that we ought to legislate to relieve Ministers of the Crown of a fair responsibility. This is a great administrative department, and Ministers must have the strength to put into their contracts that when a lad attains the age of eighteen years he must leave the department unless there is something else available for him to do ; then the Minister will be able to exercise a merciful consideration, and to say to a boy-" Very good. You have attained the age of eighteen years, and your contract leaves it in my option to turn you adrift, but I will give you another three months, or another six months." I think myself it would be a humane tiring for that reason, apart from everything else, to strike this clause out. </para>

                    <para>- I think that the committee ought to pause before attempting to interfere with an important department. This clause has been framed by the Postmaster-General as the result of certain experience. If my memory serves me aright there was a great outcry in the Postal department a few years ago in reference to the employment of boys. There were no other positions for them to fill, and they were retained in the service at a certain salary. If that is so, surely it is better to allow the department a discretion to deal with these messengers in an equitable and fair spirit. No honorable member of this Senate, I am sure, wishes to do any officer, an injustice. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Josiah</inline> Symon could doubtless frame a proviso which would cany out in effect what he wishes, but I ask the Senate to pause before it attempts to interfere with the Postal department. If honorable members had had experience in some Governments as I have had, they would know that at times a Government wants to be protected against itself. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable senators may pretend to be very virtuous, but it is common talk and a common experience that a Minister does at times want to be protected against himself. Perhaps he wants to be protected against certain men who are supporting him in the House, and who wish for selfish motives to attain a certain object. I believe that the general wish is that the department should be administered fairly, equitably, and honorably, and that can be done by adding a little proviso declaring that before these lads sire turned adrift an inquiry shall be made as to whether there are other offices which they can fill. At the same time it is not desirable that they should be kept on indefinitely unless some other avenue of employment is open to them. </para>

                <para class="block">These words were put into the Victorian Act - from which this clause is taken- - which was passed about two years ago, in consequence of the position of a number of these messengers in the Victorian service. The way in which these lads hung on became a perfect scandal. It is all very well to say that the Postmaster-General should dispense with their services when he feels that he can no longer retain them. It might, be different in other States, but in Victoria it is not fair to the Postmaster-General to lay him open to political influence brought strongly to bear upon him to retain lads in the service as messengers for years after they cease to be of the age at which they should properly discharge those duties. The words 1 have quoted were purposely put into the section in order, to induce the lads to qualify themselves for promotion in the service, and the results have been what I have indicated. Before that Act was passed, young men were content to go on year after year without attempting to qualify themselves for a better position in the service, but since this section became law in Victoria a number of messengers have so qualified, and have been promoted. Consequently the section so far as they are concerned, has been a dead letter. But there were a considerable number who attained even 25 and 30 years of age, and who were still content to go on acting as messengers. For these men to be Still receiving a salary of 15s. or 20s. per week was not a healthy state of things. </para>

                    <para>- The proposal that has been made that the clause should be struck out and the power left in the hands of the Minister looks well at first sight, but I do not think it would work well. The trouble is that the Postmaster- gGeneral will hot administer the department for all time. One Postmaster-eneral will have different ideas to another. As the instructions which he gives to his deputies are revocable at any time, it will simply mean that the regulation may be altered at any time in order to allow of some particular individual being retained in the service. We are told that we should try to preserve a certain amount of elasticity, but elasticity implies contraction as well as extension. There will be no elasticity in this matter ; it will simply be continual extension. If a Postmaster-General, under pressure, perhaps, from friends, allows a man to remain as a messenger until he has passed the age of eighteen or perhaps nineteen or twenty, and another goes even farther, will it be possible to get any reform ? If it is considered, then, as most senators seem to consider now, that eighteen is a fair age for a boy to retire, and if a Postmaster-General comes in, who holds that opinion, and wishes to put it into operation, what is he to do? He is at once to discharge all the messengers over that age. It would be a very much greater hardship to require a man who is above eighteen to retire than it would be to require a boy to retire at eighteen, according to the provisions of the statute. I think, therefore, this provision should be in the Bill. With regard to the age at which a young fellow could join, I think that might be left to the regulations. </para>

                        <para>- The school age varies in the different States ; but we will always have this safeguard - that a boy cannot be employed as a messenger until he is over the school age. If he is intelligent and able to do the work I cannot see that there is any wrong in employing him from the time that he leaves school. I am of opinion, therefore, education being a State matter, that in each State a boy should be taken on from the expiration of the school age. I consider that the provision requiring a boy to retire at eighteen should be in the Bill, because it relates only to boys' work. We do not want men employed in this capacity, and I do not think it is any advantage to the community generally that men who ought to be doing other work should be employed as messengers. A boy past eighteen who hangs on to a position like that is only keeping another boy out of it. We ought to take it as a necessity that in this community when a young man becomes eighteen he should have some better occupation to. follow than that of. running about with telegrams. </para>

                    <para>- The point under discussion is not whether a boy should or should not retire at the age of eighteen, but whether we should insert that provision iii this Bill. I quite agree that, no one should be employed in this capacity over the age of eighteen, and I hope it will never be found necessary to employ young men at this very low wage, because I presume the rate of wage for messenger boys will be fixed. Surely a lad of eighteen employed as a messenger will seek work elsewhere in order to obtain better remuneration. </para>

                        <para>- Then that only proves that opportunities for profitable employment must have been very bad indeed, otherwise I cannot imagine a young man over eighteen continuing to be a messenger boy, and to be classed as a messenger boy. I object, however to the limit being inserted in the Bill. It seems to me that we should have responsible Ministers. I presume our Ministers are responsible, and they should take the responsibility of boldly saying- -"The time has come when this lad must leave the service. There is no chance of promotion, and he must retire." Surely any man in the position of Postmaster-General or Deputy Postmaster-General should be able to take that responsibility. </para>

                    <para>- I am sure my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> must see that there is a danger in his amendment. Supposing a boy can pass the fifth standard of education at i0, is there not a possibility of that boy being employed if this remains? If a boy is 13, then I presume it does not make any provision with regard to his education, but if he is less than 13, and has passed the fifth standard, he is liable to be employed. Coming from Queensland, as I do, I object to the limit of 13 years, because our school age is 14,. and if you allow a loophole, then our boys may be taken on at 13. Of course, there may be some exceptional case, where, because of poverty, such a boy might be engaged, but this is a very dangerous thing. In the different States, as the Postmaster-General has pointed out, the school age is different. I would not like to see any interference. A boy should have time to mature physically as well as educationally. It is a dangerous thing to say in a Bill, that in consequence of intellectual brightness a boy should be allowed to come in, at such an age, and that no account should be taken of his physical ability, because the physical ability of that boy would be likely to suffer. I, therefore, suggest that the amendment should be withdrawn. </para>

                    <para>- Perhaps, my honorable friend, the mover of the amendment, will see that he must carry it a little further in order to make it effective. Reference is made in the amendment to some standard of education, but it is not stated where that standard exists. 'Possibly, it is a Queensland standard, but I do not know ; and, having no knowledge of what the standard is, I assume that if the Postmaster-General were called upon to administrate the clause in that amended form, he would also be in the dark. The amendment should, therefore, be carried further, so as to clearly indicate what standard is referred to. </para>

                    (Queensland).- I do not know that we have any standard of education in Queensland. There is a standard of education in Great Britain. There no boy or girl can be employed in certain work until they have reached a certain age, or unless they have reached the fourth standard of education.

That is what I was referring to.

What we are trying to do is what my honorable friend has expressed very clearly and forcibly. We are trying to save the Postmaster-General and the department from themselves. That is what we are endeavouring to do. May I point out that the proviso that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir William</inline> Zeal has suggested very properly illustrates the great danger into which this Parliament is running by legislating at all on the subject by a solemn statute. This matter bears on the administration of the department, and the Minister has expressly said that the age of admission of messengers into the department is a matter which should be dealt with by regulation. _ If the honorable and learned senator admits that the age of admission -should be dealt with by regulation, what possible reason is there for not dealing by regulation with the age of retirement ? </para>

                        <para>- The two tilings are absolutely on the same footing. One of the most effective purposes that will be served by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce's</inline> amendment is to illustrate the danger and the inconvenience of Parliament interfering in this matter at all. I was going to say as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> has said before, and as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Frederick</inline> Sargood have mentioned, that influence may be brought to bear. A proviso such as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir William</inline> Zeal has suggested with a view of tempering the administration of the clause would absolutely admit the same kind of political influence which is supposed to underlie the reason for this clause. The moment we introduce that proviso - and I say it with all esteem for my honorable friend, because he is oppressed with a feeling that oppresses us all that we may put the Postmaster-General or the Deputy Postmasters-General in a position in which the rigid letter of the law rather than the principles of humanity would govern their actions in some particular case- the moment we introduce that proviso we open the door to influence. The proviso requires a report to go up that there is no other available position in the service. The moment that power is given to the Postmaster-General he is left open to all sorts of influence that this poor little messenger boy may be in a position to exercise with a view of having some other billet found for him, or with a view of obtaining a favorable report. That would be disastrous. The only reason given for this clause is that it prevails in 'Victoria, and certainly a state of things has been laid before the Senate which is deplorable in the administration of the department in this State. The transfer of the department from the State to the Commonwealth has not come a moment too soon. Now, however, we are adopting quite a different regime. I have the most implicit confidence in the Postmaster-General, and will have confidence in his successors. Though they may not be equal to the high standard which we attribute to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake,</inline> I shall still have confidence in them. I have confidence for this reason, that we are not dealing with one State. How about the central government which happens now to be in Victoria <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> How could influence be exercised here on behalf of a boy in Queenslander somewhere in the Northern Territory <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> The grievances of such a boy would sooner reach the ear of heaven than the ear of the Postmaster-General. The proposal made would work untold mischief, find the only reason for it is that which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> has indicated in his' very forcible address, that it would prop up a weak Minister, and give him an excuse for dereliction of duty in the exercise of a power which he ought to exercise. It would give him an opportunity of saying - " Here is a hard and fast statute ; Parliament passed it, and I am not responsible." I say that is not a position in which we should place any responsible Minister. </para>

                    <para>- I was not here when the discussion commenced, but I now understand what the amendment is. I understand that there is a proposal to strike the clause out altogether, but I cannot see the good sense of doing that. The Minister is administering a department here, and he has had experience of administering a department in Queensland. Those of us who have any knowledge of post-office business in this State recognise that there is a dreadful struggle to maintain these young messenger boys in the department after a certain age, and you cannot wonder at it. </para>

                        <para>- It is due to one thing, at any rate. Once a man or boy enters the public service not in one case in 10,000 is he anxious to leave it. If they start as boys at a few shillings a week and run up to 30s. a week they will remain there until they are old men rather than face the world. I agree with the Minister that it is better for these youths to face the world when they can battle with it and engage in the pursuits of the world. If you leave them there until they are 25 they are men, and will not adapt themselves to new surroundings. I urge the Senate to -adopt the clause, because I do not see what harm it can do. The Minister is anxious to be protected in this matter, and if he is not' there will be eternal importunity to allow this and that bright boy to remain in the department doing a man's work, when he ought to be a farmer or miner or carpenter, or be engaged in some other employment. I do not see any great objection to the proposal, only to admit boys at a certain age, say 13, or after the school age, but I say- to strike out the clause will make the Bill more difficult to work. Instead of making it more difficult we should make it more simple. </para>

                        <para>- Does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> mean that the Postmaster-General or any responsible authority under him is not to have power at any time to dispense with the services of any individual, whether boy or man, who is not suitable for the work ? The ridiculousness of that is apparent to any one. This clause shelters the Postmaster-General and his officers in respect to the taking on of boys. If it were not there, and they knew that it was their duty only to take boys into the service who would be likely to be of use to them afterwards, and have the qualifications to fill other responsible positions, they would be much more careful. Put this clause in and they will take on Dick, Tom, and Harry, irrespective of their qualifications. Very probably <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> might write in to some officer and say - " Here is a boy who requires a position ; you will be conferring a great favour on me if you take him in," and he would be taken in, no matter whether possessed of qualifications likely to be useful in the service or not. He would be taken on simply because the Postmaster-General and his officers know that at 18 years of age they could get rid of him. </para>

                        <para>- It is not likely at all. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator" Fraser</inline> need not be afraid of the bright intelligent boy. If he has qualifications that will make him an efficient officer, they will always be taken into consideration. It is for that reason I oppose the clause altogether. If it is carried I hope the age at which any officer may take on a boy will be made as high as possible, say 13 ov 14, but I would rather see the clause dispensed with ; then the postal authorities would do the best they possibly could to get the best boys into the service, and when they got them there they would do all they could to keep them because they would be valuable to the department. On the other hand, take <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir William</inline> Zeal's proposal, which is made with the best intention. Before a boy can be retired a report is to be sent from some subordinate officer to the Postmaster-General that no other position can be found. Could not that be done without this clause ? It is not necessary that such a clause should be in the Bill, giving such an instruction to the Postmaster-General. If he was an efficient administrator he would give that instruction himself, and would say to his subordinate officers - " Be very careful not to recommend for permanent positions persons not qualified to fill them effectively." I hope the clause will be struck out, and that the postal authorities will have to exercise their best judgment in the selection of the boys they take into the service. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot follow the argument of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor.</inline> If he thinks that a boy who is not fit for the position is likely to be foisted upon the department through the influence of interested, parties, is it not just as likely that the same influence would be used to keep him in the department. . I cannot see how it makes the case any better to argue that influence will be used to get boys into the department. I do not think that is the state of tilings in the Post-office to any great extent ; but if affairs are so bad, that boys who are unfit are foisted upon the department, that is a reason for passing the clause. The whole question resolves itself into this: - Is this work of running about with telegraphic messages to be done by boys or men? If it is decided that it is boys' work, there should not be the least objection to putting the clause in the Bill. I have shown the difficulties that would arise if this matter were left to the Postmaster-General. He is not in office for all time. One Postmaster-General succeeds another, and if any action has been taken in the direction of increasing the limit, it is almost impossible for a succeeding Postmaster-General to reduce the limit. The boys are in the department, they have grown to be men, and it would be very much harder to remove them than to cause them to retire in accordance with a provision of this kind. So that if it is conceded that .this is boys' work, there is very good ground for the Senate adopting the clause. </para>

                    <para>- I have been wondering why the Postmaster-General is taking the power for his officers to use any pier, wharf, landing place, bridge or ferry, without compensating the owners for the use of their property. I recognise that he must have the power for his officers to use these tilings, but seeing that we shall have to pay the railway authorities and all other persons for the carnage of our mails, I think, that some provision ought to be made for payment to those persons whose property the department uses. </para>

                    <para>- It seems to me rather unfair that the quays, jetties, and piers of the States should be used for a purpose of this kind without some compensation being paid to them as well as private owners for such services. "While the Postal department was in the hands of the States, it made no difference whether it used the railways, the piers, or the quays of the States for carrying postal and telegraphic material-; but now I apprehend that each State will have to pay the Federal Government for the carriage of its letters and parcels just as private persons will do. I do not see why the State more than a private person should contribute towards the cost of constructing telegraph lines and telephone lines. The words in paragraph (f) cover all material, I understand. I do not see why these things should go across free, as the letters are not to be carried for the States free of cost. </para>

                    <para>- This is a provision which I think is found in all Post and Telegraph Acts, and it is based upon the universally admitted maxim that the King's mail is to go free, that it must not be obstructed in any way. There is a good deal in what has fallen from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles,</inline> and I should like, if I could see my way, to arrange in. such a way that some compensation should be given to those who have a right to levy tolls upon the public generally for using bridges or ferries, as the case may be; but I do not see how it can be done. . I do not want to anticipate the discussion on clauses 16 and 17 in regard to the use of the railways, because the railways are on a different footing altogether. Take the case of a ferry which is in the hands of a private person, who has the right to charge 3d. or 2d. a passenger. That is a very small amount, certainly; but if we once admit the principle that a toll may be levied on the mail, I do not see where the limit is going to be drawn, and it would be possible for a private individual, perhaps, who had the lease' of a ferry to absolutely stickup the mail' unless his own terms were conceded. That is the way of putting it from the other point of view. I think the committee will see that any attempt to allow tolls to be levied on the mails would lead to such a very unsatisfactory state of affairs that there is no' other course open except to assert the well known right that the King's mails must pass. </para>

                    (Victoria).- I did not refer to the mails at all, but to material required for the construction of new works or the maintenance of existing works. In some cases large quantities of material will be brought into' a State, and its wharfs, piers and jetties will have to be used, and even if a wharf belongs to a State, I do not see why it should not be paid for the use of them. I am speaking only of construction, and not of the carriage of the mails. This is a big principle, and I am quite sure that honorable senators will see that time 'after time, when we are considering not only postal matters, but other matters, this same question will arise as to whether the States are to receive any compensation 'for certain works carried out by them, or permitted to be carried out by them. . It seems to me that in those cases the State has a right - as I understand that it will be paid for the carriage of all mails - to be reimbursed the cost of maintaining any works which the telegraph and postal department may use in the transport of their material.

                        <para>- The last speaker has spoken particularly of wharfs, vessels and jetties, but the wharfs and jetties may be in the hands of private individuals, and though of course the argument I have used may not be quite so strong in regard to conveying material as it is in regard to allowing the mails to pass, it really is an extension of the same principle. Suppose a telegraph line requires to be constructed, and there is only one landing-place where the wire can be landed, and the jetty is in the hands of a private person who says " I shall not allow you to land your wire unless, you pay so much upon it." In that case' it will prevent the construction of a telegraph line. </para>

                    <para>- Although I agree with the Postmaster-General in regard to the carnage of mails, I certainly disagree with him as to the necessity for paragraph (/). Thousands or hundreds of tons of wire, and poles, and insulators may be landed at a place; for instance, at Port Augusta we had 60,000 insulators landed not long ago, for the purpose of duplicating our line across the Continent. They came in big cases. Surely if the wharfs are in the hands -of a State Government, it. ought to receive from the Postmaster-General the same consideration as private individuals would do. Although I -admit that we should take all necessary '-powers for the carnage of mails, I do not think we should take exceptional powers for the carriage of material, and the use of private and State wharfs and jetties, without making the slightest payment. We take the power to use the State railways, but at the same time we put in a clause providing that if we cannot come to an arrangement as to the exact price to be. paid by the Commonwealth for the use of them, it shall be decided by arbitration. Surely when the Postmaster-General is going to make a long telegraph line, and there is possibly only one port at which to land the poles, wire, insulators and various other things, and all the jetties and wharfs are in' the hands of the State Government, he will not contend for a moment that the State should be deprived of their usual tolls over the wharfs. It certainly is not fair to enact such a provision. I do not see any particular harm in a person employed to perform any duty of the department crossing a ferry or going over a wharf. Again, the provisions in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">(b)</inline> to give this concession to any person engaged in the conveyance of mails: is absolutely necessary. But as regards paragraph (c), a little difficulty arises in giving this right to any vehicle or horse conveying mails or postal articles. Of late years the Post-office has gone in for the parcels post business, and it keeps on increasing the size of the parcels, and is carrying merchandise. We are now actually getting merchandise in quantities from England by means of the parcels post. It. comes out in cases which measure half a, ton, and with a number of these cases, coming out by parcels post, it becomes a question whether the cases should be allowed to be carried free .over the wharfs of the State, or private wharfs, without paying anything for the use of them. It appears to me that there is even danger in paragraph (c). I am sure we are willing to give the Postmaster-General all necessary powers so that he shall be able to convey his mails, parcels, and so on, as expeditiously as possible, but at the same time - as he has a monopoly already -we do not want him to have a greater monopoly by reason of the fact that he is able to carry his goods free over private jetties, State jetties, State wharfs,&#38;c.

Therefore, I think that we are under the necessity of dealing with this clause in a way that will carry out the principle enunciated by the Postmaster-General in the very able speech which he made, when introducing this Bill.

                    <para>- I should like to see this clause amended in such a way as will provide that no contractor shall be allowed to sublet his contract. I allude particularly to country contracts. We know very well that once a contract is . sublet it is sublet at a reduced price at which the contractor cannot carry out his contract satisfactorily, either to the Government or to the public. </para>

                        <para>- It is the practice in Queensland not to allow contracts to be sublet; of course I am speaking from memory, but 1 feel sure that I am correct. It has to be borne in mind also- that sureties have to be given in the case of every contract for its efficient performance and no such provision is violated. </para>

                        <para>- I know of a case in which, to my own knowledge, a contract was sublet in Queensland, although the contractor had to provide sureties. As a rule the man who is in a position to get sureties is in a position to carry out his contract. But in cases where men are anxious to obtain contracts and are not able to get sureties, they get contracts sublet to them, and these are generally carried out in an unsatisfactory manner, both to the Government and to the public. These men are very often late with their mails. They are, as a rule, small selectors. They have a number of bush horses, and expect to carry out their work with grass-fed animals. When a dry season comes they cannot afford to buy feed for them, and in very many cases they have to throw up their contracts. Subletting is always a bad principle to be allowed. If this clause were amended by the insertion of a provision prohibiting a contractor from subletting his contract, it would be all right. </para>

This would be a far better opportunity for protecting the Minister from political influence than was provided in the case of the messenger boys. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferguson</inline> very properly points out that, whilst provision may be made in the contracts that contractors shall not sublet, there are facilities given by which the contracts are sublet. There are far more openings for political influence in the case of a powerful contractor who enters into a contract and wants to sublet it, probably at a premium, than there are in the case that we have already dealt with, of permitting messenger boys to continue in the department after they are IS years of age. On this I am entirely with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferguson.</inline> I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir William</inline> Zeal, who put the matter very clearly before the committee, will see that it is desirable that a Minister should have protection under the statute, so that if a contractor comes to him and says - "I cannot complete my sureties," the Minister will not be driven by the force of political influence to say - "I will allow you to sublet to so and so, and I will be content with a surety which is less than that previously arranged for." To protect himself I think that a provision, such as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferguson</inline> suggests, would be very useful. The Minister, in a case such as I have just indicated, would then be able to say - "There is no ' elasticity in this Act, and, therefore, I cannot do what you ask." I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferguson</inline> will press his amendment so as to secure immunity from political influence. </para>

                    <para>- 1 think that if the Postmaster-General undertakes to consider this matter and to make provision for it in the statute it will be quite sufficient. We do not want sweating in postal contracts any more than in contracts for manufactured goods, and I am sure that the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferguson</inline> are entitled to every consideration.

                    <para>- This clause appears to me to give very considerable powers to the Postmaster-General. Clause 14 requires the consent of the Governor-General to arrangements with the United Kingdom or any foreign country. Clause 15 gives the Postmaster-General, without any action of the Cabinet, unlimited power" with regard to all other contracts. Many of these contracts will involve very considerable sums of money. They will be larger than those referred to in clause 14,. which are hedged about by the consent of the Governor-General in Council. Clause- 15 provides - </para>

                        <para>- It has been almost the invariable practice for the Postmaster-General to enter into contracts. Clause 14 provides for arrangements being made with bodies outside our own country,, and that being so it is necessary that that should be done by the Governor-General in Council. Clause 15 refers to contracts made with persons, and the Postmaster-General, I think, is the proper authority to have that power. Of course the Postmaster-General in a matter of that sort means the Government. </para>

                        <para>- Has the honorable senator considered the enormous difficulty that will be involved in connexion with the signing of contracts, if nothing else, by the adoption of his amendment? The honorable senator is looking exclusively to cases of certain very big. mail contracts, and no doubt there are a few. They are only entered into, however, after very considerable deliberation, and the action of the Postmaster-General has the approval of the Government. Will <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir .</inline> Frederick Sargood consider for one moment the hundreds of mail contracts that are made every year <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> I do not know what they may be in Victoria,, but in Queensland they run into hundreds. I have had piles of them to sign, and surely each one of these contracts is not to be made by the Governor-General in Council, Many of them are mail contracts for Â£20, or Â£30, or Â£40 a year. </para>

                    - The clauses overlap. If we are going, to distinguish between' the authority possessed by the Governor-General in Council in entering into contracts in regard to these mails by land or sea, and desire to confide to him the power to enter into such contracts, we must have some limit to clause 15. Under the latter clause, the Postmaster-General has power actually to enter into these contracts irrespective of the Governor-General in Council altogether. There is no limitation whatever of his power under clause 15. The Postmaster-General can enter into contracts with Great Britain under that clause. It is in consequence of the overlapping of the powers here given that this confusion has arisen. I agree with the Postmaster-General as to the impossibility of the Governor in Council dealing with all these small, mail contracts throughout the Commonwealth. It is simply out of the question. We want, in the first place, to clearly state that the Governor-General should have sole power with regard to the important mail contracts with, foreign countries, and with the mother country. Under clause 15, the Postmaster-General and other people, who might be authorized by the Governor-General, would have power, to make these contracts. The confusion has arisen from the taking of a clause out of one particular Act and a clause out of another Act, without noticing that the powers given by the one overlap the other. We should limit the powers of the Postmaster-General under clause 15 to matters within the Commonwealth. That, I believe, is what was really intended. If we do this we may still- authorize the Deputy Postmasters-General throughout the States to deal with tenders as they have been doing in the past, accepting them and signing them on. behalf- of the Governor-General, who is the head of the Commonwealth in that respect. Some new words should be introduced in clause 15. Several proposals have been made in regard to it.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline>
                    desires to move something in respect to it, and I think it would be wise to postpone its consideration until we have gone through the rest of the Bill. The Postmaster-General would then be able to come down with such limitations of the powers conferred on him under clause 1 5 as would prevent them overlapping the powers of the Governor-General.

                    <para>- I do not see that there is very much in the objection raised by the Postmaster-General to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Frederick</inline> Sargood's amendment, because the Governor-General, as the clause stands, has the power to authorize some one in each State to sign a contract on his behalf. All that the amendment means is that it shall not be in the sweet will of the Postmaster-General to do exactly as he likes. The contract must be accepted by the Executive, and then they can authorize any one they choose to sign on their behalf. I think there is really no practicable difficulty. If my memory serves me right, the contracts in Western Australia, are accepted by the Executive. The Executive considers them, and accepts them, and then the Postmaster-General signs them. The actual acceptance of the contract is done by the Governor in Council. I think it is a desirable thing, that the power should be left to the Executive to accept contracts, which sometimes are very large and sometimes very small, rather than that it should be left, in the hands of the Postmaster-General. </para>

                <para class="block">I think that would meet the case as far as this point is concerned. It would prevent the two clauses being absolutely in conflict. With regard to the suggestion made about the postponement of clause 15, it would meet the case if it were possible, which it is not, for us to postpone clause 14 as well. That, however, would have to be a matter for recommittal now. These two clauses, 14 and 15, ought to be consolidated. Confusion has arisen from a desire to take from the different Post-office Acts in the various States those provisions which were intended to deal exhaustively with the whole matter of contracts. They are put into this Bill as though they dealt with separate subjects. Clause 15, taken from the New South Wales Act, was evidently intended to deal with all postal contracts whatsoever, and the language is sufficiently comprehensive to cover them all. In that respect <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford's</inline> criticism is well founded. Clause 14, taken from the Queensland Act, only deals with oversea and foreign mails ; but clause 15 would have dealt with them, too, except that it would have enabled the Postmaster-General to enter into contracts instead of the Governor-General. I rather agree that even under clause 14 it is unnecessary that the Governor-General should enter into contracts. The Postmaster-General is the Minister of State, and clause 15 should be so framed as to enable the Postmaster-General, who is the responsible Minister, and who is acting as the hand and voice and mind of the responsible Government of the day, to enter into these contracts. They are not autocratic. They are entered into by the Governor-General in his constitutional capacity as representing the Ministry. Therefore it will be well to consider whether clause 15 should not be adapted to deal with the whole system of contracts, relieving the Governor-General of the necessity of signing any oi them and making the entire provision one that would be effective. The observations made by the Postmaster-General seem to me to be conclusive. It would never do to ask the Governor-General to sign all mail contracts, whether immediately outside or within the boundaries of the Commonwealth. </para>

At the Berlin convention we entered into arrangements with the United Kingdom and with foreign countries with regard to the carriage of one another's mails. We have an agreement by which our mails are carried by those countries and their mails are carried by us. That is quite a different thing to a contract. The person who must negotiate and make arrangements with a power outside of ourselves, either Great Britain or any foreign country, must be the Governor-General. </para>

                        <para>- I accept the honorable senator's assurance upon that point. 1 think perhaps he is correct. The contract in that case is ' made by the British Postmaster-General, and we make arrangements with him by which, on the payment of a certain sum of money, our mails are carried for us. That is an arrangement that could he entered into by the Governor-General. </para>

                        <para>- The Premiers made the arrangements through the Agents-General. The contract was not entered into until we had agreed with the Imperial Government. They said they had certain offers ; those offers were, for the carriage of mails for a certain sum of money, and we were asked whether we would agree to the terms and conditions and what would we pay. For all practical purposes I say we entered into a contract. </para>

                        <para>- Unfortunately we are discussing the subject without having the exact facts before us. Honorable senators dan see the distinction between clauses 14 and 15. One refers to arrangements to be made with somebody outside of ourselves, and the other deals simply, with contracts. I think the suggestion made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> would have no effect because the contract is probably made here.  If we wanted to enter into a contract to cany mails to New Zealand it would be made here. </para>

                        <para>- Seeing that there is a considerable difference of opinion with regard to. the power which should be conferred on the Postmaster-General in the making of contracts, and that there is a likelihood of this clause clashing with clause 15, I have no objection to its postponement. The Postmaster-General struck a note that I think is worthy of some consideration. My intention with regard to this amendment is not merely to confine its operation to the manning of ships with white crews within the confines of the Commonwealth. I am anxious that the ships which cany our mails to Great Britain and elsewhere, shall be manned by people of our own colour. I do not want to circumscribe the operation of the amendment. I want, as I believe the people generally want, to carry ou.t a policy both on land and on sea, that companies who carry our mails shall employ white and not black men. At the same time, if there is no fear of the amendment being in any way jeopardized, I have no objection to the postponement of the clause. " The whole question can be considered in the meantime, and we can debate it fully afterwards. </para>

I do .not know what conclusion senators have come to on the subject, but I would like to point out that it is absolutely necessary that this power should be given. I think I can show the reason why, and if I can show that it is absolutely necessary, I shall have gone a long way to prove that we have the power under the Constitution. </para>

                    <para>- I do not intend in any way to thwart the Government in seeking to carry the clause, if they have so determined, in the form in which it appears. I do, however, intend to record my protest against it for more than one reason. First of . all, I do not think the Commonwealth has power to enact a clause of the kind, and I would ask that the Senate be careful in a matter which practically means encroaching very seriously upon State rights. Now, we are here to protect the rights of the States, and if they bear in mind the fundamental principle underlying the Constitution, perhaps honorable senators -will realize the doubt there is as to whether we have power to. make an arrangement of this kind. The several States joined together, and declared that in respect of various matters which they enumerated in section 51 of the Constitution, they would give the" control to the Commonwealth Parliament. With regard to everything else, the residue of control, that was to remain in the hands of the several States. The States in particular have been specially careful to retain absolute control of the railways, as they have retained all liability in regard to debts and loans contracted for the purpose of malting those railways. There was one exception made when it was provided in sub-section 32 of section 51 of the Constitution Act : - </para>

If this Parliament has the power to do it it is completely right, but in my opinion it has not the power to enact a clause of the kind. It is quite true that a tribunal is provided whereby differences of the kind may be settled, and if the States feel strongly about it, as I have reason to think some of them do, it will be competent for them to go to the High Court, when it is established, and to see whether this Parliament had the power to make a law of that kind. </para>

                        <para>- Precisely. If there is even any doubt about it, as I submit there is, then I think as a matter of i policy it is unwise for us to attempt to make this enactment. I am quite aware that the honorable senator in the chair cited the American case of McCulloch <inline font-style="italic">versus</inline> the State of Maryland, which deals with somewhat analagous questions. I do not say that the case is inconsistent in any way so far as he cited it, with the contention I am making. And what is more, we cannot attempt to follow slavishly any <inline font-style="italic">dicta</inline> in American cases. We have most carefully to see if the wording on which those cases have been decided is - in every respect similar. And while in many respects the American decisions have to be completely respected, on the other hand we are not fully aware of all the circumstances connected with the various cases. The point I am making is that we must not, without hesitation at all events, accept the <inline font-style="italic">dicta</inline> laid down in those cases, because we must see that the wording of the Constitution on which they were decided was completely analogous in every respect to the wording of our own Constitution. In my opinion we have not the power to make this enactment, having regard to the latter portion, which, actually says that we are going to impose on the State the expense and the responsibility of providing facilities for the purpose of carrying, out our work. </para>

                        <para>- If we have the power to do it, it is the proper thing to do. It is true that the value of the service rendered has to be ascertained by arbitration in the prescribed manner. My opinion is that it would be wise for the committee to omit the clause, but, on the other hand, there is no harm in putting in a clause enabling the Commonwealth to enter into the necessary bargains with the State. ' It may be suggested at once that the State may be most unreasonable, and may refuse to meet the Commonwealth. In that case the State is acting within its rights, but I cannot conceive it possible for a moment that a State which exists to serve the public in the same way as the Commonwealth does would act in any selfish, unfair, or unjust spirit in a business arrangement. I shall content myself with milking my protest. I. have not had an opportunity, I very much regret to. say, to further look up the matter and to secure any authorities in support of my contention. I do not know whether it is possible to obtain any authorities which would directly bear on the point, but nothing that has been said goes to indicate to me that my contention is wrong. </para>

                    <para>The implications from the provisions of a Constitution are sometimes exceedingly important, and have large influence upon its construction. In regard to the Constitution of the United States, the rule has been laid down that where a general power is conferred or duty enjoined, every particular power necessary for the exercise of the one or the performance of the other is also conferred. The same rule has been applied to the State Constitution, with an important modification by the Supreme Court of Illinois. " That other powers than those expressly granted may be, and often are, conferred by implication, is too well settled to be doubted. Under every Constitution the doctrine of implication must be resorted to in order to carry out the general grants of- power. A Constitution cannot, from its very nature, enter into a minute specification of all the minor powers naturally and obviously included in it, and flowing from the great and important ones which are expressly granted. It is therefore established as a general rule that when a Constitution gives a general power, or enjoins a duty it also gives by implication every particular power necessary for the exercise of the one or the performance of the other. The implication under this rule, however, must be a necessary, not a conjectural or argumentative one. And it is further modified by another rule, that where the means for the exercise of a grant of power are given, no other or different means can be implied as being more effectual or convenient." The rule applies to the exercise of- power by all departments and all officers, and will be touched upon incidentally hereafter. </para>

I have shown the reason why it is absolutely necessary that this power should be given. It was not so necessary before federation, for the reason that the same Government was running the mails and running the railways, and being the same party there could not possibly be any conflict. But now that we are dealing with the railways of six different States it is absolutely necessary, in order that justice shall be done to all, that there shall be power given to provide for the carriage of the mails over those railways, and for fixing the rate of remuneration to be paid to the States. The whole thing can be pretty well clinched by what has taken place during the last two or three days. I am not going to mention the particular State concerned, but one of the Deputy Postmasters-General received a letter from the Railways Commissioner in one of the States saying that after a certain date a certain sum of money would be required for the carriage of the mails, and asking him to see that the amount was ' provided on the Estimates. Seeing that the amount paid to the railways of that State had been increased only a short tune before by about-  </para>

                        <para>- lam not going to give myself away. The amount had been very considerably increased quite recently, and yet there was a demand made for an additional increase of about 25 or 30 per cent. Under my instructions a letter was written to the Commissioner asking him the reason why this large demand was made. Now, if we have not this power, what 'will Vie the result? We must have this power, and I very much regret if any legitimate objection can be taken to the language in which this clause is couched. It never occurred to me that any State would be so sensitive as to take exception to the terms employed in the drafting of such a clause. We must have this power, for the simple reason that if there is no means fixed of arranging for the carriage of the mails over the railways of the various States, then the Railways Commissioners may charge any price they like. That means that they may make the price perhaps prohibitive. In some cases, in order to carry the mails between States, it is necessary to carry them over the railways of an intervening State. What is going to happen if that particular State can charge any toll it likes <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> If that practice is once started, where will it stop ? If the Railways Commissioner of one State is going- to make a demand, there will be a general scramble on the part of the Railways Commissioners to balance their revenue and expenditure by making a very big demand on the postal service. It is perfectly clear, therefore, that the postal service could not be carried out without some such provision as this being inserted in the Bill. Under it there will be no desire to do an injustice to any State or to take an advantage of it unduly. It is simply a provision insuring that the mails shall be carried over the railways, and making the fairest possible arrangement for payment to the States. </para>

                    argument ; but inasmuch as he only proposes to utilize the excess service, where is the objection ? There is not a railway company in existence that would not jump at such a provision. If the Commonwealth Government attempted to impose on a State railway a condition that it should convey mails at a price that did not pay, then all our sympathies would be against the Commonwealth. But the Commonwealth Government merely proposes to ' make the

                <para class="block">States cany those mails and to pay them for it. It will pay them handsomely, too. In former times I know that a claim was brought against the department and a very large sum was asked for. the carriage of mails. But if such a provision as clause 17 were in operation there could be no difficulty at all. Again, there has been an attempt to introduce private railways into this State, and in some of the States there are already private railways, notably in Tasmania to Zeehan a.nd the Mount Lyell gold-fields. If such a provision as the one under discussion be not inserted these private railway companies may refuse to carry our mails. They should be bound by certain conditions, and as the Commonwealth Government proposes to pay the various States for the carriage of their mails, and to pay them handsomely, I can see no objection whatever to the provision. </para>

                    <para>- I quite agree with the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir William</inline> Zeal. I am under the impression, however, that the Bill does not provide for the carriage of mails over private railways. There is a private railway between Moama and .Deniliquin. I was a director of that company for many years. In the Bill authorizing the construction of that line, the Government, of course, inserted a provision that the company should carry the mails at reasonable rates, but that provision does not give the Commonwealth Government the some power as the State Government possesses'. It is therefore absolutely necessary to have some such clause as this inserted to enable the Government to make reasonable arrangements. Clause 18 specially guards against any undue advantage being taken of any State. Therefore I think that this provision should be passed as it stands.' Section 109 of the Commonwealth Constitution Act provides that where there is any inconsistency between a Commonwealth law and a State law the Commonwealth law shall override such State law. I do not think that we are overreaching the Commonwealth Act in any way, or that we are infringing upon State rights by passing this clause. I would like the Postmaster-General to look into the question of private railways. </para>

                    (South Australia). - It seems to me that the arguments in favour of the contention of the Postmaster-General upon this point are absolutely overwhelming. If it is, as hinted at by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best,</inline>
                    that this case may be eventually taken to our Federal Court for decision, I am sure that that Court will give a similar decision to that given by Chief Justice Marshall in the United States, and that the same law will govern this Commonwealth as governs that country. That decision is a sound common sense one. If we give any particular body legislative power to do certain things, we give them power to do everything necessary for the carrying out of the powers we have granted them. When we are told that Parliament has the power to make laws for the good government of the Commonwealth, &#60;fcc., there is not the slightest doubt that full powers were intended and are given. Therefore anything we may require to do for the purpose of carrying on the postal work, we have power to do in reason. It surprises me entirely that
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline>
                    should have agreed only a few minutes ago to pass a clause giving the Postmaster-General power to have his mails carried over jetties without paying one cent for that privilege, and yet that he should grumble now that we take power to provide that the mails shall be carried over the railways of the Commonwealth. He has swallowed the camel and is now straining at the dreadful gnat. He swallowed the provision that Parliament shall have the right of the carriage of mails over State jetties and State wharfs as well as private jetties and private wharfs without the payment of a cent to anybody, and yet he never called attention to the fact of how utterly unconstitutional that thing was.

                        <para>- It is a singular thing that the honorable senator did not find out that the other was illegal, but it did not suit his particular purpose at the time. Yet the honorable senator voted not only for an illegal thing, but for a highly improper thing in a sense, because we are making use of people's property without paying for it. In this case, however, we make provision for a fair and honest payment for services rendered. If any State does not come to terms, we have a provision for referring the matter to arbitration. I not only agree with the policy, .but with the absolute necessity for -it. The point made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> with regard to the control of the railways for transport and military purposes, to the effect that it was not intended by the Commonwealth Constitution that the Postal authorities should have the power to run their mails over the railways of the various States, falls to the ground when we consider that the control of those railways for military purposes is absolute control of them in every sense. The Commonwealth Government in that case will determine when, the trains shall run,' and as to the stoppage of the traffic. In fact, the section means taking away from the States in the circumstances indicated all their power over the railways. The railways are simply to be used for the Commonwealth, and the Commonwealth may dictate to the States for the time being. Therefore, there is nothing in the argument of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best.</inline></para>

I voted for the retention of clause 13 as I shall vote for this clause, because the Bill without these two clauses would be-absolutely useless. I shall vote for it for another reason. If it is to be questioned at all, the sooner it is questioned the better. By including this power, or supposed power, in the Bill, it will. give an opportunity for any one of the States to at once test the matter before the High Court. Unless the power be put in the Bill, then, clearly, the point cannot be brought before the Court so speedily. I trust that, when once disposed of, it will be acted upon immediately, and then we shall lose no time in learning whether the States acquiesce in the power or not. If they do not acquiesce, then the point can be settled before the High Court.

                        <para>- I think I can: The clause as it stands does not cover the case of private railways. We in Tasmania have a number of private railways which, by the terms of their charter, may perhaps be bound to carry mails under certain sections in the enabling Acts by which the promoters were empowered to construct and run them. The clause under discussion, however, would only apply to the principal officer of a railway department controlled by a State. If that officer is bound t'o carry the mails, what is the position in regard to the private companies upon which the Commonwealth must depend in Tasmania ? We have the Emu Bay Railway Company, the Mount Lyell Railway Company, the North Mount Lyell Company, and other companies there. The clause should be more comprehensive. It' should empower the Postmaster-General to enter into suitable arrangements with the officers having control of the railways in the various States, whether they be State or private railways, for the purpose of carrying the mails, on paying a proper and adequate compensation for the carriage of them. Why need we put it in the Bill that the principal railway official in every State " shall" carry the mails if we have not the power to enforce that provision ? I do not think we have the power to -enforce it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> has referred to American authorities, upon provisions somewhat analogous to these, and you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> referred on the second reading to authorities which you gathered from some American reports. I do not think that those authorities, however, really bear upon the point which is-now in issue. It is undoubtedly, a fact that 'the conferring of powers upon a particular body does necessarily carry with it all those subsidiary powers required to enable it to put them into effect. If the powers conferred on the Commonwealth were powers of utilizing railways for the carriage of mails - and the absence of that provision is a defect in the Constitution Act - if that defect had been supplied and there had been a provision enabling the Commonwealth Government to utilize the railways for the purpose of carrying mail matter, then the dictum laid clown ' here, that the conferrence of powers upon a body necessarily carries with it the subsidiary rights, would apply. Here we simply have a post and telegraph department transferred. We have not a railway department transferred to us, and we know that we are going to use this service for the State. But at this stage of our existence, when there is some doubt as to the powers of the Commonwealth in regard to matters of this kind, why should we, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Frederick</inline> Sargood invites in? to do, precipitate a constitutional difficulty -or constitutional litigation, and create immediately a necessity for the establishment of the Federal High Court. Why should we do this when we could achieve the same result by putting in an enabling clause in this Bill empowering the . Postmaster-General to contract with State railways and private railways to carry the mails <inline font-style="italic">1</inline></para>

                        <para>- I do not anticipate that even constitutional litigation will be likely to eventuate from the passage of this clause. It is only a matter of form rather than a matter of substance. The necessity for the clause everybody, agrees with, and there is nothing in clause '16, coupled with clause 17, -which is likely to make the Commonwealth press hardly upon any State. But, it is a matter of form, and, representing as we do the several States, and being here to guard-State rights, we should hesitate before we simply arrogate to ourselves, in my opinion, the right to dictate, even for the purpose of running a transferred service, in what particular way the officials in a department that is not transferred shall act, so that we shall be able to carry out our work. </para>

                        <para>- Lt is not my intention to harass the Government in regard to this matter. All that I say is that we should be careful to see that we effectuate what we desire 'to bring about by couching the language of the clause in such a form that it will not give rise to the .litigation referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Frederick</inline> Sargood, and which will be clearly within the powers conferred upon us under the Constitution.  </para>

                    <para>- Honorable senators who object to this clause have already accepted the position that, whether it be an interference with State rights or not, the Postmaster-General should have power to use the State Government wharfs, piers, landing places, and ferries, and without any payment at all. Honorable senators who are now arguing for State rights have accepted that provision without a word. Now they object' even to the Postmaster-General having the peremptory right to the use of railways. </para>

                        <para>-Senator Keating has already accepted the principle that the State Government wharfs can be utilized at the discretion of the Postmaster-General without compensation not merely for the carriage of mails, but for the landing of materials for construction. I fail to see therefore how the honorable and learned senator, and others who share his views, can stand up now for State rights when they allowed, them to be encroached upon in this way. It appears to me, if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best's</inline> proposal has anything in it all, that we could strike out clauses 16 and 17, because clause 15 would practically cany out all that is necessary.

                <para>SenatorCHARLESTON.- What I am contending for is that, seeing we have already granted the Postmaster-General power as to State wharfs, powers must be given to him in regard to this matter, commensurate with the duties to be performed. In view of the fact that the six States have entered into a compact, and have decided that the one central authority created by themselves shall do a certain thing, then that carries with it also the right and the power of the Commonwealth to give effect to it. </para>

                    I do not think, there can possibly be any difficulty arising out of -the amendment that has been moved. No doubt it is very much more respectful. No doubt it removes any irritation that might be felt at the Federal Parliament dictating to the States a course which is questionable Now, what is the practical difficulty? We ask the Postmaster-General to make arrangements with the' Parliaments of the various States. Would it be possible for the Parliaments of those States to remain unreasonable ? If they did so, the whole of the carriage of their mails would be stopped, and the outcome would be that the people in the various States would get no mails carried.

We do not need to go to a legal decision for that dictum. It is in the Constitution Act, and the real question is - is the provision necessary? How can any senator say that, where there is in existence a good roadway or a line of steamers trading from place to place, it is necessary to carry mails by rail? It may be expedient and' desirable and more convenient for the Postmaster-General to carry his mails by rail rather than by steamer, but it could not be argued that it was necessary. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable senator does not know where Bunbury is I feel sorry for his knowledge of Australia. It is the place where the man who has ruled Western Australia for so many years was born. Passing from the historical significance of Bunbury, I would say that there are steamers running daily and weekly from Bunbury to Perth. Could it be urged, therefore, that it was necessary for the Postmaster - General to carry his mails over the railway from Bunbury to Perth ? Certainly not necessary, although it might be more ' convenient. Does the case which my honorable friend has quoted, say that the Postmaster-General shall do that which is more convenient. No ; he can only compel that which is necessary. Sub-section (39) of section 51 of the Constitution Act says- </para>

Surely it is manifest that there may be many cases in which it is not necessary to carry mails by rail. Therefore I contend that when we are on this very debatable ground, we should approach the States in a more conciliatory fashion than they are approached by this clause,' which says : - "We shall make, you do this, whether you like it or not." As to the practical difficulty - is there a State Parliament that dare refuse to make reasonable terms ? Where can be the danger that the State of Western Australia will refuse to do that which is reasonable for the Postmaster-General ? </para>

                        <para>- I wish to say a few words in reply to the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ewing,</inline> who, I see, is not in the Chamber, before I speak to the amendment. He has taken up the position that we have no right to insist upon this particular means of carrying the mails, so long as we have any other means available. My contention is that for all practical purposes the railways are the only means by which the mails can be carried. It is very true to say that there are roads to most places, but at the present time ordinary travellers will not use the roads ; they must have the railways. As honorable senators know, ever since the reign of Edward I., every effort has been made to facilitate the despatch of mails ; to hasten them in every way ; to keep relays of horses on the roads, in order to insure that there should be no delay, and one good old English word, post-haste, is derived from that period. Every effort has been made from that time by all kinds of means to accelerate the conveyance of the mails, and it seems an extraordinary thing here in the reign of Edward TIL, to' be told that we cannot avail ourselves of the railways in the way proposed by this clause, so long as any other means of transit are available. If an honorable senator wanted to go to Albury to-morrow, it would be of no use to tell him that he could go by road. I believe it would . be almost possible for him to go by water. If -he were asked how he would proceed to get to Albury he would say " go by rail, there is no other way of going." For all practical purposes that answer would be perfectly correct. There is no other means of getting to Albury for the purpose of conveying mails except by railway. And if we are not able to take our mails over the railway, then practically the mails are so much delayed that it would almost amount to a stoppage. But the authority that has been so much quoted in this debate is dead against the contention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ewing. His</inline> contention, it will be remembered, is that we cannot insist upon having the services of the railway for the carriage of our mails, so long as there is any other means of transit available to us. </para>

                        <para>- That is perfectly clear from the terms of the clause. If they run a train we claim the right to put our mails on board and pay them a fair price for the services performed. With regard to the amendment, I should be very sorry indeed if there was anything in the Bill, or anywhere else, calculated to offend the proper sensibilities of any State. But I think there is, and always will be, a very great difficulty in introducing the phrases of polite conversation into an Act of Parliament. In an Act cf Parliament we want in the shortest and most concise way to express the intention of its framers. I fail to see, if that is done, how any cause of offence can possibly be given. But I have thrown out a challenge again and again. I have said "if you object to the particular terms that I have used, give me some other terms, always provided that it leaves the intention of the Act clear." In answer perhaps to the challenge I get this amendment by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs.</inline> But it will destroy the clause altogether if it is put in, whether it were in the original form that the Postmaster-General is to be empowered to make arrangements with the Parliament, or in the altered form that he shall have power to make arrangements with the executive authority. Let me show how this question is likely to arise in a concrete form. When the railways and postal services were both in the hands of the Government of a State, it was simply a question of the Postmaster-General wanting to give as little as possible, and the Minister of Railways wanting to get as much as possible, and the Cabinet coming down and saying " put in Â£30,000 or Â£40,000 or Â£60,000." But now we are dealing with six States we must, in justice to all of them, see that we are not paying an exorbitant price to any. Suppose a commissioner for railways says he wants Â£100,000 for the carriage of the mails, and I say I think Â£75,000 is sufficient. Under this clause, if we cannot agree, the matter goes to arbitration, but still the mails are" being carried. If that provision is not retained, or if the clause is altered as proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs,</inline> the commissioner for railways can say, " If you do not pay up the Â£100,000 I shall not carry the mails." Suppose the Postmaster-General sends down the mails, and the railway commissioner goes on carrying them, he will keep on debiting the Federal Government with that Â£100,000. It is absolutely in his power to fix the amount, and he says, " I fix the amount at Â£100,000, and you simply must pay it?" How is the clause helped by this amendment? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> says that in that case the Postmaster-General is to have power to make arrangements with the Executive authority, that is to say the Postmaster-General goes to the Executive authority, and says, "Your Railway Commissioner wants to charge me Â£100,000, but I think Â£75,000 is enough." What is the Executive authority going to do ? It will Stand by its railway commissioner, so that it does not help us a bit. </para>

                        <para>- There is a dead-lock. Still they will say " We stand by our commissioner and insist on Â£100,000." I do not mind what terms are used, but I hope that the terms will be as polite as may be, so long as we do not give up the most important position, that we must have the right of saying; that the mails shall be carried. We provide the fairest possible means of fixing the amount of remuneration, but it is not to rest with the railway commissioner, or with the Executive authority in any State to say - "We fix the price and you must pay it, else the mails will not be carried." I cannot support the amendment. </para>

                    (Queensland). - I do not think that the argument used by the Postmaster-General carries much weight; for the reason that if, by any mischance a railway/ commissioner is so ill-advised as to do this: kind of thing, any proposal on his part to submit to arbitration would naturally be adopted at once, as provided in the clause. I would ask the Minister whether in the case of a railway commissioner refusing to carry the mails because he is not getting a sufficient price, or in the case of a refusal on his part to go to arbitration, and the consequent irritation and loss to the people of the State,, the Parliament would not immediately rise to the occasion and o impel the railway commissioner to come to terms ?

                        <para>.- We do not wish to be passing laws merely to provoke litigation. I find in the 39 articles embodied in section 51 of the Constitution Act that there is a special provision in subsection (32) which gives the Common wealth control over railways in respect of transport for military purposes. If it had been intended by the framers of the Constitution that, this authority should be given over the railways of the different States, it certainly would have been embodied in the Constitution. I go further and say that the fact that military purposes are specifically set down as being a proper authority for .the Commonwealth to possess, absolutely as a matter of law excludes the right of 'the Commonwealth to any other control of the railways. </para>

                    <para>- It is very nearly time that we left law alone and exercised a little bit of common sense. The more legal opinion we have had up to the present time the more confused we poor laymen seem to get. As far as the Senate is concerned, I think that in a short time legal opinion will be considered nonsense. We have one honorable senator getting up and declaring - "We have no power to do this." Another honorable senator from the other side of the House exclaims - "Just look at the latter part of the clause where the States are asked to provide something." The States are asked to provide nothing that the Commonwealth is not willing and does not expect to pay for. To illustrate this I will call attention to clause 63, which compels the masters of vessels to provide lockers. Why should we dare to do this? There is nothing in section 51 of the Constitution providing for that. Why, then, should we do it? The answer is that we are going to pay for it. In this particular matter, too, we are going to pay. Clause 17 makes all th provision that is really necessary and 'it seems to me that some senators have an exalted idea of their position in respect to the several States which they represent.' They have lost sight of the fact that they are here - even although they are called State representatives - as representatives of the Commonwealth pf Australia. Their first duty is to consider the rights, requirements, and interests of the Commonwealth, and after that, the necessities of the States which they represent. They are here to see that no one State imposes on another, and this very clause will prevent anything of that kind occurring ? Here we have a power vested in the Postmaster-General' in connexion with the conveyance of mails. If Western Australia, South Australia, or Queensland likes to become stubborn and refuse to do anything in the matter, would not that be to the injury of all the rest of the States - to the injury of the Commonwealth - and are we to put it within the power of one State to interrupt the whole machinery of government in connexion with postal matters ? We ought to give exclusive power, but still we ought to provide that ample payment should be made. In reference to the latter portion of the clause, I would ask what does the expense to which the Railways Commissioner is put in providing conveniences matter, if these tilings are taken into consideration, either in the arrangements between the Postmaster-General and that officer, or in the arbitration court, which settles the dispute afterwards ? I hope honorable senators will lose sight of these very grave .State interests and look more to the interests of the Commonwealth, which .are the interests of the whole of Australia, and act sensibly by supporting the clause. </para>

                        <para>- Perhaps they are not, but I was just going to illustrate how legal luminaries shed their light in different ways. So far as I can gather from the Constitution, the complete control of the postal and telegraph systems of the various States have been handed over to the Commonwealth Government. I think that carries with it the right to every necessary facility for administering that special department. Some honorable senators seem to think that the Postmaster-General before he can run his mails through the . different States must go to the Governments of those States and say - "Will you allow the Commonwealth Government to use your railways for the carriage of mails through this State <inline font-style="italic">t "</inline> I say that that is a position which the Commonwealth Government should never be placed in. The Commonwealth Government is supreme in this matter. The States have voluntarily handed over the postal and telegraph departments to their control. They form one of the 39 articles of the confession of faith. I do not anticipate any trouble such as some honorable senators seem to be so much afraid of. Several honorable senators have asked - "How can we .enforce this, and how can we enforce that?" I do not know that we can enforce anything. If some of the States had refused to enter the Federation we could not have compelled them to do so. It appears 'to me that the good faith which exists between the different States of the Commonwealth ought be sufficient to carry us over any difficulty of this kind, if difficulty there be. I do not anticipate any difficulty except that some of the Railways Commissioners apparently contemplate making a raid on the funds of the Commonwealth. They want to get much more for the carriage of the mails than they have hitherto received. Anything of that kind, I think, should be strenuously resisted. The Constitution gives the Postmaster-General the right to every facility for carrying the mails, subject of course to payment therefor, and that payment is to be settled in case of a difference between the Postmaster-General and any State, by arbitration. The position seems to be this : that the Postmaster-General can command the use all our railways irrespective of price, but the price that shall be paid is either to be <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> matter of mutual agreement or has to be settled by arbitration. What is all the trouble about ? Some honorable senators seem to think that by inserting the word "shall," we shall hurt the feelings of some people in certain States. Surely we are men, and not children. We intend to carry on the business of the Commonwealth, I imagine, in a common-sense fashion. Every one knows that the people of the Commonwealth will not tolerate for a single moment any interruption in the mail service. The idea that the Railways Commissioner of any State, or any Government even, would take it upon himself or itself to stop the carriage of mails for any reason whatever, seems to me to be utterly preposterous. There is one thing that seems to me of the utmost importance. It is this : that not only should the Commonwealth Government be supreme with regard to the administration of this special department, according to the Constitution, but it should also be supreme according to fact. We have had many different opinions on the question from all sides of the House. We have had legal opinions - the legal effect of this and the legal effect of that. Let us try now to drive the legal aspect of things out of the matter altogether and to apply a little common sense to it. </para>

                    <para>- I will not occupy the time of the committee many minutes. I only rise because it appears to me from the remarks of the last honorable speaker that this is apparently a fight between lawyers and common sense. I may be allowed to say that I consider the definition of law given by Edmund Burke to be the true one - namely, that it is " the crystallization of the common sense of ages." There cannot be the slightest doubt in any one's mind that this is a very useful and very expedient clause. I do not think the difference is in reference to whether the clause in its present form is good or bad. It is a question of whether it is legal or not. At first I was very much impressed by the arguments adduced during the second reading. It did then seem to me' that, as we have a written Constitution limiting our powers, and as the railways, except for naval and military purposes, are excluded from those subjects upon which we can pass laws, we were going outside our constitutional rights in doing' anything which interfered with the control of the railways other than for naval and military purposes. It also seemed to me that any control is a limitation upon the exercise of rights ; that it is the right of a railway company, or of a railway department, to charge whatever fares they wish, and that therefore it is a limitation upon the exercise of that light to say " You shall charge the rates that are pleasing to me, and the rates that may seem fit to the Treasurer." On further consideration I have been converted from that view. I am perfectly satisfied now that the right here given is one incidental to the carrying out of the postal service. We must clothe the Postmaster-General with all the powers that are necessary, and one of the most immediate powers is the right to control, as it seems fit, the various carrying instruments throughout the country. I shall therefore vote with the Government for the retention of this clause. </para>

                    <para>- There was no subject, I think, at the time when the drafting committee of the Convention were engaged' in drawing up the Bill, that caused more anxiety than the question of whether precise words or general words should be used. It is perfectly clear that our Constitution was framed to a large extent by analogy with the American Constitution, and we came to the conclusion that the broader and more general the words used the greater would be their scope ; that if we once became too specific we should have a loophole left for an ingenious person to creep out of. We therefore assumed that the analogy of the American decisions would be followed, and that broad general words would cover everything. And so we advised the Convention, and so the Convention passed the Constitution in its present form, perfectly satisfied that these words covered everything, whether public railways or private railways or any other means of carriage. We thought, to use the expression of some honorable senators, that it would give the Parliament a general "commandeering" power. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, all of them. The words give Parliament the power - if you please to call it so - the commandeering power. I do not object to the term. The broadest words that could possibly be used are the words which are used, and if they can govern the public railways they can govern private railways. Although at the time of the passing of the American Constitution steam power had not come into effect, and railways were not in existence as now, the principles are eternally the same, whatever the means of carriage may be. To avoid the differentiation we knew might arise from the use of more precise terms we used general terms. The Convention adopted them, on the same understanding, and the Imperial Government passed the Act on the same understanding : that those general words covered everything, and gave the power of commanding every means of locomotion, for the purpose of carrying our mails, that happen to be at our disposal. I am entirely with the Government. </para>

                        <para>- That would be a very important element in deciding what would be paid for the carriage of the mails. Where a private company has agreed to carry the mails of the State free, it would, I take it, receive a mere nominal payment. In any case, if that company were not satisfied with a nominal payment, I should think that at arbitration the fact that the company had agreed to carry the mails free would be taken into consideration, and it would not get more than a nominal payment. It is not quite clear to me because that right was reserved under the State Act that the Federal Parliament could insist on the mails being carried free. It would be open for a private company to contend that their contract was to carry the mails of the State free, and they might be able to contend that, owing to federation, the expansion of business, and so on, the mails were heavier than they would have been if federation had not taken place. There may not be much in that, but they could put forward the contention that we should not have power to place ourselves, as it were, in the position of the State, and insist upon the free carriage of mails. </para>

                    <para>- This Bill provides for arbitration, but if we have the right to interfere with their mode of carrying on business, and to say - "You shall carry these mails whether you like it or not," be it public company or private individuals, you can say to these individuals - " You shall carry them free," just as you can say - "You shall carry them for reward." I should like to point out to the Senate what it is really doing. The case that my honorable friend has cited says that the Government has the right to the use of the roads for the purpose of carrying the mails, but no case on earth has ever said that the Government can come to me and demand my vehicles for the carriage of the mails. If I have a line from Kalgoorlie to Kanowna, or anywhere else, what power is there under the Constitution for the Commonwealth Parliament to come to me and say, " Carry the mails of" the Government because it is convenient that the Government should have their mails carried by your vehicles"? The Postmaster-General must draw a distinction between the power to use the territory of the State - namely, the roads - for the purpose of carrying mails and the power to compel private individuals to carry mails. Because, if we can say to a railway company, "carry the Commonwealth mails," we can say to the person driving his own trap, "carry the Commonwealth mails." I see no distinction whatever in principle. </para>

                <para class="block">There is no doubt that the Commonwealth has power to use the territory of the State and the public roads of the State for the conveyance of its mails in the Post-office, own vehicles, and that is the total extent to which the case cited by my honorable friend goes. But nowhere can he get any authority or case which shows that the Commonwealth Parliament has been given any control over the actions of citizens, and can say to those citizens - " You are travelling in the direction in which we want our mails to go, and you shall carry the mails of this Commonwealth." There is no power contained in the Bill which gives the Postmaster-General any authority to do this, and I think it is extremely unwise for the Senate, or the House of Representatives, to presume to do to individuals and to States that which we have no power to do. Can my honorable friend the Postmaster-General show us that he has power to come to me when driving a cart along the road from one place to another and say "you shall cany my mails " ? </para>

                        <para>- The distinction. I make is this, and it seems a perfectly clear one. A man is driving a cart along the road. We do not claim that we can compel Wm to carry the mails, for the simple reason that we can run our own mail-carts. The reason of this special power is .that the railways exercise certain powers which are in the nature of a monopoly, and which prevents a similar service being carried out on those lines. We cannot run a train of our own over the -railways, and therefore we claim that those railways shall carry our mails. With regard to the carriage of mails by road, we do not want to commandeer the carts of any one when we can run carts of our own. </para>

                        <para>- I think that gives the Postmaster-General the necessary power. As regards private railways, I understand that in return for the concession given to them they agree to carry the mails. I was under the impression that when the Commonwealth took over the Postal department it took over those rights. If that is so, I do not see that there is any room for a d difference of opinion on-the matter. I hold that the Commonwealth has all the necessary rights and privileges handed over to them when carrying out the work of the department. Therefore, as far as I can see, we are only wasting time and debating a thing which every one sees very clearly. </para>

He would not be controlled .as to the number of vehicles he might use. </para>

                    It struck me that something more was necessary than a simple mention of the word arbitration, and perhaps it would be as well to put in the clause that arbitration shall be in accordance' with the laws of the State.

                        <para>- I have some doubt whether we can do that. In any case, it seems to me that the term "-His Majesty's mails " is open to a misconstruction. The same term may have been used in the State Act, but the mails referred to are the State and not Federal mails. The Act of Parliament provides that they shall cany Her Majesty's mails free, which would mean the State mails. If w? use the words " His Majesty's mails"' in this Bill, it means the mails of the Commonwealth, and the owner of the private railway might very well say - " I did not agree at the time I got these powers from Parliament, and made this railway, to carry the Commonwealth mails." </para>

                        <para>- It might or might not be. He might argue that since federation the mails had become more heavy, and that that was not what he contracted to do. I think the better way is to leave the clause as it stands, because if a contract of that character has been made with the State to carry the mails free, then a mere nominal payment, I should say, would be sufficient. If the contractor is not satisfied with that, and wants to arbitrate, I should think any sensible men acting as arbitrators would say - " You agreed to cany the mails of the State at the time you got your powers, and it is no very great hardship now for you to be required to carry His Majesty's mails for the Commonwealth at a small remuneration." </para>

                    (Queensland). - I would like to point out that these private railway companies in all cases agreed to carry .His Majesty's mails at that particular time, and having received a concession from the State, they agreed to carry the mails for all time. There would have been the same increase in the mails of a State without federation as there will be with it. . But undoubtedly the private railway owners expected that Her Majesty's mails would increase as time went on. What I object to is opening the door to any private railway company to consider that it is entitled to get a payment from the Commonwealth for carrying the mails, and perhaps dragging the case into the arbitration court and putting the Federal Government to considerable expense. I am sure that the terms used in private railway Acts are the terms which I have adopted in my amendment, inasmuch as when Her Majesty passed away His Majesty took her place.

                    <para>- I can tell the Postmaster-General that I have not very much faith in arbitration. My experience of arbitration is that it is against the Government. The arbitrator for a company always stretches his conscience to the utmost of his ability in favour of his client, and the arbitrator for the Government is generally told to act fairly, and he does not stretch his conscience in the other direction very much, and when the umpire is called in he Says "Split the difference," but in the splitting of the difference the Government always gets the worst of it. Under the conditions mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> there is no doubt that these companies agreed to carty Her Majesty's mails, and had a concession given to them on the faith that they were going to perform some service to the State. If anybody is to be paid it should be the State that granted them the concession, and certainly not those who made the railway. They agreed to carry Her Majesty's mails for all time, I understand, and in many cases free. The Government gave them certain rights and privileges, and took as part <inline font-style="italic">quid pro quo</inline> the right of sending their mails free of charge ; and if any one can come upon the Commonwealth for the cost of carrying these mails it is the State Government, and. certainly not those individuals. I would certainly a great deal sooner pass the amendment as proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> than leave it to arbitration, because arbitration certainly means that the Commonwealth will get the worst of it. </para>

                    <para>- I agree that with companies that agreed to carry mails free for the privilege of building a railway, it is right enough; but there will be great changes, and there are changes going on now whereby lines that are now only carrying a bag or two may carry tons upon tons of mails. In my mind's eye I can see great changes taking place within a period of years in the way in which mails are to be carried across this continent. It would hardly be fair to make a private company carry tons and tons of mails where now they carry only perhaps a couple of small bags. It is not right to make a hard and fast rule. I agree with the principle of the .amendment, but I hold that if we make a hard and fast rule we may unwittingly be doing an injury. </para>

                    but he has made a very great mistake to my way of thinking. He says that some of these companies that gob a concession from the State Governments, and agreed to carry the mails for nothing, only contemplated carrying a bag or two, but now it might have tons and tons of mails to carry. Does not every honorable senator know that when any such company has tons and tons of mails to carry instead of a bag or two, its profits have gone up 100 per cent., and it is reaping 100 times the advantage it reaped when it was. only carrying a bag or two of mails?'

                    said that we may have tons and tons of mails going across the continent.

                        <para>- I have been in i good many places and seen a good many of these railways, but I know that not one of them is of an Inter-State character. They are all railways run from a place to some mining settlement or something of that description, and if there never had been a federation the same likelihood of development or retrogression would have been possible as there is now. Some of these mining establishments will go on and prosper ; some of them will retrograde ; but that will have nothing to do with the Commonwealth. As these lines are in a particular State, and will only have to carry State mails between certain localities in that State, then where does the injustice of the amendment come in? And as regards the increase of the mail matter, I consider that the company can well afford to carry an increased quantity, because that would be the greatest sign of prosperity. </para>

That is not so in every case I can assure him. What <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> had in his mind, and what I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator .Higgs</inline> had in his mind, is a particular private railway in the north of Queensland". What <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> is contemplating is the possibility at some future time of the Federal Government making an arrangement to continue that line perhaps to the Gulf, and thereby making this section, which is a private line and simply used now for mining purposes a section of a trunk line. </para>

The concession that was granted to them by the State, and what they give the State in return, the Commonwealth has a right to. As

                    <para>- I think that the private railway companies referred to are entitled to every reasonable consideration. The question to me seems to be this, these .companies have agreed to carry the mails free as a return for the concession .they got. An Act of Parliament is now passed which does not of necessity increase the mails, but changes the ownership of the mail service. And are these companies to be released from their' contract merely because the contracting party is given another 'name? That is -what it seems to me to come to. While I am therefore of opinion that the companies ought not to bo allowed the opportunity of obtaining payment for doing that which they originally agreed to do for nothing, still it seems to me that to interfere with them in the way which is suggested by the amendment would be very dangerous. The concession that was given to these companies was to carry the State mails free. If there are no State mails to carry henceforward, the legal position clearly is that they are released from that portion of the contract. There is no justice in that, I admit ; but there may be a legal difficulty. I therefore think that what has been said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> is the proper way of dealing with it - to allow the arbitration clause to deal with it. No doubt it is subject to this difficulty - that if we leave it entirely to be determined by arbitration, the lawyer who goes before the arbitration board will say - "You must not take into account when determining the amount of money to be paid the fact that these companies agreed to carry the mails free. You must not take that into account, because the amount to be paid is to be determined by arbitration, and it is not relevant to that inquiry to show that this particular company had agreed to cany the State mails free." Therefore I think that to leave it . to arbitration alone would not meet the end which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> has in view. I think we might provide that the arbitrator should take into consideration existing contracts in determining the amount to be paid. That would really effect the same purpose as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> has in view, with the justice of which I entirely agree. </para>

                    <para>- I suggest particularly to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> that he should give the Postmaster-General the details of his proposed clause, and that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> should undertake to consider this matter hereafter. I say this in all good faith, because if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> can make out a case I am prepared to support him. But- we have been discussing this Bill from half -past 2 o'clock till 9 o'clock, aird we have only dealt with a few of its clauses.

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator HIGGS</inline>
                    (Queensland). - I do not agree with the proposal that this question should be considered hereafter, especially when we have spent so long in arriving at our present state of mind. I have here a volume containing the Acts passed by the Queensland Parliament last year. There is, for example, the Callide Creek Railway Act. The company obtained certain privileges and concessions which some of -us thought were worth a considerable sum. Clause 32 , of that -Act states that the company shall carry upon its railway free of charge and with reasonable despatch all such persons and mails as the commissioner from time to time requires to be conveyed upon the public service, and shall allow to all members of the several Parliaments of Australia the same privileges of travelling over the said railway free, as are enjoyed by them on other railways. The same clause appears in the Glasford Creek Tramway Act, and also in the Mount Garnet Company's Railway Act. If we do not insert a provision at the end of the clause prohibiting a company from getting any payment for the carriage of mails they will make a charge, and this charge, I think, will be settled against the Government. If honorable senators had been in the Queensland Parliament at the time, they would have seen a very powerful opposition contending for days against giving these private railway companies power to construct railways at all. The provision I have mentioned was one of the several advantages advocated by the promoters of these lines as a reason why we should abandon the principle of State ownership of railways. I hope the Senate will carry the amendment.

                        <para>- In clause 91 regulations are employed for quite a number of tilings. The word "schedules" in clause 19 is, I think, a misprint. " Regulations " is the term employed for certain purposes in Victoria. The Governor-General in Council would make regulations for certain purposes, and then we provide that these regulations shall be laid before the Houses of Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot see anything wrong with it. If we call this a regulation, the question arises as to what power we have to make regulations. The only power to make regulations is contained in clause 91. I propose that the fixing of rates shall not be done by regulation. The Governor-General can fix the rates. The rates, when fixed, are embodied in a schedule, and the schedule is laid upon the table of the House. </para>

At all events, it is desirable that we should have uniformity in our language, which is what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Frederick</inline> Sargood desires. I should hesitate to insert the word "regulation" in this clause if we were not dealing with the matter also in clause 91. If we deal here comprehensively and finally with the subject .of rates, then there is no necessity whatever to insert any reference to it in clause 91. </para>

                    <para>- The point is as to how the rate should be fixed. I understand that under clause 91 rates of a certain kind are fixed by regulation, and it would be well to have uniformity. If before the word " fix " the words "by regulation" were inserted it would really be done by regulation. Then in sub-clause (2), instead of saying " schedule of such rates " the use of the words "the regulations fixing such fees" would carry out what we desire. " Schedule " is rather an inappropriate expression. </para>

                    SARGOOD (Victoria).- I do not like to oppose the Postmaster-General, but I am very anxious that whatever we send from the Senate shall stand examination in another place. That is really why I would strongly urge the Senate to adopt my suggestion. It has always appeared to me to be the usual plan to state that the Governor in Council may pass regulations, may make regulations for so and so, and then to provide subsequently that these regulations shall be laid upon the table of the House.

                <para class="block">That is the provision which is made with regard to regulations. What we are doing now is fixing the rate of postage, and instead of making it a regulation subject to the same conditions as are required in a case of regulations, we have put it thus. That is the reason why I want to make it clear now that it is not a regulation within the meaning of the Act. Under clause 19 we prescribe exactly the procedure that must be taken, for the reason that it is not going to be a regulation within the meaning of the Act. ..Part 5, clause 91, prescribes what is to be done in the case of regulations. If we were to adopt exactly the same course in regard to rates as we adopt in regard to other regulations, then it would not be necessary, to say anything about rates being laid upon the table of the House for a certain time and becoming law, if no objection be raised by one House or the other.. We prescribe the particular method of dealing with the question of rates. </para>

                    or some other honorable senator who has a preference for this " scaley " term, to tell us of its advantages. I do not like it. I think the word " schedule " is most appropriate. We hear of schedules of prices, and schedules of this thing and the other,but we never hear of a scale without making us shiver - at least it makes any one shiver who has anything to do with growing oranges, or citrus fruits of some kind. Without some very good reason, we should not make this alteration. When we make an amendment it should be to make an improvement, and if no one can show that the word "scale" is an improvement on "schedule," then, of course, we should not make the alteration. No one has* done so, and I think that " schedule " is the most commercial term to use.

                    <para>- Inthisclause.it is provided that seamen shall have certain privileges in regard to postage, and as far as the land service is concerned, that is extended to noncommissioned officers and men. The petty officer is in the same position as a non-commissioned officer in the land service, and I presume it is intended to give the same convenience to the same class of men at sea as to those in the land service. Therefore, the word " seaman" should be struck out, with a view to inserting the words " any petty officer or seaman " ; then both ranks would be on exactly the same footing in both branches of the service. </para>

                    <para>- The only objection that I can urge to altering this clause is that I believe it is a clause which is to be found in the British Postal Act, and I think in nearly all the Acts in His Majesty's dominions. I was just looking for it in the Victorian Act, but do not see it at the moment. I have no doubt it is there. The. object, of course, is to insure that these letters shall be carried at a uniform charge to sailors and soldiers wherever they may be in British dominions, and it is desirable, in order to insure uniformity, that the clauses shall be identically the same in each of the Acts. </para>

                    <para>- I was about to call the attention of the Senate to the same difficulty, and I therefore rise to second the amendment. I think the old custom that has been general throughout the State should still be maintained, and for the same reason as the mover I hope the amendment will be agreed to. It will not affect the revenue of the Postal department to an enormous extent, and I think it is a benefit which, if we possibly can, we ought to confer on the people. </para>

                    <para>- I intended to move an amendment that would precede <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith's</inline> ; that is in lines 40 and 41 to strike out the word "newspaper," and insert "journal." That would cover a wider field, and such publications as are really educational, and are of extreme value to many who are living in the country, would be able to come under the clause. </para>

                        <para>- I thought that the word "newspaper" would have a contracted meaning, and I was desirous of giving the clause a broader interpretation. Of course, if the word " journal " will have a narrower meaning, I will withdraw that. What we are really desirous about is that the people, shall have an opportunity of getting these journals, such as <inline font-style="italic">The Review ofReviews,</inline> and a number of . mining journals, which are really educational, and which convey to the people throughout the Commonwealth a large amount of information on political, social, and educational matters, and also on matters respecting the various trades. I know some of the journals appeal to only one section of the community, but I certainly think that that section should have the same privileges as other sections, and I see no reason why these journals should not be carried in like manner as newspapers. </para>

                    <para>- I have very great pleasure in supporting the amendment submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith,</inline> and I think, on reflection, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Charleston</inline> will find that the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> will cover what he is desirous of achieving. The insertion of the words "or publication" would be rather too wide, and probably would jeopardize the more comprehensive and reasonable amendment submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith.</inline> I am aware that representations have been made to other senators that a large number of journals which have hitherto been regarded as newspapers are going' to be most seriously penalized by virtue of this clause. The clause defines in well known terms what a newspaper is ; and the law of this, and I believe the other States, has been, that if they were published within one calendar month they would come within the definition of a newspaper. A very large amount of capital has been invested, having regard to that particular definition, and the various newspapers referred to are journals which enjoy a very large circulation and a very considerable amount of popularity. One has been mentioned - <inline font-style="italic">The Review of Reviews.</inline></para>

                        <para>- Hitherto it has been regarded as a newspaper. Like a large number of other journals it has entered into its contracts with its various subscribers on the basis of the prevailing law, and naturally it comes upon them with very great surprise to have this proposal made for an alteration of the definition which would penalize them probably to three times the extent of the postage which they are now obliged to pay., In the Commonwealth there are about 200* publications which would be most seriously affected by this clause, and penalized in the direction to which I have referred. Having regard to the fact that the law has acted very satisfactorily in the past, and to the fact that each of these journals has, as the Parliament should recognise, a degree of vested interests, it does seem to be a somewhat sweeping provision, and, so far as I can see, unjustified. I do not think there is any virtue in seven days. One calendar month has been the recognised period for a very long time, and as vested interests have grown up under these local conditions I hope that the Minister will see his way to accept the amendment, which certainly appears to <inline font-style="italic">me to</inline> be a reasonable one, and will avoid an injustice being done to many popular journals. </para>

                        <para>- I am just, going to state my reasons. We have been accustomed to fixing a very low rate indeed for newspapers; in fact, some of the States carry their newspapers for nothing. A newspaper has to come within this definition, and has to be published within a period not exceeding seven days. It will be generally admitted that the journal that fills the ordinary idea of a newspaper is one that is published at intervals not exceeding seven days. When we get beyond that period we get to a different class - of what we might call magazines or periodicals. No doubt there are some magazines or periodicals of a very excellent character, whose circulation no one would like to' see checked in any way. But seeing that in the past there has been no other class under which all these magazines and periodicals could come, and that the rates of postage have been fixed so very low that the proprietors have been in the habit of sending them through as newspapers, they have been held to comply with the definition, and therefore go through as newspapers. But that is not the end of it. Chen there are a great number of things that are more in the nature of trade circulars than newspapers - certain publications issued in the interests of special trades. These have all been coming in as newspapers, and I learn from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best,</inline> whose information, I presume, is accurate, that about 200 of them are passing through the post as newspapers. I think it must be admitted. by all that that is not the idea which the legislators and the postal authorities of the States had in view at the time when they gave such special 'facilities for the carriage of newspapers. I do not desire that these publications we have been speaking of should pay, as has been suggested, a very much heavier rate than a newspaper pays. But what I am inclined to favour is a description of another class of publication - a publication that may be issued weekly or monthly, with a definition also which it will be expected to comply with. In that way I. think we can have a rate for newspapers and a rate for magazines. It would be doing justice to the department, and it would inflict no injury whatever upon the publishers or the proprietors of these magazines. </para>

                        <para>- They fit the definition simply because it is so very hard to draw a line. We have got a definition, and a Postmaster-General does not like to condemn any publication which goes through, and say " This is not a newspaper, and we shall not carry it." The consequence is - and I am not speaking now of any particular publication - there are publications, especially at certain times, that go through the Post-office as newspapers, and are carried very often at a very low rate or for nothing, which are not newspapers in the ordinary sense of the word. It is simply an evasion of the Act. These publications contain a few columns of news, perhaps, taken out of another newspaper, and put in for the sake of satisfying that definition. Every one knows that the object for which the paper is published is not the object that newspaper proprietors, at all events, have in publishing their journals. In that way the Act has been evaded, and an unfair advantage has been taken of the especially low rates which have been fixed for newspapers. We shall hear directly, I suppose, that the Postmaster-General must be saved ; that he must be helped in any way ; that he must be a man with such a determined backbone that he can stop one newspaper or another, and allow others to go free. The most difficult task which can be set to a Postmaster-General is to discriminate between one newspaper and another. I know that the Postmaster-General will be charged with allowing one newspaper to go free because it disseminated radical views, and with stopping another newspaper because it was highly conservative. If a mid-way scale were fixed for the particular class of publication we are speaking of, so that it would come pretty closely to that of a newspaper, there would be very much less temptation to try and pass through the post as <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> newspaper a publication which has not the particular features which we understand a newspaper should possess. </para>

                    (South Australia). - I am sure the Postmaster-General must see that he will be penalizing a certain class of persons who are publishing a newspaper, and also their rights, because they are really too poor to publish weekly instead of monthly. There are numbers of persons who are concerned. For instance, in South Australia the Temperance Alliance has a newspaper published once a month. It appeals to a certain class, and I believe it has a very large class of readers too. It would be too costly for the Temperance Alliance to publish weekly. If they could afford to publish weekly it would be carried at this low rate.

                        <para>- Tes, that is the antidote. Then there are several newspapers published monthly which appeal to a certain class of readers, such as the <inline font-style="italic">Beacon,</inline> which was published in Victoria. To say that because those who support that paper cannot afford to support it weekly, they should be penalized is, I am sure, treating them unfairly and unjustly. I am thoroughly satisfied that the word "newspaper" is even a broader word, if it comes under the definition, than is the word "journal." <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harney</inline> has explained to me that the origin of the word would mean daily. I protest against the term prescribed in paragraph (6) of clause 26, which defines a newspaper as a publication that is published at intervals not exceeding seven days. I think that the term ought to be at least one month. I am extremely anxious that the Postmaster-General should have a discretionary power. </para>

                    <para>- Of course, I can see a difficulty here with regard to trade circulars. I think the suggestion made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Charleston</inline> to allow certain discretionary powers to the Postmaster-General in differentiating between a trade circular and an ordinary newspaper may have some value. But I should like to point out a few of the papers which cannot be considered periodicals, and which certainly cannot be considered as trade circulars. Let me point to the <inline font-style="italic">Railway</inline><inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> published in Queensland, and owned by a' gentleman in the other Chamber. That paper is brought out by him and his family once a month. It has a circulation of about 2,000, and deals chiefly with matters affecting the railway servants of Queensland, but it also gives valuable information in regard te railway matters generally in different parts of the world. That journal has been issued now probably for the last eight or ten years, and surely the Postmaster-General cannot for one moment contend that that is in any sense an ordinary periodical, or that it is the ordinary tradesmen's journal. </para>

                        <para>- I admit that, but it is certainly a newspaper, and it conveys to a number of readers - a certain section of our State - very valuable information. I am not so very clear that the journals circulating in the States of New South Wales and Victoria are not also monthly newspapers. But they cannot be considered ordinary periodicals. Again, take the <inline font-style="italic">Mining</inline><inline font-style="italic">Journal</inline> - a journal brought out by the Queensland Government, and that, too, at the strong solicitation made for two or three years in succession by the mining members of the Queensland Assembly. I amongst others urged the Government strongly to bring out that journal, and a very useful journal it is. I received a copy of it only this morning. </para>

                        <para>- One penny. Another paper owned by the State of Queensland is the <inline font-style="italic">Farmer and Grazier.</inline> That paper conveys a lot of valuable information with regard to the breeding of cattle, sheep, and horses, besides referring to other subjects. It is published monthly, and has been for a number of years. A list of other journals of an exceedingly useful character might be named. It would bc unfair to the proprietors of those journals that they should be penalized to the extent that they would be under this provision. In no circumstances would I support such a provision, because I can see that it would inflict a great deal of hardship upon a number of persons who have invested capital and entered into obligations in a variety of ways. It would be reasonable to make the term one month instead of seven days. I think the Postmaster-General and his staff ought to have, a discretionary power in determining what are ordinary tradesmen's journals. These trade circulars should not be treated in the way in which the ordinary newspaper is treated. To penalize the people engaged in bringing out those journals, which are exceedingly useful as educational agencies, would be highly detrimental not only to the persons so engaged, but to others who are scattered throughout the country. I trust that the Postmaster-General will accept the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith.</inline> Coming to the question of postage, I certainly do not think that the postage rate is too low. In some instances I think it is too high. Indeed, since coming to Melbourne I have been more than amazed at the price- which I have had to pay upon some of the journals which I have sent to my own State. During the period of the celebrations I sent a number of publications containing some very excellent illustrations to Queensland. Some of them actually cost me 3-J-d. for postage </para>

                    <para>- I am opposed to this amendment. It" seems to me" that the line must be drawn somewhere between newspapers and books. The idea originally, I suppose, in giving this concession to newspapers was that it was thought advisable that persons should be facilitated in the receipt of ordinary up-to-date news. No more. It was intended to apply to the daily journals and the weekly journals which- are a. summing up of the political and other general newsy statements of the week. AVe must draw the line somewhere, and the Bill is aimed at giving the concession to what are newspapers in the generally-accepted sense of the word. Could any one say that a periodical which comes out once a month isa newspaper in the generally-accepted sense of the term ? </para>

                        <para>- It is a monthly. No one could have the faintest chance of hoping to sell a monthly publication which was a statement or a collection of the ordinary affairs going on in the political, in the social, and in the commercial world. I am not saying at all that the concession is more justly applied to one than to the other; in fact, I am at a loss to see why there should be any such concession at all. On reading the clause, it appears to me that the concession is aimed at newspapers in the generally accepted sense of the word. Now, what I understand, and what I think every one understands, by a newspaper in the generally accepted sense of the word is a sheet which contains a summary of things going on around us and observations upon them. It is a matter of degree - two days are not one day, nor ten days two days. AVe must take a common sense line. A week, I think, is the furthest that we can ex- , tend it to, and mainly for the reason that a weekly publication is a summing up of the records of the preceding days. A great number of journals have their weekly editions, which are realty nothing more than a precis of what has been stated in the daily publications for the previous six days. Once we get beyond a week, and come to such a period as a month; no one could have the faintest hope of selling such a publication that had to do with the passing of current events. The only chance which the publisher of a monthly journal has of selling it is that it contains literary matter; essays upon things and scientific topics are dealt with. No one reads a paper which comes out so rarely as once a month for the purpose of getting an impress of the daily events that are taking place. A man reads such a journal for the purpose of educating himself upon some special topic. The question is whether we should allow a concession, which is aimed at newspapers in the generally accepted sense of the word, to include a journal that cannot be a newspaper in any sense of the word, since its only chance of existing is to avoid the matter upon which a daily newspaper lives - namely, daily topics. A magazine must live upon literary, scientific, and polemical articles. It is a newspaper that is to get the concession, not a periodical. That seems to me to be the logical distinction between the two. There is also another commercial observation, and it is this : When we have a journal coming out so rarely as once a month it necessarily is bulky ; it cannot consist of two or three sheets- This concession was originally aimed at newspapers, because they were lighter than periodicals, and easily conveyed. Therefore, it was not thought a very great deal to give this privilege. But it will be another thing to extend it to periodicals, which can grow to a huge volume. AVe have a limitation upon the growth of a newspaper. No newspaper can be bigger than would enable an ordinary person to read it at breakfast, and no newspaper can contain more -than the telegrams which the press agency supplies it with. There would be no limitation to the size of periodicals, and to extend this concession to them would open up great liability to abuse, and would be very hard on the commercial side of the Post-office. </para>

                        <para>- It is getting rather late, and I do not propose to deal definitely with this clause to-night. I would just like to say that the debate seems to have proceeded so far upon the assumption that if this limitation remain it is probable that all these monthly journals will be thrown out of the class of newspapers, and will be charged henceforward as printed matter. I should like to say here that my desire and intention is to draw up and make a separate class and rate for monthly publications. I shall try to come prepared to-morrow with an amendment to show how that can be carried out. I desire to say, also, that there is no wish to place the proprietor of any periodical at a disadvantage in consequence of this change, unless it is unavoidable. Of course, when we alter a rate the result must be a little inconvenience to the person who has to pay that rate. But there must be a time for it to come into force. With regard to the contention that contracts have been made on the present rate of postage, I would point out that this Bill will not come into operation until the 1st October next, and it is after that date that these rates have to be fixed. Probably they will not come into operation immediately. In that case I think we can arrange so that there will be no very great loss to any proprietor who previously has been in the habit of having his publication sent through the post as a newspaper. </para>

                    <para>- I simply wish to point out that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harney</inline> made rather an ingenious remark with regard to the bulkiness of a monthly journal. If an ordinary monthly publication is compared, however, with the 26 issues of a newspaper for the month, the aggregate weight of the latter will be found to be much greater than that of the magazine. With all due deference to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harney,</inline> I would like to say that there is a class of people, who read the monthly' journals, who will compare for intelligence with the average person who reads the daily newspapers. I say, therefore, that we ought to see that these journals are not penalized by being treated less favorably than newspapers. </para>
