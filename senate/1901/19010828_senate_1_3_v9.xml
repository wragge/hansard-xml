He is suffering from the prevailing epidemic, but if these statements go through the country persons will think that he is dying.

                            <para>- With great submission, sir, this motion has nothing to do with the business of the House ; it is the partial appointment of a committee. There is no more reason why the motion should be moved without notice than there was that the invitation to you in the first instance to submit your warrant appointing the committee should be moved without notice. The original motion was moved on notice. I am not making the suggestion in any hostile way or with any desire to delay the proceedings, but because the committee is to meet to-morrow, and the resignation of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser,</inline> which we hear of now for the first time, may have some effect on it. </para>

                    <para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'CONNOR</inline>(New South Wales - Vice-President of the Executive Council). - The only reason I had for moving the motion now was, since it will be necessary for the warrant to lie upon the table for a certain number of days, to expedite the actual appointment as soon as possible. But if it is the wish of the Senate that I should give notice, I have no objection. </para>
                    <para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator WALKER</inline>(New South Wales). If the motion is not agreed to to-day the probability is that the committee will not meet as a full body for a fortnight ; whereas if it is agreed to to-day it' may hope to meet as a full body to-morrow week. Thursday is the only day on which, we can meet. </para>
                    <para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir JOSIAH</inline>SYMON (South Australia). - I hope that we shall meet tomorrow in any case. Of course, the committee will not be hampered or trammelled in any way. </para>

                        <para>- lt will be seen that provision is made in this clause that the owner of goods may comply with the provisions of the measure by means of an agent lawfully authorized. Clause 174 provides that any officer of Customs may require from that agent the production of his authority. Then clause 175 goes on to say - </para>

                    <para class="block">I do not know why those words are used instead of the words " legally authorized," though there may be some legal reason of which I am not aware. When a person is authorized by the owner to act as his agent in relation to any goods, such person is to be deemed to be the owner of the goods, and personalty liable for any penalties recoverable as if he were the principal. I do not know why the 'words "passes himself, or acts, or assumes to act as such agent " are used. Surely the Customs should not deal with any one who is not a legally authorized agent. These words are not in the Victorian Act, although the rest of the clause is copied from that Act. If it be necessary to make the agent responsible in some way, that provision should not be mixed up with a clause of this kind, especially as the concluding words of the clause are that - </para>

                    <para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'CONNOR</inline>(New South Wales - Vice-President of the Executive Council). - The object of the clause is to make an agent personally liable. Ordinarily speaking an agent acts for his principal, and is not personally liable, but inasmuch as the object of the clause is to make him personally liable, it makes liable not only the person who is actually authorized, but also the person who assumes to act. Such a person is to be deemed to be the owner of the goods for the purpose of this clause only. Suppose a person is not an agent at all, but represents himself to be an agent, the principal will not be liable, but the person representing himself to be the agent will be liable. The personal liability is to be upon the agent, and he will be punished for holding himself out as an agent. In other words the clause takes a person at his word, and if he holds himself out as an agent, he has to stand by all the consequences. The clause does not impose any liability upon the principal, although it does not take away any of the principal's liability.

                        <para>- If the words - "unless the contrary be proved " are not inserted in this clause, it may make the principal responsible for declarations made by persons who are not authorized to make them. It is rather serious to hold a man responsible for a declaration made without his knowledge or consent, although it may have been made by his agent. I suggest, therefore, that after the word " held " the words " unless the contrary be proved " be inserted. This would throw the onus of proof that the declaration was made without the knowledge or consent of the principal, upon him. The principal would still be liable unless it was shown that the declaration was made without his knowledge and consent. </para>

It is dangerous to provide that any employe of a firm can make that firm liable for any declaration he likes to make. It is opening the door to an immense amount of imposition of black-mail. An employe may have a grudge against his employer, and may make a declaration which may penalize his employer. Surely the Government never intended such a thing as that. A firm should be liable for a declaration made by an authorized agent, but surely not for a declaration made by any employe. I therefore move - </para>

                        <para>- I think the committee will see that it is necessary that the clause should remain as it is if they reflect what the position really is. In the ordinary transaction of Customs business, for the convenience of the owner of goods, an agent or employe is' allowed, to make declarations and do a variety of things which it would be impossible for the owner of the goods to do himself. Honorable senators who are aware of the multiplicity of detailed transactions that have to be gone through in Customs business know that it would be impossible for any owner of goods in a large way to attend personally to matters at the Custom-house. Therefore, he sends a duly credited agent or employe, or engages an ordinary Customhouse agent to do these things for him. In the course of business the agent or employe1 perhaps makes a certain declaration. It is quite obvious that if after a declaration had been made the owner were to be allowed to escape the consequences of that declaration by showing that it was not authorized, we should be opening the door to a tremendous amount of evasion of Custom-house regulations, and it would be quite impossible to secure the collection of the revenue. When a false declaration was made, the owner would be able to say - " There has been a mistake ; I know nothing about it. I have a thousand affairs to attend to, and this is only one of them, and my agent has made the wrong declaration under a misapprehension." There is no hardship in making the principal Liable for what his agent declares. What has been done is for 'the benefit of the principal, and is done in the ordinary course of business. The clause will have the effect of making owners liable for what is done by the agents they employ to act for them. </para>

                    <para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir FREDERICK</inline>SARGOOD (Victoria). - I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor,</inline> that if a firm employs an agent it should be responsible for his declaration. But this clause says that an employe may make a declaration, - for which the firm shall be liable. The employe may not have been appointed to make such a declaration at all. I know of cases where employes who have had a grudge against their employers have got them into trouble with the Customs. Under this clause an employe who wishes to pay off a grudge may make a declaration, knowing that the firm will be responsible for anything he says. I do not care to what extent the agent may make the firm responsible if he is duly appointed as an agent. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Major GOULD</inline> (New South Wales). - My objection to this clause is that the owner is made responsible, not for a declaration made by a duly appointed agent, but for the declaration of any employe. This is a very dangerous provision. Although it makes the employer liable to pecuniary penalties, it has to be remembered that it makes him liable to imprisonment if the fine is not paid. The fine may be enforced by distress or imprisonment. I can see the difficulty with regard to the amendment which I have suggested - that it would leave it open to the person charged to prove that the agent or "employe had not been authorized. I shall, therefore, be quite willing to fall in with the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Frederick</inline> Sargood. </para>

                        <para>- If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Frederick</inline> Sargood is satisfied with his amendment, I am not disposed to 'take exception to it, but I think the clause ought to read " the ' agent," instead of " any agent." An agent may make a declaration without authority. He may be sent to do a particular business with the Customs, and may, thinking he is serving his firm, make a declaration that is contrary to fact, for which, as the clause stands, the principal would be responsible. If the clause read "the agent," it would mean the properly authorized agent. If the word "any" remains, principals will be open to serious injustice. </para>

If a man is an agent, appointed for particular duties or a particular purpose, and goes outside his employment with regard to such action, he is not an agent. The use of the words " any agent " perfectly safeguards the employer, because it must be shown that the person making the declaration is an agent, and he must, of course, be an agent authorized expressly or impliedly. I want to protect the Customs against the possibility of confusion arising from the use of the words " the agent," under which it might be argued that there could be only one agent lawfully authorized. I have consented to an amendment omitting the words " employe or," because they are implied by reference to clause 173, but I cannot go any further than that. </para>

                            <para>- I will refer to that in a moment. Clause 175 refers to the liability of persons appointed as agents for any infringements of the law they may make in the name of the principal. They are to be liable just as if they were the principals themselves. Then clause 176 is necessary for the protection of the Customs, to make sure that the principal is also liable. But he ought to be liable only for the act of an agent so lawfully authorized, that is to say, " the agent." Then I am asked, what are we to do in the case of two or three agents if we use the words "the agent." We have just dealt with an Acts Interpretation Bill, under which words used in the singular are to be interpreted to apply equally in , the plural, and that will get over that difficulty altogether. </para>

It may be two or three agents, or only one ; but if we say " the agent " we shall be referring to the agents indicated by by clauses 173, 174, and 175, and shall have homogenous and uniform legislation upon the subject. It is clear to me that there must have been some other object in the use of the word "employe," and we want only to refer to the agent defined by the previous clauses. </para>

                        <para>- I find myself unable to accept any of the amendments suggested by honorable senators opposite, or even the amendment which has been consented to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor.</inline> If the clause is amended in any way in the first two lines it might as; well be struck out altogether. It cannot be said too often with respect to these clauses that the honest trader has nothing whatever to fear from them. They are simply put in for the purpose of enabling the Collector of Customs to catch the man who perpetually or occasionally lapses from grace, and tries to " do " the Custom-house. If any of the amendments suggested are accepted, it may be opening the door to defrauding the Customs, which clause 176 is meant to shut. From my limited experience, some 37 years ago, in a merchant's office, I have been rather astonished at the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sargood.</inline> How are these entries passed ? When a merchant opens letters with the invoices in them, he hands the invoices out to a clerk or employe, who certainly would not be an agent authorized in writing under clause 173 or 174. He would be a Custom-house clerk attending to the business of passing entries. This clerk would pass the entries, and this clause says that the owner of the goods shall be held liable for what the clerk does. Suppose the owner of the goods got two invoices - a bogus invoice and a real invoice, he would hardly put upon the clerk the indignity of committing an absolute fraud on the Customs. The owner would commit the fraud by keeping back the true invoice, and handing the bogus invoice to the clerk, and the clerk would pass that bogus invoice perfectly innocently. This clause is. framed to make the owner liable in such a case. I was astonished to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sargood</inline> say that lie knew of a case in which a clerk out of spite to the owner did some unauthorized thing. He must have got some information or some invoice from the office, for he could not have done the thing out of his head. Whatever the clerk did in such a case the owner should be liable for. What the clause is designed to do is to give the collector of Customs accurate evidence, and if any one is liable for accurate or inaccurate evidence issuing from an office it must be the owner of the goods. </para>

                    <para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir FREDERICK</inline>SARGOOD (Victoria). - The honorable and learned senator has referred to his experience of 37 years ago. I have had considerable experience more recently, and for seventeen years I was chairman of our trade committee, and in close contact with the s Commissioner for Customs. During that time the principal duty of our committee was to assist the Customs department in preventing roguery. For the whole of those years I enjoyed the utmost confidence of the commissioner, and there were very few matters that were not confidentially submitted to me when a difficulty arose. I have always recognised it as a first duty of honest merchants to assist the Customs ; but difficulties should not be thrown in their way, and undue risks should not be placed upon them. The Custom-house should only deal with recognised lawfully authorized persons, either in the employ of merchants or duly licensed Customs-house agents who are employed by small firms who cannot afford to keep an officer for that special work. Other merchants, according to the amount of business they have to do, employ one or two of their own employes, not merely throughout the year, but when a press of business comes on at the commencement of a season. They are authorized in writing, and their authority, I believe, is registered by the Customs. I have before me the declaration of our shipping clerk, in which he says - </para>

" Any agent " means any agent authorized as aforesaid, and I feel confident that no court, construing the Bill, would ever say that " any agent " in this clause meant any other class of agent -than that referred to in clause 173. What 'difference does it make to the Minister to use the words " the agent " when they will have the same force as "any agent?" If two or- more are employed, the Acts Interpretation Bill, as has been pointed out, will enable us to catch all of them. </para>

This Bill is to protect the revenue, and for the collection of the revenue, and it must not be forgotten that if an agent goes to the' Custom-house and make a false declaration, and represents himself as the agent of a man for whom he is not the agent, he will render himself liable to prosecution for perjury ; the law officers will have a proper hold upon him and can punish him. I support the Government proposal. </para>

                    <para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator MACFARLANE</inline>(Tasmania).I support the amendment, for the reason that it is not only merchants but other individuals who may be interested. An individual may import goods on which there are ad valorem duties, and may employ one or two Customs agents. If he employs two, both may pass entries, and ih the case of one there may be an undervaluation. Is the principal to be liable for that undervaluation, though the other entry passed may be correct? If we have the words " any agent " it will include more than one, and if we have the words " the agent," it will include only th6 authorized person. </para>

                            <para>- No; but what honorable senators want is that there should be responsibility only in the case of an agent appointed in a particular way' under clause 173. It ought not to be limited in that way. If the Custom-house, for its own purposes, choose to allow the owner to act under clause 173, an agency is created in that way. But if in some other way, perhaps not complying with that clause, a principal, chooses to send a person to make a declaration for him, so as to get the benefit of it, why should he not be responsible for it also? I cannot understand the object in trying to protect a man from the act of his own agent. I consented to the omission of the word "employe" because there might be some doubt whether it might not mean any employe, whether authorized or not ; but now that it is quite clear that the person who makes the declaration . must be the agent - that is, the person authorized - what does it matter whether he is authorized under clause 173 or in any other way? </para>

                        <para>- It appears to one that this is a convenient way of dealing with the clause. On a previous occasion I contended that the Government were attempting to go beyond what we thought they had aright to do. When the new clause is submitted,the sense of the committee can be obtained without any honorable senator feeling himself prejudiced on the subject. </para>

The clause says that if the officer has reasonable cause to suspect he shall do something ; but the sub-clause gives him power to do nothing.Ipropose to move to omit the words " may detain and," with a view to insert the words " shall detain and question, and may." </para>
                <para>SenatorMajor GOULD (New South Wales). - The clause evidently intends to give the officer the right to use his own discretion ; but, if it is amended as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> desires, he will have no discretion to exercise, but will be bound to do a thing which may be wrong. I think the better plan will be to omit the words " the following consequences shall ensue." </para>

The suggested amendment would effect an improvement in the drafting of the Bill, and would remove an obvious blot; but it really does not matter to me, and so far as I am concerned I would make a present of the clause to the honorable and learned senator. </para>

When the things happen that are indicated in that clause, the ship becomes forfeited. Then the clause before the committee provides that any officer may seize any forfeited ship or any goods which he has reasonable cause to believe are forfeited. That is to say, if the Offence which forfeits a ship or goods has been clearly committed, the officer may seize them as forfeited goods. If he has a reasonable cause to suspect that the offence has been committed, he seizes the goods. If there were not this power, the power of forfeiture would be of no use, since there is not much use in being able to forfeit a ship unless there is also power to prevent her from sailing away. </para>

                        <para>- I have no objection whatever to the first part of the clause, but it seems to me that to permit an officer to seize a ship which it is reasonable to believe may be forfeited, is going a bit too far. The forfeiture of a ship is an action to be taken after certain preliminaries have been observed. It is not a question of suspicion, but of facts. There is no reason why we should empower an officer to seize a ship merely because he has reason to suspect that" something has been done. The fact should be capable of demonstration. I submit that the last part of the clause might very well come out, unless there is a reason, which I cannot divine, why it should remain. </para>

                            <para>- No ; the offence would have to be proved afterwards. The mere fact that the thing has been done would enable the ship or the goods to be forfeited. We are giving this power to an officer, so that if he has reasonable ground to believe that certain goods have been smuggled, he may seize them. If a seizure is made, the officer must justify his conduct on the grounds that there has been smuggling, or that some other offence has been committed. Or if there is reasonable cause to believe that there has been smuggling, the officer has to act to the best of his judgment and seize the goods. If it should turn out afterwards that there has been smuggling, the officer is justified in his action, and if he has had reasonable cause to suspect, it is right to give him the power conferred by this clause. Under these circumstances we require to have both powers : in the same way as it is necessary to give a constable power to arrest if an offence is committed in his presence, or where he has a suspicion that a felony has been committed. We could never get officers to act unless we protected them in this way. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable and learned senator will see that it is impossible to provide for that in the clause unless we provide for it fully ; and it would be very inappropriate, in a Bill like this, to provide details as to the method of sale, the publicity of it, and similar matters. Although it is very important to the persons concerned,still, after the forfeiture has once taken place, and there is the right of sale, the carrying out of the sale is a simple matter enough ; and I presume that all that will be necessary will be that the sale shall take place under such circumstances as will secure the best value for the Government. Any one who knows anything of the working of Customs Acts will bear me out that, in these days, when the old style of smuggling has disappeared, the forfeiture of a ship is a thing that very seldom takes place. It is, however, necessary that we should retain the power. </para>

Under it any officer of the Customs may, without warrant, arrest any person whom he has reasonable cause to believe guilty of any offence whatever under the Bill. There are many such offences which, every honorable senator will agree, would not demand the exercise of such a power as that of personal arrest, but under the clause an officer of Customs may exercise this power merely if he considers he has reasonable cause - which is a very wide phrase - to believe that some person has been guilty of any offence whatever, even the ;most trivial. I admit that there may be offences under the Bill in connexion with which it might be necessary to give a Customs officer this power, but there are many trivial offences for which there would be no justification for the exercise of this power. I should like to ask the Minister what he means to do with regard to this clause. </para>

That power is given in New South Wales to any . individual, not only in the case of indictable offences, but in the case of offences punishable simply by fine or summary conviction by a magistrate. All that can be done by any individual ; but in this clause we give this power only to a Customs officer or police constable. In other words, for the purpose of this Bill, we make an officer of Customs a special constable and give him the power of a policeman to without warrant arrest any person whom he has reasonable cause to believe has been guilty of any offence under the Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> has suggested that this might include any trivial offence. </para>

                            <para>- When you give a power of this kind you must not be always regarding the extreme limit of the power, and supposing that it will be- applied to the most trivia] circumstances. That is a constant way of criticising these powers which, must be given to federal offices for the good of the whole of the people of the Commonwealth. The proper principle is to see whether there are cases likely to occur in which this power may be properly exercised, where it is necessary that it should be exercised on the moment by some officer who happens to be there, and then to trust the officials not to use it on trivial occasions, and not to apply it where its immediate application is not necessary. Custom-house offences are of a peculiar character. The offences to which the . clause would be applicable would be probably all offences connected with the smuggling of goods, for instance, on a wharf. An immense amount of smuggling is done by lascar seamen off the P. and 0. boats. Supposing that a Customs officer on a wharf sees a man going by who, from the appearance of his clothes, he has reason to think has a few thousand cigars about him, what is he to do ? Is he to wait until he can go to a magistrate and get a warrant ? Where will the Iascar be by the time the officer 'has got the warrant <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Is it not obvious that in these  circumstances  there must be some power in the officer to act immediately. In such a case the clause will enable the Customs officer or a constable to arrest the person on the reasonable suspicion that he has contraband goods in his possession. There are also cases in which a man may be making away with some goods from a ship - in a lighter or a boat. If the Customs officer has to wait until he can get a warrant, what will become of the offender ? These powers, if they are to be usefully exercised, must be exercised on the spot, lt is unreasonable to suppose that they will be exercised in trivial circumstances. Where a large power is placed in the hands of government officials they do not like to undertake the* responsibility of its exercise unnecessarily. If there is any leaning in carrying out the power in this clause it will be rather in the direction of letting go a man who might be reasonably suspected of committing an offence rather than running the risk of arresting the man on -suspicion where the case is not . a very strong one. I ask the committee to leave the clause as it is, because, if it is omitted it will leave a very large loop-hole in those precautions which we are very properly taking to secure the revenue of the  Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator CLEMONS</inline>(Tasmania). - I am quite certain that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator '0'Gonnor</inline> knows that I .have no desire to prevent the clause from operating in any one of the cases -he mentions. 'I have "no 'desire to rob the Customs officers of any power they ought to have for carrying out the Act :in its entirety. But, because I feel that way, .that is no reason why the clause should remain exactly as if is. It will be .perfectly, easy for <inline font-weight="bold">-Senator -O'Connor</inline> 'to amend it, so that an officer will have 'the right to exercise the power in- every case where- it is desirable ; but as it reads, the public, for whom we ought to show some consideration, are liable to be placed in an -extremely awkward and unfair position. There are hosts of offences created in the Bill for which we should not make the offenders liable to arrest without warrant by any Customs officer. Clauses 56, 57, and 5S, for instance, create distinct offences  for which a penalty of ,£20 <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> .provided. I submit, with every confidence, that in the case of all the offences .under the Act, it is unwise to give a Customs officer the power to arrest a man without warrant. Yet, if this clause is passed as it is, he will most certainly be able to do so. Referring to clause 56, is it possible that we shall allow an officer, who may say that he has not had reasonable facilities for boarding a ship, the power to arrest the master ? Again, clause 57 creates an offence which would be covered by this all-embracing clause. I entirely object to the attitude of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor.</inline> Surely it is competent for him to provide that the officer can have all the powers he wants him to have, but not ;powers such as no honorable senator would like to see entrusted to any officer. I do not think it is sufficient protection to the public for -us calmly to say that an officer would never exercise the extraordinary powers of this clause. We should not place in any man's hand a power which he can exercise at -his discretion, and then trust for our protection that he will not exercise it. If I searched the Bill I could find twenty instances of offences with penalties provided, 'for .-which even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Oconnor</inline> would not think it desirable that an officer should have the power of arresting a man without warrant, simply because in his opinion he lias reasonable cause for suspicion. It is incredible that we should allow any man 'to be .arrested without a warrant for offences such .as are enumerated in clauses 56, .57, and 58, and half-a-dozen other clauses, all of -which are ridiculous, and ought to place no man in jeopardy of being arrested. One of the most serious injuries you can :do a man is to place him under arrest. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> to cite "the 'Customs Acts containing this provision, .and seeing that he has not cited one, I take it for certain that 'there is no precedent. I shall call for a division on the -Clause if it is -necessary. </para>

                            <para>- This is one of those matters in which we must give a large power to be exercised at the discretion of an officer when it is necessary. In the case which my honorable colleague put, unless the officer has the power of immediate arrest, it will be impossible for him to sheet home the offence against the lascar who has smuggled . cigars in his possession. In the Crimes Act of New South Wales power is given to a policeman to arrest without warrant, and why should not that power be given to a Customs officer to be exercised in cases where he has reasonable cause to believe that offences have been committed against the Customs Act? If honorable senators will look at the next clause they will see that the power is carefully safeguarded. It provides that on demand the officer must give a statement in writing of the' reasons for which the arrest is made, and, therefore, there is not the slightest probability that it will be exercised lightly, or in any case except where it is absolutely necessary. It has been admitted by honorable senators that there are cases in which it is desirable that such a power should be given. Unless it can be shown how it can be given to apply in those cases where honorable senators think it would be justifiable without making it generally applicable, a case has been made out for the clause as it </para>

                        <para>- This clause has caused the commercial public and the shipping public a feeling of amazement. They would like to know how it could have passed another place. It is absolutely new, and to show in what way this power, which is desirable and necessary up to a certain point,can be exercised, I would refer the Minister to section 212 of the Victorian Customs Act of 1883. Under that provision all those cases to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> referred - where crews of vessels have tried to smuggle in goods - have been successfully stopped. It is absolutely necessary that the Customs authorities should have the power to prevent acts of smuggling which in themselves are small matters but which in the aggregate are very serious matters. </para>

                    <para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator MILLEN</inline>(New South Wales).If this power is necessary, as the Ministers contend, how have Customs Acts without this power been worked? Whether it is necessary or not is proved by the fact that Customs Acts have been worked in the States without the power. The Customs Act in New South Wales and also in Victoria has been administered without this power for very many years. I think that the statement as to the necessity for giving the power is entirely overridden by the challenge to show wherein such a power has ever been claimed or exercised. There can be no objection to giving an officer the power to effect an arrest, when without that power some evasion of the law might be successfully carried out. But to say that because we want to give a power of doing something of that kind we should give power to an officer to do something which he ought not to do, is carrying the thing to a ridiculous extreme. It is something Hike the case of Charles Lamb's Chinaman, who burnt his house down in order to roast his pig. I am not prepared to go to that length. I hope that the Government will see that the opposition to this clause has a great deal underlying it, and will consent to modify the provision. </para>

                        <para>- The difficulty would be got over if the Government would accept the section of the Victorian Act. I understand it refers to the more serious offences that may be committed. We could get over the difficulty by specifying the offences which must be committed before power is given to an officer to arrest a man. What we want is to prevent a man being arrested "for any trumpery offence. Under this clause a man may be taken before a justice of the peace, who then has two courses open to him. Either he may send him to gaol or he may admit him to bail. Even if the man has committed only such an offence as failing to bring his ship to for boarding, or has not brought his ship to the mooring place as quickly as possible, he may be arrested. Again, a man may be. arrested because he has not arranged his goods properly, or has not paid certain dues, or has not provided sufficient lights, or has not provided proper accommodation for the Customs officer. </para>

I wish to guard against giving an officer power to arrest a man for what may only be a mistake, or a difference of opinion as to whether a certain thing has been done or not. It is really absurd to give the power sought. This afternoon we passed a clause under which a merchant is made liable for an improper declaration made by his agent. The merchant may know nothing at all about the declaration, but under this clause a Custom-house officer might go to him, and say - " Come here, my fine fellow. I am going to take you to gaol because your servant has made a declaration which is not quite correct. I intend to arrest you, and bring you before a justice of the peace." Is not that absurd <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> I hope the Minister will consent to some reasonable amendment in the clause approaching the terms of the section of the Victorian Act which specifies the offences. </para>

                        <para>- I am sorry that any attempt made on this side of the Senate to offer fair criticism seems to be resented by some honorable senators. The clause before the committee is one that demands the careful criticism of every honorable senator, and should not be passed unless it is made clear that it is absolutely necessary. I direct attention to clause 188, which, it seems to me, would do everything which the Vice-President of the Executive Council says it is desirable to do. He instanced the case of a lascar making an attempt to smuggle goods. Clause 188 would cover such a case. That clause corresponds to the section of the Victorian Act quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Frederick</inline> Sargood. That is an additional reason why the clause under discussion is not necessary. I am desirous of giving the Custom-house officers any power which they should have for the prevention of smuggling. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> would agree as to the particular offences for which it is desirable that this power should be used, those offences might be enumerated in the clause. I should agree to such an amendment as that. </para>

                        <para>- I certainly was unware, when we began the discussion of this Bill, that it was intended by some clauses in it to repeal the provisions of Magna Charta, the Habeas Corpus Act, and every other foundation of British liberty, for the purpose of protecting the Customs, but that is exactly what this clause does. For the purpose of Customs administration it enables any officer of the Customs or any member of the police force to arrest, not anybody who has been guilty, but anybody whom the officer may suspect to have been guilty of an offence under the Customs Act. A more monstrous and Draconian provision was never inserted in any Act of Parliament. I would give the Customs all reasonable power for the prevention of smuggling, but I would not give them power to arrest any person coming as a passenger of a ship. A Customs officer might arrest a person whom he did not like or who might not give a satisfactory answer to questions put to him. I agree that there should be stringent provisions for the prevention of smuggling, but this clause goes altogether too far. If we are to repeal Magna Charta let us do it, but do not let us introduce such a proposal by a sort of side wind for the purpose of making stringent the Customs Act. To sweep away, by a clause such as this, the foundation upon which the immunity of persons from arrest now stands, is an infringement of the rights of the subject, lt seems to me that clause 188, which contains the powers given by the "Victorian Act, is sufficient. If it were necessary to enlarge that provision no one would object,, because we are all agreed that every possible power must be put in the hands of the Customs authorities to safeguard the revenue. But it should not be within the option of a Customs officer to exercise such powers of arrest as are proposed to be given. </para>

                        <para>- I trust that the Minister will see that there is a great deal of force in the criticisms that have been made by honorable senators opposite with regard to this clause. I hope they will see their way either to adopt the Victorian section or to limit the clause in the way that has been suggested by defining the offences for which arrest may take place, or by confining it to smuggling. If one .of these courses were adopted, the difficulty would be overcome. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable senators opposite admit that this power would never be exercised except in serious cases ; but they object to have such large powers, left for possible application to trivial offences. Inasmuch as it was never intended that the clause should apply to trivial offences, and as it would be absolutely of no value as applied to trivial offences, I have no objection to amending the clause in the form in which we really wish to have the power exercised - that is, for preventing smuggling. We do not desire anything more than that. It must be remembered that the clause will' be exercised by responsible officers, under proper official control. But, inasmuch as the Government will secure all the power they require for the protection of the revenue by making the amendment suggested, we may save time if I state at once that I am going to consent to it. Therefore, 'if the honorable senator will pardon the application of the American story to himself," though I do not wish to deprive the committee of the pleasure of hearing his "speech, I hope he will reserve it for another occasion. It will be found that the word "smuggling" is defined in the interpretation clause in this way- </para>

It is generally supposed that a Bill is. debated on the second reading, and remarks in committee should have reference only to particular clauses.

                        <para>- While this clause was being discussed, I wrote the word " smuggling " on the margin of my Bill, thinking that that would meet the wishes of honorable senators; but when. I came to look back to clause 1 88,I thought that that clause would cover it, and that there is therefore no necessity for this clause at all. I feel even now that there is no necessity for this clause, if it is intended that smuggling only shall be dealt with under it, because that is already dealt with under clause 188. I agree with the arguments advanced in opposition to the insertion of the words " contrary to the provisions of the Act," because that would seem to imply that people may smuggle if they can do so in accordance with the provisions of the Act. </para>

                    <para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir JOSIAH</inline>SYMON (South Australia). - I think the Vice-President of the Executive Council might give way, and admit that it is not necessary to insert the words " contrary to the provisions of this Act," because they do not. carry the thing one atom further. The honorable and learned senator will see that the offence is being guilty of smuggling, which is defined as the importation and introduction, or attempted importation and introduction, of goods with intent to defraud the revenue. The words " contrary to the provisions of this Act," if inserted, will not make the smuggling more heinous, and will not make that an offence which is not an offence without them. Apart from the criticism that they seem to imply, that there may be some other kind of smuggling which is not contrary to the Act, on which I do not offer an opinion, the words may very well be omitted; but if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> is obstinate in the matter, I would suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> that he should then not press his objection to a division, as the responsibility for any absurdity of this kind must rest with the Government. </para>

                        <para>- I am sorry that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> has agreed to' alter this clause at all. It was a very comprehensive clause, and honorable senators who opposed it acknowledged that. They have great fears that under it something would be done that would affect - whom? The great mass of the people of the Commonwealth, who are very few of them engaged in the business of smuggling or importation of any kind. It concerns them very little. What they are anxious about is that the legislation passed will be for the purpose of protecting the revenue. I want to tell honorable senators that there are many other ways of evading the just dues of importers to the Commonwealth Government than that of smuggling, and if those ways were attempted, and there was a probability of the perpetrators being discovered, they could elope. But under the clause as it stood at first, if there was any possibility of their doing these things, it would have been possible for an officer to arrest them and prevent their escaping the justice that ought to overtake them. It is for that reason I am sorry <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> has accepted any amendment at all. I hope that he will see before the Bill gets out of committee that every offence in the way of defrauding the Customs will be met. </para>

                            <para>- At any rate, the words "on demand" should be struck out. In the typical case of the lascar, I do not think we could attribute to the person arrested the knowledge that he could make a demand for a written statement of the reason for his arrest, and probably 999 persons out of 1,000, if so many were arrested, would not know that it was necessary to make this demand. It is only fair that at the earliest possible moment the person who is arrested should have an authoritative statement in writing of the reason for his arrest. I move - </para>

                        <para>- The Bill so bristles with penalties against persons who in any way infringe the law that it is reasonable to require the imposition of light penalties on officers who exceed or do not fulfilitsrequirements.It is a very serious matter if an officer arrests a man and does not forthwith give him a statement of the reasons for such arrest.

                        <para>- Ido not know if the amendment is a mere lumbering attempt at a joke, or whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> intends it seriously. If it is intended seriously he will make the clause perfectly ludicrous. We are to give a power to an officer to make an arrest ; he is to make the arrest on the spur of the moment, and to give the offender at once a statement in writing of the reason for his arrest, and if it is incorrect he is to be liable to a penalty of £50. Is there any other clause under which you. impose a penalty upon an officer for not carrying out the provisions of the law? It is quite obvious to me that the amendment, whether it is so intended or not, would make the clause absolutely absurd. It seems to me to be carrying the passion for alteration, without any ostensible object or reason, to an absurd extent to make it an offence if an officer does not carry out his duty under the Act. Under the Bill there are hundreds of occasions in which the officers will have to perform duties quite as important as this, and you impose no penalty. What officer' is likely to carry out the duty of arresting a person who is in the act of committing a felony if he knows that any mistake in the statement of the reason for the arrest is likely to subject him to a penalty ?I shall oppose the amendment, and if it is carried ask the committee to vote against the clause. </para>

                        <para>- I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> has made a mountain out of a molehill. He has denounced the amendment as a lumbering attempt at a joke. I do not think that is a way in which an amendment, seriously put as this is, ought to be treated. It only wastes time. My honorable and learned friend has misapprehended or not quite accurately represented what the amendment is. He has put it that it is a penalty sought to be imposed on an officer for giving an incorrect statement of the reason for the arrest. That is not so it is for not giving a statement. If it is obligatory on the officer, in the interest of the liberty of the subject, to give a statement of the reasons for an unauthorised arrest, he should be obliged under some kind of a penalty to hand in those reasons. His reasons may be utterly wrong, or quite incorrect, but if he gives a statement of his reasons that is all the clause requires. Surely there ought to be some penalty imposed on an officer for neglecting to furnish a statement. I would suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> that a penalty of £50 is a little too much, because under clause 202 the penalty for resisting or preventing an arrest is only £20. I think £20 is a moderate penalty. </para>

                    <para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator PULSFORD</inline>(New South Wales). - I cordially welcome the utterances of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor,</inline> because they explain very clearly the spirit in which this Bill has been drawn. It is drawn very much in the spirit of "headsI win, tails you lose." The Customs officers are to be on top all along, to have the power of arrest and to be able to do anything they choose; but there is to be no check upon them. I admit that one or two clauses allow punishment to the officers, but substantially they may do all sorts of things without any of those penalties attaching to them which the Bill requires to be dealt out to those who infringe the law. I admit that £50 is a considerable sum, therefore I am willing to make the penalty £20. </para>

                            <para>- If we are to put on every petty police officer a penalty of £20 or £50, because he neglects to do something which he ought to do, there will be no carrying on the machinery of police government. Supposing that a police officer catches a lascar or a petty officer red-handed with cigars, jewellery, or watches on his person, and he arrests him, but that, after he gets to the station, he has to rush away to arrest somebody else or to seize some goods which are being landed, and he keeps the man waiting for a statement for half-an-hour or an hour, when is the penalty to attach ?

                            <para>- What is the value of the provision unless it can be enforced? However, as there seems to be a strong objection to putting a penalty on a Customs officer under any circumstances, we might allow this matter to pass, now that the provision under which a man can be arrested is for smuggling alone. He would know at once that he had been so arrested. That being the case, and as there is such a strong objection to the amendment, the honorable senator will perhaps consent not to press it, but will leave it to the officer to do his duty. If he fails in this respect, he should suffer a more severe penalty than a mere reprimand. </para>

                        <para>- This clause provides, no doubt very properly, that before an action is brought against an officer notice 'shall be given. I am perfectly sure that no one will take exception to that. But there is no provision to meet the case where, owing to any unforeseen circumstances, or want of knowledge, notice has not been given within the time specified. It would be a matter of fairness in such a case to leave the power in the hands of a Judge - if he were satisfied that a person had a <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> cause of action, and had from inadvertence not given the notice - to extend the time. This would not be a novel proceeding, because under the Employers' Liability Act, where notice must be given within a limited time, power is placed in the hands of the Judge to extend the time under exceptional circumstances. The Judge would be very careful in exercising this power, because he would recognise that an officer should have the fullest possible notice of any action that is' to be brought. But it would be reasonable to have in the clause such a provision as I have just suggested, which would give the plaintiff an opportunity, where, through any unforeseen reason, notice had not been given in the proper time to being an action, after making application to the Judge. </para>

                        <para>- I agree to a great extent with the views of the last speaker, but I hardly think his remarks are applicable to the clause under consideration, which provides that no action shall be commenced against an officer until at least one month's notice has been given. This is not a limitation upon an individual taking his action within a certain time after the accrual of the cause of action. An amendment such as suggested would come in better under another clause. If there was a clause providing that no action should be taken against an officer for anything done in pursuance of this measure unless the action was commenced within 12 or18 months after the accrual of the cause of action, the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> would be to the point, but in this connexion there is no limit as to the time within which the individual has to bring his action. </para>

                        <para>- The amendment suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> might well be introduced at the conclusion of this clause. I suggest also that instead of the words " the defendant shall receive a verdict, with costs," it will be better to say " the plaintiff shall be non-suited." A man might bring an action without giving his notice properly, and might get a speedy trial in a local court. Thus he might yet have time to give a second notice, and it would be manifestly unfair that a verdict should be given against him because he had not complied with the law, when, if he were merely non-suited his remedy would not be gone, and he might still give fresh notice and bring a fresh action. To take away his remedy simply because he has not given the required notice while there may be time for him to give that notice seems to me rather an arbitrary procedure. </para>

                            <para>- The suggestion made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E</inline> wing, is a very reasonable one. But it is a matter entirely distinct from the suggestion I made with regard to the power of the Judge. I agree that that might well be dealt with, not by an alteration of the verbiage of the clause, but by an addition to the clause. In such a case as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ewing</inline> has suggested, it would be better that the clause should provide that the plaintiff should be non-suited rather than that the provision in the clause should remain as it stands. </para>

                        <para>- I think, the clause is better as it stands, and to accept the amendment suggested might simply lead to the piling up of litigation. If the plaintiff were non-suited because he had not given sufficient notice, he would have to pay costs ; but he would be able to make another attempt, and if that failed he would be able to make another. The result would be that the officers would be liable to be harassed by actions, and it would be impossible to know when a matter would be at an end. In dealing with a question of this kind, it is a ' good thing to put the rights of the members of the public and the rights of the Customs officers plainly upon the face of the statute. The person who brings an action knows before he goes into court what his rights are. He knows he must give notice, and must prove his case in accordance with that notice. He knows, too, that if he does not do that he will fail. The proposed amendment, however, would leave it open to bini, if he failed, to give notice to try again. Of course he must pay the costs of the action, if he fails, but that' might be a very small matter. There are scores of statutes in which a clause similar to this is found, but I know of none in which there is any such provision as is suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ewing.</inline> In all cases where notice is necessary, the failure to give the required notice is always held to be an absolute bar to the action. </para>

The principal Custom-house officials will have a very large number of officers under them. A person may come into court with a complaint that upon a certain day, so many months ago, he was improperly treated by a Customs officer. Where? notice is giving in writing, the Custom-house officials get an opportunity to make inquiries, and to find out the particular officer who was in charge on the occasion, referred to in the complaint. They are able to find out all the circumstances, and direct their proof to meet the case brought against them. A complaint may be made that on a certain day something took place, but months afterwards it may be impossible to identify the particular transaction,' and to ascertain whether a particular officer was in charge at the time or not ; but this proposal would place it in the. hands of any plaintiff to bring forward a claim when it would be impossible for the department to bring evidence to meet it. </para>

It is very necessary in such cases that notice should be provided for so that the Custom-house officials may have an opportunity to make necessary inquiries. The clause as it stands puts the department and the plaintiff in what is simply a fair position, and it is better to have the rights of the parties settled definitely once and for all. If the law is not complied with, the verdict should be with the defendant, and if it has been complied with the case for the plaintiff can go on on its merits. To adopt the amendment suggested might compel the Government or the officer complained of to prefer to pay an unjust claim to taking up time with it any longer. </para>

                        <para>- I entirely agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ewing</inline> in this amendment, and the reasons advanced by the honorable and learned senator should, in my opinion, appeal to every honorable senator. It is apparent that, in the exercise of the duties devolving upon the different Customhouse officers, there may frequently be instances in which hardship will be inflicted upon a private individual, and for which he may seek redress in the courts at his resort. The clause, as at present worded, favours the department inordinately, and regards very lightly the rights of the individual. I know from experience of cases of a similar character, where the defendant has been a company carrying on operations under Statute. The legal representatives of such defendants have always been ready to take advantage of any legal technicality of this kind that may arise. Under this clause, an individual who has been aggrieved by the action of a Custom-house officer, and brings forward a <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> claim, may have omitted to give the statutory notice, and may thus be absolutely prevented from pursuing his claim against the department, though he may have brought his action well within the period of limitation. He may,' under the Bill, commence his action within six months, but he may have begun it within three weeks, ignoring the fact that it was ° necessary for him to give at least one month's notice to the department. The clause provides that, because of this mistake, there is to be a verdict for- the defendant, with costs, and the plaintiff is absolutely debarred from taking advantage of the opportunities, that would be afforded him, under other circumstances, of bringing a fresh action during the remaining four and a half months. I have known cases of great injustice under a provision of a similar character, where private companies have been the defendant, and such injustice might be inflicted to a greater extent where a State department is the defendant. </para>

If he likes to go on, there will be a verdict against him. If he applies for a non-suit, or consents to be non-suited, or if the other side applies for a non-suit, he can be non-suited and he can bring another action. I have no objection to the clause being put in that way, because there will be an intimation on the face of it that a plaintiff, to succeed, must carry out these conditions. What I object to is to putting a label on the face of the clause that he shall be non-suited in default of this proof. I think it is very much better to leave the matter in the discretion of the court, as it will be,' under the ordinary procedure, and just intimate in the clause that the plaintiff, if he does not comply with the conditions, shall not be entitled to a verdict. I am willing to go to that extent if my honorable friend will accept that amendment.- It will cany out his object very much better than his .own proposal does, and it will then be open to the court to take any proceeding which is justified under the circumstances. </para></speech>

The amendment would, in the event of any inadvertence or mistake on the part of the plaintiff, still leave the door open to him to prosecute a cause of action if it were an honest and just one.

                    <para class="block">Provided always that the want of such notice shall be no bar to the maintenance of such action if on motion made for leave to proceed notwithstanding no such notice has been given a Judge should be of opinion that there was reasonable excuse for. such want of notice. </para>
                    <para class="block">There is a provision with regard to how it should be done if the action were brought in the District Court. It would be fair to put a proviso of this character at the end of the clause, so that if a Judge were satisfied that there was reasonable excuse for such want of notice, there would be no necessity then to let the plaintiff take a non-suit and give his notice after this, but it would give him an opportunity to have his case tried straight away. Of course it would always have to be in the opinion of the judge. Section. 7 of the Act gives power to amend a defect in the notice - </para>
                    <para>The court in which any action for recovery of compensation under this Act is commenced or is pending, may, at any stage of the proceedings, amend any defect in a notice of injury or death, or direct that the action shall proceed and be maintainable, notwithstanding that such notice has not been given duly if the Court, having regard to the circumstances of the case, thinks just so to direct. </para>
                    <para class="block">And section 8 contains this further provision - </para>
                    <para>No such notice shall be deemed invalid by reason of any defect or inaccuracy therein unless the judge who tries the action arising from the injury mentioned in the notice shall be of opinion that the defendant in the action is prejudiced, in his defence by such defector inaccuracy. Supposing that a man meets with an injury in the course of his employ, then every possible provision is made in the Act, consistent with fairness, to enable him to proceed with his action. While the employer is protected by it being necessary to commence the action within a limited period, and by the provision that notice shall be given, nevertheless if either of these things be omitted there is always power in the hands of the court, assuming that the action is commenced within a reasonable time, to get over the defects. In our Customs Act it would be reasonable to have a similar provision for an individual who felt himself aggrieved by any action of an officer, so that in the event of any mistake being made with regard to notice or times he should still be able to prosecute his action, always provided that he could satisfy a Judge that there was reasonable cause for his omission to give a notice, or that the defect in the notice was not of a character which would prejudice the defendant in any way. While it is necessary to be stringent with regard to actions brought against the Government for anything done by a Customs officer unless it is only reasonable that no technicality should be allowed to stand in the way of a man obtaining redress fora wrong he had sustained. The Crown, we know, fights its cases just as strongly and earnestly as does any private individual. I do not propose to submit an amendment until I hear what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> has to say of my suggestion. If he regards the principle as a fair and reasonable one to adopt I have no doubt that we can mould an amendment which will adequately conserve the rights of the Government, and at the same time protest a man who has a good cause of action from being defeated by a pure technicality. </para>

                        <para>- We have five clauses dealing with notice and regulating the conduct of these actions. I do not think we shall gain any advantage by spending an hour or two in striking out this clause, and embodying the provisions suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould,</inline> who, I think, will see on reflection that if there is one man who should not be shut out because he has not given notice, it is a man who brings an action under the ; Bill which he holds in his hand. I do not think that an Employers' Liability Act can fora moment be compared with a Customs Act. A constable or an officer is trying to do the best he can to prevent smuggling, and because, on some occasion,he goes a little too far, some trader or importer makes up his mind to go for him. The importer ought to know at once whether he has an honest action against the officer - whether the officer had any reasonable cause for arresting him, or for doing something else. There is no occasion to give this man more than a reasonable time ; he has six months in which to bring his action, and what more can he want <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> If he does not adhere strictly to the Act he is shut out, and rightly shut out, I think, because we are dealing with an officer of the Crown who is trying to collect the revenue, and who is surrounded by certain safeguards to which private litigants have no right. I do not think that a litigant who is trying to get damages out of a Customs officer, because he slightly exceeded his powers, has any right to be surrounded with the safeguards of those unfortunate men who may have an action under the Employers' Liability Act. The suggestion made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> carries out the spirit of the amendment. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ewing</inline> has certainly drawn attention to a blot in the clause; and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor,</inline> if he moves his amendment, will cure it. </para>

                            <para>- I cannot agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> as to the necessity for any provision similar to that in the Emplovers' Liability Act. The circumstances in the two cases are absolutely different. In framing that Act it became apparent, although it was fair that a man should give notice of cause of action, and that it should be delivered within a particular time, yet very often from the mere circumstance of the happening of the accident, the party might be incapable of giving the notice. At the very time when the notice ought to be given, he is either lying at death's door, or he and his family are in such trouble about the injury that the matter is likely to escape attention. A hundred and one things may happen which make it consonant only with mere justice that want of notice or a technical objection should not be allowed to stand in the way of the action, and ample powers are given to the Judge to amend the notice or allow the action to proceed without notice. But we are dealing with an entirely different state of things. The whole proceeding under the Employers' Liability Act shows that the amendment would mean a great multiplication of the expenses of litigation. Under that Act, before an action commences, the plaintiff is obliged to go to the court for permission to proceed without notice or to amend his notice. That cannot be done without the expenditure of money and time. Surely we do not want to introduce unnecessarily this lengthening of proceedings ; and it is certain that if the principle of the Employers' Liability Act is adopted this will follow. A provision similar to this is in almost every Act which imposes duties on the servants of the Government. In almost all these Acts there is provision for the protection of the officers, in that an action should not be brought against them without notices containing certain particulars. But in very few, if any, of these Acts is there a provision similar to that in the Employers' Liability Act. The cause of action under the Bill is a perfectly simple one. The injury does not incapacitate the person aggrieved from giving notice, and he knows what he is claiming. To go beyond the simple requirements of the clause, and to put it in the power of either party to go on with protracted litigation, is beyond the necessities of the position. In a Bill of this sort we ought to make the rights of the parties as clear and definite as possible, and so fix them that there can be no misunderstanding. I cannot fall in with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould's</inline> amendment ; but, in regard to the other matter, I would suggest that the amendment which I have foreshadowed will really carry out <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ewing's</inline> wishes, but in a way which will give more liberty in dealing with the matter in court. </para>

                    <para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator EWING</inline>(Western. Australia). - I am quite willing to withdraw my amendment. In regard to the other matter, however; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> is apparently under the impression that only one class of action will arise against an officer of the Customs. If, however, an officer has a large number of men in his employ, and one of them is killed or injured in carrying out his instructions, the injured party or his representatives have to bring an action and to give notice. </para>

                            <para>- Under ordinary circumstances the Government itself would be sued, but the whole policy of the Bill contemplates that the proceedings must be against the officer whom the Government had appointed. If the collector, for instance, stops my goods, I have to sue him, and give him notice ; and if a man is killed in carrying out dangerous duties under the instructions of the collector, where is the distinction <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> It is something done in the exercise of his office, and it seems to me there is a close analogy between the two cases. If goods are seized at Wyndham, in Western Australia, the merchant in Perth may not hear of the occurrence for months. All that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Major Gould</inline> is asking for is that the court may use its discretion in regard to the notice if there are circumstances which excuse want of notice. A man may be wrongly arrested in the northern parts of Western Australia or Queensland, far away from any place where he can get legal advice, and he may be, perhaps, locked up for months under an action taken by an officer of the Government, and thus rendered incapable of giving notice. These are the very cases to which an exception of the kind is intended to apply. Such a man would probably not know of the existence of this law, and to say that he is to be deprived of all his legal remedies simply because he has been kept in prison, seems one of the most monstrous propositions ever put before a legislative body. If a Judge is satisfied that circumstances have intervened which render it impracticable to give notice, he should have power of dispensing with the notice. A man in the back-blocks cannot get hold of a Commonwealth Act, and find out exactly what he has to put into the notice, and yet, if the notice is not exactly in accord with the clause, his claim is to be cast out. The power to rectify errors and dispense with formalities should be given to the Judge, if he be satisfied that the justice of the case calls for such a course. It is easy for us to say that a man ought to know the provisions of an Act, but in practice it is impossible for the people in Australia to know the laws of the country ; and to say that, because a man does not give notice, the remedies for wrongs done him must go to the winds, is not consonant with twentieth-century justice. </para>

                    <para>That the following words be added to the clause : - " Provided always that the want of such notice shall be no bar to the maintenance of such action, if upon motion for leave to proceed, notwithstanding no such notice has been given, a Judge of the High Court of Australia, or of the Supreme Court of the State in which such action is commenced, shall be of opinion that there was. reasonable excuse for such want of notice." </para>
                    <para class="block">I think that is practically the wording of the provision in the Employers' Liability Act.. I propose this proviso so as to enable the Judge of the High Court of Australia or the Judge of the Supreme Court of the State in which the action is commenced to have power to allow the action to go on, notwithstanding that the notice has not been given, supposing that there is reasonable excuse for such want of notice. It will be observed that I provide that the Judge must be satisfied that the application is a reasonable one before giving permission. The Employers' Liability Act also contains provisions enabling the notice to he amended if it be defective in form and substance, provided that the amendment would not be to the prejudice of the defendant. What was said in opposition to this proposal a little time ago, by the "Vice-President of the Executive Council has been very effectively, I think, answered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ewing,</inline> who pointed out several instances in which an injustice might be done to the individual. While I know that the committee very naturally want to amply safeguard the Customs, yet I am sure that honorable senators are averse to doing anything unjust, and if anything like what I propose can be reasonably provided for it should be done. The only fear is that the committee, in their desire to frame the Bill in such a way as to make it a terror to evil-doers, may err on the side of too great stringency. There is no probability of their erring on the side of too great leniency, judging from the debates that have hitherto taken place. But while we should see that the law is made stringent against wrong-doers, provision should be made amply to protect the man who honestly believes that he has a cause of action against the Government  or against an officer for something done in the execution of his duty. My proposal by no means takes from the strength of the measure, but rather strengthens it. Our <inline font-style="italic">duty</inline> is to make the measure as strong as we can, consistent with fairness to the individual. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> drew a distinction between an Act like the Employers' Liability Act and "the Customs law. I admit that there is a difference ; but both under the Employers' Liability Act and a Customs law, an endeavour should be made to do justice to the individual </para>

                            <para>- Yes, and I do not propose to interfere with that limit. But surely the Judge should be able to say whether there has been an honest mistake, and whether there is a fair and reasonable ground why the action should proceed, notwithstanding the absence of the proper notice. The individual has no opportunity of repairing a mistake unless there is some proviso of the character I propose. I have no doubt that, except in the very exceptional cases mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ewing</inline> as to actions that may be brought a long distance away from the centres, there would generally be ample time for a man to give his notice, and the Judge would say so. But it may be discovered after the six months have gone by that the law has not been properly complied with. </para>

                            <para>- No ; my proposal is only to enable an action to be proceeded with, notwithstanding that notice has not been given. An action may have been commenced within the six months, and it may turn out that no notice, or no notice conformable to the Act, has been given. Then the Judge cam say, "Here is a clear mistake," and he may allow the action to proceed, notwithstanding that the proper notice has not been given. If the Judge considers that there is a reasonable excuse for such want of notice, the proposal leaves it absolutely within his power to dispense with it. We can surely trust a Judge of the High Court with a power like this. I am convinced that no Judge would allow the notice required by statute to be dispensed with unless he was satisfied that there were very strong reasons to justify the waiving of the notice. </para>

                            <para>- No. If it could be shown to the court that a man had slept on his rights for five months, the Judge would not grant the order. In an enormous territory like ours there must be Customs officers here, there, and everywhere in remote parts, and it may be a long time before the man can communicate with the centre and obtain' advice, so that it is only reasonable to give a wide margin in the event of any mistake happening. If the Government like to say that they will extend the time to twelve months, the reason for this proposal would be removed at once. This power could only be brought into force in the event of the Judge being satisfied that a man had not slept on his rights. </para>

                            <para>- I must oppose this amendment, and I shall give my reasons- very shortly. What is the object of these clauses with which we are now dealing? It is. to protect the officer who has the administration of the measure. The officer is carrying out his duties day by day, dealing with hundreds of cases and. hundreds of persons, probably, in a busy place. Why do we want to protect the officer, and why do we treat him in a different way from that in which we treat an ordinary individual ? For the reason that he lias a multiplicity of transactions with the public, and deals with an enormous number of persona -in the course of a day : and, if his attention is not directed ' to the circumstances immediately after the event, it is very likely that he may not be able to meet the charges made against him. lt can be easily understood that if we definitely lay down in this Bill that there shall be six. months' notice of any action, the officer will know what he is about; but, if this provision is added, it means that the case may be. brought up some considerable time afterwards, when the whole of the circumstances may have gone out of the officer's memory. In other words, this proviso means; that instead of settling the rights of the parties definitely in the Statute, we shall leave it to the Judge to decide whether there ought or ought not to be a notice. If this is done .we simply fritter away the protection given by the Bill for the purpose of enabling officers to do their duty. The officers have no interest in the matter except to do their duty. They make no profit out of it. If' an officer in doing his duty knows that if a complaint is to be made against him it must be made within six months,. and that there* must be definite- notice of what the complaint -is, and that the- action can only be on that cause of complaint, his position is well defined. But if this proviso is allowed to stand, a person cao. bring his action many months afterwards -without giving notice at all, because the person making, the complaint can go to the court, for an extension of time. That means a multiplication of legal proceedings, and enables persons to sleep on their rights, instead of looking. into, the -law and understanding what their rights are, and acting accordingly. The Employers' Liability Act is quoted in justification of this proposal. </para>

                    <para class="block">But the principle upon which that exception rests is that, from the very nature of the injury itself, a man may be incapacitated from giving, his notice. That does not apply hem. With regard to the argument of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ewing,</inline> that the cause of action may take place in the centre of Australia, I reply that that cannot be a hardship, because the notice has to be served, not on the comptroller or any officer at the centre of departmental administration, but on the officer of whom the complaint is made. What hardship can there be in that ? I presume that if a man is injured he can serve his notice within a short time upon the man who has- injured him. With regard to the argument as to the man knowing, nothing about the law, no one knows better than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ewing</inline> that that is not an excuse. It would be a very- bad thing, indeed if ignorance of the law . were permitted to be an excuse. The laws are passed, and every one may acquaint himself with them. It is to be assumed that every one does- know the law. Especially is that the case with regard to a law of this kind, when a person is dealing, with the Customs. It is very easy for him to ascertain what his rights are. I hope the- committee will not assent to this amendment, for the reasons I have given. After all, we have to consider what is the main object of the clause, and the main object of this clause is to protect the officer and prevent him being harassed. If the clause is carried as it stands, it will effect that object without doing any injustice to the person who may be injured, and if it is not carried as proposed we shall fritter away the protection of the officer and establish opportunities for piling up costs and litigation. </para>

                        <para>- I have had a good deal of experience of these notices, and I really feel that the clause as it stands is the best means of piling up costs and harassing .everybody concerned that was ever invented. I take a much stronger view of these so-called notices of action than J have yet 'heard expressed. I entirely disbelieve- in them. I see no more reason why these highly technical notices of action should be: given in the cases of officials, police officers,- justices, and so on, than in the ordinary cases of controversy that arise between man and man. That there should be some kind of notice - a letter-before-action sort of business - every one will agree, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> knows as well as anybody else that there never has been a more fertile source of technical argument in courts of justice than these notices of action. They have been a constant source of delay and expense in courts of. justice. I do not regard the existence of these notices as any protection to the officer. The protection to the officer is the limitation of six months.No man, however injured he may be, is entitled to bring an action against an officer who may have done him the greatest injustice - seized his goods, personally arrested him without reasonable cause - after six months. These officers must not be harassed too much, and we must not put them in the position of being liable to actions for a long period of time, when the suspense would itself be intolerable. What is this notice for ? It is not for the purpose of enabling the officer to get up his defence, but simply for the purpose of enabling him to do what a defendant might desire to do - tender amends. It is exactly the same thing as occurs under the Employers' Liability Act, in which there is a thoroughly just provision to enable the. employer to tender amends in respect to an injury done to his servant. Suppose some ignorant man gives a notice which is defective. The Bill says that the cause of action must be stated in the notice, and those of us who happen to know a little of law know that the cause of action is one of the most difficult questions to be settled in considering notices of this kind. I know of a case at the present moment where a man, who has a perfectly honest claim, has sustained an injury, and is prevented from recovering because of a defect in his notice of action, which is not stated in a sufficiently technical way. My honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor;</inline> asks why we should bring in a Judge to decide this thing ? But we bring in a Judge as it is. We provide that the cause of action must be clearly and definitely stated, and, unless it is so stated, evidence is not to be admitted. Who is to decide but the Judge whether it is clearly and definitely stated ? If he says it is not clearly and definitely stated, that, is equivalent to a decision that it is not a valid notice at all. The only effect of this amendment will be to give the Judge a little further discretion, and enable him to prevent injustice being done to a man who may have a valid claim to compensation. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">If we intrust a Judge with the powers already intrusted to him by these two clauses; of deciding whether the notice is sufficient or not, surely we may trust him to say whether or not the giving of a notice should not be excused, if no injustice is done to the defendant. But the plaintiff must not exceed the six months' limit. If a complainant has neglected his interests, and allowed five months to expire before he gives his notice, it will not matter how it is worded, because the expiration of the six months will bar his action. It is a fair thing that a little further discretion should be intrusted to the courts to secure justice to both parties. </para>

                        <para>- The object of the amendment is, as far as possible, to secure justice being done, and to secure that where there is a fair case a man shall not be thrust out of court simply because of some unavoidable or unexpected delay that has occurred. It appears to me that that is a very reasonable proposal. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> has asked whether there is any precedent for such an amendment. I do not know whether it is a precedent, but I may quote a case from my experience under the Victorian Customs Act, which occurred a good many years ago. A case was brought against the collector, and the action was defended by the Crown. The Chief Justice tried the case with a jury, and the evidence was unmistakably in favour of the plaintiffs. The Chief Justice summed up unmistakably in favour of the plaintiffs, and the jury brought in a unanimous verdict in his favour. We thought the whole matter was over, when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Webb,</inline> subsequently <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Webb, quietly called attention to a clause in the Customs Act requiring the action to be brought within a certain time, and he pointed out that it had been brought one day after that time had expired. As a consequence the case was lost, and the plaintiff had to pay£1,500 in costs. There is a case in which there was an absolute denial of justice because the Judge had not power to extend the time allowed by one clay. </para>

I have quoted this case as an instance in which it was recognised by the Chief Justice and by the jury that justice was on the side of the plaintiffs, and yet they lost the case because of the delay of a day which occurred in consequence of protracted negotiations between the traders on the one side and the Ministry on the other. </para>

                    <para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator KEATING</inline>(Tasmania). - I entirely support the principle involved in the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Major Gould.</inline> It seems to me that the opposition to it is based upon a misapprehension of its object. It is not contemplated to affect in the least degree the administration of the department. An officer may have exceeded the bounds of discretion in the discharge of his duty, and thereby injured a private individual, and he may be proceeded against under the terms of the statute within a period of six months from the accrual of the cause of action. It appears to me that "the officer is sufficiently protected by the limitation of six months, and in endeavouring to protect him we should be exceedingly careful that we do not at the same time too much trench upon the rights and privileges of individuals. Under ordinary circumstances an aggrieved individual would have two, three, or, perhaps, six years within which to bring his action ; . but here he is absolutely limited to six months, and there is this notice, which is a condition precedent to the maintenance of the action. The object of the amendment is that the Judge before whom the matter comes may take into consideration the whole of the circumstances, and say whether or not it is excusable that such a condition has not been complied with. Taking the whole of the provisions of the Bill into consideration, I think the Customs department is amply protected in these matters. If an individual is guilty of any violation of any of the provisions of the Bill, a prosecution may be instituted against him so long afterwards as a period of five years; and when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> asks why this notice should not be given, in order that the defendant may be able to prepare his evidence to meet a case presented against him, we might ask with equal force why an individual against whom a charge was brought by the Customs department should not have a similar degree of protection. </para>
                    <para class="block">Why should he be asked four years and nine months after an offence is alleged to have been committed to get his witnesses together to meet the charge which may be levelled against him ? I look upon the notice of action as a preliminary condition which is more or less of a technical character, and one in respect to which we can very well give the Judges the discretion of deciding whether the absence of notice is of such importance in the particular case that it should be considered an indispensable or a dispensable condition precedent. I support the principle of the amendment. </para>

In this clause there is nothing with regard to the collection of anything except any Tariff or Tariff alteration contemplated by this Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- I am sorry to say that I cannot give <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> the information which he asks for. I do hot see that the clause has anything to do with the question of what duties are to be collected, or under what statutes or sanction they are to be collected. It does not authorize any collection or anything to be done. It simply protects the officer of the Customs as to the time of bringing an action for a certain kind of illegality. This is a permanent Customs Regulation Bill which is to apply to any proposed Tariff or any proposed alteration of the Tariff, not only in this session, but in any future session. It is not limited to any particular set of circumstances or any particular illegality. It is a well-known constitutional usage to begin to collect the duties under a proposed Tariff immediately that Tariff is laid on the table of the House, and to afterwards legalize what has been done. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">The obvious necessity for a course of that kind has rendered the usage constitutional. If that were not done, and those who deal in imported goods had three or four months in which to make arrangements while the Tariff discussion was going on, there would be very little revenue to collect. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> asks me whether the clause will legalize the collection of duties under a uniform Tariff before there is an Act enabling that to be done, and whether it will also protect the Customs officer in the collection at the same time of the duties imposed by the Tariff Acts of the different States. My answer is that it will protect the officer in any illegality committed for the protection of the revenue in the course of collecting the tariff. Whatever the . illegality may be, it is covered by this clause, so long as the officer is acting for the protection of the revenue in the collection of any proposed Tariff or proposed Tariff alteration. It would be quite impossible for me to make a statement in regard to what the intentions of the Government are in the collection of duties ; but as to the clause itself, it is one that is necessary, and I hope it will be passed unanimously. </para>
                    <para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator CLEMONS</inline>(Tasmania).- My attitude is in no sense hostile to the clause, and any questions I have put, or any criticisms I may offer on the clause tend in the direction of making certain that the Government have the power which obviously they want. I wish for no indication on the part of the Government as to what is intended in the Tariff, but it may be desirable, and positively imperative to collect the higher of two duties, which may be a States duty, and personally I have grave doubts whether the clause, as worded, would enable that to be done. </para>

A Tariff will have to be brought down which will ultimately be uniform, but in the meantime its incidence will be the enforcing of the highest Tariff in each one of the States. I have, therefore, taken the view throughout that it matters very little whether the clause be carried or not ; because, without being in the confidence of the Government, or knowing their views, I think it absolutely necessary for the prevention of fraud on the new Tariff, to have an act of authority which it will be absolutely impossible for us to legislatively provide for, but which it will be quite possible for us to subsequently ratify. I think the clause is some protection, and all the protection we can give, and I support it for what it is worth. </para>

                        <para>- We can readily understand the object of the Government in inserting the clause. We cannot blind our eyes to the fact that we shall be put in the position of having a Tariff that is not uniform ; but, whether it will be necessary to collect both State and Commonwealth Tariffs, is another question. On that there seems a difference of opinion, but we can readily forecast what the Government will do under, a provision of that character. They will collect on the proposed Tariff where that is the higher of the two," and where the State Tariff is the higher, they will collect the State Tariff under the State laws as they exist to-day, and, no doubt, when the Tariff has been finally dealt with, will refund any moneys over-collected. We must recognise the fact that we shall be labouring under the same trouble as now, that of the Inter-State duties, which we want to see abolished as early as possible. </para>

There is such a tempting field for discussion opened by what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> has said just now, that we may be led away, and take up a great deal of time with matters irrelevant to the clause. All the clause provides for is the protection of the officer in anything he may do for the protection of the revenue in relation to any Tariff. It is quite irrelevant to discuss those other matters as to whether it is desirable to have Inter-State free-trade or not ; and I would suggest that the discussion be kept strictly within the limits of clause 217,because we all wish to get through the Bill to-night, if possible. </para>

                            <para>- I do not propose to go into a dissertation in regard to the establishment of InterState free-trade, but we must not blind our eyes to the effect of the provision. The Government will collect duties on the borders of the States, as well as on the borders of the Commonwealth. The clause proposes that nothing shall be done until after the close of the session, but we have no assurance as to how long the session is going to last. We are required to have a session each year, but I was member of a Legislature in which a session lasted 13 months. We must bear in mind, therefore, that we are possibly suspending a person's cause of action for some indefinite period. I admit at once that there is a necessity for doing something, and I am not prepared to propose anything more satisfactory than the course suggested by the Government. But I want the committee to realize what the effect will be if they pass the clause as it stands. </para>

                        <para>- The Government are extremely desirous to protect their officers, but I share with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> the fear that this clause will not protect them in the direction desired. Therefore I urge upon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> that he should think over the matter again. The clause distinctly says ' ' any Tariff or Tariff alteration proposed by this Parliament." What is to be feared is that this will not protect officers in the collection of duties under State Tariffs. That is a point really worth considering; and even if we spend a little time over it, so long as we finally give to the officers that protection which we all desire to give, the time will not be wasted. </para>

                            <para>- I have no doubt whatever that this clause will give all the necessary protection. The clause has been considered with exceeding care. As honorable senators no doubt are aware, Other methods were suggested at first of dealing with thisquestion,andfinally, after a great deal of consideration, this has been determined upon as the best method of getting over the difficulty that must arise in dealing with the uniform Tariff. It will be observed that the protection is for anything done in the collection of the revenue in respect of "any Tariff or Tariff alterations." Even if it is proposed to collect the State duty where it is highest, or the uniform duty where that is highest, this clause clearly protects the Customs officers. The proposal simply means that it being necessary to do certain things for the collection of the revenue, what is done for that purpose is protected. I can assure honorable senators that this clause, in the opinion of the Government, will carry out the object we aim at. </para>

                        <para>- This clause has necessarily received considerable attention at the hands of importers generally. The best legal opinion has been taken upon it, and that opinion is that the clause will not fully carry out what is intended. I do not think there can be any doubt that for a time two duties will have to be collected, namely, the existing duties, which we may call the State duties, and the duties under the Tariff brought in by the Commonwealth Government. The proposal I have to submit to the Minister, as the result of a legal opinion which has been taken, is that the clause should be slightly altered, so as to read as follows : - </para>

                    <para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator CLEMONS</inline>(Tasmania). - Of course, we all know that the protection sought to be secured to the officer is to be extended where the officer proposes to collect duties which may be higher than the duties proposed by the Federal Government. The persons called upon to pay those duties may object to do so, because they have not been passed into law by the Federal Parliament. The clause, however, provides for the case where an importer objects to pay the duty imposed by the Commonwealth, and the officer insists upon his paying it. It protects the officer, no matter what the ultimate duty on the particular article may be. It is perfectly adequate to protect the officer with regard to the Commonwealth Tariff. But something else has to be contemplated as possible - that is, the collection by the Customs officers of the existing State duty, because it happens to be higher than the Commonwealth duty. In that case the protection which ought to be given to the officer is not given by this clause. The clause directly limits his protection to the collection of higher duties than are ultimately imposed by the Commonwealth Parliament. That is a protection which Customs officers have the right to expect. But I. suggest that something more than that is needed, and that the object would be met by making it read as follows : - </para>

                            <para>- What I suggest secures the protection of the officer if he collects a Tariff not proposed in this Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> may say that the Commonwealth is now collecting the Tariffs in existence in the various States. But those Tariffs are not Tariffs which come within the description of the words of this clause. They are not Tariffs imposed by this Parliament. I urge upon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> the necessity of securing protection to the officers in the collection of existing Tariffs.' The words suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Frederick</inline> Sargood were " existing Tariffs." I would sooner see them modified so as to refer distinctly to any existing State Tariff. We' can, I think, safely call them Tariffs existing in any of the States. An importer may object to pay a duty because it exists in a Tariff that is merely tabled, and which has not become law. This clause will protect the officer who insists upon the payment of that duty. An importer may also say, "I object to pay a duty which is imposed by the Tariff of any particular State, and shall only pay the duty which is in the Tariff tabled in the Commonwealth Parliament." There is a clear line of objection on the part of the importer,- just as strong as his objection to the duty mentioned in the Tariff that is merely tabled. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> will recognise that unless some alteration is made, that objection will be made on all hands. </para>

                            <para>- I understand that the objection is-that while the protection is given to the officer for collecting under a Tariff which is not yet altered by law, no. protection is given to him for the collection of duty under a Tariff under existing Acts. Well, it is absolutely unnecessary to give the officer any such protection. I will assume that there goes on the collection of a uniform Tariff which is not yet authorized by law. The officer wants protection for that. Suppose, at the same time, that there goes on in certain cases the collection of duties under the existing Tariffs. That is legal. The existing Tariff Acts are not repealed, and the Commonwealth is now collecting duties under them, and will be collecting duties under them until they are expressly or impliedly repealed. The mere fact of collecting duties upon some other basis, which may be in addition to these, and which are not authorized by law, does not render illegal the collection of duties authorized by the existing Tariffs. I have not the slightest doubt that that is the position, and for that reason we have found it necessary to provide for the protection of the officers with respect to what they do in the collection of duties imposed by the Tariff which is not yet authorized by Parliament. With regard to anything "done under existing statutes, no such protection is needed. With regard to the question of collecting uniform duties at the same time as the State duties, does the collection of those duties render nugatory or invalid the existing Acts ? I have no doubt it does not, and therefore no protection is necessary in the collection of duties under existing Acts. Under the circumstances, I hope the committee will see that there is no need to go beyond what we have done already to secure the protection of the officers. As to what the protection of the officers is, we have not taken away the right of action against an officer ; we have only postponed it under certain conditions. If the party who makes the complaint thinks fit, he may make an application foi1 security against the officer, and if the officer does not give security, the action may go on at once. If the officer does give security, the action is postponed until after the end of the session in which the Tariff is proposed. I have thought it well to state my view, and it is the view of the Government, that the -protection here given to the officer is ample. </para>

Of course the responsibility rests with the Government. Their desire is the same as ours, to afford protection to the officer in the collection of duties under a uniform Tariff or any alteration of the Tariff, not necessarily in this session of the Commonwealth Parliament, but in any session of the Commonwealth Parliament. If the Government are satisfied that this clause, as framed, will carry that into effect, I think my honorable friends may be satisfied to let it rest there.

It would be more difficult to conceive of anything which an officer might do, which would not be included in this clause, than to enumerate the things which should be included under it. This is a provision which has never appeared before in any Customs Act, but although that is so, it has always been regarded as part of the ordinary law in connexion with the administration of this particular department of executive government. It is a distinct improvement and advance in legislation to put this plainly and clearly in a Customs Bill, because then we know exactly, and the Customs department know exactly, how we stand. We know that the imposition of a Tariff. by Executive act would be, from the point of view of constitutional law, an entirely illegal proceeding, and an action might be brought in regard to it. We know that it is followed by an act of indemnity, and an action brought might be avoided by a judicious step on the part of the court to stay proceedings until the legislation is complete. That would be a perfectly legitimate exercise of discretion on the part of the court. I think this clause one of the best provisions we have in this Bill so far as it departs from the ordinary form of a Customs Bill. It is very wide in its operation, and as the Government are satisfied with it, I think my honorable and learned friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> might withdraw his amendment. </para>

It is because that would not be legal imposition of duty that we need the clause to protect the officers, for the Federal Tariff, being collected under those circumstances, would not, as we all admit, be a legal imposition of the Tariff. </para>

                            <para>- Surely it has been admitted that though this has been done constitutionally for a hundred years, it has not been a legal collection of the duty. That has already been decided in the Stevenson case, in Victoria, in which it was shown that the duty paid could be recovered by action. This clause 2 1 7 is to deal with the bringing of an action. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> has pointed out, the duties under all the State Tariffs will be collected by virtue of Acts, none of which will be repealed until the Federal Tariff is passed into law by an Act repealing the State Acts, and therefore, as I understand it, SenatorClemons' amendment could not be necessary, because whatever duty is collected by virtue of a State Act is absolutely a collection according to law. Several honorable senators ' have seemed to imply that when the Federal Tariff is laid upon the table there will be a collection of duties under it and possibly also the collection of higher duties in the Tariffs of the different States. I venture to hope that no such proceeding or practice will take place. As I understand the law, no differential Tariff, or no Tariff which is not absolutely uniform, ought to be laid upon the table, and it appears to me that to lay a uniform Tariff upon the table and then to commence to collect duties which are not uniform would be an absolute violation of the Constitution. I hope that whatever takes place, that will not take place, and that some such suggestion as was made by the honorable and learned members for Bendigo and Indi will be adopted to secure such an imposition of duties as will bring about Inter-State free-trade. </para>

                    <para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir JOSIAH</inline>SYMON (South Australia). - The only justification for the honorable and learned senator's long speech is his nervous dread of having the high duties existing at present collected for one moment longer than they ought to he. The point emphasized by the Vice-President of the Executive Council is that we have existing now in each State an equal Tariff, and lawfully the duties under those Tariffs may be collected. If the duties' under the Commonwealth Tariff are collected and they are lower than the existing duties that will be a concession in each case to the person called upon to pay duty. </para>

                            <para>- It would be perfectly legal to collect the duties of the lower Tariff. What I rose to say was that my honorable and learned friend must not assume that he is right in saying that everybody admits that the collection by Executive minute of the Tariff which may be imposed will not be an imposition of the Tariff within the meaning of our Constitution. I do not admit that it will not be such an imposition. On the contrary, there is a very great deal to be said in favour of the collection of the Tariff by Executive authority being held to be an imposition of the Tariff for the purposes of our Constitution, so as to enable Inter-State free-trade to come simultaneously into operation. </para>

                        <para>- I rise to propose certain amendments, which will bring the clause more into agreement with the provisions in the English law. In England an Act was passed in 1890, which very considerably mitigated the harshness of the forfeiture provisions. When this Bill was in the other House the Minister of Trade and Customs expressed his intention of putting in some provisions in accordance with the English Act, but he did not do so. That Act made very important alterations. In the first place,, it limited total forfeiture to vessels of under 250 tons burden; and then with regard to offences connected with ships exceeding 250 tons burden, the penalty was limited to a fine of £50, with power, if the commissioners were not satisfied that it was an adequate penalty, to bring the ship into court with a view to a fine of not exceeding £500 being inflicted. </para>

                        <para>- The power of forfeiture of a ship is a power which has existed, and is used, I think, under all systems of Custom-houses. The power exists in England and in all the States. It is quite true that it is not very often exercised, but when it has to be exercised, it does seem to me that it is just as fairly exercisable in regard to a ship of 500 tons or 1,000 tons, as it is in regard to a ship of 250 tons. </para>

I am quite aware that my honorable colleague did make a promise to restrict the tonnage of the vessel, but not in this way. The proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford,</inline> so far as I understand it, is to restrict the tonnage in the case of sub-clause (4) to 250 tons but I do not feel disposed to accept off-hand an amendment of this very sweeping character. If you limit the powers of the clause in this way, you will certainly make it very hard indeed on the owners of small ships. </para>

                            <para>- Undoubtedly, you make it relatively harder - and very generally the owners are men who make their living in their own ships. In the case of large ships, all the remedy given is the remedy of detention, as I gather from the proposal, pending the obtaining of the money, or until approved security for its payment is given. The proposal has not been circulated, and I do not see that I can accept it at present. I would like to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford's</inline> explanation of it. He has explained very shortly what it is ; that is to say, he has referred to the English Act, which he has had the courtesy to hand to me. But I should like to hear his views as to why the proposal he substitutes for forfeiture should be adopted. If he had any difficulty as to the wording of the clause I would not have any objection to- recommit it, but I certainly think we may discuss it to-night. </para>

                    <para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator PULSFORD</inline>(New South Wales). - The reason why there should be a distinction made between small vessels and large vessels, is that the trouble with smuggling and the various other offences mentioned in the sub-clauses are found to be almost wholly due to small vessels. In the case of the big vessels which come to our ports any trouble of that character is almost impossible. In England this has been recognised, and it has been felt to be an absurdity that any provision should exist in an Act whereby a vessel which was worth hundreds of thousands of pounds might be liable to forfeiture if there was some little infraction of the law, which might be easily brought about under some of the conditions mentioned in the six sub-clauses. A big steamer worth hundreds of thousands of pounds might be used by some sailor or passenger for the purpose of smuggling; and that a vessel of that character should be liable to forfeiture is ridiculous. It would never be carried out. I only propose to bring the clause more into accord with conditions which would be carried out. The English Act is a justification for the removal of a great many of the harsh conditions in the Bill, and for the attitude which I and other honorable senators have taken with regard to harsh clauses. Considering, however, that the amendment as drafted gives power to inflict a fine twice that allowed by the English Act, namely, £1,000, I think I have erred on the side of harshness rather than on the side of leniency in this case. </para>

                        <para>- I think I can point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> why the amendment is worth his serious consideration. The first reason I would suggest to him is, that the clause as it stands proposes to punish the ship, not according to the gravity of the offence, but according to her size. The offence may be of exactly the same gravity if it is committed on board a ship of 250 tons as if it is committed on board a ship of 10,000 tons. In one case the penalty will be the value of the ship of 250 tons, which you may put down at £1,000 ; in the other case the penalty will be a sum equal to about £500,000. A provision which punishes the offence in that way is one which we ought not to tolerate. This matter had very serious consideration in England, and the provision in the English </para>

                    <para class="block">Customs Consolidation Act of 1876 was evidently found to be so inequitable and so Oppressive that a special Act was passed in 1890 which altered the penalty, and provided that the forfeiture of any vessel should not take place where the tonnage exceeded 250 tons register. I have no doubt that the reason which actuated the framers of the amending Act was partly the reason I have suggested - that the offence should be punished <inline font-style="italic">qua</inline> the offence, not <inline font-style="italic">qua</inline> the size of the ship on which it was committed.

                    <para>It is obvious that on a large boat it will be practically impossible for the owners to make it quite certain that some felonious person on board shall not commit the offences laid down in the Bill, while, in the case of a small boat of 250 tons register and under, it is obvious to all of us that the owner or master would be much more in control of the boat and of every one on her. I can quite understand why the distinction has been drawn. It has been held in a rough sort of way that in the case of a boat of small tonnage the owner or master ought to be held to be in entire control of what is going on. But when you get to a boat of 10,000 tens, it seems to me a monstrous tiling that there should be forfeiture, at any rate, for an offence under sub-clause (4). If the clause were enforced literally, with all the powers it contains, it would be possible to forfeit to His Majesty a boat of 10,000 tons worth £500,000, because some passenger, or if you like some of the crew, threw some goods overboard to prevent seizure by the Customs. A power of this sort seems to be monstrous. I cannot see that you have any right to impose a penalty of £500,000 because that happens. Yet the clause provides for a penalty of at least £500,000. There are plenty of ships whose value can easily be assessed at such a sum, and if an offence is committed by somebody on board over whom, perhaps, neither the captain nor any officer has any immediate control, to mulct the owner in a penalty of that sort seems to me an utterly preposterous proceeding. If there was no other provision to object to, I should offer the most strenuous objection I could to sub-clause (4). </para>

By what process of reasoning can he justify the infliction of a penalty not in regard to the offence but in regard to the size of the ship on which it is committed ? I cannot believe that he is going to insist on the clause standing as it is. I would suggest to him that however reluctant he may be to have the clause postponed, it is well worth being postponed, unless he can adopt the amendment as it is. It must be desirable to have some limit as to the size of the ship which can be forfeited. </para>

                            <para>- My honorable friend goes much beyond that. The scheme of the clause is that it provides that certain ships which are used in certain ways shall be forfeited to His Majesty. The governing words at the beginning of the clause, which the honorable senator wishes to amend, apply to the whole of the six paragraphs. The English Act only applies to one, namely, paragraph 4. As to that, the English Act provides that no ship shall be liable to be forfeited on account of goods being thrown overboard unless such ship shall be of not more than 250 tons burden. I am quite willing to consent to an amendment limiting paragraph 4, so that any ship of not more than 200 tons reputed tonnage may be forfeited. The reason for that, as pointed out by </para>
                        </talk.start>
                    </continue>
                    <para class="block"><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons,</inline>is that if goods are stowed on board a ship as part of the cargo, the owner must have something to say to it, but goods may be simply thrown overboard, it may be by a passenger or a member of the crew, or some one not connected with the owners. There may be a very good reason for restricting the tonnage in that case, and as my colleague, the Minister for Customs, has promised in another place to make the restriction in this particular, I have no objection to it. But see how it would operate if applied all round. There are a number of offences mentioned in the clause. One is that any ship having false bulkheads, false bows, sides, or bottoms, or any secret or disguised place may be forfeited. We all know that these devices are used. I am instructed by a gentleman who is here from the Customs office that there was a case not very long ago in which a foreign barque of 1,000 tons came here fitted with most ingenious devices for running cargo. She had artistic pictures hanging on the walls, perfectly innocent in appearance; but when they were removed it was found that behind them were the handiest places imaginable for the concealment of brandy, cigars, and other goods. All over the ship there were places, part of the ship's fittings, for the concealment of dutiable articles. These hiding places were calculated to baffle the most astute Customs officer, and were fitted up especially for the purposes of smuggling. Why should such a ship, because she is of 1,000 tons burden, escape, while the barque or schooner of 250 tons, which is perhaps her owner's only means of living, is forfeited? What justice is there in entirely forfeiting the 250-ton ship and not the other vessel? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> objects to the principle of forfeiting a ship because the amount of the forfeiture has no relation to the advantage gained by the offence. If that . principle were generally applied it would be impossible to obtain the forfeiture of goods.Very often, for the sake of obtaining a small advantage, a man may run the risk of the forfeiture of a large quantity of goods, amounting perhaps to 200 or 300 times the value of the duty. But we do not therefore say the punishment does not fit the crime. The reason for the punishment is that it may act as a punishment <inline font-style="italic">in terrorem.</inline> We make it so severe that persons will be deterred from committing the offence. It may be worth while to run the risk for a certain gain, but it is not worth while to run that risk if it means the forfeiture of the goods or the ship. </para>

                    <para>SenatorMcGREG OR. - It is neither greater nor less. If any vessel is to be forfeited for one of the offences mentioned, in this clause, the principle should apply all round. As far as I am concerned my vote will always go to give the same leniency tattle big rogue as the little one, and if a small vessel is to be forfeited for one of these offences the same punishment should be meted out to a large vessel. A vessel of 10,000 tons has ten times the capacity for fraud as a vessel of a thousand tons, and certainly ought to be under the same liability. I hope the Vice-President of the Executive Council will stick to the clause as it stands. </para>

                            <para>- To lay down the principle that a man is to be punished according to his means would be very dangerous. It is generally the little ships that are used for smuggling purposes. It is more convenient to have a small ship hovering about a coast and running its cargo into some port thana large ship. In the case of a large ship the offence might be committed unwittingly so far as the owner is concerned. It would be better to adopt some proposal on the principle suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford.</inline> As there seems to be a difficulty in dealing with it now, I would suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> that we should adjourn the matter rather than push the clause through in the form which it at present assumes. </para>

I am willing to accept an amendment of sub-clause (4) restricting the forfeiture to the case of a ship of not more than 250 tons, but I cannot go any. further than that. It would be hard upon the owners of a ship, whether large or small, to make them responsible for throwing over- board by passengers ; but in the case of a ship of the size stated, it is much more likely that the master or officers would be connected in an attempt to evade justice. That is an amendment which has been promised by ray honorable colleague in the other House. </para>

I want to get the Bill finished this week. I have promised the recommittal of some clauses, and there are some new clauses to be proposed. The discussion upon the remaining clauses will take some time, and I would like to be in a position to have the whole of the Bill dealt with, subject to the final recommittal, by to-morrow night. If honorable senators will promise to assist me to do that, by sitting as late as may be necessary, and confining their speeches within as short a limit as possible, I shall have no objection to adjourning now-. I hope 1 may appeal to the Senate to so facilitate business that we may be able to get this Bill through, and sent do wai. to the other House this week. If it depended upon me entirely, this- Bill would' have been out of this House long ago, and I must ask my honorable friends opposite to help me in the conduct of public business by shortening, discussion us much as possible, and enabling us to deal finally with the Bill this week. Under the circumstances, I am willing that the Chairman should now report, progress. </para>
