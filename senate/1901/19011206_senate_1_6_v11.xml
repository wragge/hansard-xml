                        <para>- The adjournment which the Senate makes over Christmas docs not necessarily indicate the time&#39; of the adjournment of another place. , The two Houses need npt necessarily act identically in that respect. The present intention of the Government is that the Senate shall adjourn on the 13th or 14th December. It may be necessary to ask the Senate to sit on Saturday if we cannot finish the business before us next Friday. Then we propose to meet again on the 15 th January. That arrangement is of course subject to the exigencies of public business/ That is to say, I do not bind myself in any way to that date. For instance, should the Tariff be passed by the House of Representatives before Christmas, it might possibly become necessary for the Senate to meet earlier. I cannot say anything more at present. </para>

With regard to the latter part of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford&#39;s</inline> question, I hardly think that his proposal will be feasible. I am collecting all tho information on the subject, and hope to be in a position to give it to tho Senate; but the figures in every case will be only approximate- I. think it better that I should, in giving the figures, be able to make explanatory statements in connexion with them. </para>

                        <para>- Of course it is a matter for the Senate to determine. Some honorable senators have complained that we have not sufficient ventilation, whilst others have complained that we have too much. Evidently I cannot please every one. But I propose, if the Senate does not object - perhaps after the Christmas adjournment - to take down the curtains. As to the other matter, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator De</inline> Largie asked me a question concerning the officers of the House and late sittings. I do not think that the late sittings of the Senate itself have been sufficiently numerous to necessitate any action, but there are certain officers of the Senate who, in consequence of late sittings in the House of Representatives, have been kept at their duties for very late hours, and sometimes all night. Arrangements have been come to to give them some compensation. </para>

                    <para>- The arrangement of business must be left to the Government. If they are to have control of the business of the Senate, it will be quite apparent that they cannot be expected to give reasons for the arrangement of business in any particular matter. Therefore, although I will answer the honorable senator&#39;s question on this occasion, I do not think it is one of those matters with which the Senate generally has much to do, unless it is a matter which really concerns some particular piece of business. </para>

                    <para>- When my speech was interrupted last night I was criticizing some remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> and to-day I shall dwell upon three or four points which will enable me shortly to express my views upon the matter, and at the same time show, as I think I can, how ineffectual and weak were the arguments of my honorable and learned friend. This is an Imperial matter, and I am too good and loyal an Imperialist to let pass remarks such as those uttered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> without venturing, as well as I can, to criticize them, and to show how dangerous they are. The honorable and learned senator said that the method proposed by the Bill is a subterfuge, a cheat, and a fraud, that the Bill does not speak the truth, and that it does not. say what we mean. My answer is that paragraph (a) is so plain, that even a fool can understand what it means. </para>

What I complain of is that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has left out the Imperial aspect of the question. He has absolutely ignored it. When I express regret that my honorable and learned friend is &#34;not a true Imperialist, he replies that he is as true an Imperialist as I am. On this point, however, my honorable friend&#39;s remarks appear to me to be those of an Australian Jingo. In dealing with Imperial matters I do not agree with him. I would remind- him of the phrase &#34; loyalty with a latch-key,&#34; which I think was coined by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Parker.</inline> No doubt <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> is an Imperialist with a latch-key. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> asked us why we should bow down to the whims of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain.</inline> We are not doing anything of the kind. We are simply seeking to get into line with the British Government in its conduct of matters of diplomacy. When my honorable and learned friend can ascend to the heights we know he can, why should he argue from so low a stand-point as this ? The Secretary of State for the Colonies has said most emphatically that the educational test, as it appears in the Natal Act, meets with the approval of the Imperial Government. He said at the conference of the Premiers in London in 1897, that if the educational test did not prove effective in excluding Asiatics from the Commonwealth, we would have a right .to make the test more effective. The Government proposal, which has been deleted from the Bill, sought to make the test more effective in a plain intelligible way. It provided a very severe test I admit, but it was on the lines of that which the Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Premiers agreed in 1897 should be the policy of the Empire. I am astounded that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> should endeavour to make us ignore that fact, to induce the Senate to think only of Australia, and to dictate a policy to the Empire. To such ari extent did he get away from true Imperialism that he even went on to deny last might that our self government and free institutions were a gift from the motherland . Was not the very land in which we live a gift <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Surely the Imperial authorities have a right to ask us to fall into line with their views when they are really carrying out a policy on behalf of the Empire ? The honorable and learned senator forgot to dwell upon the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor&#39;s</inline> amendmentif adopted would fail to carry out what he desires to accomplish, whereas the provision that we have deleted from the Bill would have been absolutely effective in seeming an Australia as white as possible. The eight millions of negroes in South America, the anarchists of Italy, the Russian Jews could all come in under <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor&#39;s</inline> amendment, and the Russian Jews, as he knows, would be able, to go in for sweating in the clothing trade and knock down wages. In fact, the whole scum of Europe could come in under this amendment. </para>

I am surprised that honorable senators do not look at what would be the practical result of this amendment. We have been told by the Prime Minister that the Government cannot accept such an amendment. Do the labour party expect him to go back upon a public statement of that kind ? They know surely that one of three things must happen if this amendment be adopted. Either it will have to be eventually abandoned, or the Bill itself will be dropped by the Government, or the Government will resign. When Ministers ask us to consider the practical effect of what we propose to do, how is it that this amendment, which can bring about nothing but complication and disaster, is insisted upon ? I fought the Kanaka Bill because I believed that justice was with the planters. There is no such question here, and I am with the labour party in desiring a white Australia. I ask them, therefore, to give up the amendment. If they do so, they will secure everything that they desire. </para>

                        <para>- I do not want them to come here, but at the same time I think we must really have regard to the well-being of the Empire on this question. The honorable senator should remember that there is a Secretary of State for India in the Imperial Parliament. Our Indian fellow-subjects have fought for us and died for us. The black men from India were the first to enter the legations in Pekin, and the white women there put their arms round them, and. thanked them for delivering them. We cannot have India as a part of the Empire, and yet treat its inhabitants in the way proposed here. </para>

                    <para>- I take it that the object of the honorable senator is to carry out the views expressed by himself and others, including Senators Macfarlane and Neild. Their objection to the Bill is that it does not follow the Natal Act, and I understand that those honorable senators are prepared to support a clause which will follow the Natal Act. I remind the honorable senator that there is one feature of the Natal Act which in Natal and elsewhere makes it obviously and admittedly ineffective, and that is that words of the test are contained in the schedule to the Act so that any one may learn them off. If the honorable senator is prepared to leave the form of words to be submitted to the discretion of the officer by omitting the words &#34; set out in the schedule&#34; with a view to insert in lieu thereof the word &#34; prescribed,&#34;I shall be disposed to accept the amendment. </para>

                        <para>- It is not necessary to take up time discussing the matter at greater length. I should very much prefer the form proposed by the Government because it would give a much wider discretion to the officer administering the Bill, and could be made applicable to the extent of prohibition if necessary. This amendment follows the same principle as the Government proposal, and as the latter&#34; has been defeated, we now feel it to be our duty to support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker&#39;s</inline> amendment. I hope that honorable senators who have said that they would be prepared to support the Natal provision will be found supporting this amendment. </para>

                    <para>- I understand that the object of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> was to secure honest administration, but it is quite clear from what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> has said that by the adoption of this amendment <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker&#39;s</inline> object can be defeated. Under the amendment as now proposed, if a German seeks admission to the Commonwealth, the test may be put to him in Polish. If the amendment is to be adopted, because it is honest, and puts upon the face of the Bill that which we desire all intending immigrants to understand, it should be provided that the test shall be in the English or some other language. It must not be left to the officer to say in what language the test shall be applied. If I as an American were to apply for admission into Australia, the Government could test me in the Russian language, which I could not understand nor could I write out the form which would be placed before me. &#39; Although this is intended to be an honest amendment, it is not, because it would keep out any European whom the Government desired. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> has been completely got at, and all he desires to accomplish will be defeated. This is an educational test which can be applied in exactly the same way as one we rejected last night. </para>

                        <para>- I shall oppose the amendment. The power, no doubt, always exists in the Government to shut out, according to their discretion, any person who they think ought not to be a member of the community. But it seems to me that it would be giving too great a power altogether to leave it entirely to the discretion of a Government to say who should or should not be proclaimed prohibited immigrants. If there is to be a law regulating these admissions, there ought to be a provision in it much more definite than that. </para>

                    <para>- I concur in almost every word which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> has said. It would be a pity if we should leave on the face of the Bill any degree of uncertainty in any direction which we can possibly avoid. My strong view in regard to the Bill as it stood originally was that everything was left to the discretion of the Ministry or an officer as to who should be admitted and who should be excluded, and that it would be entirely inefficacious for the purpose intended of securing the exclusion of Asiatic races. This amendment would leave it equally indeterminate. I know, and we all know, that in another place a provision was sought to be inserted with the view of providing for the exclusion of those who might be declared by resolution from time to time by Parliament to be undesirable immigrants - I think it was moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Isaacs-</inline> - and that was open to the same objection. We ought to have a clear and determinate rule as to who are to be excluded and there ought to be no scope for discretion which may render the administration of the Act absolutely inefficacious. The object we have in view is clear. Let us carry it out if we can, and put straight on the face of the Bill what we mean to do, so that no officer- &#39;from a Custom-house officer of low grade, up to the Governor-General in Council - shall have power to make fish of one and flesh of another. </para>

                    <para>- I do not think that the amendment will meet the case of those who are in favour of a &#34; white Australia.&#34; I regret very much to find myself in an unfortunate position this morning. There was a considerable majority in favour of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor&#39;s</inline> amendment for direct exclusion, but owing to the forms of the House requiring certain propositions to be submitted before others, a blank has been created, and his amendment has been defeated, and we are now in a worse position than we were in before. We have to consider how this state of things came about, and whether those who have been supporting the plan of direct exclusion, are going to carry out their intention to the uttermost degree. Instead of beating about the bush any further, and trying to fill the blank, we had better endeavour, by some means or other, to get into a position to reconsider the clause and restore the Government proposal, which is far better, I think, than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker&#39;s</inline> &#39; amendment, or any proposal except <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor&#39;s.</inline></para>

                    <para>- This paragraph is, strictly speaking, foreign to the object of the Bill, which has been introduced to insure a white Australia. The paragraph raises the question of the engagement, not of coloured races, but of labour of other kinds,, whether from the old country or otherwise. Whatever may be the desirability of granting such power to the Minister as this Bill provides, this is not the measure in which it ought to be introduced. The paragraph opens up a very large question which has not yet been dealt with in any one State. It practically means that Australia is to be kept, as far as manual labour is concerned, entirely for those who are already in the country, subject to the consent of the Minister of the day to the introduction of skilled labour. I do not think that such a provision is in the interests of the Commonwealth as a whole, and I am certain that it is not in the interests of the labourers of Australia. At the time when there was a steady stream of immigration into &#39;Victoria, at the rate of 1,000 a week, we were paying 17s. 6d. a day for manual labour. In those days there was a continuous immigration to the goldfields. It is in the interests of the working classes themselves that there should be a stream of immigration into the country. Such a paragraph as this is, -so far as I know, contrary to the wishes of the general public, and the question it deals with certainly was not mooted in Victoria at the Commonwealth elections. It will allow the Minister to stifle industries that may require the importation of specially skilled men, and the consequence will be that capital that might profitably be employed in developing industries will be unable to be so utilized. I feel strongly on the subject ; not that it will affect me personally, but because I feel sure that it will injure those whom it is intended to protect. </para>

                    <para>. - I agree to a great extent with what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sargood</inline> has said in regard to the advantages that have resulted to Australia from the influx of population in the past, but his remarks as to the benefit of immigration to Victoria in the time of the gold discoveries do not affect this question. The paragraph deals with indented labour. We all desire that in the future Australia shall be made so attractive to persons of all classes that there will be a considerable amount of free labour introduced. But this paragraph will not affect that immigration. It may be true, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sargood</inline> says, that at the federal elections in Victoria nothing was said about indented labour, but I know that in Queensland a considerable amount of interest was taken in the question, and indeed ever since I have been in political life there has been a strong feeling in that State against the introduction of indented labour. That is to say, employers of labour - say, a big contractor - engages workmen in a country where wages are lower than they are here, for the purpose of doing a certain piece of work cheaply. It is recognised by most people that a practice of- that kind must have the result of introducing into Australia a number of persons who will work for a lower rate of wages than is generally paid, thereby causing dissatisfaction, and diminishing the attractiveness of Australia to people of the class whom we desire to bring here. There is a special exemption for skilled men, so that the honorable senator has no ground to stand upon in his objection to the paragraph. In the United States of America there is a similar provision to this, amounting to a direct prohibition of indented labour. That is a proof that 70,000,000 of the most intelligent people in the world have come to the conclusion that this is a restriction that ought to be imposed in the interests of working people. We cannot do better than follow such a lead. </para>

                    <para>- I cannot allow the paragraph to pass without making a protest against it. What Australia needs most is more population. There may be a surplus population here and there. There might be a surplus of labour for a time, but I am certain that the one great need of Australia is a greater population, . which would help to lighten the burdens that rest at present on the shoulders of the three or four millions of inhabitants of the Commonwealth. I do not apprehend that there is any danger of the wages rate in Australia suffering from the bringing in of new labourers. It rarely happens that labourers are introduced into Australia from Europe under the conditions hinted at in this provision, and I see no reason why it should be inserted. </para>

                    <para>- As one who would like to see the influx of a large European population into Australia, I shall be obliged to vote against this clause. In days gone by a squatting firm in Northern Queensland introduced gardeners from Scotland, and farm servants f rorn Norway, who became in time excellent bushmen and splendid colonists. We hear a great deal about a white Australia. I am afraid that what some honorable senators really want is an Australia for the whites already here. They do not want any one else to come in. If they had any sense of humanity they would see that there are numbers of white people who would like to come here, and they would endeavour to assist them. Many of these people cannot afford to pay their own passages, but employers would be able to bring them out under indenture for three years. That could be done in the case of Danes, Norwegians, and Swedes, for example, and no one would say that people from those countries are not amongst some of our most excellent colonists. Some persons deny that labour, like any other commodity, may be bought and sold. A notable instance of the fact that it is a purchasable commodity, however, is afforded by the offer of &#163;2,500 a year made recently by the Victorian Government to one of the New South Wales Railway Commissioners. He said he preferred to remain where he was if the Government there would consent to raise his salary from &#163;1,500 to &#163;2,000 a year, and the Government of New South Wales are bringing in a Bill to enable them to pay him that salary. Would the people of Victoria have found fault with the Government if it had entered into an agreement to bring him here <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> This provision in the Bill is a dishonest attempt, under the plea of a white Australia, to prevent from coming here Europeans who would be able to secure in Australia terms superior to those obtainable in their own countries. </para>

                    <para>- There were some 9,000 miners employed in Broken Hill a few months ago, but there are now only 5,000. We have heard a good deal of the poor kanaka, who has settled down with his family in Queensland. What about the poor miners who have settled down and got their families round them in Broken Hill, but are now out of work? Of course they can go elsewhere. They can break up their homes, and go first class to the other end of the Commonwealth. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> knows that in all probability the white workers at Broken Hill, who are out of employment, will have to roll up their swags, and leave their families in search of work. It is all very well to introduce the domestic servant problem into this question. The scarcity of domestics is due to the fact that a very large number of mistresses do not know how to treat their servants properly. Many of them have been servants themselves, and probably because the}7 have had to work hard they have made up their minds that their servants shall do the same. We do not want any indented labourers here, and I sincerely hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sargood</inline> will withdraw his objection. He is a good employer himself, and probably he thinks that every one else is. He must know, however, that some of the bitterest strikes that have occurred in America have been due to the introduction of labourers under contract. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. At first they took contracts for supplying the mines and mills with firewood at very low rates. But as -soon as they established themselves upon a sound footing, they fell into line with the conditions that had prevailed before their arrival in the State, and did not take contracts at rates lower than those at -which others were prepared to accept them. For a considerable time, however, the Queensland workman suffered severely, and I hope no action on the part of the Senate will bring about such a state of affairs again. </para>

                    <para>- I take it for granted that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> and other honorable senators have no desire to reduce wages, but I should like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> to be forced to compete in the labour market as I have had to do. It has often happened that a combination of employers has brought about a state of affairs which has made it absolutely necessary for their workmen to strike for better conditions, apart altogether from wages. When a strike has been forced upon the workmen the employers have been prepared to indent labour, even at higher wages than they were giving, in order to defeat the strikers. When the strike, is over, and when there are two applicants for every billet it is very easy for employers to make a proposition either to reduce wages or to harden the conditions in other directions. And the men through the force of circumstances are compelled to accept those conditions. We do not wish anything of that kind to occur. The expression &#34;wages below current rates &#34; would not protect </para>

                <para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator PULSFORD</inline>(New South Wales). - I desire to draw <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor&#39;s</inline> attention to the fact that Australia is some thousands of miles away from the chief labour recruiting ground, and in the case of a strike, or anything of that sort, there would be no reasonable opportunity for the introduction of men from Europe, with a view of interfering with the men on strike. I do not think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> wishes us to understand that we are to insert a clause in this Bill to make it impossible for more labour to be imported, and I can see no objection to providing that they shall not be brought in to work for wages under the current rate of wages. </para>

                    <para>- I wish to point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> that if the wages for eight hours were 10s. per day, and an employer offered 11s. per day for twelve hours, it would be a reduction of wages. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson</inline> has shown us that it is not merely a question of wages which causes labour disputes, but very often the conditions and hours of labour. We know that although America is some thousands of miles from Europe thousands of men have been imported from European nations to take the place of American citizens, in some cases to bring down the rates of wages and in other cases to break up the unions which the men had formed. Domestic servants have been referred to, but what is to prevent people from bringing domestic servants here and making their engagement with them on the spot when they may know what are the local conditions and what is a fair wage? The objection is to the introduction of people under contract who are not aware of the local conditions. </para>

                <para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator CHARLESTON</inline>(South Australia), - I may give an illustration which may help honorable senators to understand that it may sometimes become necessary to have such a provision in the Bill. Honorable senators from South Australia will remember that it was decided to construct a large reservoir and reticulate a large part of the country called the Beetaloo area. There were some ideas of protection prevalent at the time, and it was decided that the pipes should be manufactured in the State, even though the contract amounted to &#163;34,000 more than it would have been necessary to pay if the pipes had been imported. The contractor introduced a number of workmen under contract from Scotland, and the men, after working for some time, discovered that the terms&#39; and. conditions under which they had been engaged were less favorable than those under which they had worked in Scotland. The result was a serious strike, and the men. were brought before the court. That led to a provision being inserted in one of the South Australian Acts to the effect that no contract made outside the State for labour should be valid until it had been re-signed in the State. </para>

                    <para>- We need not go to South Australia for an example because we have one in the State of Victoria. Some honorable senators will remember that Cornish and Bruce imported 100 Italian immigrants in connexion with the contract for the Mount Alexander line, . under a contract to work for more than eight hours a day, and at less than the rate of wages which was considered reasonable. It turned out a failure, because the Italians did not adhere to the agreement made with them in Italy for about half the rate of pay which was current here at the time. An. attempt was made to get over the difficulty by substituting a lot of brick-work for stonework, because the masons caused a lot of trouble to the contractors, and worked under the eight hours system. Cornish and Bruce looked upon it as their right to import men at any price at which they could get them, and at the time I speak of masons&#39; wages here were from 1 5s. to 1 6s. a day. </para>

                <para class="block">I do not see why if the absent seaman is a European, the officer should have the absolute power to declare him a prohibited immigrant if he does not turn up when the ship is going away. The shipping companies suggest that as all whites, whether passengers or crew are professedly to be free to enter the Commonwealth, words should be introduced in this paragraph limiting its application to Asiatics. It is admitted that an Asiatic member of <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> crew should not be allowed to land, and that if he does not return to the ship before she leaves, the owners of the ship may fairly be held responsible for the introduction of a prohibited immigrant. But they ought not to be &#34;held liable in the case of a European. Under this provision if a white man does not appear when the crew are mustered, he may be considered a prohibited immigrant. That is very hard on the master of the ship. He is not the keeper of a  member of  the crew who is legally allowed to walk about the streets of . Melbourne or Sydney, because he is a free person. </para>

                    <para>- I cannot quite see with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> that the amendment would make the provision more stringent than it is. The word &#34; domiciled &#34; has a legal meaning. I understand that before a man can be regarded as having become &#34;domiciled&#34; there has to be the clearest evidence placed before the court that he has absolutely left his native country for good, and means to take up his permanent residence in the new country. If that is not the law, I should be glad if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> would point out what it is. I do not think that the words of this amendment are quite so strict as the word &#34; domiciled,&#34; which may require every case to be judged on its own merits. </para>

                        <para>- The word means that a man has made his home in a country. If a man brings his wife and children here, and lives in this country, and has given up his other home, then he is domiciled here, and that may take place in a week or a month. Of course it may be a question of evidence whether a man has become domiciled in the country. If a man has a home in England, and he leaves his wife there and comes out here and establishes another home, it may be that he is not domiciled, but surely it may be left to the Government to decide under the particular circumstances whether a person is domiciled or not. What &#60;io we aim at here? We aim at reaching those persons who have actually made their homes among us. That is a perfectly simple thing to decide. There is no reason why an officer should not decide it. </para>

                    <para>- It seems that there is some little misconception as to what this paragraph is intended for. This is an exception. The previous paragraph deals with prohibited persons, but there are certain classes of persons who, when they come here even if in other respects, they might be within the prohibited class, are not so if they can satisfy the new conditions. One of these conditions is that if a man has been domiciled in Australia either through having been a native of it, or having had his home here for a number of years has gone away and has returned, he is to be admitted, as a matter of course, as he ought to be. It seems to me that the paragraph is perfectly clear, and is intended to except a class of persons who would otherwise be prohibited. </para>

                <para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator STEWART</inline>(Queensland).- It appears to me, notwithstanding what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has said, that this matter is not clear at all. Seeing that our legal authorities are not agreed as to the meaning of the word &#34;domiciled,&#34; I think it would be much better to insert the words - &#34;resident for six months.&#34; </para>
                <para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator WALKER</inline>(New South Wales). As it is possible for a man to be resident in a State and yet not to be domiciled therein, would it not be better to use the words &#34;domiciled or resident for two years?&#34; That would cover both cases. 24 p 2 </para>

                <para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator DOBSON</inline>(Tasmania). - This amendment has been suggested and prepared by one of the ablest solicitors in Victoria, at the request of the shipping companies. Like all lawyers, he does not quite like the word &#34;domiciled,&#34; because, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> has stated in a nutshell, a man may be resident in a place for years and yet not have a domicile there. When we use the word &#34; domiciled &#34; we use a word which has two meanings. </para>

                <para class="block">The clause provides that a return shall be laid before Parliament showing the number of persons refused admission to the Commonwealth on the ground of being prohibited immigrants. I should like words to be inserted providing that all those persons who are admitted without passing the test shall be included in the returns. It is a reasonable proposition, and will furnish us with evidence as to whether the Government are carrying out the measure as Parliament intended that they should. </para>

I gather that that is so from an interjection made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs.</inline> If that be the case there will be no use in postponing clause 18. I am  quite willing to consent to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs&#39;</inline> proposal. If the statistics are to be kept at all, they should be perfect statistics, and there is no doubt that some such particulars as he proposes should be given. If clause 4 remains as originally proposed by the Government, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs&#39;</inline> amendment might very well be agreed to. I appeal to I the committee not to waste time over a technical objection. </para>

I intend to pursue the course I have hitherto followed in regard to this matter, and when a reconsideration of clause 4 takes place, and the issue in regard to supplying the blank in paragraph (a) is decided, we can deal with the nature of the return which shall be required. </para>

They live very cheaply, they contribute very little to the cost of the government of the country, and in many cases their sole -aim is to acquire as much wealth as they can, and leave the country as quickly as possible.

                        <para>- Apparently those Acts cannot be administered to cope with this great evil. Municipal councils have appointed officers to administer the Health Acts, but find it  impossible to deal with the Hindoos and the Chinese. I desire to compel these aliens to pay something towards the government of the country, and I think that the proposition that they shall pay a tax of &#163;5 per annum is a very reasonable one. I noticed in a Brisbane paper the other day a paragraph, setting forth that hordes of Hindoos, Chinamen, and other Asiatics are concentrating in the northern portion of Queensland. The paragraph stated that the Premier of Queensland, when interviewed on the question, said that the Government had official intimation that such was the case, and that he had no doubt that these aliens were being brought into the north of Queensland to meet the kanaka legislation of the Federal Parliament - to supply the places of the kanakas who will be deported in course of time. These Hindoos and Chinamen will compete with our workers in many ways, and I am anxious that we shall not make their stay in the Commonwealth too rosy. If we can, by the imposition of a tax, prompt them to leave the country, I think we ought to do so. I have proposed that the tax shall be &#163;5 per annum, because I think that is a fair compromise. Personally, I should like to make it &#163;20. There may be something in the contention that those who have already paid a poll tax of &#163;100 should have some special consideration, and I am quite willing that they should. </para>

                        <para>- I must oppose this amendment. It goes altogether beyond the necessities of this measure. This Bill is to regulate immigration, and it seems to me that it would be a verv unnecessary and harsh proceeding to place under special disabilities aliens who are already in the Commonwealth. If it is found that, in carrying on the business of the Commonwealth, it is necessary to make special laws dealing with any particular class of coloured aliens, there will be power to do so under sub-section (26) of section 51 of the Constitution. That, however, should be done only by some special Bill, and not by a side wind. </para>

                    <para>- Honorable senators will recollect that at almost the commencement of the session, I said in a jocular way that the labour party were for sale when the proper auctioneer came along. The auctioneer did come, and an offer was really made. I am not saying that any individual member of the Opposition came to the labour party and said - &#34;If you do so and so, we will do so and so,&#34; but no one could fail to understand that we were offered support. Now the labour party has been sold, and the next time an auctioneer comes along and makes an offer, he will also have to make a deposit, to prove the <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> of his offer, and of the arrangements proposed to be made. Last night I honestly moved an amendment, and I was supported ; in fact, there was a majority of six against the proposal of the Government, and in favour of deleting a certain paragraph. That was done, and we, as a party, thought that everything was going on well. But that paragraph was knocked out for the purpose of inserting something else, and when we attempted to put that something else in we failed to do it by two votes. All the labour party were here, and I throw the responsibility of the present position upon Senators Pulsford and Ferguson, who have declared that they are against this Bill. They have been against another Bill of a similar character, and they and other senators have gone in the same way. I have every confidence in the position taken up by the leader of the Opposition, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> and I believe also that Senators Smith and Charleston have been sincere in the position they have taken up ; but I tell honorable senators that, if the labour party are going to ally themselves with anybody, it must be with some party that has some respect for their leader, and the members of which will follow their leader, and not lead us into a misunderstanding. </para>

                        <para>- I do not consider it is safe for me as a member of the labour party to put myself in that position again, Once sold is quite sufficient for me. Seeing that honorable senators in opposition have declared that they are opposed to this Bill, because it is too stringent and is altogether prohibitive, I certainly have a right to be satisfied, and consequently during the rest of the consideration of this Bill I am going to do all I can to support the Government in carrying out the provision which honorable senators in opposition have declared to be too stringent, and which they, have two or three times made an effort to make less effective as a means of preventing aliens and ail other objectionable immigrants from coining into the Commonwealth. That they think it is too stringent is warrant enough for me to support this amendment, knowing that according to them it will carry out the provision I desire to see inserted. </para>

                    <para>- I regret very much indeed the present position of affairs. There is no doubt that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> moved his amendment in a <inline font-style="italic">bona fide</inline> manner and he had no stronger supporter for it than myself. Last night I asked an honorable member of the labour party if there was going to he a division, and he said there was not, as there were four or five honorable senators who desired to speak. This morning I was out of the chamber for not more than a quarter of an hour, and when I came back I found that a division had been taken and that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor&#39;s</inline> amendment had been lost. Then another proposal that certain -words should be substituted was also lost, and now the position is exactly the same as it was before. This is a matter of the greatest importance. I was pledged to the absolute exclusion of every coloured alien from Australia, and if there is one question more than another upon which I. feel strongly it is this question. The amendment now proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> will be ineffective, if it is administered honestly. It will be effective if it is administered dishonestly, but if that is the intention it will be a disgrace to the statute-book. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> carefully considers the matter he will see that he is in no worse position now than he was yesterday. If some honorable senators on the opposition side and the labour party vote against the Government proposal now made, it will be defeated, and then <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McG</inline> regor&#39;s amendment can come on again. The honorable senator has hinted at treachery, but I deny that there has been any treachery. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferguson</inline> is pledged to vote for it. </para>

                        <para>- I do rfotnot want anything dishonest, and to be practical the administration of this Bill would, according to the honorable and learned senator, have to be dishonest. I am exceedingly sorry at the turn affairs have taken. I would propose the amendment which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> has seen fit to drop, but I am afraid there would be little use in it, because if the labour party have pledged themselves to support the: Government proposal, the Government will win, and legislation will be placed upon our statute-book which it is certain <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> never contemplated. He certainly said that the legislation might be made more stringent, but it is clear that he referred to a more stringent English education test. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, but the immigrant is given the choice of the language in which the test is to be applied. Under this proposal an alien may come here who can speak three or four languages, and because he may not be able to speak the language selected as the test in his case he may be excluded. The object is plainly to exclude a person on account of the colour of his skin. </para>

                        <para>- 1 want to do it honestly, and to say frankly that for ethnological reasons we do not desire the coloured races to come into Australia. Instead of that, legislation is proposed in which it is suggested that there is no bar to the coloured races whatever, and that we only desire to see that our immigrants are educated people. The subterfuge is that the intending immigrant may be examined in any one of the 78 languages mentioned by that eminent philologist, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford.</inline> I shall be sorry if any such legislation appears on our statute-book in the first year of our national life. It seems to me that the Government have won, and I. am not annoyed at it fpr any party reason, but because legislation is likely to be passed which is directly contrary to the pledge I gave my constituents, and which will be a disgrace to our statute book, because to be administered effectively it must be administered dishonestly. </para>

                    <para>- I am extremely grieved that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> should abandon his l guns at this stage, when there is every reason to believe that if he moved his amendment again it would be carried. That the honorable senator should tell us as the leader of the labour party that that party is for sale, that the Opposition ha\e practically made an offer for the party, and that he should now plainly show as he has done, that the Government have bid something higher, is one of the most disgraceful things I ever heard of in politics. We know that when the vote was taken this morning two or three of our supporters happened to be away. We know also that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> from all he has said is practically pledged to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor&#39;s</inline> amendment now that he has lost the amendment he desired to see carried, introducing the words of the Natal Act. Unless you apply <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor&#39;s</inline> test, how can there honestly be a test of colour at all ? I need not deal with that point, because it could not be put more clearly than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> did. I shall vote against the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor,</inline> and if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> deserts his guns I shall move the insertion of his own amendment. </para>

                    <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> smarting under a defeat which I suppose was unexpected by him, appears to have lost his head, and has mentioned the very last man in the Chamber whom he should have named. In the various divisions I have taken no part. I have not voted with the Government or against them, with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> or against him. It will be recollected that when the subject was last before the Chamber <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> twitted me with being a party by myself. He did not know what attitude I should take, nor did <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> have a shadow of information from me, directly or indirectly, that I intended to support his amendment. The position I have taken has been exactly the same as I have occupied in public life for the last ten or fifteen years. I have always held that it is the duty of Australia to effect these arrangements with regard to immigration by treaty with powers like Japan and China, and as to the natives of India, by an arrangement with the British Government. I have had very little support, but I have not wavered from this attitude. I have not, on this occasion, supported either the proposal made by the Government, or by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> or by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker.</inline> Therefore, considering the extraordinary position we seem to have reached, when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> publicly announces that he has deserted the proposal to which he intended to stick, he must not be surprised if, after having passed reflections on honorable senators, which were entirely undeserved, he finds reflections made on his own conduct, and, perhaps, with a greater degree of accuracy. </para>

                    <para>- So far I have not spoken in regard to the Bill, but my attention has been drawn to the fact that a little time ago in the debate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> wondered what I was going to do, and reminded the committee that I was a member of a Government which had passed a Bill similar to this one. While that statement is true, it is equally true that that Government passed a Bill practically on the lines of the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> not in the same words, but virtually to the same effect, because it contemplated applying all the provisions of the Chinese Restriction Act to the different coloured races. </para>

                        <para>- One moment, please. It also repealed the provision in the Chinese Restriction Act which exempted British subjects from its operation. The Bill was framed with the express purpose of dealing entirely with coloured races in the same drastic manner as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor&#39;s</inline> amendment did. It is true, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> has interjected, that the Bill was subsequently put on one side, in order to submit another. But it was passed through both Houses, and reserved, and at the conference of Premiers, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> said that the Royal assent would not be given, and suggested the adoption of the educational test in the Natal Act. Returning to New South Wales, the Premier submitted a Bill on those lines, because clearly it was the only legislation he could get of the kind which was desired, but it was thoroughly understood at the time that it would be a question for the Commonwealth Parliament to deal with by and by. Therefore the attitude which was taken up by the Reid Government, and the attitude which was taken up by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> in the House of Representatives, in supporting an amendment similar in character to that of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> has been consistent throughout. I also claim to be following a consistent course of action. I find that when the Bill I mentioned was being dealt with in New South Wales, one honorable member said - </para>

                <para class="block">There are many other passages which I might quote from the speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor,</inline> who now so earnestly deprecates legislation of this character. I have cited these passages for the purpose of pointing out that while certain honorable senators are maligned for their consistency others, who have proved themselves to be inconsistent, take credit to themselves for the action they are pursuing now. I admit that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> was not responsible in any way as a Ministerialist, and that he said it was a responsibility which he would allow the Government to take themselves. But. in a well reasoned out speech from the stand-point which he then occupied, he pointed out how clearly and necessary it was in the interests of this great nation that we should have the power of direct exclusion. If he had been as consistent as some of us he would not have found himself in the unfortunate position which he occupies to-day, for it must be remembered he has not said yet that he does not now believe in &#39; these principles. There has not been any doubt as to what action I was going to take, for before he spoke, ray name was entered in the pair-book as having paired with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> against the Government and in favour of the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor.</inline> There is no question that it was consistent with the attitude I had previously taken. One cannot always believe the whisperings one hears in the lobbies. But from the very commencement I have been very much impressed with the idea that there was a bit of a game going on. Some honorable senators wished to posture before their constituents, and they thought they could do this very well and say afterwards - &#34;We did all we could, you see ; but the Government beat us.&#34; However, these honorable senators have &#39; discovered that their gun was loaded. They thought they had blank cartridge. An amendment was submitted last night, and it was a remarkable thing that no member of the labour party had the courage to call for a division. It was left to an honorable senator not of that party to call for a division, when the Chairman said that the voices were given against the amendment. </para>

                        <para>- That leads me still more to believe that there was something in the whisperings that the labour party had no desire to embarrass the Government over this question. They found that it was likely to embarrass the Government, and therefore it was not their intention to proceed with the amendment to a final issue if it could be avoided by any pretence. I should not have been surprised if the amendment had not even been submitted. </para>

                        <para>- Directly. Honorable senators who have been trying to make a great noise, but with the desire to do no harm, find themselves in an unfortunate and humiliating position. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> shows the hollowness of the whole tiling when he says that he will not go to a division against the proposal of the Government. I recognise the fact that the longer one lives in political life the more instances one gets of honorable gentlemen turning summersaults, sometimes gracefully, sometimes the reverse. I congratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> and his friends who have told us that they were selling themselves, that they think that they have been sold, and that therefore next time they shall require a deposit. I presume that the Government has given them a deposit. What it is I do not pretend to know. But I did notice the other day with regard to some measures that they stuck close and fast to the position they had taken. I dare say that even now they will have an opportunity of voting for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor&#39;s</inline> amendment. It occurred to me last night that it would have been very much wiser to have submitted it as a substantive amendment, and then to have dealt with paragraph (a) in the light of what had been done with the amendment. But assuming for the sake of argument that the Government proposal is carried, it will enable them to deal with races that are not coloured and to deal with the very cases which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> mentioned last night of undesirable immigrants from European countries, who, though not coloured, are not desired as citizens. So that it will do good so far. After all it is still open to any honorable senator to submit <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor&#39;s</inline> amendment. I do not propose to do so, but if it is submitted I shall be prepared to vote for it, and if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> and his colleagues do not vote against it, it will be a matter of very great astonishment to me. But let every man who is allied to this party which has posed as being the friend of the working man, which believes in certain principles that the working men advocate, go before his constituents, and explain why he voted against an amendment which he knew could be carried by the votes of honorable senators. Let him explain why he voted against his own principles. </para>

                        <para>- That has been a matter of argument. It has been put to them, but they have not been satisfied with it. Why should we not deal with this matter honestly ? If we desire to deal with a particular class of aliens, should we not do so straightforwardly, and not place a fraud upon the statute-book ? My action upon this matter has been consistent from the first. Ever since I have been in politics I have followed one line of action, which may have , been right or wrong, but which at all events has been con-consistent. When honorable senators say they want a thing, they should be prepared to stand up for their so-called principles, and do what they say they intend to do. I shall watch with a considerable amount of curiosity the result of the vote upon this question. </para>

                        <para>- The principle is the same whether it is contained in a measure passed by one State or by a Commonwealth - by one colony or a dozen colonies. Who is really posing before his constituents? Why, it is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> himself, and not the labour party as he has said. The labour party have found out - just as I felt they would when I voted last night in opposition to their proposal, although my sympathies are with them - that they were on the wrong track, and they are acting a manly and straightforward part in harking back and voting for what they believe they will secure, instead of voting for what, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould,</inline> they cannot obtain. </para>

                    <para>- I regret very much the unfortunate position in which I find myself. I admit freely, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> has suggested, that I have been cornered. While <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> was speaking, the old story of the spider and the fly came forcibly into my mind, the- spider in this case being the Opposition, and the fly, the poor, innocent labour party. The spider invited us into his parlour. We went there. We have come out not entirely unscathed, but still with some life left in us. We are invited to reenter the spider&#39;s parlour. If we go in again, probably we may never come out. Therefore, having some regard for our own skins, we have decided to remain where we are. The blandishments of the spider are not going to have any effect this time. As every honorable senator knows, I believe in the direct exclusion of coloured aliens. </para>

                        <para>- I suppose I must accept the honorable and learned senator&#39;s denial, but that certainly was the impression which his speech last night conveyed to my mind. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> has charged the labour party with having gone back on its principles. I deny that. We have principles, but I would remind honorable senators that the labour party is not the child in politics that it was a few years ago. It has cut its wisdom teeth, and has come to the conclusion that it is sometimes better to take half a loaf than have no bread. We have not gone back on our principles. The leader of our party moved a certain amendment upon this Bill, and every honorable senator of the party supported it. We had the support of certain honorable senators in deleting clause 4, and we naturally came to the conclusion that, having gone so far in the fight, they would see it out. But when it was sought to insert the words proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> our honorable friends who had so kindly assisted to create the blank in the clause did not turn up. They had business elsewhere. Various explanations have been given for their absence, but the one fact which stares me in the face is that, having gone with us to a certain extent, they deserted us. </para>

                        <para>- I shall tell the honorable senator my reason for refusing to do so. We cannot go on recommitting this Bill. If we were defeated upon the second trial, as we were upon the first, we should be the laughing stock of all Australia. Finding that we cannot obtain all that we want ; finding that we have been betrayed, practically, by those who professed to be our friends, we have come to the conclusion that it is much better to take what the Government offer us than have nothing. I do not approve of the Government proposal, but it is better than nothing. Nothing would suit our planter friends in Queensland better than that this measure should be hung up indefinitely. While <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> and the Commonwealth Government were corresponding in regard to it, the Queensland planters would be pouring Hindoos and other Asiatics into Queensland, and when the question was finally settled we should find that the alien difficulty in Australia was much greater than it is at the present moment. We make some pretensions to being practical politicians. If we cannot obtain all that we should like to get, we shall take all that we can obtain for the time, and I trust that on some future occasion, if the necessity arises, we shall return to the charge, and, perhaps, have complete effect given to our will in the matter: I protest against the insinuation thrown out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould.</inline> That honorable and learned senator, I understand, occupies a leading position as a member of the Opposition. If he had been desirous of seeing <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor&#39;s</inline> amendment carried, he would have taken care that his fellow members of the Opposition were present to vote upon it. He did not take that precaution. The gun missed fire, and now he invites us to have another shot. I have read of guns missing fire and of people being so foolish as to &#34;monkey&#34; with them afterwards, with the result that they have been shot. We have no intention of getting shot. We have done all in our power to embody in this Bill the principles in which we believe. Having failed, we intend to do the next best thing, and accept the provision which the Government desires to insert. </para>

                    <para>- With one exception, we are in exactly the same position as we occupied last evening when this question came before us. We have to determine whether or not we should accept the educational test proposed by the Government or the direct exclusion proposal put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> last night. There is no alternative or middle course. The exception is that whilst last evening we were all under the impression - and certainly I was under the impression most deeply - that the amendment was proposed with the most perfect sincerity, we have now reached a stage at which the little game seems to be exposed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> says that the reason for the sort of jump- Jim- Crow tactics to which we have been treated this afternoon is that the labour party have been betrayed. Betrayed by whom? Betrayed by themselves. They are their own worst enemies. The honorable senators who came forward to declare that they wished to secure a white Australia by a policy of direct exclusion of coloured aliens, that they would be no party to any educational test which might be used this way or that way, at the discretion of an officer, to admit one immigrant and exclude another - the honorable senators who said they would have no paltering with this question - turn round, drop their own amendment for direct exclusion, and say - &#34; We are going to vote for the Government educational test.&#34; What then ? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> has selected two of those who voted yesterday with him as honorable senators in whom he has perfect confidence, namely, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> and myself. Therefore I may speak with the most perfect friendliness and in a tone of the most kindly criticism of my honorable friend and of the most extraordinary attitude which he has adopted. </para>

                        <para>- My honorable friend has no control over himself. How can he throw stories at other people in this respect? He is put up for sale. He glories in it. He is to be sold when the auctioneer arrives to the highest bidder. Is not that an exhibition of political prostitution - declared on the floor of the Senate- without a parallel ? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> talks about it as a joke ; but it is not a thing to joke about. We might say - &#34;What price to-day as against yesterday ? &#34; Is it a kind of Dutch auction, so much last night and a little more to-day? What is the bargain which results in this exposure of the little game in regard to this amendment? It was going to be proposed, but in a kind of &#34; Willing to wound and yet afraid to strike&#34; style. I think we may all ask where was the serious desire to secure a whits Australia by direct exclusion. </para>

                <para>SenatorSir JOSIAH SYMON.- What right has the labour party to bring forward this petty pretext for the abandonment of their principles ? If they had stood up and said - &#34; We have changed our mind; we do not care two pence for securing a white Australia by means of a policy of direct exclusion, and we have thrown aside this majority of 15 to 9,&#34; none of us would have a right to complain. A man has a right to change his mind, but what I complain of is the apparent subterfuge. The fever has been catching, and seems to have taken possession of honorable senators. I was afraid it would after what happened last night. I was present, and can corroborate what has been said by another honorable senator, that there was no voice from the labour corner calling for a division. They were going to let the question go on the voices. That shows the absolute sham ! Who have been betrayed? Those who voted with the labour party upon this, and who are prepared and intend to vote again upon the same question. </para>

I do not say it was a catch vote dishonestly taken, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> proposed an amendment by accident. The honorable senator does these things by accident. When I came into the Chamber, I found my honorable friend dancing with joy at having moved a little amendment. The Vice-President of the Executive Council very readily accepted that amendment as we should all have done in the same position. But the words were struck out, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker&#39;s</inline> accidental performance was not successful either. That was dropped out also, and so we come back to the actual position we were in last night, and if my honorable friends had one grain of political honesty in their composition they would go forward with their amendment now. </para>

                        <para>- My honorable friend is very simple. Some one has said that the members of the labour party have cut their wisdom teeth, but that kind of wisdom is the wisdom of the serpent, and they have plenty of it. It has been an example of guile from the beginning to the end of the transaction. We are quite agreed that the honorable senator may abandon the amendment as he chooses, but it is not right for honorable senators, even if they are seduced by a Bill which involves so many elements of dishonesty and subterfuge, to indulge in that kind of thing themselves. I think they ought not to do it. I think their political reputation will be apt to suffer, and the effect is not likely to be neutralised by the constant and callous declaration that they are up for sale to the highest bidder. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles</inline> spoke last night and to-day as if no honorable senators except those on the Government side should vote for any proposition . submitted by the labour party. If they did - and I was rather amused at the declaration - my honorable friend said that whatever his views might be upon the merits of the question he would vote the other way. He told me last night, that although his sympathies were with the labour party, and with the amendment they proposed, yet because I forsooth agreed with their proposition he would vote the other way. That is a fine declaration of political creed. </para>

                        <para>- It is very necessary that these things should be pointed out, and my honorable and learned friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor,</inline> should not have a monopoly of lecturing his supporters. I say we are now back to the point at which we diverged last night. The issue now being put to the committee is whether the Government educational test, which is not intended to be an educational test at all, shall be embodied in this Bill. Upon that issue last night, on the invitation of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> the committee determined by a majority of six that it would have nothing to do with the educational test. A debate then took place as to whether the words proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> should be inserted, and if we had taken a division last night those words would have been inserted. Honorable senators know that on Friday morning the attendance is not usually large, and when the division was taken this morning there was a majority against <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor&#39;s</inline> amendment, and the only member who was absent and had not paired was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith.</inline> A proposal to insert words in lieu of those proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> was also defeated, and that was equivalent to an intimation by the committee that the field was once more clear for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor&#39;s</inline> amendment. Now, when we come to consider the proposal, relieved of all those other entanglements which complicated it, and the clear issue is as to whether there is to be an educational test, or direct exclusion, we have the intimation that those who favour direct exclusion are going to vote for the educational test. If that is their view of the principles on which our proceedings should be conducted, it is a pity we did not know earlier. So far as I am concerned, I intend to be consistent with what I declared on the hustings, and in the Senate, and I intend to vote against this educational test, because it is inefficacious for the purpose we have in view. Every member of the committee knows that the intention is prohibition, and no one could have stated that more lucidly than the Vice-President of the Executive Council. I say we should not put an educational test into this Bill, which can be made prohibitive only at the discretion of the Customs officers and of the Administration. One man may get in and another be shut out. Education is not the test by which we are dealing with these immigrants. It is race and colour. It is not a linguistic test at all. We do not wish to admit people because they possess the faculty of writing 50 words in English or in some European language, but we propose to shut them out because they are not of a race and colour of which we approve. It has been said that if this is honestly administered it would admit every Hindoo and every negro in the United States of America. </para>

                        <para>- Not at all, because I intimated yesterday that if that amendment was not sufficient we could always add to it. This is not an educational test, but an embargo upon race and colour at the discretion of the officers who have to administer the law, subject again to the discretion of the Ministers as to whether they shall exercise it faithfully or not. I warn honorable senators that if this Bill is passed in this shape, as a means of excluding Asiatics from this country, before long they will repent of it. If we are to adhere to the principles which we came here to give effect to, we should be clear in the language of our statute. My strong objection to this proposal is on the ground, firstly, of its inefficacy, and secondly on the ground of its being discretionary. I do not care who is to exercise the discretion - discretion upon this subject is not what the people of Australia want. They want exclusion. And thirdly, I object&#39; that this measure, with regard to the subject of exclusion, is a&#39; mere sham and pretence if it is intended to be honestly administered. I do not desire to minimize what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles</inline> has said as to the views entertained long ago with regard to the interference of the Colonial-office. But are we only to legislate when we know that the Colonial-office will give its assent? Are we to tie our hands in legislating in that way ? We had better lock up our chamber altogether, if, whenever a Bill is introduced into the Senate, ,we are to be told that we must not pass this clause, or some other clause&#39;, because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> - meaning the Secretary of State for the Colonies for the time - may veto the Bill. If that is to be the understanding we shall tie the hands of Parliament, and for that reason, if for no other, I say let us vindicate our right to legislate without restriction and without being hampered by any such fear. If in the exercise of our prerogative we pass legislation, and it is subsequently vetoed, then it is for us, and not for- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain,</inline> to consider whether or not we shall give way. We should not humiliate ourselves by hesitating to pass a Bill in a particular manner because of any alarmist notions as to what may happen to it when it gets to the Colonial-office. I am as anxious as any one to preserve good relations with the Imperial authorities, but .1 am far more anxious that the self governing powers and the legislative powers of Australia gathered together in this Commonwealth should be preserved, and that our self-respect as a people should be upheld. It is for these reasons that, even if I vote alone, I shall be found voting against this educational test and in favour of direct exclusion. </para>

                        <para>- That is just the reason why the labour party do not feel safe in going any further. There Ls too much of this kind of offer - &#34;We think so and so will vote with you.&#34; When we moved the amendment honorable senators were found voting against it, and other honorable senators whose votes we were led to believe we would get were absent. Can honorable senators wonder that, having been defeated once with such support, we decline to risk a similar defeat again. I remind the committee that there has been a debate during this last week, which has been very ominous. The labour party have been supporting the Government in an effort to rid Australia of a large number of people of a coloured race, and on which side have honorable senators been in that discussion, who are now so anxious to take the extreme step of complete exclusion to which the labour party is pledged ? They have been most severe in their criticism of the attitude the labour party have taken up upon that question, and yet they are the men who led the movement for an extension of time for the planters in Queensland. That is a significant incident in the week&#39;s proceedings, and should be sufficient to make us pause before we again walk into the spider&#39;s web. If any one is responsible for the present position it is the free-trade party, and their lack of organization, and their lack of loyalty to their leaders. </para>

                        <para>- Whether it is a party question or not, we are face to face with that fact that in the Senate there are three parties, and if we wish to carry any legislation, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> puts it, we must approach the dominating parties in the Senate. We did approach them. We approached the Government on the one hand and they offered us an educational test, which is admitted by some of the freetrade party to amount to prohibition. On the other hand, the free-trade party said - &#34; We will go the whole way with you, and vote for complete exclusion.&#34; In good faith we brought forward our proposal for complete exclusion, and honorable senators of the free-trade party united with us to create a blank in the Bill. But when we wished to fill in the blank, what support did we get <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> We were in a minority. In one division we had a majority of six, and in the next we were in a minority of two. Now we are again asked to move the amendment again, but we have to remember that this is not the last stage of this Bill, and we may have to depend on the men who have failed us once to fight this Bill if we come into conflict with the other House. If their organization is so loose that their own leader cannot depend upon them, and does not know whether they are going to fight with us or not, how can they blame the labour party for taking an offer, which, at any rate, has some backing in it, and which does carry some Vote.5 with it for a certainty. We should be novices, indeed. in political life if we took an uncertainty for a certainty. We have played and lost, and we decline to again allow the same contumely to be heaped upon us. I advise the party on this side, if they wish for the support of the labour party, and wish to combine with the labour party, to first set their own house in order and ecures some shred of organization. </para>

                    <para>- I should not have risen, but that my name has been brought into the debate as if I were going to give a different vote to that which I have already pledged myself to give. I have not pledged myself to any individual, because I have not been asked for my vote, but I pledged myself openly in this chamber last night that if the Government would bring in a proposal strictly analogous to the terms of the Natal law, I would vote for it without one word of discussion. The suggestion I made was not acted upon in any way, and according to1 the well-known rule I was not necessarily bound by it. Even though I had the best possible excuse to go back upon that assertion, I did not go back upon it. It is quite true that I voted with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> to make a blank in the clause, because I had plainly announced my opposition to the provision as it stood in the Bill. The blank being made, I waited in order to fufil my intention of voting for the Natal clause, and I had already given a vote to create an opportunity for doing so. When the opportunity came I voted for the Natal clause. What is there inconsistent in that, and why should I be charged with having failed to keep some compact, which I never heard of and never entered into ? So far from being open to any allegation of the kind, my action has been absolutely free from the slightest suspicion of trickery, and it is a misrepresentation to suggest that I am .going back upon anything I pledged myself to do. I am going to vote against the Government when the new clause is submitted. I have already taken exception to it, and I am not quite sure, if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> does not do so, that I shall not move the introduction of the provision in the Natal Act. It is just as legitimate for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> to move the introduction of that provision a second time as it is for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> to move the introduction of a clause which has been defeated. Whilst <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> was defeated by only one vote, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> was defeated by half-a-dozen. So the former has five better reasons than the latter for re-introducing his proposal, which I hope he will do. I shall vote against the paragraph (a), as proposed by the Government, for two reasons. I do not consider it an honest proposal, because it attempts to do by a subterfuge that which the Government are not game to do openly. If they are game to do it openly why did they not vote with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor?</inline> He desired to do the thing straight out from the shoulder. That I was not with him does not prove that he was wrong. He sought in a direct and deliberate way to achieve that which the Government wish to do by an underhand method. I am also against the proposal of the Government, because I do not consider that paragraph (a) is likely to be used efficaciously for the object which all of us have in view. I assume that we are all at one for the exclusion of undesirable people, but we look from different stand-points at the question of the best way in which it is to be accomplished. Of the three proposals we have proof of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker&#39;s</inline> being efficacious, so far at least as Imperial consent is concerned, and of its working we have heard no complaint. I consider it my duty to vote for it, because it seems to be the most reasonable course, and perhaps it has the advantage of being to some extent a middle course. I do not know how it was that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Charleston</inline> managed to evolve from his inner consciousness the idea that 24 <inline font-style="italic">g</inline></para>

                        <para>.- While we recognise <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> as our leader in respect to- Tariff matters, there is no obligation for party action in respect of other matters. We have held no meeting. We have not discussed the matter of this vote in any form, and I am quite sure that I am saying no more than I am entitled to say. There has not been the least idea of party action in respect to it. We have gone on our own, and done that which we thought was best. We have had a splendid homily as to the necessity for party action. That homily may bear good fruit, and we may be very greatly indebted to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> for his kindly instruction. But at the present time I do not know that we shall be able, to get the full benefit of it, or that it will affect the issue before the committee. I shall vote against the proposal of the Ministry as it stands, and for the introtroduction of the provision in the Natal Act if the opportunity is offered. </para>

                    <para>- I have&#39; never heard a more ungracious attempt to add insult to injury than has been disclosed in the speeches of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> this afternoon.&#39; We have fulfilled to the very letter our part of the compact with the electors, both in the other House and in this Chamber. We told the electors that we should go for direct exclusion. Our representative in the other House moved an amendment to that effect, and was&#39; defeated, although we saw a strange combination of conservatives voting with him in a direction in which they were never known to go before. Then, true to our principles, we came here and the same amendment was proposed. We were in our places to vote on every occasion. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> tells us that we have the same strength to-day as we had yesterday. But how was it, then, that although last night we had fifteen votes, to-day we could command only eleven ? Because some conservative senators, who were never before known to vote for a democratic proposal, find themselves defeated in an attempt to disparage or discredit the Government, they turn round and heap a lot of contumely on our heads. The action taken this afternoon is only in keeping with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon&#39;s</inline> interjection, at the time we raised a little cheer on behalf of a white Australia. In a contemptuous way he sang out - to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> - &#34;Are you not proud of your allies?&#34; </para>

                        <para>- I have felt during the debate, that I have been in a very dangerous position. As it proceeded, I could see that the Government were evidently desirous of securing as far as possible a white Australia, but that, judging from the tone of despatches from the old country, we might get no law at all unless we passed the measure as introduced by the Government. On the other hand, I could see from interviews with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Philp,</inline> in the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane Courier,</inline> that he was hopeful, owing to the combination which was taking place in the Senate, that this Bill would be hung up, and probably the Government in the other Chamber would be forced to resign, and so both the Pacific Island Labourers Bill and this Bill might be delayed for twelve months or more. What is the idea of some honorable senators in voting for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor&#39;s</inline> amendment? Is it to secure a white Australia, or is it to put the Government in such a position that they will have to eat their own words or resign ? </para>

We find ourselves in a minority. We have a certain programme. We say to the two great parties here - &#34; We are anxious to get the best we can. Give us such reforms as we believe will be for the benefit of the people, and we will support you so long as you try to do something for the people of the Commonwealth.&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has endeavoured by his eloquence to make out that some of us are putting ourselves up for sale, and that we are going to get something personally out of the sale. </para>

Is it political prostitution to come into this chamber, and endeavour to get some of the reforms which the electors sent us in to secure ? The Government have stated that they intend this Bill to be prohibitory.

                <para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator CHARLESTON</inline>(South Australia). - Surely there was no reason why <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> should have deserted his amendment so quickly. The statement that there were fifteen honorable senators pledged last night to vote for striking out the clause does not bear on the point at all. I grant that in the group of fifteen senators some voted to strike out the clause, so that they might insert the provision in the Natal Act, and others, so that they might insert the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor.</inline> This morning the vote was taken more quickly than was anticipated by some honorable senators who had supported <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> and was lost. With what result? We were in exactly the same position as we were in last night, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> could have again moved his amendment and seen what effect it would have. He failed to do so, and therefore he deserted his guns. I came into the Senate with a free and open mind in regard 24 g 2 to these great questions. Only once, I be-believe, during ray campaign, was I asked the question, &#34; Are you in favour of a white Australia?&#34; And I said, &#34;Yes.&#34; In my manifesto I inserted the words, &#34; I am in favour of the supremacy of the white races.&#34; I came here so that I might hear from the representatives of Queensland who have had experience of the kanaka traffic, and from other honorable senators, what the effect of these Bills would be. What was the result? From all I heard on both sides here my sympathies went out to the kanakas. We were told of the great wrong which was done to them. What did I do ? I gave my worthy friends in the labour corner an opportunity to stop that wrong at once. Were they found voting on that side? No. Therefore they proved again their insincerity. They declaimed against that traffic, yet they were willing that it should be continued for another five years. In this Bill they have had another opportunity of declaring for a white Australia, and of protecting Australia entirely from the incursions of coloured people. Again they have deserted their guns, and they are prepared by their vote to admit black races from any part of the world. It is useless for them to say that the administration of this measure will give them all they want. That may be the case with the present Ministry, but if a Government came into power which was opposed to the measure, what would be the result ? </para>

                    <para>- I can quite believe that, in view of the position which the labour party occupy at the present moment, they may be liable to be lectured. If the lecture comes from those who are justly entitled to lecture us, we will not mind it. An honorable senator in the position occupied by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> might very well criticise our situation at the present time, but when a political wobbler, like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Charleston,</inline> has the audacity to lecture the labour party, not .only in regard to their attitude on this measure but in relation to the Pacific Island Labourers Bill, I think he is going a little too far. I must protest against being lectured by an honorable senator of his standing. No matter how inconsistent our present position may appear to be, we shall always receive a great deal more credit for political straightforwardness than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Charleston</inline> is likely to secure. There is no honorable senator whose opinion upon any question is so difficult to ascertain until he actually votes. He wobbled right through the debate on the Kanaka question, and it is only now, when he sees an opportunity of gaining a little political capital, that he takes up a definite attitude. Those who know him best will have no difficulty in seeing through the little game. </para>

If that is to be done, it is necessary that the Bill should go down to the other place today. To wait until next week would only be a matter of form, and now that the question has been settled, I shall ask the Senate to help the Government in their desire to make the Bill law as soon as possible. </para>
