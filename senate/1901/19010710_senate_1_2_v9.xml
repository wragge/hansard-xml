I do not know how much progress the committee will make this evening, but I hope we shall make very substantial progress. I shall be obliged if honorable senators who desire that clauses shall be recommitted will remind me of them, because in many cases where it has been suggested that a clause should be recommitted subsequent discussion has shown that no alteration is necessary. The only clauses I have noted for recommittal are clauses 2 and 5. </para>

                    <para>- Underlying the amendment before the Chair are one or two very important principles which I think affect not only Australia, but the Empire. Therefore 1 desire to say a few words in reference to it. I feel reluctant at all times to differ from my fair-minded friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> ; but just as he believes his amendment to be right and just, and a reasonable application of the principle "of a white Australia, so I am, I hope, equally as conscientious in the belief that the amendment is unjust, unfair, and.:, most unreasonable and improper application of that principle to which we all give our adherence. To look at the matter in a practical way, can any one suggest or affirm that, supposing the 7,000 lascars who are in the employment of the Peninsular and Oriental Company were dismissed, and 5,000 white sailors were engaged in their place, one single citizen in the Commonwealth of Australia would find employment <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> The Peninsular and Oriental Company is domiciled, so to speak, in England, it is managed in England, and I suppose 99 per cent, of- its shareholders are in England. I do not suppose that if the  Iascar  sailors were got rid of, any citizen of this Commonwealth would get employment. Therefore, when there is no practical advantage to be obtained, I think my honorable friend is rather pushing the white Australia doctrine to an embarrassing extent. Let us look at the history of the matter. When the monopoly of the East India Company ended, about the year 1834, the trade between India and China continued to be carried on by what were called country ships. Those country ships were manned almost entirely by lascars, but the steersmen  or officers  were Europeans. I believe it can be proved that the seamen who were in those days brought up in those ships were second to none in the world. About five years later, in 184.0, I think, the Peninsular and Oriental Company, with its then small fleet of ships, came upon the scene. The company" obtained most of its best sailors from among the lascars and Europeans who were acting in the country ships ; and for 60 years and a little over the company has continued to employ these  lascar  sailors, who are subjects of the King. I find, from a letter written by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Sutherland to the <inline font-style="italic">Times,</inline> in the year 1S99, that the British sailor at that time was not too plentiful, and that it would have been almost impossible, prior to the opening of the Suez Canal, to man the fleet of the Peninsular and Oriental Company with purely white sailors. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> says i - </para>

                    <para>It is not too much to say, therefore, that in these days, when English seamen are not too plentiful, the employment of intelligent seamen in our mercantile marine is as necessary to the manning of British ships in the Eastern seas as the employment of coloured troops is for the defence of the Empire. </para>

When the company's lines began to be worked regularly <inline font-style="italic">cid</inline> the Canal, it was the intention of the directors of the Peninsular and Oriental Company that the .ships would be manned exclusively by Europeans, the employment of lascars being confined to vessels running between India and China and on the coast lines. Accordingly the steamers leaving this country were provided with English crews, both seamen and firemen ; but with results so unsatisfactory that the efficient working of the mail service was seriously compromised. It was no uncommon experience to have half a crew in prison for drunkenness and disobedience to orders, and the directors found themselves compelled, after a year's experience of English sailors and stokers in the tropics,, to make the experiment of employing lascar crews on this side of Suez in order to get the work of their ships properly done. I sa3'., against their inclination, because it was feared, the. lascar would never stand the rigour of an English winter. But experience proved long ago that this apprehension was groundless. </para>

                <para class="block">The writer goes on to point out that this system is by no means a cheap one, because they keep in their vessels more lascars than they require, so that they may educate them and teach them to be sailors. One of the officers of the Orient Company, I believe, has given evidence to that effect. He ' pointed out that it is almost as expensive to maintain a mixed crew, of lascars and white men, as it is for the Orient Company to maintain their crews of white men only. Let us consider for a moment how these lascars are engaged. They are not engaged as units, but sometimes whole families are taken. The son, the father, and the grandfather may all* be in the employ of the Peninsular and Oriental Company at the one time. What sacrifice has been made in order to bring about this result1! These families have given up their positions in their native land. They have given up their places in the rice fields, the tea gardens, the public works, the railways or the canals of India, and have made up their minds to spend their lives in working under the British Crown and under the British flag. </para>

They have been doing this work for the last 60 years. I would now direct the attention of the committee to matters relating to this question so far as our own country is concerned. It appears that at the postal conference held at Wellington, prior to 1895, a motion was moved and passed, I think, that it should be represented to the British Government that the Australian colonies preferred to have their mails carried by ships which employed entirely white labour. Following upon that determination a resolution was carried at the postal conference held in Hobart, in 1895, that it be a condition in any future contracts that, mail steamers should be manned by white labour only. Another resolution was passed by that conference in which the following words occur - </para>

I cannot think that the fact of a few hundred lascars - ' he might have said thousands - subjects of the same Sovereign being employed on the mail steamers should be a matter that the Australian people should take so strongly to heart as to -say - "We will not even allow them to be employed." It seems to me we are getting into a position of great insulation, .and also in a position in which we may be charged with very great selfishness. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline>
                    Glassey's  amendment, was not assented to on the ground that the persons it referred to were British subjects, and that we must give a British subject that fair and generous treatment which we, as British subjects, claim for ourselves. Coming to the present time, let me remind.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline>
                    that to some people - and I am one of them - it appears to savour rather of cant and insincerity to ask the Senate to pass this amendment.
                </para>
                <para class="block">Here we have 9,300 kanakas expressly imported to work our sugar plantations in Queensland. Ten years ago a Royal commission advised that the kanaka labour should be done away with. There was such an outcry, however, that the kanakas are there to this day, and we know that, although we are going to get rid of them, we are going to do it with that human consideration, mercy, and justice which we have a right to apply to any body of labourers - 1 do not care how low they may be on the industrial ladder - whom, we have invited to our shores and whose services we have utilized We ought not to kick them out of the country like so many dead cats. We know that kanaka labour is to be gradually decreased, and no injustice is to be done. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> and those who support him will agree with me at once that this amendment on the face of it is cruel and unjust. As <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest says, it is selfish. It does not propose to give these people a moment's notice. It does not ask what is to become of them. What is to become of the 9,000 lascars in the Peninsular and Oriental Company's service, and the. 35,000 others engaged, in shipping generally, with 35,000 families dependent on them, who are employed on British boats ? It is not suggested that these men have to earn their own living, and the proposal does not take into consideration that they have given up their work in their native land in order to perform these duties for us. It is intended if this amendment is carried to inflict an injustice, a cruelty, and tyranny of which I for one would be ashamed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> asks have we not a right to assert that we will not give our own money for the carriage of mails by ships that employ other than white labour ? It is difficult to answer the honorable senator in one sentence, but I will reply to him by asking another question. I might just as well say to the honorable senator - Why did you sweeten your coffee this morning with sugar that was grown by Chinese, or Japanese, or Malays, or kanakas ? And 1 might ask some one else why he" sweetened his tea with sugar grown by negroes in Fiji or the Mauritius? 1 am trying to point out that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> Glassey's  argument as to whether we cannot do what we like with our own money has but very little in it, because every hour of the day we citizens of the Commonwealth are supporting black labour with our money, and we shall be compelled to do so. Let us apply this principle of a white Australia in a reasonable manner. It appears to me that we shall positively embarrass this company and twenty other companies, and we shall also embarrass the English Government, if we keep on insisting and insisting upon the application of this doctrine of a white Australia outside our own borders. Have honorable senators not heard of the word "jurisdiction"? Although I admire the trades unions for being on the alert in trying to make labour and keep Australia for our own people, what right have we to travel 12,000 miles away from our own shores and to dictate .to companies in the old country? There are good reasons win' I should appeal to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> to withdraw his amendment. </para>

The two points which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> made cannot be supported. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> has told us - and we know that the Minister made the pledge in the most solemn manner - that if my honorable friend would be content to withdraw his amendment, he would pledge himself that the Ministry would give effect to the principle of a white Australia as far as it could within the Commonwealth, and as far as it could within our own seas, so to speak. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Josiah</inline> Symon has pointed out that if this amendment is carried we may not be able to give a ship a contract to cany our mails, because a black cook is employed on it. That black cook may have served for ten years faithfully and well. He may be too old to begin work as a navvy, but according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey,</inline> that black cook must go about his business. The only fair way of dealing with that cook on the trade and labour unions' own principle would be to say that he has a right to stop there as long as he pleases, provided that he is of good behaviour and his master requires his services. When the black man goes that would be the time to say that no other black man should be employed, or that, if another black man was so engaged the ship in which he was employed should not carry our mails. I have given one reason why my honorable friend should withdraw his amendment. Let me give another. I made it a point to go into this matter, and 24 hours ago I read a printed copy of the mail contract. That mail contract, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> informed the Senate, is made by the Postmaster-General of Great Britain with the P. and O. Company. We do not appear in it. Our contribution is not a subsidy ; it is simply a payment for services rendered. We pay £72,000 per annum, and in spite of the representations made by the postal conferences in Wellington and Hobart, in spite also of the resolutions sent to the post-office authorities in Great Britain, they entered into a new contract, and they were compelled, as they were dealing with their own British subjects, to ignore those representations and resolutions, as they will be compelled to ignore the amendment proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey,</inline> if it is carried. A further reason why he should withdraw it is that the present contract does not expire till 1 905, so that the honorable senator will have plenty of time to go into the question in future sessions. He will have plenty of time to see how we deal with the kanaka difficulty and a white Australia within our own jurisdiction. He should wait to see what is possible and what is practicable, having regard to the principles of justice and mercy in reference to these lascars, who for two generations have been employed in carrying our mails. When he has seen how far we can apply this principle consistently with justice and mercy he can then bring in an amendment, possibly in a better shape, at some future time. Under all the circumstances, I appeal to the honorable senator to withdraw his amendment. </para>

                        <para>- Then, I say, let us exchange commodities with them. But I say, if we are going to bring the lascar or coolie or anybody else into competition with our own flesh and blood, when our own are as- capable and even more capable of performing the duties required, then I say we are doing wrong, and we are losing sight of the rights of the women and children of our own race, and considering in our humanitarianism the rights of the women and children of the darker races. That has, however, nothing to do with it. The black can work and sailorize on his own coasts as long as he likes, but if we have to subsidize a company to the extent of £70,000, then I say we have a right to ask that that money shall be spent among and for the benefit of people of our own flesh and blood. They are our first consideration, and I do not care what consideration is extended to the coloured races afterwards. Honorable senators talk to us about the impossibility. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> told us that despite the recommendations of the postal conferences in the past, the British Government will never do what is proposed. Those very individuals who made those recommendations backed down, and the honorable senator asks us if we would not be surprised at this ! We are not surprised at it at all, because we find a very similar class of people who, on public platforms all over the country are prepared to whoop for a white Australia,, and when  coming here they are asked to give practical effect to it, to .the smallest extent, they are not prepared to do it. We are not at all surprised. We know we have to fight this battle. I want to tell <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> and other senators,, that although on a very recent occasion the British authorities declined to sanction an Act that was passed excluding coloured labour in one of the States, they have not always done it, and will not always do it. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> if it is not a very peculiar tiling, that in that very State, Queensland, with respect to their mail contracts, they have a provision similar to that proposed. </para>

                        <para>- It may not be in any Act of Parliament, but the conditions are there, and the contract as made specifies the very same thing that we are asking to have embodied in an Act of Parliament. Is it not a fact also, that New Zealand has done the very same thing <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Yet I have not heard of any fresh eruptions in the volcanic mountains that exist there in consequence, nor have I heard that Joe Chamberlain, or any one else, has attempted to coerce the people of New Zealand. But if we are not going to submit to a system of toadyism that is always to place us in a servile position, so far as Great Britain is concerned, and if we are not going to refrain from asserting our own rights and principles in our own Acts of Parliament, we will find plenty of companies prepared to man their vessels with white crews. Why, even. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Charleston</inline> has cheered an assertion made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator -Dobson,</inline> that it was not on account of cheapness, and that it was found cheaper- to run the ships with white crews. Then why don't they do it <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> The very same argument comes in again. The directors of the P. and O. Company have used the very same argument as the advocates of coloured labour in Queensland - " the white man is not reliable." The Britisher who has carried our banners over every portion of the earth is not fit to do a bit of coal trimming in a mail steamer, or to fire up at one of the furnaces ! He is not fit to do ordinary sailors' work, and he must submit to the greater ability of the Indian lascar ! I think the senator who would make such an assertion ought to be ashamed of himself. He ought to be ashamed to so slander the race he belongs to. </para>

                        <para>- I have little consideration for the interjections of any one even here, who is prepared to go to the extent of depreciating, not only the British race, but the very race he comes from himself. I refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harney,</inline> and consequently I need not further refer to any of his interjections. I want to point out that when the Suez Canal was opened, and attempts were first made to work the steamers going through that way with white crews, it was not always contended that they should be changed because the white crews could not do the work. It was because the white man was not prepared to submit to the same conditions that the lascar was prepared to submit to. Have any honorable senators ever been down in the stoke-hole along with the lascar ? Have they ever seen the hose turned on him to make him do his duty, and even when the vessel lias been in danger at the time1? Such things have been of common occurrence in the past. </para>

                        <para>- " Hear, hear," again. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harney</inline> knows that these people are not as much subjects of King Edward VII. as we are, although they are far more subject to him. Where does their self-government come in <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Have they a voice in the government of their country? Are they not a conquered people, who are so subjected to the rule under which they live that, they have not a say in the appointment of any of their officials ? Is not that exactly the position they are in <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Any honorable senator who says that they are as much subjects of His Majesty as we are does not realize the ridiculousness of the proposition he is attempting to make. When these people have the same rights and the same privileges as have the colonists in different parts of the world, and the citizens of the British Empire itself, then there may be some reason in the suggestion that they are subjects as much as we are. They are subjects- far more than we are, as they have not our rights. I have no desire to do any injustice to them, nor has any honorable senator. But w-e say that when there are services to be performed, and our own people can profitably perform them, let them have the benefit of that employment. If there is 'anything in Asia, which can be done there but which cannot be done here, we are quite willing to exchange service then, but not until then. A great deal more, I dare say, will be said before a vote is taken on the amendment, and I hope that honorable senators who have pledged themselves to a white Australia will do all they possibly can to put in the way of their own flesh and blood all the benefits which it is in their power to do. </para>

                    <para>- A good many tilings have been introduced into the discussion of this amendment which appear to bear very little relation to the questions involved in so far as regards the present Bill. I do not think that the discussion is likely to be advanced much by referring, as I am sure was inadvertently done, to the Secretary of State for the Colonies as ''Joe Chamberlain." I think it is inadvisable that an expression of that kind should be used, and I am quite sure that it fell accidentally from the lips of my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor.</inline> Nor do I think that this amendment involves the question very much of the lascars that are employed by the Peninsular and Oriental Company, or by any other of those companies that trade with, eastern ports and carry mails. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> laid, it seemed to me, a good deal too much stress upon the effect of this amendment, if introduced into the Bill, upon those who are engaged under service to the Peninsular and Oriental or -other companies. If the provision is in itself a right one it is our business to adopt it. If it is a wrong one, it is our business to reject it. But if it is a right one, and we do accept it, then we can only hope that we shall be able to introduce into the administration of the measure some provisions which may mitigate the difficulty or the hardship to which he refers. Nor do I think that the argument is likely to be much advanced by our referring to the people of India, the lascars, as belonging to a conquered race. We must necessarily admit, as British subjects, that our title to dominion over India is conquest. But I should have thought that, instead of that being a reason for our treating with less consideration our fellow subjects in India, it would have been a strong reason for our treating them with additional consideration, and not regarding them as serfs who were unworthy to be employed on the service of our British ships, or in any other capacity than that Of soldiers in the field who are prepared to pour out their blood for the defence of the Empire. I should think that if they have been conquered by us we ought to rejoice, and to be proud to give them the same privileges, so far as we can, as we ourselves enjoy, and not at any rate to treat them as a subordinate . and an inferior race. </para>

What were the Scandinavians? What were the Norse sea-kings ? What were the Phoenicians who navigated the seas, and peopled Cornwall and those parts of England, and not only taught us seafaring, and the elements of navigation, but also taught us how to develop the mineral resources of our own country ? The Normans, too, were a seafaring race before coming into England and conquering us. </para>

                        <para>- Our great merit is, that the Anglo-Saxon race is made up - like the English tongue - -of contributions from all the peoples of Christendom. The Anglo-Saxon race enjoys its strength and its enterprise by reason of the mingling of all the blood of Europe, and, therefore, these arguments really are, I think, beside the question. Nor does it seem to me - I wish to dispose of them before I say a few words on the amendment - to affect the matter. Then, we are told that white sailors, or, as my honorable friend put it, our own people are displaced. I find no authority for that statement. I defy any one here to prove by statistics of the seamen employed in the mercantile marine, or, for the matter of that, in the navy of the British Empire, that our own people, to use my honorable friend's excellent phrase, are shut out. What has been the great cry for decades past? It is that we cannot get enough English seamen to man the mercantile marine. AVe have got men from every nationality in Europe, and we are obliged to do it. </para>

                        <para>- What is the use of my honorable friend talking about decent wages ? That is another point. It is a question of colour, and not a question of wages, that we are debating. My honorable friend wants to forbid the employment of coloured men simply because they are black, or mulattos, or red or yellow, and made of that colour by the Same hand as made us white. That is not a distinction which ought to be drawn. If my honorable friend brings in a Bill to enhance the rate of wages m paid to seamen I shall be with him. I have travelled a good deal on ships, and 30 or 40, or more, years ago, when I came to Australia, I saw how sailors were treated. I am happy to think that they are better treated, and better paid now. But in those days I recognised the hardships which they had to undergo. I know and recognise the inadequacy of their payment as well .as any man, but that is not the question we are dealing with. We are not dealing with the question of wages, and therefore before it - is stated here that our own people are displaced <inline font-style="italic">by</inline> the employment of lascars we want information and figures to prove it. I deny it. I say, on the contrary, without fear of contradiction, that the British mercantile marine would not be what it is to-day, or be manned as it is to-day, if we were to rely solely on' our own seamen. Therefore I put that aside. This debate- was introduced with great care, with much conciliation, and with great information, by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey,</inline> and it is a pity that we should surround and obscure it, as I humbly venture to think, by mere matters of prejudice, not calculated to throw light; on the issue we have to decide in accepting or rejecting the. amendment. But then again I would like to tell <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline> who put to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> Glassey as a reason for withdrawing the amendment, that if it were passed it would only be ignored, that he forgets that it would be a provision in an Act of Parliament which could not be ignored ; that if it goes in it goes in for some purpose, and to be carried into effect. Therefore, although I think there are strong reasons, if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> will permit me to say so, why he should withdraw the amendment at the present tune, I am free to confess that that suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> is not one of them, because if the amendment is introduced - and I think the Postmaster-General will say so - it will have to be carried into effect somehow or other. Q[t will be binding, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> said, on the Government and on the Commonwealth, and will have to be regarded as" of full force. But then <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> gave as an additional reason, that the Government had pledged themselves to give effect to this provision where they could. That attitude on their part to me is a surprising one. They do not oppose the amendment because it is wrong. They seem to me to oppose it because it is right. The statement that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> has called attention to - the pledge by the Government that this, if it is withdrawn, is their policy, and will be carried out--- </para>

                        <para>- I accept the honorable and learned senator's assurance that it is done. But one gets tired of expressions of sympathy with amendments unless they are translated into action. Sympathy is useless unless you crystallize it into support. I am not in sympathy with this amendment, but if I were I should support it and do my best to have -it embodied in tins Bill. I do not believe - and I think we should say so frankly, if that is our feeling - that there is any danger of a veto being being placed on this provision at all. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator. O'Connor</inline> put the matter fairly enough that, even though there was not a danger of the provision being vetoed, we should not court the possibility of it. To my mind there is no question of international relations being involved in this amendment at all. We are dealing with our own contracts. We have just as much right to say, supposing it is .our own contract - and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> Glassey's amendment deals only with our own contracts - what stipulations shall be put in that the work shall not be done by black, or yellow, or brown men, or any other kind of men, as to stipulate that railway contractors shall not employ black men upon their work. </para>

I should prefer, if that is the policy of the Government, that it should be clearly stated in the forefront of an Act of Parliament, so that all our people might know what is being done, and all the nations of the earth might be aware of it. " That is the position in which it seems to me the matter should be placed. There are, however, other reasons why this amendment should not be accepted.

In connexion with these postal contracts, however, the Postmaster-General not only enters into contracts under his hand and seal, but also into contracts by handing a mail to a ship to be carried to a particular place. Is the Postmaster-General to stipulate how that mail is to be carried ?

                        <para>- I would not interfere with what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> regards as perfect. The question of a white Australia has nothing to do with this proposal. That matter rests on totally different ground, and different conditions to those that effect the present proposal. There are several other conditions involved. My honorable friend's amendment aims not at a white Australia, but at a white universe. We are to shut out the black man from employment, irrespective of competence. That is what it comes to. If this amendment is carried, it is perfectly 'immaterial to me whether it affects thousands of lascars in employment at present or not ; although we know that many men of this race in India have been sailors for countless centuries. There' are no better sailors in the world than those who go in Arab dhows from India, and trade with Africa and Arabia. 'They have been doing the same sort of thing for centuries. No question of competency or courage is involved in the amendment, it is simply colour. We allow black men to compete with white men in other directions. Take the case of white pugilists, if you like. They fight with coloured pugilists. There is the case of Peter Jackson. </para>

                        <para>- We know that black pugilists have been allowed to fight with white pugilists in the past, and, what is worse, have beaten them. What is more, we stood by and joined in the cheering and admiring crowds when the Imperial contingent from India came to Australia. Those magnificent soldiers seemed to inspire us all with admiration. And those are the men who are going to be shut out, simply because of colour !I repeat that the question is not at all connected with that of a white Australia, nor is it a question of finding employment for seamen of our own flesh and blood, because we cannot get them. Then, again, let it be remembered that British ships are part of the soil of England. If we introduce this clause into the Commonwealth legislation, we may as well legislate as to who shall be employed in the workshops and factories of England. Has my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey,</inline> considered that? If this amendment were limited to ships on the Australian register, of course it would be in a totally different category, and I admit would have to be considered from a different point of view. But this amendment provides that in all contracts for the carriage of mails there shall be only white men employed among the crew. We are thus dealing with all British ships with which the post-office authorities may at some time or other have to enter into contracts. Then, again, what does my honorable friend mean in his amendment by the word " white " ? He says "shall be" white men." "White Australia" is a very convenient phrase. We have a general idea of what it means. </para>

                        <para>- And at all times. It is a beautiful phrase. In fact it is considered to be of such value that two or three distinguished statesmen have been contending for the honour of having invented it. I lay no claim to that myself. But the word " white " is, as I think my honorable friend will see, utterly indefinite. <inline font-style="italic">We</inline> should never legislate even in regard to a " white Australia " by simply enacting that there shall always be a "white Australia," or that the country shall always be inhabited by " white " men.

                    must define what he means by "white" men. Then, again, is it to be limited to men of our own blood, or are foreigners to be included, who in time of war may be a source of the greatest possible danger to us ? Are they to be " white " to the extent of being albinos

                    What are they to be ? For all these reasons I ask my honorable friend to withdraw his amendment and reconsider it. It will be unworkable if left in its present state, and it would certainly have the effect, as
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline>
                    has pointed out, of unfairly harassing the Postmaster-General in the administration of his department. Then, again, it has been pointed out, that we cannot control the arrangements and the managing of the ships, which carry our mails. If these lascar sailors are unequal to British seamen, or if their employment involve the companies in greater difficulties, that is a question for them to determine, not for us. At any rate, we have no right by compulsion to seek to interfere with the management of the Postal department, which might be driven if this amendment were introduced into the Bill to refuse to enter into contracts with ships flying the British flag, and to intrust the carriage of mails to foreign vessels. Such a state of things, I venture to think, would not be tolerated by this Senate. While at present we put our mails on board French and German ships, I fancy that the people of Australia would pause before they assented to anything which would make it compulsory that all our mails should be carried by ships flying foreign flags, much as we respect the nations to which those vessels belong.

I have also seen half-caste Portuguese and Indians employed as stewards on many vessels other than those of the Peninsular and Oriental Company. I think the difficulty of administration would be almost overwhelming, even to a Minister with so much energy as the present Postmaster-General, if such a provision as this were, without any limitation, introduced. I am glad' the subject has arisen for discussion, and if my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey,</inline> will allow me to compliment him, I may say that his speech could not have been delivered with better effect. The honorable senator almost persuaded me to become a follower of his. I should like to see him rewarded in every possible way.

It is urged that it is unfair to employ coloured labour on vessels under the postal contracts because other companies object to it. I can only say that I have never heard of am' such .objection. Other firms have never complained of the Peninsular and Oriental Company employing coloured labour, and, before any drastic steps are taken, we should be careful that no injustice is done.. As far as firemen and stokers are concerned, there is the greatest difficulty in getting British men to do such work. It is not a. question of wages. It is simply a question of getting the men. </para>

                <para>It is very important that we should remember that if we do away with coloured labour on board these vessels we shall have a class of sailors, such as Greeks, Italians, and others, who, in time of war, will be of no ' assistance to us. The Britisher as a rule having once taken a voyage to the , tropics, and worked in a temperature of from 120 to 130 degrees, has very seldom any desire to repeat it, and consequently there is great difficulty in obtaining Britishers for this work at all.

                        <para>- The Government has declared their policy of a white Australia, and when that policy is brought before us we shall be in a position to discuss it in all its phases. As was pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor,</inline> we are now practically running the risk, of having this very important machinery Bill hung up for an indefinite period. If we insert this amendment we shall be practically legislating against the employment of British subjects. Undoubtedly we are all part of a very great empire, and that empire embraces within its confines all classes of labour. If we pass this Bill it will have to be sent to His Majesty the King for his assent. Could His Majesty assent to such a Bill ? Could he consent practically to the exclusion of a certain part of his subjects from this field of labour? It seems to me that this is a strong position notwithstanding the arguments used by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Josiah</inline> Symon. We are not merely legislating for ourselves and for the Commonwealth. We are saying by this amendment that we will not 'enter into any contract for the carriage of mails whereby any person other than a white man shall be employed. By so doing we shall render it almost impossible for  His  Majesty the King to assent to the Bill. Another difficulty in which we should be placing the Government is that it will be impossible for them to enter into an arrangement with the British Government for the carriage of mails. If we adopt the amendment, I am thoroughly satisfied that we will not induce the British Government to follow our example at this juncture. We shall be driven to make separate contracts for the carriage of our mails,  outwards -at least, notwithstanding that we may even receive mails from Great Britain brought here by vessels manned by crews not all perhaps as white as ourselves. By receiving mails so brought to our shores we should be guilty of breaking in spirit the principle which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> desires to see embodied in the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- That is all the more reason why we should not embarrass the passage of the Bill by introducing tins policy into it. With regard to the question of whether white men can do the work coloured crews can perform, I, as a marine engineer, with experience of white and Chinese crews, can speak with some ' authority. I say that white men can work where coloured men can work. I do not believe it is a question of cheapness on the part of the companies who have adopted 'this system. Nor do I believe that they have adopted it because they desire to use their employe's just as they like. My experience is that we, as officers on board ship, have had more restrictions placed upon us in our treatment of the Chinese than we have had in regard to men of our own race. </para>

                        <para>- With the Orient Company employing white crews, and the Peninsular and Oriental Company employing lascars, there can be no philanthropic sentiment in it at all. It is a question of which crew they can work to the best advantage for themselves. If it were a question of cheapness, how could the Orient Company afford to pay for white crews, while the Peninsular and Oriental Company only pay for coloured men ? Is it to be supposed that the former is prepared to pay something for a sentiment ? Sentiment does not enter into commercial calculations. In my opinion it is more a question of convenience than anything else. </para>

                        <para>- No, I do not desire to do so. I have held all through that it is the trades union influence upon these men which has led to a better class being secured. Where an officer or an engineer has an organized body of men with a secretary to deal with, he knows that a man who is unworthy of a position in the ship, who is guilty of drunkenness and disobedience of orders can practically be boycotted. Such a man can be practically wiped out of the service. That I attribute to the influence of trades unionism. T think that to-day in many of our firemen and sailors we have a much better class of men than we had a generation ago. </para>

                        <para>- I say they are not all drunkards. At the same time I believe that, instead of dealing with this question in a Bill of this sort, it would be better to leave it to a Bill which would deal with it in a comprehensive manner. If I am asked how I account for the positions of British seamen being taken up by men of other nationalities, I say boldly that it is because of the glorious free-trade policy of Great Britain, and the fact that her industries have been so developed that she has been able to give employment to her own people at home. I very much question whether any one would go to sea in the stokehole of a steamer because he preferred it. If men can get work to do at home which will compensate them for their labour, they do not desire to go to sea, and it is because of the better condition of the working classes of England that we find that men of the British race are giving up the sea and engaging in the home industries of Great Britain. That is one great reason why their places in British ships are being taken up by men from the more highly-protected countries of Europe. They cannot get equally good conditions at home, and are practically forced to take service on the ships. If we were being asked to support this proposal to enable British seamen to be employed, there might be something in it. . But there is nothing to show that British seamen would be employed. Do my honorable friends think for one moment that people in the south of Europe, for instance, are paid the same rates of wages as Britishers are paid ? Certainly not. If we were being asked to confine this employment to British subjects, it might be well to insert the amendment ; but there is no attempt to do that, and we shall only have the cheaper-paid races of Europe competing against our own race if this amendment is carried. I do believe in enforcing good conditions for seamen, and I have always stood up boldly, as an engineer, for the best conditions for firemen and others working under me. I have always insisted that they should have everything possible given to them to enable them to carry on their labour efficiently. What do we find ? We find that the very same policy is the policy of the British Parliament, and they insist that the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act shall apply to lascars as to all others. They are striving to raise the standard' of living and the wages, and to improve the industrial condition of the people. That is what we should aim at here, and what I, as a trades unionist, have always contended for. I believe it is our duty to raise the lowest as high as possible, that our own position may be benefited thereby. When we speak of subsidizing the Peninsular and Oriental Company, or any other company, I fail to see where the subsidizing comes in, unless we are paying for more than we are receiving. ' If the £72,000 which is our share of the cost of carrying the mails represents the service rendered to us, where is the subsidy <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> If that is fairly our share then the steam-ship companies are under no obligation to us nor are we to them. </para>

                        <para>- We do that in order, not that we may get an immediate return, but that we may benefit a certain industry by seeking to permanently establish it. But when we stipulate with our mail-carriers to carry our mails; they say that if they are asked to carry them at a certain speed, they will have to demand a higher rate of payment than it would be necessary for them to demand if they might carry the mails at a lower speed. If we earned out the policy proposed, we would find that the Postmaster-General would be unable to avail himself of any opportunity to utilize any ships which might have any coloured men in their crews at all, for the despatch of our mails. We have now a line of Japanese boats trading to Australia, and the Postmaster-General might find it convenient to engage them to carry mails to and from their own country. Under this amendment such a contract would be forbidden. </para>

                        <para>- I have had experience of different races, and while no ' man favours his own race more than I do, I do not believe in imposing restrictions which would prevent our having our work well done for us. I believe that tins amendment would prevent our work being well done if it were carried. I know very well that there are to-day combinations of steam-ship owners that are very oppressive upon the producers of this country. Steam-ship companies have entered into strong unions and have raised freights enormously, and that is having a very depressing and injurious effect upon our industries. I say that if we are to interfere, it would be far better to say that we would not allow our mails to be carried by companies who have entered into combinations, to force up freights to an abnormal figure. </para>

When we are being urged to deal with the question of a white Australia in a comprehensive way, I shall say let us deal, with it boldly, and then throughout the whole of our legislation this policy may be made to tell. But to deal with it piecemeal like this would not be wise, and would only interfere with the passage of the Bill and with our Australian commerce. </para>

                    <para>- I am very much afraid that some of us are in danger of losing our characters. Considering the remarks that have been made during this debate, I am afraid that the outside public when they compare their utterances on the public platform with their speeches in this House, will be branding some of the members of the Senate as political opportunists. We hear a great deal of sympathy expressed with the idea that we should make Australia white, but as soon as we have a Bill before us that deals with any phase of the question, we are told that the time is not opportune, and that we should wait until we get a comprehensive Bill before us, when we will be able to deal with the question in a way that will be satisfactory to the people' of Australia. I venture to make the remark today, as I did the other evening, that on every matter that comes before the Senate relating to this particular question, whether it is a Bill to restrict the importation of Pacific Islanders, or a Bill dealing with mail contracts, I shall try to impose such conditions as in my opinion will carry out the idea of a white Australia. Therefore, I am not going to wait until the Government introduces another Bill, but I take the Bill before me, which deals with the Post and Telegraph service, and the amendment before me, which deals with the question of employing white labour upon mail steam-ships. The amendment says that in future we are to employ white men on the steamers carrying our mails, and I am therefore prepared to register my vote in support of it. I sincerely hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> will not be led away by the blandishments of honorable senators, but will push his amendment to a division, when we shall know who are desirous of having a white Australia. </para>

                        <para>- In his speech this afternoon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> quoted some remarks by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Sutherland in a letter to <inline font-style="italic">The Time*.</inline> As that gentleman occupies the position of chairman to the P. and O. Company, it is scarcely fair to press his views strongly on this most important question, because he is a highly interested party. It is a libel on the white sailors for him to say, as he did in <inline font-style="italic">The Times,</inline> that they are unreliable. That is not so, and I agree with the remarks which have been made . by several senators this afternoon. It is not a question of the reliability of white sailors or otherwise. It is a question of conditions - a question of rates of pay, and hours of labour and service, and because the P. and 0. Company have not felt inclined to use only white men there is not much likelihood of their doing it unless we are prepared to impose these conditions. You, sir, as well as other honorable senators, know that this is a very old question. We have debated it times and again in the State Parliament, and we have been told there exactly as we have been told here - that we are to wait. We are told that we are only parties to this contract, and that, therefore, we have no controlling power. Reference has been made to the postal conference in New Zealand where all the Postmasters-General of Australia solemnly declared that for the future white men were to man the ships carrying our mails. But not one of them so far as I can see has yet had the moral courage to put that resolution into effect, to make an honest attempt to attain that end in his representations to the British Government. In this debate the same old .arguments have been rotted c out. We are told to wait and see if something will turn up which will realize our desire. Reference has also been made to the shortage of sailors in our mercantile marine and in the navy. One of the reasons why there is this shortage is because there is not the same encouragement given to the British sailor as is given to men in other avocations. 'The result is that men who under ordinary 'Circumstances would make excellent sailors .are forced into other occupations. But that is not all. At the present moment, as we all know, there is quite a number of men who would and could occupy these positions in our mercantile marine and in the navy, but for the fact that they are edged out by unfavorable conditions. After looking at this question from every point of view, I think we ought to make representations to the British Government, at any rate to ask that our views shall be respected. We are told that if this amendment is passed, and the Bill becomes an Act, the British Government will veto it. I am not afraid of that, but the question will have to be faced .at some time. Exactly in the same way with any other Bill which we think is distasteful to the British Government, or a section, honorable senators may argue that we must not put in a certain provision, because  the British  Government will say "No" to us. I trust; that the amendment will be -carried, and that it shall be stipulated in all future contracts that white men alone ;shall be employed to man mail ships.  <inline font-weight="bold">Senator PLAYFOR.D</inline> (South Australia.) - I should not have risen to speak on the question, as it has been so fully debated, but for the fact that some honorable senators, especially <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> appear to me to have an idea that the Secretary of State for the Colonies has put down his foot on one or two occasions, and prevented a contract from being entered into with the condition that coloured labour should be kept out. It is also suggested that he has interfered in relation to certain Bills affecting the employment of Japanese in Queensland, and the importation of coloured labour into the colonies. The mail contract was made before <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> came into ofK.ee. Practically, the Liberal Government, in which the Marquis of Ripon was Colonial Minister, had settled the whole matter before the present Ministry came into office. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> has nothing whatever to do with the question ; in fact it is not under his department. It is dealt with by the Treasury and the Post-office. It will be within the recollection of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> that the Parliament of South Australia passed a Bill in which they named the people whom the}' intended to exclude from the State - such as Asiatics. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> was certainly in power when the Government declined to ask Her late Majesty to assent to the Bill, which had been reserved by the Governor for the signification of her pleasure thereon. I had a long conversation with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> on the subject ; his views are practically in accord with our views here, but there are two or three ways of doing certain tilings" which we want to be done - an exceedingly nice and pleasant way, and an offensive way. Great Britain has diplomatic relations with the Japanese and coloured races in various parts of the world, but the idea of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> was that we might very well exclude those races from Australia He was not opposed to that policy, but he held that their exclusion should be effected in a way which would not give offence. He said - "Instead of excluding them from the colony, by using their name and making the legislation offensive to the Governments of Japan , or China, and so on, you can exclude them by doing as they did in Natal. By imposing an educational test or a language test, and so on, you can accomplish your object exactly in the same way but in a manner which will give no offence." That appears to me to be a sensible and an exceedingly diplomatic way of managing affairs. If we can manage our affairs and accomplish our object in an exceedingly pleasant way, is it not far better to take that course than to go bald-headed and offend people where there is not the slightest necessity to offend? </para>

                        <para>- It certainly is a very good policy. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> has referred to mercy and justice, and asked that mercy and justice shall be meted out to 35,000 lascars. He appears to look upon them as a people whom the Bill with this amendment would affect more. arbitrarily than others. He has drawn a harrowing picture of these poor fellows being thrown out of work. I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey,</inline> if he reflects for a moment, will see that it will have little effect in that respect. It can only have some effect in regard to certain seamen under certain circumstances, and the immense trade done by the Peninsular and Oriental Company, who are the chief employers of lascars, will not be affected. "When this harrowing picture of what an unjust and unmerciful thing it will be to pass the amendment is looked into, it will be found that there is really nothing in it. </para>

                        <para>- There are 7,000 lascars under the Peninsular and Oriental Company . <inline font-weight="bold">Senator PLAYFORD.-</inline> It would throw out but very few of them under any circumstances. Then we are informed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Charleston</inline> that we are shutting out British subjects. Nearly all of us here have stood on public platforms and advocated white Australia. Did <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Charleston,</inline> in his advocacy of a white Australia, say that he was not going to shut out British subjects ? Of course he was, because, of all people of whom we may be frightened the Hindoos come first. They are, year by year, increasing in number so greatly that the great problem before the Indian Government is to find some room for the surplus population, and they would only be too glad to get rid of a few millions of them every year. If we intend to have Australia white, we must keep out the Hindoos, as well as others. They certainly are British subjects. We have also hundreds of thousands of British subjects who are Chinamen. We have Singapore, Hong Kong, Penang, the Straits Settlements, Malacca, and Borneo, and the majority of the inhabitants are British subjects. The arguments which honorable senators use to discount this move by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> are precisely the same as the arguments one can use against a white Australia. </para>

We do not ask them to carry it to absurd extremes, and apply it to .every possible case. AVe do not expect them to do impossible things, but it would be a great deal better that the amendment should be embodied in the Bill. I believe that in the future it will not be necessary in a great many instances, even in the case of the carriage of mails to Europe, for the Government to enter into contracts. We shall very likely be able to do what is done in America, where the Government put their mails on board a ship that is going to any particular place, and pay for them by weight or per letter, according to a regular scale of charges. If that is to be the practice in the future, as I believe will be the case, no harm will be done by having such ' a provision in the Bill. There is no doubt that the Government can carry it out in' regard to the inter-State mails without any trouble. In connexion with that, there is another very important matter, although it is not strictly connected with the carriages of mails. There are ships carrying coloured crews which trade between port and port,, and which are cutting into our inter-State trade. AVe ought to do something to protect that trade in the same way as our cousins in America did in regard to their shipping trade. For these reasons I shall support the amendment. </para>

                    Heseemed to be under the impression that the commission which inquired into the black labour question in Queensland adopted a majority report against the employment of black labour. The facts are just the other way about. The majority of the commission, were in favour of the continuance of the employment of black labour, but a minority,, including the

                    H. Groom, who is now a member of the House of Representatives, were in favour of substituting white labour. The opinion of the majority of the commission was that in places above a certain parallel of latitude black labour should be permitted to be employed. I. have no doubt that in his speech in reply
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline>
                    will give the committee the exact facts, because he knows them very well. I have always been under the impression that the British Empire was a cosmopolitan empire. AVe are part of that empire, and I cannot conceive' it to be otherwise than inconsistent that we should not be cosmopolitan. For that reason alone I shall oppose the amendment. Irrespective of that, there would be a great deal of difficulty in giving effect to it if carried. In'Australia there are a number of Eurasians who have children born in the States.

                    <para>- In regard to the policy of a " white Australia," I am glad to say that there are a number of senators who at the elections were never asked a question upon the matter. If I had been asked, I should have replied that I believe in .a white Australia in my sense of the phrase. My impression is that we should have a stream of European immigration, and that Australia does not exist for the handful of people who are at present in it, but for the British race amongst others. Coloured people are God's creatures like ourselves. It is to my mind a matter of regret that there .are honorable senators who, having wide views in other respects, entertain so narrow an opinion upon a question of this sort. It seems to me that we have tories in our midst. The modern tories of Australia are those who call themselves the labour party. 'They want to punish people for that for which they are unaccountable, namely, their colour. It is absolutely unchristian, and I am quite unable to agree with my honorable friends in the matter. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Josiah</inline> Symon has said so much with which I coincide that I need not prolong the discussion. He has shown that the British race have not a monopoly of seamanship. We need not go back as far as the Phoenicians or other ancient peoples to realize that it is absurd to suppose that the British people are the only good sailors. AVe regard New Guinea as almost a part of the Commonwealth in one sense. </para>

                        <para>- I speak of British New Guinea. There are splendid sailors in that island. Some honorable senators, I have no doubt, have been as far north as Thursday Island. There are there many aboriginal natives of Australia who are excellent seamen, and they will be excluded under this provision. All our most generous instincts are outraged by this proposal. One of the most estimable sea captains in Sydney, from whom one hires boats, is a black man. He is a splendid sailor. There is not a better seaman in Sydney Harbor than that man. Is it not outrageous that in this twentieth century we should carry our prejudices to such an extent as to go back to a policy worthy only of the days of darkness ? I can understand many people objecting to going to sea if they can find other employment, and that is an additional reason why we should not forbid the employment of black labour. When <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Johnson</inline> was asked his opinion about going to sea, he said that it seemed to him that going to sea was like going to prison, with the chance of being drowned thrown in. Numbers of people cannot stand being on board ship at all. I trust that honorable senators will have a chance before long of visiting other parts of Australia than the temperate regions. Those who have lived in t]i tropics would have been much worse off there had it not been for coloured labour. While opposing the amendment, I compliment <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> on the way he has brought it forward, and desire to say that I have nothing but respect for him personally. </para>

As far as the amendment is concerned, I feel somewhat humiliated that in a British Legislature a proposal so unjust and so uncharacteristic of that sense of fair play which is supposed to be inherent in all British statesmen should be brought forward for consideration. AVe are asked to say that along our coasts no coloured sailor shall be employed, yet we know that along the coasts of Asia British shipping to the extent of hundreds and thousands of tons is always trading. </para>

                        <para>- I am quite aware of that. But I want to draw the attention of the Senate to the position of shipping. AVe are asked to exclude all coloured labour from the coast of Australia, while at the same time white labour is employed in carrying the very products of the great countries of Asia to our shores. That cannot be equal British fair play. It does not appeal to our sense of what is right and becoming. Added strength is given to this contention when we remember, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Josiah</inline> Symon has pointed out, that in dealing with the people of India we are dealing with a population we have conquered, and to whom by ever}' right of justice, by every sentiment of British fair play, and by everything that has distinguished our race in the past, we are bound to deal out not alone mercy - I do not ask for that - -but everything that we in justice and equity can give them. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot take a small view of this question. I cannot forget what has taken place in the past ; the developments which are taking place in regard to various Asiatic powers, the growing power of the coloured races. If we look forward to the possibilities of the future, we shall hesitate very much indeed, if we want to do what is best for Australia and the Empire, before we put upon our statute-book a provision which carries with it a great insult to one half of the world's inhabitants. It has been for a long time past the boast of Great Britain that she is more or less of an Asiatic power, and that her presence in Asia has done a great deal to develop India and the contiguous countries. She has brought peace to them. There has been an increase of wealth, and the natives of India and of Asia generally are in a better position than they were at the beginning of the last century. They recognise that they enjoy greater privileges and greater blessings under the British flag than they possessed in years gone by. Having regard to the expansion which is taking place in China and Japan, and the certainty of greater development in the future, it is not for us when we do not know what the coming years will bring about, and when we do know that it is desirable for us to have the friendship of a country like Japan, to put upon our statute-book a piece of legislation which they would look upon as an affront and an insult. I want the distinction between legislation such as this, and such as is required to carry out the idea involved in the principle of a white Australia, to be clearly seen. I am an advocate of the policy of a white Australia. I recognise that evil has resulted in America from the mixture of white and coloured races. We ' require to keep the races in Australia distinct. We desire to keep the races in Australia white, and we must not admit coloured races in any indiscriminate manner. .1 do not propose to admit them at all. All coloured labour should be kept out of Australia. But keeping coloured labour out of Australia is one thing, and trying to keep coloured labour out of British ships on the high seas is quite a different matter. It is a difference which I think we shall do well to understand. I have pledged myself in favour of a white Australia in the sense in which I am referring to it, but most decidedly I will do everything in my power to prevent that policy being extended in a direction which was never contemplated. </para>

I trust therefore, that this amendment will be defeated by a very handsome majority. There are many other directions in which I might elaborate my objection to the amendment, but considering the length to which this debate has extended, I content myself with these few remarks, and by again expressing the earnest hope that the honour and fair play of the British Empire will be vindicated to-night by the defeat of this amendment. </para>

                        <para>- I wish those honorable senators who talk so much about drawing the line would only draw it. I wonder if they have ever looked the position they take up squarely in the face ? I am going to try and put it to them as. clearly as I can. The primary objection which has been taken by the opponents of this amendment is that in legislating, in this fashion we are "interfering with the inalienable rights of British subjects. They say that this amendment is aimed at the- Indian subjects of the Government, and that as these people are citizens of the British Empire just as much as we are, they are entitled to every right within the boundaries of the empire that we enjoy. Very well : but are honorable senators who argue in this way prepared to face that position in its entirety. If this contention is correct, then I say that the Indian coolie, in his thousands and tens of thousands, can come here and swamp the white workers of Australia.. Are the people of Australia prepared for that? </para>

I look upon him as one of those canines who is prepared to betray his trust for any little bone that is thrown to him. Are honorable senators prepared to face the position such as I have placed before them. If they are, we might as well at once abandon all talk of a white Australia. What is the good of talking about a white Australia if we have not a right to prevent the Hindoos and the coolies, and all the other alien subjects of the King from coming here? Have we that &gt; right or not ? If we have, then we can keep them out. If we have not, then we have no power to keep them out. I think we : should have some strong statement on the question- from honorable senators. who get up to discuss it. I have always been under the impression that this is a self-governing community. We have been told that we have supreme power in connexion with everything Australian, and that we are as much a self-governing community, as far as our interna] affairs are concerned, as the people of Great Britain themselves. </para>

                        <para>- It is not external at all. The honorable senator who made that interjection does not seem to be able to differentiate between what is external . and what is internal. I would ask the honorable senator's attention for a moment. If the Government of the Commonwealth makes a bargain with a particular shipping company to carry the mails of the Common-, wealth to some distant part, is not that a. matter which affects the internal affairs of the Commonwealth ? </para>

                        <para>- It affects purely the internal affairs of the Commonwealth.. The agreement that we make with a particular shipping company is that it will cany our letters to a particular part of the world, and from a particular port of the world, and we say to this company - " One condition of the contract we make with you. is that you shall only employ white crews." . Either we have a right to make such a condition or we have not. The Postmaster-General admits that we have the right, but he says that it would be injudicious, perhaps,' to put it into the Bill. We are assured, however, that the Government will take very good care that this very provision, which we ought not to put into the Bill, will be put -into the contracts. If the Government can put a condition of this kind into its contracts, why not put it into the Bill ? The Vice-President of the Executive Council says that if we inserted such . a provision in the Bill, the Imperial Government would probably refuse its assent. </para>

If the honorable senator had his way, instead of having 100,000 blacks, we should have 10,000,000. I know how he would develop the resources of Australia. He would bring in cheap coloured labour by thousands and hundreds of thousands. He does not make any secret of his belief. He tells us that he is in favour of free-trade in labour. Is the honorable senator also in favour of free-trade in capital <inline font-style="italic">1</inline></para>

The question of colour involves much more than the mere whiteness, brownness, blackness, or yellow hue of a man's countenance.Why do we particularly object to the employment of coloured people ? There are two reasons, so far as I can gather. One reason is that we do not believe in mixing the breed. We do not want to debase the national currency, to use another phrase. Another reason is that we do not want to subject ourselves to competition with the cheap </para>

We heard a great deal this afternoon and on previous occasions about the British mercantile marine being manned by foreigners. How has it come about? Do honorable senators know the history of this question? Do they not know that the British seaman has been continual!)' agitating for the last 50 years for improved conditions ? Have they ever heard of a gentleman named Samuel Plimsoll, who for a very long series of years agitated for a load line ? Has it ever come within the range of their ken that British ships were for decade after decade nothing more nor less than floating coffins, and that the British seaman, seeing that he could not get good conditions, safe ships to sail in, and could not get decently paid for his work; seeing also that he was fed more like a dog than a man - all in the interest of commercialism, all in the interests of the beautiful policy so strongly advocate by Senators Pulsford and Walker of New South Wales.

                        <para>- Perhaps honorable senators will just permit me to say that those two honorable senators are doing more injury to the cause 'of free-trade than it is possible almost for any other two honorable senators to do, because if their principles were carried out to their logical conclusion, the result would be such as would make free-trade stink in the nostrils of every man who loves Australia. As I was saying, th reason why British seamen desert British ships as we are told rats leave a sinking ship, is because they were not decently paid or decently fed, and because the ships in many cases were mere floating coffins. They tried to get better conditions and they were refused. The British Parliament, with its reverence for free-trade principles, would not interfere with the sacred doctrine of supply and demand. Oh, - no, it would never do, and the consequence was that the British seaman looked out for other occupations, and took himself to other parts of the earth. He went over to America to help build up the splendid national edifice which we see over there to-day, and now we have men from every country in Europe manning British ships, whereas, if we had a decent protectionist policy in force, which protected the workmen as well as the capitalists, the ships of Britain to-day would be manned not by people from the </para>

                        <para>- That was the cry of the British ship-owner, and he said, " Employ a British seaman ! No, I will not employ a man I cannot trust two hours out of my sight, when I can get a Dane, a Norwegian, a Swede, or a German, who is as sober and as constant as the sun." We have heard the British seaman slandered, and we have seen the other disabilities under which he has been placed, and still honorable senators get up in this Chamber and lament the fact that the British marine is manned by foreigners instead of by Britons, and now when the foreigner is becoming exhausted what does the capitalist do? Why, he turns to the dusky millions of Asia. He says that the white seamen will not work except under conditions upon which the shipowner cannot make so much per cent., and then he says we will bring his black brother from India, his fellow subject of the King, into competition with him, and if he will not submit to our conditions we will starve him out. We here in Australia, fortunately,. I think, for ourselves, and fortunately, I believe, for civilization, take entirely another view of the question. We say capital has. its rights, but we also say that labour has its. rights, -and we insist not only upon the labourer in every occupation being well paid, having decent hours, fair conditions, and all the rest of it, but further that the labourer shall be one of ourselves. The first duty of every man is to those of his. own household, and the first duty of every country is to its own people. We say if we have any employment to give, if we have any money to spend, or any cash to circulate, it shall be circulated amongst our own people, and not amongst black people ; who, although it may be an unchristian doctrine this to preach, and although it may be a very conservative doctrine - because we have been stigmatized as infidels and tories - charity, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> ought to know, begins at home, and when we have swept our own doorstep clean, when we have got our own white brothers and sisters into the fold, when they are all well oft' and comfortable, and treated as we would like to see them, I am with the honorable senator and ready to go with him on an expedition into Asia to see whether we cannot do something for the people there. But while there, is any work to be done here I consider it .my duty to remain here. That is the position we take up. We say we have no ill-feeling against the people of these countries, but our first duty is to our own people, and to see that they get employment, because we are not all millionaires, unfortunately. Fortunately for himself, the honorable senator may be so situated as to be beyond the reach of want, but the great majority of the people of this country have to dig and toil and, moil for their daily bread, and they have great difficulty in many cases in getting it. We are here to see that even' opportunity of getting a decent livelihood is placed within, the reach of fill our citizens. </para>

The honorable senator nudges his neighbour, but I can assure him that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> has very little sympathy with him on the present occasion. I do not know whether it would be in order for me to discuss this question of our fellow subjects. I am not going to enter into it at any length, but it appears to me that you cannot mix wine with oil, and you cannot , put new wine into old bottles. You may try to build up an empire, one-fourth of which is composed of white men, with' one standard of civilization and one set of ideas with regard to social, political, and industrial subjects, and the other three-fourths of the empire being people with entirely different ideas on every subject one could mention, and also of a lower type of civilization - I say you may attempt the task of building up a homogeneous empire composed of such materials, but the task is impossible. This may appear strong speech, but it appears to me to be simply impossible to build up an empire on such a principle. You cannot weld two pieces of iron together unless they are both equally heated, and I say you cannot join two races, you cannot mingle two "races, you cannot blend them unless there is something in common between them. So that to attempt to build up a homogeneous British Empire out of such materials as we have at our hands is one which I say is bound to end in failure. </para>

                        <para>- And as the honorable senator interjects, he is not an Indian. He is sent over from Downing-street,, and is inspired from Downing-street. The Indian is governed, not by the people of India, not in accordance with Indian ideas, but by the people of Great Britain, and after the fashion of British ideas. Probably it may be that this very fact accounts for the serious difficulties, social and industrial, we find occurring so often in the history of India.. We have heard all manner of objections to the amendment. It is extraordinary how easy it is to find flaws in a proposition when one is not in accord with it. One honorable senator said - " When we come to deal with the question of a white Australia,, let us bring in a comprehensive measure,, and then I shall be with you.!' When a man goes into a field to plough it, he has to turn it over furrow by furrow. When a man goes out to fell a forest, he has to cut the trees down one by one. He cuts down the forest, but one tree after another disappears before the blows of his axe.' In like manner we have to deal with our legislation. We cannot pass a comprehensive measure which will embrace the whole population of the Commonwealth. We have to do the thing in a piecemeal way. We have to do the best we can, and that we are attempting to do by this amendment. Any honorable senator who cannot see his way to support the amendment need not tell me that he is in favour of a white Australia. Probably he is in favour of a white Australia when he is on the platform. One honorable senator said that he was never asked a question about the subject. I am 'very sorry he was not. Being a six years man' he is probably placed beyond the reach 8f the wrath of the electors. I would warn him to escape from wrath to come, for assuredly it will fall very heavily upon him, if he does not take care. I admire his honesty. He ds in a much superior position to those who get up and say one tiling here, whereas when they were before the electors they said something quite different. I can honour a man who holds certain opinions, even if I disagree with them. He is a much better type of citizen than a man who professes one thing before the electors and practises another thing before the Senate. Wherever the Commonwealth has a farthing to spend, I shall endeavour to put the spending of that money in the way of people of my own race and blood. We have heard something about the teeming population of India, and of outlets being wanted for them. I have no objection to outlets being found for the surplus population of India. But there is a surplus population in the country from which we come - in Great Britain and Ireland - and so far as I am concerned, I mean to keep this territory for them and their children. We ought to keep this territory for white people, no matter what anybody says - no matter about the connexion with the British Empire. We ought to be masters in our own household. If we are not a self-governing people, then the sooner we find it out the better.

                    <para>- I wish to make a few observations, but not so as to prolong the discussion, which I confess has lasted a little longer than I anticipated. It has been of some value, however, and- 1 sincerely hope that it has had the effect of inducing the Postmaster-General to withdraw his opposition. I am very glad to hear from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> that only 7,000 coloured men are engaged in the ships at which my amendment is aimed. He asked by implication if those 7,000 men were replaced by 5,000 white men - the proportion which 1 assume he supposes would be employed in their place - what benefit would it be to the Commonwealth ? It would be a considerable benefit I think. At any rate the bulk of us say that we wish Australia to be the home for a white, free race, and all my amendment aims at is an extension of that policy - a declaration that in future mail contracts there shall.be a stipulation that men of our own race and colour, under our control, and receiving our pay, shall be engaged. It is not too much to say that if 5,000 men of our own race and colour were engaged to fill the places of 7,000 men of another race and colour it would be of &lt; some benefit to the people of the Commonwealth. At any rate it would show that we are in earnest so far as our opinions have been expressed with regard to the establishment of this great principle of a white Australia. . <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> is aware that not only is this contention being made in Australia, and made, too, with some force and activity, but is also being made by the people of Great Britain. The people of Great Britain, members of the House of Commons, the great industrial organizations of the old country, and more  particularly those who are engaged in mercantile pursuits, ask that this principle be established not only on this side of the globe, but also on the other side of the globe. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> said that the P. and O. Company have actually tried to work their ships with white men, and that the experiment failed. I would not for a moment imply that he would attempt to mislead the committee by ' giving false information. That </para>

With regard to the objections raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Josiah</inline> Symon, I may be pardoned for saying that they appear to me to be simply legal, quibbles. How would it be possible to define absolutely what a coloured man is ?' There are men with dark blood in their veins some of whom are as fair in complexion as our Chairman. Some are dark ; but it would not be possible to put, in the Bill the exact shade of colour of every person who may be employed. I deal with ' matters in a broad and general sense. I do not know that any medical man in the world could frame a definition such as is asked for by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Josiah</inline> Symon, who, with that acuteness in hair-splitting and straw-splitting to which he is accustomed at the bar, made a good! deal of fun out of the case of the cook. I do not object to a little fun, but when I am told that it would be impossible to carry out such a provision as this, I am reminded of a letter I received from an old friend of mine some years ago, in regard to a suggestion I had made to him, which he thought it would be impossible to carry out. He said, " Brother, speak of possibilities, and do not suggest wild extremes." I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Josiah</inline> Symon to speak of possibilities, and not to suggest wild and ridiculous extremes, as ' I may be pardoned for saying the honorable and learned senator has done. Another point has been raised - a sort of hobgoblin to terrify people. It is that the British Government is likely to object to this amendment. We are told that the Imperial Postmaster-General must have a. say in the matter. I am not here to anticipate what the British Postmaster-General may do.

                        <para>- I wish to assist the Postmaster-General to get the Bill through quickly, but I am not possessed by his fears, nor do I think there is the slightest justification for them. In this matter, which so seriously concerns the welfare of the Commonwealth, the Government have not shown that firmness of purpose which the people of Australia expect from them. Therefore the amendment is essential. The Postmaster-General will clearly understand that if the amendment were passed no harm would arise so far as existing contracts are concerned. Therefore no inconvenience would be felt. I shall not attempt to answer all the objections which have been raised by honorable senators. Some of them appear to me to be very foolish. But there is one objection of which I will take notice. It was raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Charleston. His</inline> line 'of argument was that it is not wise to exclude those persons who are aimed at by the amendment, because they are British subjects. The same argument will apply to the exclusion of coloured races from the soil of Australia. It may be said that they are British subjects, and we have no right to exclude them from our soil. But I hold that we have a perfect right to do so ; and that it is our duty in the interests of the Commonwealth, and for the sake of the safety of the people who travel in the vessels to which I allude, that white sailors shall be employed in our ships. Let me direct the attention of the committee to the wreck of the <inline font-style="italic">Quetta.</inline> It is alleged with good reason that that wreck was largely due to the carelessness and timidity of the lascars who manned the veseel </para>

It is not necessary to prolong the discussion. I shall content myself by dividing the committee. I do not know whether I shall carry the amendment, but I hope I shall ; and I trust that honorable senators will cast a vote which will give effect to the will, wishes, desires, and aspirations of the people of the Commonwealth by establishing the policy of a white Australia, not only in regard to the soil itself - and along our coasts, but also so far as relates to the manning of vessels which we subsidize for the carriage of our mails to and from Great Britain and other ports. </para>

                        <para>- I do not suppose the Postmaster-General would send mails by any ship without some sort of written agreement ; and that would, under the terms of the amendment, bring in such a line of ships as I have referred to. There is no interpretation clause in the Bill defining the word "contracts," and in the absence of an interpretation clause it appears to me to be certain that the amendment would apply. Therefore, I cannot see my way to support the amendment in its present form. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator CHARLESTON</inline>
                    (South Australia). - -From the arguments which I have heard, it seems to me that the only intention
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline>
                    has is directly to exclude the P. and 0. Company from carrying mails. He states plainly that any ship having coloured crews, even if only carrying mails temporarily, and not under a definite contract, may be excluded. I do not understand that. I do not think that any one reading the amendment would be led to suppose that that was all that the honorable senator intended. It seems to me that the amendment provides quite clearly that the Postmaster-General cannot enter into contracts, whether for the carriage of one mail only, or for the carriage of mails for a period of years, with a company which employs other than white crews on the vessels to be engaged in carrying those mails. I fail to- see how
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline>
                    could contend that coloured servants, such as stewards or cooks, might be employed on such vessels. I do not think that
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline>
                    moved his amendment with any such narrow view as that in his mind. If I understand the amendment at all, the intention of it is to exclude from the contracts all coloured labour.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline>
                    very clearly put it that he- did not believe in quibbles ; that he did not believe in having coloured servants, whether employed as waiters, or otherwise. Therefore, it is plain that he means that all coloured seamen, and coloured servants, shall be excluded from ships carrying mails.

                    <para>- I am not going to interpose at this stage of the debate with a speech of any great length. This subject is of such great importance, and the mover of the amendment and those who support him are so much in earnest, that I cannot vote silently upon it. I desire to gay this, to start with, that it seems to me that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> is beginning where he might have hoped to end. I mean by that, that if he succeeds in carrying this amendment he need not despair of carrying out any form of legislation whatever which might come within the scope of the term " white Australia." The honorable senator is directly attacking Imperial interests. He will admit that. I feel as I have already said in discussing this question, of a white Australia, that that is the greatest difficulty we have to face, and yet the honorable senator is facing it here. </para>

                        <para>- The main point is that they do not sign within the Commonwealth. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> will therefore see that he is attempting the most serious form of legislation which can possibly come within the meaning of a white Australia. I suppose I may congratulate him - although I am not quite certain 'about it - on the attitude of the Government with regard to this amendment. I listened with a great deal of curiosity and great amusement to the expressions of both the representatives of the Government while the amendment was being discussed. I heard sympathy poured out freely and abundantly. The whole atmosphere was rarified with sympathy. Occasionally, by way of a stage aside, and some irrelevant interjection, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> was informed that there was not likely to be any practical outcome to his proposal, so far as the Government were concerned, but he was told 'that the amendment had the widest sympathy that it could command from the Government. Therefore I suppose he is to be congratulated on the effect of his speech, and of the speeches of those who supported him, upon the representatives of the Government. I am not going to vote on this question without distinctly saying what I have said elsewhere on the subject of a white Australia, because it is prominently brought before us. I am not going to offer <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> the cold comfort of my sympathy, but I am going to deny him the value of my vote. I sympathize with the cry for a white Australia, and I am prepared to give- it my strongest support whenever it touches the question of social or moral legislation. My objection to the introduction of what are comprehensively termed black people into, this Commonwealth is that it spells race deterioration, and every possible opportunity that I can find to prevent that invasion of black humanity into Australia, I shall take. So far as the industrial side of my friend's amendment is concerned, he has not got my sympathy at all, and he will recognise that he is making this appeal to the Senate purely on the industrial side of the question. </para>

                        <para>- I confess that if I had been otherwise inclined to support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey,</inline> seeing that the amendment does refer to the industrial aspect of a white Australia, I should have hesitated for the reason that I cannot see what he is aiming at, unless it is to improve the status, indirectly, of the British navy. I have heard it said that we should encourage the employment of white men on board steamers coming to Australia, because such men will form the nucleus of the British navy hereafter. If the honorable senator has moved the amendment with that view, I can only suppose it is a generous attempt to supplement that magnificent contribution which Australia gives to Great Britain for her naval protection. But is that really his intention? I do not think that the honorable senator is considering the improvement of the British navy. He is probably considering some advantage that will accrue to the Commonwealth. The only advantage that I can possibly see is that if he carries his amendment, it will open up an avenue of labour to residents in the Australian Commonwealth, which at present is not open to them. He will give them an opportunity of working down in the stoke-holes of the Peninsular and Oriental boats. I wish to approach this subject seriously. If this is the reason - and I frankly confess I cannot see any more direct result to accrue - it is. not sufficient to satisfy me. I will not admit that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> and those who support him are the only persons who are anxiously desirous of improving the material position. of everyone in the Commonwealth. They have not that monopoly, and I say frankly that if this endeavour of theirs is only to succeed in opening up such an avenue of employment as that which I have indicated, their friends might just as well ask to be saved from them. They will not be doing Australia very much good. </para>

                        <para>- When Senator Mcgregor has finished his interjections I will continue my speech. He reminds me of one of his own most excellent arguments. In viewing this question he adopted the very sound attitude of the free-trader, but he does not extend that free-trade principle very far. He wants to prevent men who are members of this Empire from sharing in the employment he would reserve for residents of Australia. That is another aspect of this question with which I cannot possibly sympathize. I recognise that the Peninsular and Oriental Company, which is the only one aimed at, is a company that carries on its operations chiefly and firstly in and about India, and it is simply because its operations have originated in connexion with our vast Indian Empire that we see lascars and coolies employed in the stokeholes of the Peninsular and Oriental Company's ships. I would therefore point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> that his amendment deals not only with England itself, but with the extension of England's empire into India. Although I recognise that in this Bill we are attempting to do all sorts of tilings we ought not to do, I do not think we ought to begin legislating for Great Britain through our postal measures. Finally, I would tell <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> that I have a very good mind to give him my vote after all, because I think there is just the chance that if his amendment were inserted the Royal assent to the Bill would be refused. It would be the best thing that could happen for Australia if this measure were thrown out lock, stock, and barrel. </para>

                    Neild, whose sympathies are with the great mass of the people. I wish to be practical, and I do not attempt in my amendment to interfere with mails put on board any ship with the owners of which there is no contract for the carriage of mails. When the Postmaster-General comes to enter into a general contract for the carriage of mails to Great Britain, then my amendment means that a stipulation shall be inserted in that contract that the vessels on which the mails are carried shall be manned by white crews only. With regard to the French steamers and those of other companies who are paid for the carriage of our mails by weight, this amendment does not touch them at all. It simply deals with contracts which may be entered into in future.

                        <para>- We come now to a question which has been very much debated already. I do not wish to say anything to deprive any honorable senator of an opportunity of expressing his opinions on the subject, but I hope it will not be found necessary to travel over all the same ground again. When this matter was before the committee last, I said I would have a clause printed defining a periodical ; that clause has been printed and circulated to honorable senators. To recapitulate what I said before, the desire is that in connexion with all these publications, whether daily newspapers or papers published only once a month, there should be rates charged which would at all events be fair and uniform for the different classes of publications. In Great Britain the definition of a newspaper was, a publication that came out at intervals of not less than a month or 30 days. That, it was found, would not work, because it brings within the definition a great number of publications of a very different character. We know what a newspaper is in the ordinarily accepted sense of the term - daily papers and generally weekly papers containing a recapitulation of the news which appeared in the daily papers. But when we go outside the seven-day limit we come to a number of publications of a very various character. I had a deputation to see me the other day representing a number of these periodicals. They include first of all the small temperance, philanthropic, and religious magazines, which are very light in weight, and come out perhaps once a month. Then, we get papers like the trade journals, in which the interests of iron workers and other special trades are dealt with, nearly full of advertisements, and of pretty considerable weight ; and then we get again the magazine which has been frequently referred to in this discussion, the <inline font-style="italic">Review of Reviews,</inline> reaching full}' ten ounces in weight. This is a very heavy magazine, and hitherto, as it has come within the 30 days in the matter of publication, it has been passing as a newspaper. We say that in making these distinctions we first of all want to have a rate for newspapers in the ordinary sense of the word, and then we want to be able, in dealing with periodicals, to discriminate by weight between the small papers, published fortnightly or monthly, and heavy papers, such as the literary magazine I have referred to. For certain very obvious reasons it is quite impossible for me to discuss rates at this juncture. Of course we are providing under the Bill for rates to be framed by the Governor-General by regulation, and with the consent of both Houses of Parliament. I think it is reasonable that we should have an opportunity in fixing rates for this particular class of postal matter, to discriminate between papers coming out at intervals of a week and papers coming out at longer intervals, from beyond a week to a year.

                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">It is perhaps the only country from which he can get such an illustration. If we take the United States, and I believe Canada, or if we take the rule which has been in force in every State in Australia, we shall find that the definition of a newspaper is a publication coming out at intervals not greater than one month or a little longer than that. In the United States the definition of a newspaper is a publication that comes out at least four times a year. Is it not a far better analogy for us to take the United States and Canada, which embrace enormous territories, and correspond therefore very much more nearly to Australia than a little place, as regards area, like Great Britain ? It matters little to publishers in Great Britain whether the rates are higher or not, because the farthest distance to which they have to send their publications is only a few hundred miles. In Australia or the United States, the distances are very great. Of course we do not ' know what rate the Postmaster-General proposes to put on those publications which come out once a month or once a fortnight, but we can infer that it will be greater because that is his object in making this division. I am told that if the}' are taken out of the classification of newspapers the rates to Queensland may be increased by nearly three times. That is a wrong principle' to go upon. We should not reverse what has been the custom throughout Australia, unless there are very good reasons for it. We ought to endeavour to give some encouragement to what I might call the higher Australian literature - to such newspapers as <inline font-style="italic">United Australia,</inline> which T believe is about to come out once a month, and, therefore, . will come under this definition, the <inline font-style="italic">Review of Reviews,</inline> and many social and moral periodicals that generally come out once a month. </para>

                        <para>- I understand that the object of the Minister is to differentiate between those publications and newspapers. I contend that to merely judge a newspaper by the intervals at which it comes out is altogether illogical, because if the <inline font-style="italic">Review of Reviews,</inline> or other papers with exactly the same reading matter were to come out once a week, they would be deemed newspapers. The only logical way of dealing with newspapers is to class them in the same way as letters, that is by weight. But the Postmaster-General -would allow the <inline font-style="italic">Australasian,</inline> which weighs, I suppose, as much as the <inline font-style="italic">Review of Reviews,</inline> to go as a newspaper, not because it contains news of the day, but because it happens to come out once a week. The only reason which can actuate the Minister in introducing a separate class is that it will enable him to charge higher rates. We are only dealing with Australian literature, and I contend that monthly literature is generally of -a higher character than daily or weekly literature. We want to encourage such publications as <inline font-style="italic">United Australia</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Review of Reviews,</inline> and unless my amendment is carried we shall put them at a distinct disadvantage.. There are many journals dealing with social topics, such as temperance, which come out once a month simply because they have only just started, and their proprietors have not sufficient capital to publish them more frequently. Therefore, without my amendment, we shall place at a distinct disadvantage those publications which are not issued once a week. I sincerely hope that honorable senators, if they will not give any encouragement, at any rate will not endeavour to place obstacles in the way of the publication of what I might call the higher literature of Australia. </para>

The powerful dailies are well able to take care of themselves from the financial point of view. I trust that the committee, if it is going to make any exception, will make it iri favour of those financially weak journals which come out monthly. </para>

                        <para>- If that is the case I shall refrain from reading them. The Postmaster-General has not told us whether he proposes to make the postage only a little more for the monthly than for the weekly publications, Of course, if the rate is to be only a little more, it will weaken one's objection. If one takes the weight of a daily newspaper for a period of 30 days, it will be found that it gives the postal authorities a great deal more trouble, and involves more expense for delivery, than a monthly magazine* My sympathies are very largely with those persons who live in outlying districts. To them monthly magazines like, for instance, the <inline font-style="italic">Pastoralists' Review,</inline> or religious journals, are of very much more importance than daily newspapers. I have been asked to support this amendment by several persons. </para>

                    <para>- I have been somewhat puzzled to understand the motive for the Postmaster-General's advocacy of this clause. I fail to see why he should desire to distinguish between the publications in question. It is strange to me that a paper published for an educational purpose - to give a certain class of people who are interested in a particular subject, whether it be religion, philanthropy, or politics, certain information once a month - should be penalized, simply because the proprietors cannot afford to publish oftener. These papers are usually worked at a loss ; and «hy should the Postmaster-General seek to impose heavier burdens upon them than upon the successful daily and weekly papers <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> If it is a question of making publications pay for services rendered, let that policy be pursued towards all papers ; but why attempt to deal differently with various classes' of publications <inline font-style="italic">t</inline> The Postmaster-General has given the Senate no reason for so doing. The great dailies and weeklies are issued practically from the same office. They are usually powerful and wealthy papers, commanding a great deal of political influence. I am sure the Postmaster-General would not adopt the course he is pursuing because of the great influence such papers might exert on the Government or upon Parliament. The honorable senator would not be influenced by any such sordid motives. Therefore, I am puzzled to understand why he pushes his proposal as he is attempting to do. Many monthly publications are, I am sure, quite as educational as our daily newspapers, and then- carriage does not entail greater loss upon the Government than the leading journals. Why then should heavier rates be charged upon them <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> These papers are looked forward to by people in the country as advocating their special ideas. Though the readers of them may not be numerous, their purpose is educational. A daily newspaper may appeal to a larger constituency, but I fail to see why it should be treated differently to papers which devote themselves to special work. It has been pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> that many journals, like the <inline font-style="italic">Review of Reviews,</inline> as well as various commercial papers, are of great value to the community, although some of them may only appeal to a certain section, whether it be mercantile or industrial. The people interested in them derive great benefit from them ; and the news which is of such value to the various branches of industry and commerce ought to be carried as cheaply as if it were published in weekly or daily journals. </para>

                        <para>- I hope this discussion will not be prolonged. I would sooner have the matter decided quickly, one way or the other ; because probably we shall be able to deal with it by regulation. The way I have looked upon the subject is this : Newspapers in some of the' States are being carried for nothing, and in other States at very low rates. I know that very strong pressure will be brought to bear upon the Postmaster-General, and also upon members of the Senate, for the purpose of getting the rates cut down as low as possible. </para>

                        <para>- Consistent with what ? <inline font-weight="bold">.Senator DRAKE.</inline> - Consistent with anything or nothing. There will be pressure to have the rates cut down very low. The proprietors of newspapers are already saying that they are prepared to pay something for the carriage of their journals, but they point to the number of periodicals that have come in under the newspaper rates, but which are not newspapers in the strict sense of the term. When the question of fixing a low rate for newspapers is brought under consideration, it will be a very important element if under the heading of newspapers we have to carry all sorts of periodicals. That is the point I wish to have borne in mind. Supposing we enlarge the definition to enable all periodicals to come in as newspapers, the next point will be to fix a rate. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot give any figures upon the subject. Three -of the States are carrying newspapers free and three at a very low rate. I believe that when the half -penny postage rate for papers was introduced in Queensland, it made a difference of about £12,000 a year to the revenue. I do not want to do any injustice to any class of postal matter, but I think newspapers and periodicals should pal some fair rate, and I desire to have it equalized, so that there shall be no undue pressure upon any class of periodical. </para>

                        <para>- We are bound to have a loss, seeing that in three of the States papers have been carried for nothing and in three others at a very low rate. I do not anticipate such a charge as will enable us to make a profit upon the carriage of newspapers ; but the question is, how much we are going t. lose on that class of postal matter <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> I desire that the loss shall be minimized. If this amendment is carried, it means that I shall not proceed with the other clause upon the subject. It will mean that the department will have to carry anything and everything that can come under the definition of a newspaper at a rate - whatever it may be - which may be fixed. When we come to discuss the question of newspaper rates, we shall be told that they ought to be. made very low, and that we ought not to carry a whole lot of periodicals that are not properly newspapers. No Postmaster-General can discriminate. It has been tried in the States in the past I have no doubt, and every Postmaster-General who has tried it has absolutely failed. As long as a paper with a certain amount of printed matter in it - a few articles or clippings on local subjects - is published, it has to be registered as a newspaper. It is not because the Postmaster-General has not the courage, but because he does not want to do any injustice, that he never refuses to register. Therefore everything that bears the appearance of a newspaper is registered. If we are to carry every tiling, whether published daily weekly, or monthly, at newspaper rates, the rate must be fixed high. That will have to be borne in mind when we afterwards come to discuss the rates to be charged. All my desire is that this particular class of postal matter shall bear some fair charge that will approximate to the cost of the work that is carried on. If we do that I can see m}' way in the near future to reduce the rates upon letter matter. But if we are to yield to the pressure that is continually exercised in the direction of inducing the Government and Parliament to consent to postal matter being carried at very low rates or altogether free, then it is absolutely hopeless to expect to reduce the rate on letters. </para>

                        <para>- They have been carried free in three of the States, and in New South Wales, the most shocking example of all, the State has paid for special trains for carrying free newspapers to their destination. I hope the committee will bear that in mind. I know that pressure will be put upon them by persons who are interested in these matters. My only desire is to have such rates fixed as will be fair to everybody and enable us to reduce the postal charges. </para>

                    <para>- I should have been much better pleased if before resuming his seat the Postmaster-General had been a little more logical in his proposition. He desires an equitable price for carrying printed matter. That is his allegation. But he piloses to achieve that object, not by charging according to weight, but according to the number of times that a publication is printed. Could anything be more illogical? With all respect to the honorable and learned gentleman, I think there must be something behind the scenes which is inducing him to maintain an attitude that is positively illogical. Apparently if a document weighs 10 ounces, and is published once a week, it may go as a newspaper, but if it is published once a month and therefore only puts the Commonwealth to one-fourth the expense, it must bear a higher rate. Is that equitable? The honorable and learned gentleman has referred to the <inline font-style="italic">Review of Reviews.</inline> That is a publication issued once a month, and the Postmaster-General very reasonably takes exception to it being carried at just the same rate as a single sheet. He does not propose, however, to meet the difficulty He simply says that if a paper is published once a week, it can go as a newspaper, but if it is published once a month, it must pay something extra. The Commonwealth is to be penalized to the extent I have indicated. I venture to submit that a small, light publication, which costs very little to cany, should at least have as good a show at th hands .of the Commonwealth distributing department as a very heavy publication receives. </para>

I do not know that it has been mentioned, but I may say that one of the great troubles has been - at least so far as New South Wales is concerned - that business firms, by the addition of some slight items of information, have succeeded in having their business circulars and advertisements, and extensive quotations, sent broadcast through the post as newspapers. That is the great trouble which the postal authorities have to meet, and it is because of this that they have to take up a position which seems hard and ungracious to proprietors of. small publications, which are issued with no mercenary object, but purely for the purpose of doing good. </para>

                        <para>- That is my idea, but I am not justified in discussing- rates here. What I have pointed out - and perhaps <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lt. -Col. Neild</inline> will give me his attention for a moment - is, that newspapers, as they are generally understood, arc papers which are published daily, and also papers published weekly, that are practically a recapitulation of the news which appears in the dailies. That is the general understanding of what a newspaper is, and I want such papers to be carried at the one rate. When Ave get beyond the seven days' rate, and come to newspapers published at intervals of more than seven days and less than one month, we find that they are of a varied character. They comprehend small monthlies issued in the interests of religion, temperance, and philanthropy. </para>

They include also a vast number of trade circulars and prices current, containing a few illustrations - such as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> ha3 referred to - and items of news clipped from newspapers, and in this way they come in as newspapers. If the Senate agrees to this suggestion of allowing the clause to go as it is and assenting to the clause I propose with regard to periodicals. I intend to discriminate in the matter of weight with regard, to periodicals, so that a publication of lightweight, such as 6oz., 7oz., or 8oz., may be carried at one rate, similar or approximating to the newspaper rate, and other periodicals which are heavier shall be carried at a rate higher than the minimum charge.

                        <para>- - Because they are a recapitulation of the news which comes out daily. They are newspapers which were intended to be helped by the very low . rates. That may not have been good policy, but it was the intention, although there may not be anything behind it. When we come to hear the claims of the newspaper proprietors to have their newspapers carried free, or at something approximating free carriage, we shall find that they ask for the transmission of their papers at a very low rate on the ground that they serve very important purposes ; that they have an educational influence and assist in the administration of the Government. A number of arguments of that kind are used which do not apply to the other classes of periodicals that I have referred to - publications which are issued at intervals longer than one week. I wish to place these in classes. Let the newspapers which have hitherto been well treated be in one class, and let us do justice to them. Then let us have these periodicals which are of such a diverse character, placed in another class so that we may be able to discriminate as to weight, having a certain charge for those which are of small size and something higher for those which are heavier. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable senator was in a large retail business he would probably issue a price list, and. that list would be news to a vast number of people ; of much greater consequence perhaps than that which is contained in the daily papers. The Postmaster-General says that it is claimed on behalf of newspapers that they are educational and necessary. I admit that we would not like to do without our newspapers. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister will not commit himself. I know that the honorable and learned senator has said that he wants to charge for newspapers, but he does not say that the Government are in favour of that. I want a Ministerial statement on the subject, because we know the pressure that will be brought to bear on the Government by all the big dailies. I believe that all the big dailies are in favour of free carriage of newspapers, whether in Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth, or Hobart. They will all be in favour of free carriage of newspapers, and I want a statement from the Postmaster-General as representing the Government, and not from himself alone. I take the statement he has made to mean that the Government are going to carry newspapers free. </para>

I hear of the tax that is going to be put on sugar. We will have newspapers carried free while the sugar of the working men is taxed. I request a Ministerial statement from the Postmaster-General on this subject before we go any further. I do not want the honorable senator to say what the rate will be, but simply to say if the Government are going to charge for the carriage of newspapers or not. When we have that information we will be in a position to discuss these other questions more intelligently than we are able to do at the present moment. </para>

                        <para>- I am and have been in favour1, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator -Stewart</inline> knows, of a postal rate upon newspapers, and in 1S91 I refused to join with others in fighting for the free carriage of newspapers. What I am doing at the present moment is this, and I think members of the Senate ought to see it : I am trying to reduce the amount of pressure that will be brought to bear in favour of the free carriage of newspapers, because the wider we make this now by extending the definition from seven days to a month, the greater pressure there will be to get us to cany all these periodicals free. Honorable senators refer to the loss of revenue, but I do not think that will weigh against the weight of the pressure that will be brought to bear. If the clause goes through as it is now we shall only have to stand the pressure of the newspapers pure and simple, while if 'it is carried in the amended form, we shall have to stand the pressure not only of the newspaper proprietors, but of every one interested in' every one of the little papers that are published monthly. That is a matter to be considered. I do not want to delay the decision longer than the committee desires. I am quite willing to take a division. If the committee desires this amendment to be made it will be made I suppose, but the responsibility will not rest upon me. </para>

The discussion we have had so far clearly proves that it is necessary to make a distinction between what are understood as newspapers by 99 people out of every 100, and what are understood as periodicals. It is right that newspapers should be carried at a low rate, but, like the Postmaster-General, I am clearly of opinion that a charge should be made for all newspapers.

                <para>Ave limit the pressure only to a few publications such as the daily newspapers, and their attendant weeklies, that pressure being the strongest that can be brought to bear, it is likely that influence will be used to have all these publications carried free, and as has been clearly pointed out the general taxpayer will, have to make up the loss. As to discriminating between newspapers and periodicals I do not know how far we ought to go, but I am in favour of the amendment proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> that the seven days should be extended to one calendar month. My reason for that is that there are a number of - small publications that really would never become a burden upon the Postal department, and yet are of very great importance to sections of the community, so small in themselves, though in- the aggregate they may be numerous, that they scarcely have a voice or any great individual influence, and we, collectively, ought to endeavour to protect their interests. The Postmaster-General has told us that these publications that are issued between the seven days and a month should have a certain, discrimination exercised in connexion with them, and those which are not so heavy will probably be carried at the same rate as ordinary newspapers. To come back to the seven days' definition, we will find that there are some publications issued daily, bi-weekly, or weekly which vary so much in weight that it would be almost necessary that some discrimination should be exercised in connexion with them also. Bags of waste paper would be sent from the offices .of these daily and weekly journals and distributed all over the country, which thousands' of people would never look at, while some important issues of papers coming out only once or twice a month would have to pay such a rate as would almost make it impossible for those concerned in their publication to circulate them at all. I do not see why the newspapers should make such a fuss about low rates, because the proprietors never pay them. I have never come across any newspaper proprietor who sends out his paper post free to the subscriber. If there is a postal charge the subscribers have to pay it. You can go into any of the States to-day where there is a postal charge on newspapers,  and I find the proprietors get nearly the lot, because, whether in the country or in the city, if you buy a separate newspaper you have to pay exactly the same price. I should like to see news matter circulated as cheaply and expeditiously as possible, but I do not wish to discriminate between papers issued once a day, and once a month. I am, therefore, going to support the amendment for extending the seven days to one calendar month. </para>

                    <para>- In the course of this discussion, some of our minds have undergone a degree of change. At first I felt very strongly in favour of the view the Postmaster-General put before the committee. It seemed to be an absurdity, to talk of a newspaper in the ordinary popular acceptation of the term, as a publication issued long after the news must have got stale, and to describe as a newspaper, a publication issued weekly, or within a less period than a month, but looking at the clause I am rather disposed 'to think that my honorable friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> is right. This clause is merely an arbitrary definition for the purposes of legislation. Inserting a month will not alter its arbitrary character. We might put in six months in the same way. It does not define what a newspaper is at all. In fact it is doing violence to our ordinary understanding of what a newspaper is. I was under the impression that the clause contained a definition and that it had something to do with rates; but upon examination I find that it has nothing whatever to do with rates. </para>

                        <para>- No : because what is there to prevent the regulations which deal with the subject of rates from differentiating as to newspapers published daily and weekly, and those other publications called newspapers and published once a month. There may be a differentiation as to time and as to weight. Nothing that I can see in the clause affects the rates, and we have been discussing something which does not help us in the practical interpretation of the clause at all. It merely gives an arbitrary definition of what a newspaper is, and leaves it entirely to the Postmaster-General by regulations, to impose what rates he thinks fair, subject to the approval of Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- The Postmaster-General very forcibly says that the real reason why the monthly publications are not included as newspapers is to prevent the pressure that may arise in regard to the leading newspapers being more potent by reason of a number of other publications being included in the definition newspaper. I confess that this argument has rather influenced me the other way. 'I am rather inclined to take the view that if we put these trade circulars, and all these magazines like the <inline font-style="italic">Review of Reviews</inline> and other periodical publications, in the same category, we will immediately introduce a body* of influence against the carrying of ordinary newspapers free that will be exceedingly potent to maintain the revenue. That is what has struck me, and that is an argument which induces me at the eleventh hour rather to change my opinion on the subject. So far as the clause is concerned, it does not matter two pins whether we make it seven days, two months, or six months, because it does not affect the rates. There are some newspapers which, to my mind, ought not to be carried at the same low rate as the daily newspapers. Their very bulk ought to preclude that. The post-office is merely an ordinary carrier carrying postal matter, and it seems to me that the <inline font-style="italic">Herald,</inline> published in Melbourne, or any daily newspaper, ought not to be put on the same footing as some bulky weekly newspapers, which impose a heavier burden upon the Postal department. My view is that what we are really discussing is perfectly immaterial, as if the  seven days were extended to a fortnight or a month, it would still be left to the regulations to say what the rates shall be. We are to have faith that the Post-office department will impose such rates as will be just to the community and to the revenue. If all are put in the same category, the Postmaster-General will rather be assisted than hampered in fixing the rates. </para>

                        <para>- I would point out one other consideration after the remarks that have fallen from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Josiah</inline> Symon, because I think he has not satisfactorily solved the difficulty. If the proposed amendment is carried, of course the new clause I propose will not be inserted, and then all periodicals published at any interval up to a month will have to be carried as newspapers. There is a definition of what a newspaper is, although it is somewhat loosely worded, and up to the present time all sorts of publications have been allowed to go as newspapers, but the time may come when there will be a Postmaster-General, who will set himself to discriminate more closely than has been done in the past as to what is really a newspaper. And then, supposing this amendment is carried, and the other clause goes out, and we have the 30 days definition, so long as a publication is issued within the 30 days it will go as a newspaper at the newspaper rate, whatever that may be. But if the Postmaster-General decides that it is not a newspaper within the definition, it will be carried only at printed matter rates. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that I can discriminate, but I do not know that that would give satisfaction, after having fixed this class, and put in the definition of a newspaper as any periodical fulfilling certain requirements, and published within a month. I do not want to express a very positive opinion on this point, '.but I know that it will give a great deal of dissatisfaction if I attempt, in the face of that, to make a distinction between a paper published weekly and one published monthly. What I wish to impress on the committee is that, as I propose it now, a publication which is issued within a limit of seven days is a newspaper, and goes at newspaper rates. Supposing that the amendment is carried, and everything that fulfils the definition and that is published at any time within a period of one month becomes a newspaper, a much larger number of publications will be brought in as newspapers, and if the Minister wants to exercise his discretion then as to what is or is not a newspaper, if he decides that a particular newspaper is not a newspaper, it does not then become a periodical to be carried at the same rate, or perhaps a little more, but it becomes printed matter, and is carried at a very much higher rate. Those who are thinking more particularly about some of these monthly periodicals, which I, for one, do not desire to stop or hamper in any way, have to bear in mind that if they do not strictly come under th definition of a newspaper they will be thrown out, and will be liable to be carried as printed matter. The magazine which has been quoted more than any other publication in this debate is exactly a case in point. If the Postmaster-General at any time should decide that it was not a newspaper, then it would have to pay printed-matter rates. During the early period of the debate it was said that if this definition were altered that magazine would then have to pay three times the rate it had been accustomed to pay. That argument means that if the time limit were altered so as to put that magazine within the category of newspapers it would have to be carried as printed matter. I meet that by my clause, by saying that if we cannot carry it as a newspaper we shall carry it as a periodical at an intermediate rate. I think that is a very fair thing. </para>

If the Minister decides that any magazine or monthly is not a newspaper strictly within this definition, then he can refuse to carry it as a newspaper, and if the periodical class is not there it will have to go as printed matter at about three times the rate it has paid. </para>

                        <para>- That is exactly what I do not want. This newspaper is brought out almost exclusively in the interests of our railway men in the great State of Queensland. From every part of the world news is gathered relating to railway questions, such as the condition of labour, accidents, and train wrecks. How would it be possible to gather all that information in a week, and circulate it over our vast territory? It cannot be done. When we have 6,000 persons who depend largely on this monthly journal for literature of this nature, is it fair that it should be put out of the category of newspapers and described as a periodical? </para>

Supposing that <inline font-style="italic">Reynolds' Newspaper</inline> which has been published for the last eighty or one hundred years were proposed to be brought within the category of a periodical, what would be the effect? The owners would very properly oppose the proposal with all their might and main. Again, if a Minister were to bring in a Bill to destroy the name of a firm which had been trading for many years in Sydney or Melbourne, strong opposition would be offered. As a representative of Queensland I decline to allow the prestige and influence of a newspaper such as the <inline font-style="italic">Railway Times</inline> and others which might be named, to be cast on one side by being called periodicals. It is an unfair proposal. It will act most injuriously on a number of newspapers which have been struggling to maintain a position for many years. </para>

                <para class="block">Acts which have recognised one by one that a newspaper so far, as the time limit is concerned is a publication issued at intervals of not more than a month. And now it is proposed to legislate in an entirely different direction. So far as all the other qualifications of a newspaper are concerned, we leave them practically as they were before, but so far as regards the interval of publication, we wish to limit it absolutely to seven days. I do not agree with the arguments which were adduced on a previous occasion, when some honorable senators addressed themselves to the question of what is or is not a newspaper in the technical or the literal sense of the word. We are here to - legislate in the Postal Bill from the point of view of the administration of the machinery which s intrusted to us, and we have to define a newspaper. We have not to confine ourselves strictly to what a newspaper may be, judging it from either a technical or a purely literal stand-point. We have to say what shall be a newspaper from the purely postal stand-point. And seeing that the practice in the past has been to pass through the post periodicals that appeared at intervals of not less than a month and contained what might be current news for those whom they purposed to serve, I do not think there is any wisdom in this proposal to limit the time for those particular periodicals which come under the definition of newspapers to a period of seven days. We must have regard to the fact that we are legislating for a country which is entirely different from the old country from whose legislation this clause I believe has been drawn. We must recognise the fact that we are legislating for a country whose territory is very vast and whose population is very small, and if we wish to improve this country and to assist those sections of the people who are engaged in any trade, science, or calling, we must encourage them as far as we possibly can. And having regard to these facts, we cannot follow precisely on the same lines as are laid down to us in a country like Great Britain, where the territory is small and the population very dense. But we must endeavour to introduce as much progress as is possible in every art; every science, and every branch of industry in whose interests a newspaper may be issued. If a periodical is issued, even though it be quarterly, in which attention </para>

He must have convinced honorable senators that, so far as concerns those by whom they must be read, in order that they may keep in touch with what is going on throughout the world in their own calling, those periodicals are just as much newspapers as the journals which appear from day to day, and which honorable senators read for their politics. With the hopes we have of developing this large territory and its small population, it is our duty to give every encouragement to every walk and vocation in life, and if a trade newspaper is brought out we must recognise the fact that the paucity of our population necessitates its infrequent issue. We cannot expect that it shall appear from week to week or from day to day. I earnestly hope' that every honorable senator who has at heart the development of the industries of the Commonwealth will see that any newspaper, no matter how infrequently it appears, that is brought out for the sole purpose of advocating or instructing those engaged in any industry shall receive the same facilities for transmission through the post as a newspaper containing the ordinary news of the day and political articles. I have very much pleasure in supporting the amendment. </para>

                <para class="block">I understand that the corporation of Launceston have,after a great deal of trouble, succeeded in supplying the city with a very efficient system of electric lighting. The wires for that purpose in many instances run parallel with and close to the wires used for telegraph purposes. The corporation is therefore very much concerned with regard to some of the clauses in this Bill. I believe they have already taken counsel's opinion, and they are assured that by some of the provisions of this Bill they are likely to be seriously injured if not altogether prejudiced, in what to them seems to be the very good work they have already done within their province in supplying light to the citizens of the city of Launceston. I hope the Postmaster-General will be able to see his way clear to allow this clause to be recommitted, and permit a very short postponement in order that further consideration may be given to such a class of cases as is illustrated by that of the city of Launceston. </para>

                        <para>- This amendment means that none of us can put up a wire on his own property, or even in his own private house or warehouse, without first going to the Postmaster-General to ask his permission. Is this not carrying red-tape and departmentalism to an absurd extent ? What is the advantage of it so far as the Postmaster-General is concerned <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Surely we are capable of looking after our own interests, and of putting up wires in our own warehouses. I join issue at once with this proposed amendment. It is not what I want, or what is wanted by those whom I am representing in the matter. I may say I have received a large number of communications on this point from Queensland and New South Wales, as well as from various parts of Victoria, all protesting against this interference on the part of the Postmaster-General with private lines. My proposition is to insert, after the word "lines," line 3, the words "other than private lines." And then, in clause 3, I propose that we shall define what are private lines. Those amendments, if carried, will take private lines clean out of the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that even for a layman it is a very difficult thing to distinguish it. I should say, to begin with, that it is a line wholly upon private property, used for private purposes, and having no connexion whatever with public telephone or telegraph lines. Take my own case, in my warehouse I have lines leading to fifteen different places in' the warehouse, not connected in any way with the Government system of lines, and why should the Postmaster-General bother himself about those ? </para>

                        <para>- That is certainly another matter, but if we are agreed that lines such as I have mentioned, lines upon private property, say, for private purposes only, are not to be interfered with, that is one difficulty cleared out of the way. Now, another difficulty is that with respect to lines to be put on stations, for instance, that may be intersected by a number of roads, man)' of them practically unused, some of them used to a small extent, and some probably main roads. What is wanted in that case is to utilize existing lines and to get permission to cross the roads. In connexion with the crossing of the roads I recognise that permission should be obtained from some one to cross a road, and probably a small fee should be paid in recognition of that permission. </para>

                        <para>- No. I can assure the honorable and learned senator that we have had quite enough of regulations. I mentioned the other day a case in Victoria where, though the heads of the department acknowledged that the regulation was absurd, they would not take the trouble to alter it. I wish to see a matter of this sort dealt with distinctly in the Bill itself, and that may be done by putting in the very words of the New South Wales regulation that I have just read. There would then be no question as to what private individuals are entitled to do. It does not impose upon the Postmaster-General any trouble whatever, and I know the present Postmaster-General wants to be saved all the trouble he can. I am voicing the wishes of a large number of persons who are interested in this matter all over the States. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot agree to this amendment, because I think it would produce a condition of anarchy. I am not a despot, although I have been called a despot and socialist, and all sorts of things, but I recognise that in the matter of telegraphy it is necessary that there shall be some authority, and we claim that the authority should rest with the Postal department, as we have no body analogous to the Board of Trade in Great Britain. As I propose to amend the clause, the -matter will be left perfectly clear with regard to these private lines. We do not want to interfere with a private line upon a man's property, so long as the line is wholly on his property, but if it crosses a road, we desire to make a charge which shall be simply an acknowledgment of the rights of the Postal department. I think that to fix the charge irrespective of the distance of the line would be unfair, because the length of the line, and number of roads that it crosses, are elements that should be taken into consideration. </para>

                        <para>- It does not cost us anything, but if the honorable senator wants a line 100 miles in length, and crossing a number of road5, he ought to pay more than he would for a line that only crossed one road. I think the line mileage and the number of "roads crossed ought to be taken into consideration. In New South Wales they have a regulation which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Frederick</inline> Sargood says is entirely satisfactory. Perhaps it is because they only charge <inline font-style="italic">£1,</inline> whatever the length of line may be. In Victoria the charge is somewhat higher.

                    <para>- I think the first part of the Minister's proposal will meet my objection. It will leave apparently to private persons the right to construct, maintain, and use telephones and telegraphs upon their own land, and the term " land," I understand, covers warehouses and so on. If that is so it is right, but why should we be limited to 12 feet from our border ? Surely we have a right to use our own property up to the border. I do not know what authority the Minister has to deprive me of my right to use 12 feet of my land if he wants to put up a telegraph line. </para>

                    <para>. - suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Frederick</inline> Sargood that there is very little difference between us, and I shall point out to him a course which I think will save all difficulty. I understand from the Postmaster-General that if a private line is erected too near ii public line it may affect the working by induction of the public line. It is quite clear, therefore, that in order to maintain the efficiency of the public line, the Minister must have the right to control the erection of electric lines alongside in such a way as not to interfere with it. I understand from my honorable colleague that 12 feet is the necessary distance to make a public line perfectly safe. I do not know that he is quite certain on that point. I would suggest that the amendment should be carried as it is, and my honorable friend will inquire from his experts to-morrow as to whether 6 feet is sufficient. If it is sufficient to work, I quite agree that the more free and unrestrained use an owner has of his property the better. I am quite certain that my honorable colleague has no desire to interfere with the use of private property any more than is necessary. He will make a statement to the committee after the inquiry is made, and, if necessary, recommit the clause to make the distance 6 feet. </para>

                    <para>- This amendment, I understand, contemplates an entirely private line on a man's private property quite unconnected with the Commonwealth property. The fatal objection to the amendment is that it practically enacts that a man may not do what he likes with his own. To put it in as a proviso in that way seems a very cumbrous and unnecessary way of doing it. Perhaps the Minister will find this plan simpler. After the words " the Postmaster-General shall accept," put in the words "except as to telegraph lines on private property," and then insert a proviso that such telegraph line shall not be within 6 or 3 feet of a public line, but do not put in a proviso which practically enacts that a man may do what he absolutely has the right to do now. It seems to me monstrous that we should even by means of a proviso acknowledge that a man cannot put up a private line entirely on his own. property. Of course it is a serious thing that a private line should be permitted to be so near as to perhaps interfere with the effective working of the public line. That undoubtedly ought to be prevented ; but the sole object we ought to have in view is to exempt from the operation of clause 77 in its enacting part lines which are or may be constructed on private properties ; but if it is put in by way of a proviso, it is in effect an enactment that a man may erect a line which acknowledges that some day or other the Commonwealth may step in and say, " Oh, we are going to abolish that proviso : that was a concession." I do not recognise this as any concession by the Commonwealth. Every one of us has a right to have a telegraph line from his stable to his house, if he likes. At least that ought to be recognised, and we should not depend on legislation for having that right, but we ought to depend on legislation for what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> has pointed out - a provision that the working of that private line shall not in any way interfere with the efficient working of the public line. If we put in that the Postmaster-General shall, except as to a. telegraph line on private property, have the exclusive privilege of working and maintaining telegraph lines, the thing is done, and we do not acknowledge that the State is making any concession to a private owner. </para>

                    <para>- I entirely agree with the last speaker, and I must support his view if it comes to a division. At first, I was prepared to support the Minister's view, but I really do not see why a private owner, whether it be at a mine or in a warehouse, or other place, should be obliged to submit to a clause of this kind. We have the right now to erect these wires, and let it remain intact ! Surely no harm can be done ? The Minister should make some reasonable provision for a line to cross roads. </para>

                    <para>- I consider that the amendment suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Josiah</inline> Symon to be really only a choice of verbiage, because I take it that the point he made is that what we want to&gt; do is to exclude from the operation of the clause private lines. The Postmaster-General proposes to carry out the exclusion by means of a proviso ; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Josiah</inline> Symon proposes to carry out the exclusion, by means of an exception ; and the question is, what is the difference in the significance of exception and proviso <inline font-style="italic">t</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Josiah</inline> Symon says " if we do it by means of an exception we recognise an inherent right in. individuals to erect and use private lines.. If we do it by means of a proviso we recognise the right of the Postmaster-General to control private lines, but we make him grant a concession." I at once apprehend the meaning of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Josiah</inline> Symon ; but it seems to me a subtle and unnecessary distinction, because I know if I, as a lawyer,, were construing it drawn as he has said,, with the exclusion made by an exception and not by a proviso, I would still say that the Legislature excepted private lines from the operation of the section, and in an amending Act it may negative that exception just the same as it may when it is done by a proviso. The Legislature grafted this concession by means of a proviso on the power given to the Postmaster-General, and we may remove the exception by an amendment, so that really it is a distinction without a difference. 1 do not know if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Josiah</inline> Symon follows me, but I certainly am at a loss to see where the real practical benefit comes in altering the amendment, which was drawn by the Minister, in order to effect the same thing by an exception to the general provision, rather than by a proviso to the general power which is granted to the Minister. I shall not actively resist either amendment because they seem to me to have the same meaning, but I think, if the Minister persists in his phraseology, there is no sufficient gain in using the phraseology suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Josiah</inline> Symon to induce us to depart from it. </para>

I recognise that as a matter of sentiment there is something in what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Josiah</inline> Symon has said, and I should suggest that the amendment of the Postmaster-General, by the alteration of a very few words, will be made to carry out exactly the same purpose. Supposing it is altered to read in this way - </para>

                    SYMON (South Australia). - I think
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harney</inline>
                    has misapprehended the difference between the two amendments. There is no doubt that
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor's</inline>
                    alteration in the phraseology of that amendment does, if not altogether, at any rate to a large extent, remove the objection which seemed to me quite fatal to the amendment in its first shape.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harney</inline>
                    must observe that clause 77 as it now stands enacts that the Postmaster-General shall have something. Parliament gives him something, and the effect of the exception is simply to prevent the giving of that something taking away what we, as free-born individuals, already possess ; and I think it is very important that that should be excepted from the gift which Parliament gives to the Minister for the purpose of the Act. If the proviso, on the other hand, had stood as it was, the effect would have been exactly the opposite. It would have- had the effect of declaring in the enacting part of the clause that the Minister got everything; and then came the proviso which enacted that the citizens of the Commonwealth should have something, given by the generosity of Parliament, which they already possessed. That is a situation which I do not think we ought to be in, and I agree with
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor,</inline>
                    as we are approximating to it very nearly in the amendment as altered, we ought to accept it.

                    <para>- I cannot grasp the meaning of telegraphs, because, the word includes telephones. Take a case where telephonic communication extends entirely within a warehouse. Perhaps it is carried from one department to another up to the highest part of the building, and at that point it may not be more than 3 or 4 feet from the wires outside the building. What effect would the clause have on the working of such a telephone ? </para>

                    SARGOOD (Victoria). - Sub-clause (2) raises the matter with reference to the crossing of roads. We have dealt with lines wholly on private property. Now we have to deal with lines upon property intersected by public roads. I have circulated an amendment which I have drafted somewhat hurriedly, and which I have no doubt will be improved upon by the legal members. For the purpose of having the matter discussed, I intended moving -
                </para>
                <para>That the following proviso be added to the clause : - " Provided that where a private line has been or shall be constructed by a person who is the 2274 <inline font-style="italic">Post and</inline> [SENATE.,] <inline font-style="italic">Telegraph Bill.</inline> owner of the land upon both sides of a road, railway, tramway, or creek, then such person shall have the right of continuing or carrying such private line across any such road, railway, tramway, or creek at a height of at least 18 feet from the surface of such road, railway, tramway, or creek." 'The object of this amendment is to continue the use of a private line across a public road, railway, or creek. This is not an unreasonable thing, although it has occurred to me whether the Postmaster-General has the right to grant power to cross roads, or whether that does not belong to the State, or in the case of Victoria to the municipalities. </para>

The first is absolutely necessary and would come under section 52 of the Constitution Act, which places it within the power of the Commonwealth to construct a telegraph or telephone line. But the case 1 am dealing with is different altogether. All I want is to get permission to cross roads and streets upon payment of a small fee, to recognise the legal right of the department. </para>

                    Sargood's amendment is right enough so far as it goes, but it might shut out a number of equally good private lines. Supposing A is the owner of a block of land in a particular place, and B is the owner of a piece of land in another place, and that the two properties are intersected by a block of land which is not subject by statute to alienation. In that case this amendment would not apply. I suggest that if private lines do not interfere with public roads or with the Postmaster-General in any degree whatever, even if they cross a piece of land, including a road, they should not be penalized, subject to a small fee being paid for the right of crossing the road, and also subject to the control of the department.

It would be better for him to amend that provision in the direction of securing the approval of the Postmaster-General, because it might be necessary to carry the line underneath the ground. The provision should be made to read "or in such manner as may be approved by the Postmaster-General." Then if it was really necessary that the line should be carried under the ground, permission might be given. </para>

                    <para>- This is a matter which should receive serious consideration. For instance, with regard to reserves, it would be quite possible for a person owning land at Roeburne and at Eucla to run a telegraph line 1,000 miles between those places, because it would cross Crown lands. Then it is provided that public reserves may be bisected by wires owned by private persons. I think that should be excepted. It is also provided that wires may cross a road. Would that provision also apply to a street ? If so, suppose a person ' owned property on one side of Bourke-street or Collins-street, and more property on the opposite side, would there be anything to prevent him running a wire across that street ? Then the amendment says "at a height of at least 18 feet above a creek." Does that mean above flood level, summer level, or what? I support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor's</inline> proposal that no telegraph or telephone line should go across a road, street, or tramway or railway, unless the consent of the Postmaster-General has been previously obtained. Otherwise a great deal of difficulty may be caused, and I think the power might easily be abused in the country districts. </para>

                    (Victoria). - There is no clanger about the reserves, there is more danger that the power will be abused in cities than in townships. Men are not going to erect private lines . at great expense for nothing. If a reserve is a mile or two across that does not matter where the line is constructed at an owner's private expense and for his private use. I can understand, however, that this might be abused in townships and cities, and I am prePared to SuPport the Minister in preventing any abuses of the kind.

I think that what he suggested was that some proviso should be put in to say that the entry should only be when it was convenient. We could not provide that, because we might find that it would never be convenient. We might never be able to get at the proprietor, and he could always say that it was not convenient to allow his land to be entered upon. I believe that with any such amendment the clause would be entirely unworkable. </para>

                    <para>- The Sydney Chamber of Commerce has asked me to bring this matter forward, because the clause confers almost unrestricted power upon the Postmaster-General without any proper safeguard so far as private owners are concerned. I cannot pretend to draft the amendment they would like to put in, but I draw the attention of the Postmaster-General to the fact that the powers conferred by the clause are considered very arbitrary. </para>

                    <para>- In this clause the Postmaster-General proposes to take enormous power. The matter came before us in connexion with the Electric Lighting Bill which was before the State Parliament a couple of years ago. A similar clause was introduced into that Bill, but we struck it out. It .seems to me that it is an unnecessary invasion of private property. I do not see why the Postmaster-General should have the right to attach a wire to my private property simply for his own convenience. </para>

                    <para>- I am sure the honorable senator will see that it is absolutely necessary that we should have this power in order to carry out the telephone system. It is altogether a different thing where we are dealing with electric lighting, and with cables carrying an enormous current of electricity. It is quite right that where such wires have to be carried to a great height, it should be on Government posts. But if the telephone system is to be carried out, we must have some lofty position from which we can start our wires to buildings in different directions. We carry a great number of wires in a cable underground, and then when we come to some particular point we have to carry the cable up to a considerable height, and from that high position start the wires in various directions. Let honorable senators consider the buildings here in Melbourne, and ask themselves how we are to have telephone communication with a lot of those buildings if we are not to have the right to fix our wires to the sides of a house. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, and I know of many cases in which that has been done, and no harm whatever has arisen. You must take the wires into some of these buildings in order to supply the different people who may be living in them. Many of these large buildings have an enormous number of rooms and offices occupied by different persons, and unless we have the power to take the wires into such buildings we cannot put the tenants on to the exchange. </para>

I take it that the Postmaster-General will have the power under this clause to cut such trees down. My attention has been called to the fact, by the municipal authorities in a large number of cases up country, that this provision will necessitate the destruction of miles upon miles of avenues of trees that have been growing for the last 30 years. The other night I gave an instance of my own property, where I have an avenue of trees that have been growing for 30 years. If the Postmaster-General erects a telegraph or telephone line on the edge of the pathway there, I shall have to cut down the whole of those trees. </para>

                    <para>- I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Frederick</inline> Sargood is unnecessarily apprehensive, because, as I read the clause, the 20-ft. limit is rather for the benefit of such gentlemen as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Frederick</inline> Sargood. If that limit is not inserted, the clause will provide that the Postmaster-General shall be at liberty to cut or lop any trees likely to interfere with the proper working of the telegraph line. We might say that that is only natural, but there is a safeguard inserted for the benefit of gentlemen like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Frederick</inline> Sargood. It is provided that although they may have trees which are injurious to the working of the telegraph line they will be safe if they are not within 20 feet of it, so that considered properly, the limit, instead of being a restriction upon the rights of private owners, is a concession to private owners over and above the lights given to the public. </para>

                <para class="block">Sargood, because the object of the clause is really to provide that trees which obstruct a telegraph or telephone line shall be cut down. And if the trees are growing on private land, within 20 feet of any such line, the proprietor shall cut down or lop those trees as and when required so to do by the Postmaster-General. It does not follow as a matter of course that if they are growing within that limit he shall be bound to cut them down. It is only as and when he is required so to do <inline font-style="italic">by</inline> the Postmaster-General. It is obvious that the Postmaster-General would not ask the proprietor of private land to cut down the avenue of trees so graphically referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Frederick</inline> Sargood. The honorable senator would not be asked to cut down those ornaments to his estate, unless they were actually in the terms of this clause obstructing the use of the telegraph or telephone line. The clause goes on to provide - </para>

                <para class="block">Of course if the Postmaster-General exceeded his powers in any particular instance under this clause, the matter must come under public notice, and I think with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harney</inline> that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Frederick</inline> Sargood is unnecessarily apprehensive with regard to the powers which will be exercised by the Postmaster-General. The whole object of the clause is to provide that trees shall not be allowed to interfere with telegraphic or telephonic communication. If they grow upon private land to within 20 feet of the line itself, the private owner may be asked, if it is necessary to cut or lop them, in order that the obstruction may not occur, and if he does not cut or lop them, then the individual authorized by the Minister may enter upon such land and cut or lop tl|%n, as may be deemed necessary. If there is, as the Minister suggests, in many instances an avenue of trees which has been planted for many years, no doubt the authorities, in constructing telegraphic or telephonic communication that will pass by the side of the trees, will have due regard for that fact, and will put the wires at such a distance that the obstruction which may be anticipated under the clause will not be experienced. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Frederick</inline> Sargood will see that it is only a clause which gives permission to the </para>
                <para class="block">Minister to have his telephonic and telegraphic communication uninterrupted and undisturbed, and that it is not a clause which is framed for the express purpose of giving the Minister or any one under him authority to unnecessarily entrench on the private rights of any person. Under these circumstances, I think he will readily see that the clause should pass as printed. </para>

                    SARGOOD (Victoria). - I referred just now to the fact that a similar clause had been submitted in an Electric Lighting Bill, and was withdrawn. I find that I was misinformed. It was a Bill introduced by the Postmaster-General of Victoria two years ago, which contained the same clause as affecting telegraphs ; and the representations which were made to him by the Melbourne City Council were such as to induce him to withdraw the clause. It has been pointed out to me, within the last few minutes, that if this clause is passed it will necessitate, probably at the freak of some Minister or officer, the cutting down of a number of trees in the city of Melbourne.

                    <para>- There is one thing which may well be considered. Of course, a good deal of this difficulty has arisen from the fact that under the Bill we deal with telephone as well as telegraph lines, and what is very proper for a telegraph line is riot so proper, convenient, or fair in relation to a telephone line. On the hills at Mount Lofty there are many instances where the telephone lines pass through gardens. Under the Bill, telegraph lines mean telephone lines, and the probability would be that, if there was a likelihood of interference in the working of a line - it might be fairly arrived at on the part of any officer - we might find that the trees would have to be cut down, or the proprietor, if he did not wish to have his trees cut down, would have to discontinue the use of his telephone. I could mention several instances in my own neighbourhood on Mount Lofty where that position would actually occur. I can see how' the confusion has arisen. Of course, these clauses are taken from Acts dealing only with telegraph lines, which are not restricted to private property as a rule, and which do not cross private property or pass through gardens. The South Australian Act, from which this provision is taken, has to do with telegraph lines and not with telephone lines. I ask the Postmaster-General to consider seriously whether 20 feet is not the proper distance as regards telegraph lines. When it says 20 feet, what is meant ? Does it mean from the trunk of the tree or from the branches ? If it is from the trunk it is not a* bit too much. </para>

                        <para>- That is the difficulty which I think the Minister will find himself in. Supposing that an officer reported that the trees in a garden, interfered with the working of the telephone line, the occupier would have either to discontinue his line or to submit to his trees being cut clown. It seems to me the solution is to consider whether an amendment might not be introduced to say that certain of these provisions should not apply to telephone lines, or else apply certain limitations. </para>

                        <para>- I could mention scores of instances on Mount Lofty, and I dare say there are many others near Melbourne and other places where a telephone line passes through very tall trees, and we might have. an officer say they did interfere with the line. I am not making the suggestion with a view to qualifying it in any way as to telegraph lines, because that may seem perfectly proper, and the original provision was intended to apply to them only : but when we have to deal with telephones we are brought face to face with a different situation. These clauses have not been considered in relation to telephone lines, but have been adopted under a definition which says that telegraphs shall mean and include telephone lines, when in many respects they are totally inapplicable. I suggest that the better way will be for the Minister to reconsider the provision, and see whether something may not be done to..meet the case of telephone lines in the altered circumstances. </para>

                    <para>honorable and learned senator is really answering a good deal of his argument by pointing out that 20 feet is not unreasonable in the case of telegraphs. Both telegraphs and telephones are dealt with in the Bill, and unless we devise some means of separating the clauses dealing with one from those dealing with the other, it seems to me that this clause is just as it should be. I would remind my honorable and learned. friend that the Postmaster-General here is taking, no doubt, rather extreme "powers. AH through the Bill he will find instances of very extreme powers given to the Minister. But it always must be taken that as these powers are to be used in the interests of the public, the Postmaster-General will not do any wanton mischief or damage to private property any more than is absolutely necessary. </para>

                        <para>- Y - Yes ; it is only whether these trees or whatever growth it is, in the opinion of the Postmaster-General or other officer, that obstruct or is likely to interfere with the proper working of the telegraph line, I take it, that the department, in carrying out a clause of this sort, will very likely arrive at some general view founded upon the scientific interest of the position, in regard, to telegraph lines, a certain distance of clearing is necessary, and in regard to telephone lines, a much smaller distance is 060688017. All wo do here is to give authority to the officer to determine which in the particular circumstances ought to be left. I think the last speaker will see that after all this is only one out of a hundred very large powers given to the Minister. If these powers are to be exercised unreasonably, then undoubtedly a great portion of this Bill ought to be excised. If, on the other hand, wc are to trust the Postmaster-General to use these powers in the interests of the public, I think this is a power which might very well be left to him.
