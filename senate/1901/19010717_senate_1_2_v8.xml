                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Frederick</inline> Sargood has an amendment to move on this clause, but before proceeding with the business I wish to state that I have had all the amendments proposed to be made reprinted and circulated. They comprise the amendments which I hope to make on recommittal, and also the amendments of which notice has been given by that honorable senator. If any amendments have been omitted I shall be very glad if they are pointed out to me. </para>

                    <para>- The amendments, as they have been reprinted, make confusion worse confounded. This morning I received a copy of the amendments covering a volume of paper, and arranged very differently from what I have been used to. It would be a wiser and more convenient plan to print the amendments of each senator on a separate sheet. As it is, I have to hunt all over this paper to find my amendments. </para>

                        <para>- The amendment of which I gave notice was for the insertion of a sub-clause, providing that a telegram should be transmitted by the route prescribed by the sender, at the tariff for that route. This is in accordance with the agreement of the International Telegraph Convention at Berne. At present there is what is called Reuter's telegraph line, which would be more or less under the command of the post-office. There is also the route by way of the Cape and before very long there will be a route by the Pacific, and probably also a route north from the Cape or what is known as the Cape-Cairo line. The principle was laid down by the Berne Convention in regulation number 2 that the sender of a telegram should have the right of deciding by what route his message should be sent. The object of my amendment is to carry out that rule. I need hardly say that the immediate effect of it would be that those who preferred to send their messages by Reuter's line could do so. On the other hand, those who preferred to send their messages by the line of the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company could do so. Unless this concession be given in the Bill it will entirely destroy the position taken up by New South Wales and South Australia under which - rightly, I think - they have taken advantage of that company's line, and, as a matter of fact, a very large number of merchants invariably send by that line in preference to the others as being equally rapid and more economical.

                        <para>- I do not think this amendment will be of any benefit, and it might under certain circumstances be very mischievous. I do not see how it can effect any good purpose so long as there are different rates for cable messages, because if the sender pays the lower rate his message will be sent by that particular service, whereas if he pays the higher rate it will go by the service for which the higher rate is charged. I cannot see that there is any advantage in giving the sender the right to indicate the route if rates are dissimilar. </para>

                        <para>- Where it will become positively mischievous will be in cases where we have two or more cable services and the published rates are equal. The disadvantage will be that a provision of that kind will enable persons to make private arrangements with the cable company to have their messages sent at a discount, and that I think will operate very prejudicially against the cable that is owned by the State. Of course what the honorable senator is looking forward to is the completion of the Pacific cable. </para>

                        <para>- When it is completed it will be the first State owned cable from Australia, and no doubt it will be in competition with other cable services. An enterprise which is controlled by the State is necessarily conducted in the open day. The rates by that cable will be published. The rates by a cable which is controlled by a private company will not necessarily be made public, or if published there will be nothing to prevent its proprietors from allowing a considerable discount. If this sub-clause is put in it will enable a privately owned cable company to make arrangements with the users of the cable to send messages over their lines in preference to using the State line, by promising a certain discount. In that way the Pacific cable may be made unremunerative. If the cable rates are the same on each line, as they probably will be - because I cannot conceive for one moment that when we have two or three cable services, the Pacific cable, the Cape cable, and the Eastern Extension Company's cable - there will be any difference in the public rates, it will be all the same whether messages are sent one way or the other. What is the advantage of having this provision, that the sender may state the route by which he desires his message to be sent <inline font-style="italic">1</inline></para>

                    Sargood. The Postmaster-General states that the postal authorities should have the absolute' right of determining by which route messages intrusted to them should be forwarded, and he furnished some reasons why his department should be placed in that position. But surely the honorable and learned senator has not overlooked the fact that that will place in the hands of the Postmaster-General an absolute power to shut up a private cable.

Under the Bill as it stands, the Postmaster-General will be able to determine that, the rates being the same, all messages shall go by the State-owned cable.

                        <para>- The very disadvantage that the Postmaster-G ggeneral himself has been careful to point out, that the State owned cable might be choked with business, while the other lines were lying idle. In order to cany out this policy of State ownership of the cable we might have the post-office forcing all the business over one line to the disadvantage of the others; In this way the department would be able to say that private cables should not be allowed in Australia. We should leave it to private individuals to say to whom they will intrust their messages. If they were allowed to do so, what harm could result ? Why should not every person who wishes to send a cable message be able, to decide by which route it shall be transmitted <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> It seems to me that we should do one of two things, either determine to stop privately-owned cables altogether, or else leave every man who wishes to send a cable message free to select the route by which his message shall be transmitted. </para>

                        <para>- It should be remembered that a State-owned cable is not in the same position as a privately-owned cable for the reason that the State-owned enterprise is conducted in the light of day. It has to publish its rates and it cannot allow any discount. One man has to pay the same rate as another. But a privately owned cable can make secret agreements with certain - persons to take messages at reduced rates. If a proposal of this kind is allowed to go in the Bill it will mean that the private cable company will be able to make such arrangements with the public as will enable it to obtain all the cream of the business, and the State owned cable will have to carry such messages as come to it at its published rates. </para>

                    <para>- As far as the cable communication exists at the present time, or has existed in the past, it has been due to private enterprise. The argument of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> appears to me to be absolutely unanswerable. If the Postmaster-General means to make a declaration that all the cable business shall be owned by the Government and that no private company shall be allowed to have a share of it, we can discuss the matter on that basis. The Postmaster-General says that the general public must not be allowed to say by what route they shall send their messages. If the rates are unequal, that will adjust itself. No injustice is done, because the man who pays the lower rate will have his cablegram sent over a line to which that lower rate is applicable as a matter of course. But the difficulty, says the Postmaster-Genera], is when the rates are equal. I want to know why the Government has any possible right to a monopoly which is to kill' a private line ? The reason given on the face of it is an answer to the argument itself - because people who send telegrams might make arrangements with 'the private companies to send them at a lower rate than the Government would charge. So much the better for them if they do. </para>

                    Sargood in his amendment. If the arguments he has used are not sufficient and satisfactory;, any supplement to them that is necessary has been furnished by the Postmaster-General himself. It seems to me that the statement the Postmaster-General has made supplies an excellent' reason for supporting the amendment. It might occasionally occur to us that incidentally we are legislating for the convenience of the public. The Postmaster-General has practically suggested that we are legislating against the convenience of the public.

                    <para>- I should like to call the attention of honorable senators to what they have already done in connexion with the Bill under discussion. They have given the Federal Government a monopoly in reference to the carriage of letters. The arguments that have been so ably used by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir John</inline> Downer, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Frederick</inline> Sargood, and others, could have been as well used for contending that we should allow a private individual to start a post-office in Melbourne, and carry letters to the Northern Territory in opposition to the post-office. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable senator will restrain his impetuosity for a minute or two we may arrive at some conclusion. The Postmaster-General's objection to the amendment simply is that he wants to maintain the Government monopoly in connexion with cable communication as well as in regard to postal matters, and he wishes to leave it to the Government itself to make arrangements with the private companies. Here we have a private cable company with which the State Governments formerly, and now the Government of the Commonwealth enters into an arrangement to give a subsidy of from £50,000 to £200,000or £300,000 per annum. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senators who support this amendment have never saida word about that. Now in comes <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Frederick</inline> Sargood - and I am glad to find that his friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir William</inline> Zeal, takes a different view altogether - and points out clearly what private enterprise wants to do. He says that the private companies are going to give special rates to mercantile men, -and he asks why they should not be allowed to send messages at cheaper rates than the Government? Suppose that the Federal Government laid down a cable to Tasmania, or to the Cape of Good Hope, or any other part of the world, and there were private lines in existence which conducted their business for the purpose of damaging the interests of the Commonwealth line and destroying any revenue that it was clearly, entitled to on account of the expenditure it had incurred. Suppose then that these private companies went to the business firms and said - " We will take your messages at cheaper rates than the Government charge." Then as soon as ever the private firms had knocked out the Government line, up would go the rates again. The Eastern Extension Telegraph Company has been subsidized by the Governments of Australia, and now it is to be used to help to defeat an enterprise entered into by the people of the country. I hope that honorable senators who have the interests of the Commonwealth at heart, will agree with the Postmaster-General and reject the amendment. They surely will not for the sake of a temporary advantage, which might exist only for a couple of months, allow the public to be eternally fleeced. </para>

These agents take our ciphers and send our messages at small expense. We can send in one cipher message what would require 100 messages if sent in the ordinary way. If we transmitted our cable messages through these agents the Government would find that they could not charge so much for the one as they could for the hundred. Let us have as much and as cheap cable communication as possible with all parts of the world. I am strongly of opinion that we should act wisely in accepting the amendment. </para>

The State I have the honour to represent has the misfortune to suffer more than any of the other States in regard to its telegraphic communications. I think that before very long there will be a desire on the part of the Commonwealth that the Government itself, if it cannot acquire the cable between Tasmania and the mainland at a reasonable rate, shall construct a line. If this amendment were carried the hope of placing Tasmania on the same footing as the other States in regard to this matter would be a very remote one. </para>

                        <para>- It certainly presents itself to me in that light. It may be a selfish light in which to view the matter, but I think we are quite justified in looking at it in that way. I fail to see the great danger of the monopoly that has been referred to, seeing that it is going to be a Government monopoly - if it is to be a monopoly at all. In view of that fact, I do not think we should have such regard for the vested interests of the syndicate cable lines. We should rather have greater regard for the rights of the Commonwealth. </para>

It seems to me that if the Postmaster-General has his way his proposal will practically destroy the usefulness of that line. </para>

                        <para>- Decidedly. If there were two competing lines, and they were owned by different States, no doubt each State would like the message to go over its line. Surely, however, the Post-office should decide. In arriving at a decision, it would consider the public convenience, and it would send the message over the route that was least blocked. The question of allotment of revenue does not arise in connexion with this matter. In a great many cases we can send messages to one particular town over three different routes.We simply keep the three lines as busy as we can, and send the message by the route most convenient. If this amendment were intended to apply to land lines the absurdity of it would be seen at once. If a man wishes to send a telegram to Ballarat he does not prescribe the route by which it shall go. A message to that city can be sent through two routes, and the Postal department send the wire over the line that is least busily employed. </para>

                        <para>- The question as to private companies' rights in regard to telegrams is quite distinct from the Post office. My point is that we ought to allow a man who sends a telegraph message the same privilege as the man who sends a letter. If sx man indicates the particular route by which he wishes to have his letter sent, the practice in England and South Australia is to give effect to his wishes as expressed on the cover of his letter. What <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Frederick</inline> Sargood desires is that when a man wants to send a telegram to Europe by a particular route, and indicates that particular route, his wishes should be carried out. I think that is a very fair proposition. The question raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Charleston</inline> relative to the overland line from Adelaide to Port Darwin is a very serious one so far as South Australia is concerned. The proposal made by the Postmaster-General would enable him to send the whole of the messages by the Pacific cable as soon as that cable is constructed. FOr five years South Australia has to bear any loss upon its postal and telegraphic services. So far as the telegraph line across the continent is concerned, I may state that we have expended over £600,000 upon its construction. No doubt South Australia will be recouped for that outlay at the end "of five years. South Australia- has reduced the rates on the overland line to such an extent that she has spent upon it over £300,000 above the receipts. Of course, this was done particularly for the benefit of her own people, but to a very great extent for the benefit of the people of the whole of the continent, because the population of South Australia is small <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> comparison, and consequently its telegraph messages are considerably less numerous. We have done all this, and yet if the Postmaster-General has the right to send messages by the Pacific cable and to ignore the land line altogether the receipts from that line will practically fall to zero. Except for messages to eastern parts, such as to Hong Kong and Singapore, there will be no receipts from the line at all, so that the loss to South Australia will be very heavy indeed. Of course, at the end of the fifth year, when the whole thing is taken over by the Commonwealth, the loss, will be borne by the several States. On this, line, which we have constructed in conjunction with the Eastern Extension Company, for the benefit of the whole of the people of  the continent, we will suffer most serious loss if this power is placed in the hands of a Postmaster-General who may be hostile to us, and who may have special interests in the Pacific cable. Such a Postmaster-General would do everything that lay in his power to send oil messages by that line, and to ignore our own South Australian line, sa that the finances of that State would be in a rather serious position. Some honorable senators have asked why we should not. utterly ignore the Eastern Extension Company. It must be recollected, however, that the Eastern Extension Company laid their cable and placed us in immediate communication with Europe and the rest of the world at a time when we were not able to do it for ourselves. </para>

                        <para>- They came to us-' and told us what they would do. They asked a certain subsidy as an inducement for laying the line, and the States willingly agreed to their proposals. The subsidy has since been increased or decreased according to circumstances. When they have lowered the rates they have asked the States to increase the subsidy in order to make up the difference and free them from loss. The whole thing has been purely a business transaction between the States and the company, and the company has kept to its engagements honestly. The company having come in at a time when we were not prepared to bear the expense of joining Australia to Europe by cable, I do not know that it is fair on our part now to say that we will not encourage them in the future, and to say we will do all that we can to prevent them from having trade with this country. They are entitled to a ' fair amount of consideration. If this amendment is not carried, and if the Postmaster-General chooses to exercise his powers in the direction I have indicated, he will inflict considerable hardship upon the State that least deserves it. As in postal matters we allow' a man to say by what route his letters are to be carried, by parity of reasoning we should also allow a man who wants to send a telegram to say by what route his telegram shall be sent. </para>

                    <para>- The argument put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> should commend itself to the committee - that South Australia has shown a great amount of enterprise in constructing a telegraph line across the continent - but I put it to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> whether in a federation such as we have now, carried on by responsible government, the Government is likely to go out of its way to injure any one of the States. I say that directly the contrary would be the case, and this overland line of South Australia is not at all likely to be handicapped by the Commonwealth Government to the extent <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> has- suggested. His fear is altogether illusory. Another point to which I wish to direct the attention of honorable senators is the great advantages which will follow from our having a duplicate cable between Australia and Europe in the case of war. That has been pointed out again and again by persons coming here. We know that even ten years ago representatives were sent over from Canada and from other places to negotiate with us with a view to the construction of what is called the Pacific cable, and it was pointed-out that if what was proposed was to be done the cable must be subsidized by the different Governments. Now, what are honorable senators proposing to do ?. They are proposing to handicap that Pacific cable, and to permit all the mercantile community - I think I may use the argument - to enter into an arrangement with a private company to deplete the Treasury of its proper assets. </para>

If the Postmaster-General's argument is worth anything at all, it means that the clause will enable the Government to have a monopoly, and that is a matter which will commend itself to the serious and earnest consideration of honorable senators. It appears to mc that it is reasonable. We have been told a great deal about the generosity shown lately to these States by a certain company. What is the reason for. that generosity <inline font-style="italic">1</inline></para>

                    he will not resent my saying a few words for myself. A great deal lias been said about monopoly, but I take it that what the Postmaster-General desires to do is to establish, at any rate, the right to create a monopoly. On the other hand, we do not ask for any ' monopoly for private individuals, but we say that where they establish a cable service it should be placed on exactly the same level as the State -owned cable, and senders of messages should be allowed to take their choice between the two. In speaking of a monopoly, some senators appear to have overlooked the fact that there is the widest possible difference between land lines in a territory absolutely owned and controlled by the federal authorities; and a cable which runs through territory beyond' their control. The Postmaster-General mentioned the case of three telegraph lines from one town, and said it would be absurd to allow the sender of a message to such a place to indicate which line lie preferred to have it sent by, but the honorable and learned senator forgets that in that case the State rates would be the same for one line as for the other, and that there would be no objection to picking a particular line. There would be a very big difference, indeed, if there were varying charges for the different lines.

                        <para>- We have heard a lot of these remarks about being able to bring people to heel, but we know that when we place any one in a position of power, there is always growing an appetite for more power. We see that throughout the whole of this Bill The officials of the department are trying now to gather more power than I, at any rate, feel disposed to give them. With regard to the federal authorities paying a subsidy, the argument on the subject appears to me to be idle, because we cannot imagine the State undertaking the construction of a cable and continuing to give a subsidy to a private line to compete with it. If we want private enterprise to be shut out altogether, let us say so openly and above board, and let us paste a notice up at all the ports of Australia that we intend to do that. We will then have some justification for the monopoly, but what guarantee will we have that. we shall be able' to get our messages delivered on the other side of the world? Our monopolies must cease with- our border lines. It is idle to talk of establishing a monopoly over a cable which touches other shores than our own. </para>

                        <para>- Very well, our absolute monopoly. I do not see why the transmission of telegrams by cable should not be as .much a State monopoly as the transmission of messages by land. I do not assent to the honorable senator's proposition. There seems to me to be no necessity for extreme illustrations as to how this would work, because we know exactly what would happen. Suppose we have two cables from here to Great Britain. We have a published rate of 2s. 6d. a word, and a private company advertises that it will carry messages at the same rate. </para>

We have published our rate as 2s.

Everybody has got to pay the 2s. 6d., but a privately-owned company can publish its rates and then give heavy discounts. It can pick its business, and say to certain firms- - " If you agree to send all your business over our cable we will allow you 20, 30, or 50 per cent, discount." In that way they would be able to keep their cable always busy and leave the other cable comparatively idle. If we are to have two cables-- </para>

                        <para>- The business of subsidizing has not worked well in the past. I think that in the past we have paid very much more than we should have paid for our cable messages, and the sole reason that rates have been reduced lately is the anticipated competition of the Pacific cable. It is that which has brought the rates down, and so surely as this monopoly is able to destroy the State-owned cable so certainly will the rates go up again. It is the duty of every one who desires to get the cable rates permanently lowered to see that nothing is done which would injuriously operate against the Pacific cable. With regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford's</inline> illustration as to posting letters viet Brindisi or <inline font-style="italic">wm</inline> Torres Straits, there was once a reason for doing that, because the postage rate was regulated by the route by which the letter was to go. In some cases a letter could be sent for 4d. by one route, but if a 6d. stamp were put on the letter, and it were marked to go <inline font-style="italic">vi(i</inline> Brindisi, it went more quickly. Where the analogy absolutely fails is that in the case of a letter no one will make a secret profit out of it. The fact of marking a letter to go by any route does not put money into the pocket of any person, whereas the sole object of this amendment is to enable a particular company which has a cable to insure that messages shall be sent by that route for its own profit. I do not think I am unfairly stating the ease. </para>

                    <para>- The amendment resolves itself into the question of whether we are to allow the Telegraph department to be controlled by its customers or by its official head? If senders have the right to say by which route their messages shall go, and there are alternative routes, then certainly the control is taken out of the hands of the department. When we look at the clause in the light of the fact that there will be a State route, or what is known as the Pacific cable, the argument of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> in dealing with the South Australian land line loses much of its force. The action which he pictures an imaginary Minister as having taken would be the action of a person who wanted to ruin his own business. Certainly for five years South Australia would have to bear the loss, but the ultimate loss would fall on the Commonwealth. Will he say that the Minister, for the purpose of benefiting the Pacific cable for five years, is going to ruin the overland line in South Australia? We have in Western Australia a line to Broome. I am certain that for the convenience of the department in that State, the Deputy Postmaster-General will continue to send a considerable number of messages to Banjoewangie. The Deputy Postmaster-General of South Australia very likely will send all the messages he receives by the overland route to Port Darwin. When we have the Pacific cable, it is possible that the Deputy Postmasters-General of New South Wales and Victoria may find it convenient to send some of their telegrams over that route. I do not think it can be soberly stated that it is for the purpose of crushing other lines out of existence that we are asked to give this power to the Minister. For the proper working of the department, he requires the power to send these messages by whichever route is convenient, and the right to select the route should not be given to the customers. For these reasons I intend to support the attitude of the Minister. As regards sending a letter by whichever route we wish, I would point out that in the case of a letter, a man has not an alternative as to whether it shall go by a private route or by a State route, and, further, the cost of the postage-stamp goes to one person - the Postmaster-General - in every case. In the case of cablegrams we pay on the one hand the Minister, and on the other a private company, and that, in my opinion, marks the distinction between a letter and a telegram in that respect. </para>

                    <para>- I wish to make a few remarks on this question, not so much from a business as from a national point of view. It is to begin with a question of pounds, shillings, and pence ; and, secondly, a question of whether it is of national importance that we should have a second line. In the first place, if the second line is not to be a paying line, from any causes which may eventuate from the people of the States, then I hold that it need not be taken into consideration. But if it is likely to pay, and I understand that we are practically pledged to give some assistance to a line <inline font-style="italic">viâ</inline> Canada; then I hold that, instead of one line having the monopoly, through some combination of business people, there should be an equal amount of advantage given to both lines. There is a far more important matter to be considered, and that is the importance of a second line from a national point of view. This second line will give us communication with the dominion of Canada, and direct communication with the mother country through Canada. Practically it will be a British-owned, and a British-utilized line with a small risk in time of war of its being destroyed and our being cut off. Consequently that ought to weigh with honorable senators just as much as the importance of the line from a commercial point of view. I shall support the clause. </para>

I shall never put. something which is in my State as a buffer between some private monopoly and the welfare of the whole community. My fellow senators from South Australia view the question from a different stand-point, and 1 can only attribute that to a want of the federal spirit which ought to exist in them. These honorable senators talk about our transcontinental line being ruined. In what ? In the interests of Australia.

                        <para>- I am surprised at the honorable senator. A few minutes ago he said that for the first five years any surplus would be credited to South Australia, and of course any deficiency would be debited to it. I have no fear that within that period any Postmaster-General will treat his own property and the interests of the Commonwealth in such a manner as to allow South Australia to suffer. It would be unfair if he did. I am sure no matter what State he represented the Senate would not hesitate to bring any Minister to book who attempted to do such a thing. </para>

                        <para>- It would give details enough, and if it did not we could soon see that it did. With regard to sending letters by this route or that route, I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> Playford has had sufficient explanation to see that there is no analogy between that and that which the Minister is contending for. On the other hand, many letters are marked to go by a route because a mail may be going earlier by that route than by another. We are endeavouring to give the Minister an opportunity, in the interests of' all Australia, to get as many bines as possible to all parts of the world and to have them all under his control.,, This is simply a question of private individuals dealing with separate companies, or the postal authorities dealing for private individuals with all companies. That is the position I take, and I hope I shall never be so provincial in my ideas as to allow a State interest that does not exist to stand between what is just to the whole Commonwealth and any fear that might be in my mind. </para>

I must confess that I listened with astonishment to the statement of the Postmaster-General that it was expected that the line would be opened by March next. The route has not even been surveyed yet.

                        <para>-The Minister urged that there was no necessity to put in this amendment now, because we should have the Pacific line by March next, and I merely want to show that that portion of his argument was somewhat faulty. Then the argument of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford,</inline> I think, is worthy of grave consideration. There is no doubt, in my mind, that once the Pacific line is opened and it becomes a Government line, as it will, the tendency of the Post-office throughout the Commonwealth will be naturally to send as much business as possible by that line, and to that extent the transcontinental line in South Australia must suffer. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> dwelt somewhat on the fact of benefiting the Eastern Extension Company's line, and, perhaps, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> overlooked the fact that we have two lines, and that the Pacific line will be a third one. What is the position of the Eastern Extension Company's line ? We are subsidizing that line, and the more it earns the less subsidy we shall have to pay. The more business we take from that line and throw on to the new line, the more subsidy the Commonwealth will have to pay. </para>

                        <para>- I grant that in the meantime the Commonwealth will not have taken over this line, but the existing States will have to pay, and in that sense the Commonwealth will have to. pay. So that every pound we take from the Eastern Extension Company's line in order to give it to the Pacific line, will, to that extent, represent a pound which the Commonwealth will have to pay in increased subsidy. It is well that we should understand that, and not try to convince ourselves that by giving these facilities to those who send telegrams, we shall be benefiting only a private company. To a certain extent undoubtedly we shall, but we shall also be saving the Commonwealth an increase of the subsidy ; so that the benefits will be divided. Then I will point out to the Postmaster-General that it is utterly impossible to- prevent this being carried out. It is true that by rejecting the amendment we can entail upon the commercial public some loss and inconvenience. I may say in passing, what is probably well known, that the vast bulk of the over-sea telegrams are sent by the commercial public, and surely it is advisable that we should do what we can to assist, not to throw difficulties -in the way of our own customers. What is being done, and will be done by the commercial public, is that telegrams will be sent through Reuter's agent in Adelaide. The Post-office will thus lose this business altogether. The messages will, still go by the Cape route. The Postmaster-General cannot stop it. </para>

However, there is no possibility for the next two or three years of the company doing anything to increase its rates, and by that time we shall have the Pacific line in working order. Then the Commonwealth ought to be able to do the business as cheaply as any company can. I should be ashamed to think that the Postal department could not conduct its business as economically and satisfactorily as any private firm. I merely mention the matter of the reductions to show that there is no intention of killing the Government line and then putting up the price. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> is not speaking within the bounds of practical business in making that suggestion. I can understand the Postmaster-General being anxious to stick to his Bill, and to obtain for his department all the powers he can get. That is very natural. But at the same time I confess that it is very dangerous for the public as a whole ; because I do not care what department it is - whether the Postal department or any other - officials always like to magnify their offices, and rise from power to power. As a rule, the public suffer in consequence. </para>

                    DOWNER (South Australia). - At the risk of being called provincial by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline>
                    I want to say another word. Of course, I can very well understand that the majority of persons in dealing with the property 'of others adopt a certain breadth of view with respect to the terms on which it is to be acquired. Their view is altogether different from that of the individuals who happen to own the property. I have resisted that view on the part of a certain section in politics before, and even at the risk of being called provincial I resist it now. We have a line of telegraph in South Australia that cost the Government of that State a lot of money, which some day we shall have to pay. In the meantime we have to carry on the line. We do not make anything out of it. It has always been conducted at ja loss, but we want to work it at the least possible loss. We have been the benefactors of the whole Commonwealth of Australia in this case. We, a small State, undertook the work for the other States, who were timid and fearful. It is true that the others came to our help afterwards when there was no necessity, but they had not the courage to do the work themselves. Now we have to contend with a different state of tilings. We recognise, as
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline>
                    has put it, that we require another line of cable for other than merely mercantile p'urposes. It is to be used for mercantile purposes certainly, but also for military and naval purposes. It will be an advantage to have that other line. Well and good. The Commonwealth says that, and the little State of South Australia says - " We agree with you, it is a fine national feeling ; but how about us"
                    <inline font-style="italic">1</inline>
                    The Commonwealth establishes a new line for military and naval purposes for the benefit of all Australia, but what is the Commonwealth going to do as far as South Australia is concerned
                    <inline font-style="italic">1</inline>
                    All the messages from Australia may be sent by the new line, and none may be sent over the South Australian line. The result, as
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline>
                    says, will be that South Australia will be subject to a disastrous loss for five years.
                </para>
                <para class="block">That "would be an unjust position. The answer is that no Postmaster-General would ever do it. Well, I do not know. I am an old Minister ; I have had more experience in politics than many honorable senators ; I have seen as many surprises in politics as most people, and I would rather be sure than sorry. I .do not know what any Postmaster-General may or may not do; but, even assuming that the Postmaster-General wants to do no injustice, an injustice may, nevertheless, be done to South Australia. Suppose the Postmaster-General happens to come from Queensland and has a prejudice in favour of the Pacific line of cable, in which Queensland is particularly interested - I am only putting a hypothetical case - there might be a tendency on his part to help that State rather than a State that was far off and of which he knew very little. These things happen, and will have to be provided for. But I am told that we ought to take up higher and national ground on this occasion. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> take that view. Then I reply - "The Commonwealth may as well pay for your great national feeling, and you. should not throw the expense on a small State and accuse people of being provincial because they happen to think that justice ought to be done, even if the Empire is in danger." There is another point which I wish to put to the committee again. Suppose that the hypothetical Queensland Postmaster-General gets his own way and establishes the Pacific line, and that certain rates are imposed ; and suppose that we in South Australia, working with the Eastern Extension Company, think we can do better by imposing lower rates ? Why should we not do so <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> If we are not permitted to do so, let the Commonwealth take the thing out of our hands and pay for it, and not leave us in the position of having to bear the. expense, while the Commonwealth takes the business OUt of .our hands and leaves us with a heavy loss which we have to liquidate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford,</inline> who is an experienced Treasurer, says that it may mean a loss of £30,000 a year to South Australia through this deflection of business, in consequence of the erection of the new line. If the Commonwealth is going to leave South Australia with this possibility, we should have the chance of making the loss as light as we can. We have built this telegraph line with . the approval of all Australia, and every one has benefited from it ; and why, in the guise of patriotism and high feeling, should the Commonwealth want to do this abominable injustice to that State? Why, when the bigger colonies refrained from doing the work themselves, should South Australia be subjected to a heavier loss than is necessary because she came to their help ? </para>

I hope very seriously that those honorable senators who have spoken will reconsider the matter and support the amendment. </para>

                    <para>- There is a growing feeling in this Chamber and elsewhere that South Australia in every bargain made between that State and the Commonwealth is not going to be behindhand, but is going to get the best possible terms for herself. I do not blame South Australian senators for speaking on behalf of their State. It is their duty. But it is only reasonable to expect that they will recognise that there are other States beside South Australia. We have heard so much of the Northern Territory telegraph line and of other white elephants in which South Australia is interested, that really we may be pardoned for thinking that that State is almost on the verge of insolvency. It seems to me, however, that in respect of Commonwealth affairs South Australia is getting on remarkably well, and is still going strong. That State is going for something more than she has already got. We, however, have to consider the interests of the Commonwealth as a whole. The desire of the Postmaster-General is to make the Pacific cable a commercial success. We are all anxious to see that result achieved. If it is to be a success the Postmaster-General must have the right of controlling the telegraph service, and not leave to Others outside the opportunity of getting the best of the department, and making bargains to suit themselves. The key-note throughout the whole discussion on this Bill has been that the telegraph service should be a State monopoly. If it is not to be a State monopoly, how is it to be a commercial success? And. if it is not to be a commercial success we should be foolish to allow the Commonwealth to be robbed of revenue to which it is justly entitled. If we are not to have a Government monopoly, the revenue will certainly decrease very considerably. <inline font-style="italic">We</inline> hear a great deal about loyalty ; but, I contend, that it is the duty of the people to. be loyal to the interests of the Government, just as much as it is for them to talk of all this cheap loyalty in reference to the King, and that sort of nonsense. We have to be loyal to the Government and to the Constitution, and if we allow private individuals to make bargains, by which they will get the better qf the services of the Government, we shall not be true to the interests of the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MILLEN</inline>
                    (New South Wales).The honorable senator, who has just resumed his seat, has made a statement which, I take to be an absolute declaration in favour of the establishment of a Government monopoly with regard to the projected cable. That is a definite statement which I can quite understand. It would have a great deal of force if there was no private cable in existence. As there is such a cable in existence, however, that declaration must mean that by some means or other the honorable senator proposes to prohibit business on privately-owned cables. I desire to ask the Postmaster-General a question. He stated a little while ago that a private cable company, having published rates equal to those fixed by the Government, might still in practice allow rebates. In that case he said it would be right to allow the Government to step in and exercise the power which the Bill gives the department.

                    <para>- I intend to oppose <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Frederick</inline> Sargood's amendment. It appears to me that the honorable senator represents the commercial circles of Australia in this matter. The position seems to be this. For a number of years the commercial community have been labouring under the heavy exactions of private telegraph companies. They have agitated and agitated until a proposal has been brought about for the establishment of State enterprise, and now they wish to put the State enterprise and the private enterprise into competition with each other. That seems to be the position, as far as I can gather. In the case of State enterprise, we can fix the rates to suit the public convenience. If the rates are too high, we can lower them ; if they are too low we can raise them ; if the service is not expeditious, an improvement can be made. We have no control, however, over private enterprise. The only whip we can hold over it is the competition of a State telegraphic line, and that apparently is likely to have the effect of reducing the rates which, for a long period, have been charged by this private enterprise. No doubt they have made very large profits. They have put considerable sums to their reserve funds, and they are prepared to pay a little now to bring discredit on State over-sea telegraphic enterprise. I am not going to play into their hands at all. Whether any business goes over the State line or not we shall have to maintain it. The interest on the cost of construction will have to be paid, and the officials will have to be paid. The whole cost of carrying on the business of that line will be going on whether any messages are sent over it or not, and the people of Australia will have to pay. It appears to me to be' more in the interests of the people of the Commonwealth, who will be called upon to defray the cost of maintenance, that their line should be used than that a certain section should be given advantages - for that is what it would amount to - at the expense of the whole community. I am inclined to support the honorable and learned gentleman in attempting to bring about a tiling of that kind. It appears to me that we ought to support the Postmaster-General in the position he has taken up. The honorable senators from South Australia appear to be very apprehensive of injury to that State in connexion with this matter. I do not suppose that any one desires to inflict an injury upon South Australia or upon any other State iri the Commonwealth. As I listened to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir John</inline> Downer's argument I was forced to the conclusion that, if carried to its logical issue, it was an argument against the Pacific line itself. If the Pacific line is established a certain amount of traffic must necessarily, in any circumstances, go over it, and the business of the transcontinental line will be lessened by so much. We are all grateful to South  Australia for her philanthropic efforts to provide telegraphic communication for the people of that State and the rest of Australia. But South Australia must yield to the pressure of circumstances just as we all have to do. The teamster in the back blocks provides himself with bullocks and horses,, but the railway comes along and deprives him probably  of bis means of existence. He has to give way to the new conditions, and so it must be with South Australia. <inline font-style="italic">TI</inline> the Commonwealth as a whole can be better served by means of the Pacific cable than it has been hitherto by means of the Eastern Extension line, combined with the transcontinental line, South Australia must accept the position. We do not wish South Australia to be at any loss. I am certain that a very large proportion of the business will go over the transcontinental line, but in any case I think it is better that the line should be in the hands of the Postmaster-General, and that he should have the power to say whether a message should go over it or not. The decision as to whether a message should go over that line or not should be in the hands of the Postmaster-General rather than in the hands of any private syndicate. I think that even from that point of view South Australia is more likely to be bettered than if the entire control were in the hands of a private company. With regard to the question of charges, several honorable senators have pointed out that a private company might be willing to carry messages at very much lower rates than the State. It does not matter, however, what rates are charged upon our telegraph lines ; the people of the Commonwealth have to pay them. If the commercial classes get their messages over one line cheaply and the community as a whole has to keep up another line in idleness, then it is much better for the community as a whole to pay the higher rates upon its own cable than that a certain section should have the benefit of low rates over another Une. In the end the people have to pay, and it is much better that we should pay ourselves, so to speak, rather than that we should pay some one else. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator CHARLESTON</inline>
                    (South Australia). - I am also one of those who are not afraid of being called provincialists in this matter. I look upon this proposal as a very serious attack upon the line which is already constructed, and which has been of such great service to Australia. We have heard a great deal this afternoon about the high rates that were charged by the Eastern Extension Company, and how they were ultimately reduced. It was quite natural, however, when they had to work an expensive line with very little traffic over it that they should charge high rates. With the aid of the cable communication established between Australia and Europe and America, Australia has largely benefited. We have increased our trade and commerce ; and we have increased our population, with the result that greater trade has been done. In this way the company's business has been increased, and they have been enabled to reduce their tariff. Such a thing naturally follows in all cases. As statesmen we have felt the need of other cable communication. We have felt that Australia ought to be connected with the old world by two lines, and that if we had one which passed through British territory alone, we should be on much safer ground in the case of a European war, or an occurrence of that kind. If,then, Great Britain, Canada, and the Commonwealth of Australia decide upon constructing a cable, well and good. There are certain reasons why that course should be adopted. We approve of the line being constructed, but to say that, because we believe it necessary that there should be a line passing through British territory alone, we should practically close up other lines is another matter.

Some honorable senators argue as though we had passed the period of five years, and were now taking the full responsibility of everything in . the Commonwealth. If we had passed over the five years the whole of the loss sustained by the telegraph line would fall on the whole community, and there might be something in the honorable senator's arguments. But, instead of that, South Australia must bear that loss for five years; and, seeing that she has always been ready to meet the demands of the commercial people of Australia, and, in conjunction with the Eastern Extension Company, has reduced rates in proportion to the business done-- </para>

                        <para>- We are not so sure of that ; and I am one who, with Senators Downer and Playford, will not put it in his power to do so. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has said that South Australia must suffer if she stands in the way of progress, but we are not standing in the way of progress. All we are saying is that, when the Pacific cable is established, those desirous of sending cable messages should be allowed to say on which line they prefer to have their messages transmitted. If I understand anything at all of socialism the socialist is prepared to bring the State openly and boldly into competition with private enterprise. If the State, cannot do work as cheaply as private enterprise, then in the interests of the community private enterprise must do that work. But I for one believe that the State is always able if work is done rightly, and as it ought to be done, to compete successfully against any private enterprise. When it is said that the State will not be able to compete with a private company, I ask how is any private company going to fight against the State when the State, in order to keep its line going - as it would be justified in doing in order to continue direct communication with the whole world over British territory -would from its general revenue make up for any loss on the working of the line ? How long is any private company going to stand that? Of course it would have to give way, but the existence of the private company would force the Government to do their work economically, and to keep pace with private enterprise. I, as one who has stood up bodly for State enterprise, am not afraid that the State could have its business crushed out by any private enterprise. I, therefore, say that if the people of Australia desire to send their messages by either of the lines connecting us with the old country they should be allowed to do so, and I strongly support the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sargood.</inline></para>

On the other hand, it is quite refreshing in contradistinction to that to hear what a beautiful organisation, and philanthropic body the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company is. On the one hand, we are told that we must distrust the Government in every way-; we must not give them any power whatever, or they will be bound to abuse it ; while, on the other hand, we are told that the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company is so philanthropically inclined, and so good in reducing their rates, that we must trust them in everything, and must not injure them in any way. I have had a considerable amount of experience of the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company, possibly as much as any honorable senator present, and my own opinion is that it is one of the most dangerous and insidious monopolies we have in the British Empire. That company has been making enormous profits for years, but it has been careful enough to hide those profits. It has watered its stock ; it has built up huge reserve funds; it has built fleets of repairing boats, and laid down other cables out of its profits. In these ways, it has hidden the enormous profits it has made out of the people of Australia and the other peoples with whom its lines . are connected. That philanthropic body is managed by millionaire directors, men like Lord Tweedmouth and others ; and what did they do when the proposal was made that the British Empire should come together and have an Empire cable? They placed every obstacle they could in the way of it. Through Lord Tweedmouth, in his position in the House of Lords, and in every other way, they used every influence they could to obstruct the Pacific cable line. These are the people we are implored to assist, and the other cable, the profits from which will go to the people as shareholders, and not to private directors, we are to disregard. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> mentioned that the great reason why this Empire cable could not be carried into effect was that South Australia had a telegraph line which had been built by the State. </para>

I thought he gave it as an unanswerable argument why the Postmaster-General should not have the power to divert the traffic to the Government line that South Australia had patriotically built a State line from Adelaide to Port Darwin. I point out to honorable senators that Western Australia has also got a cable at Broome.

                <para class="block">Australia say that for that reason the Commonwealth should not have this right. I object to the statement that the Government will go out of their way to do an injury to any State unless they are prevented by some such amendment as has been proposed. The Government have been subsidizing the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company for some years past, and if they will ultimately lose by the South Australian line it is not likely that they will go out of their way to specially injure South Australia. I ask honorable senators from the various States if the Commonwealth Government are going to be so unfair as to absolutely injure their revenue and their prospects in that way. I think such a clause as this is absolutely necessary, because it is quite possible, and I believe it has been done, for private companies to give a rebate on messages sent over their lines. They will do that kind of thing privately, and will make,perhaps, an arrangement for six or twelve months with some firm to send their messages at a certain rate. </para>

                        <para>- No, but the Government can prevent it by sending the messages across their own line if the rates are the same. I understand by this clause that the Government can send the messages by whichever line they like. Therefore, where the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company advertise their rate at 3s. 6d. a word, and the Government also advertise a rate of 3s. 6d., it will not matter whether the Eastern Extension Company allow a rebate privately or not, the Government can send the messages across the Government line. That is why I consider this clause so absolutely necessary. The Government department must conduct its business fairly, openly, and above board, while the private company need not necessarily do so. I do not believe that any Postmaster-General of this Commonwealth will unfairly take advantage of this clause. But I believe such a clause to be necessary in the interests of the Empire, the people of Australia, and even of the cablers themselves. </para>

                    (New South Wales). - There is one point I would like to mention to the Postmaster-General. I presume there is no reason why a State department should not be conducted on business lines, and if. he finds that an opposing company is offering inducements at a lower rate, I fail to see why he should not also be prepared to allow the same reductions.

                    SARGOOD (Victoria). - I wish to insert a provision which was specially put in the Crimes Act of Victoria to meet what was found to be a want of power. Prior to the enactment of that provision, many documents perforce had been allowed to pass through the post - office, owing to the want of a definition of the word "indecent," and two years ago the Parliament of this State passed the provision, which I' have copied in order that the Postmaster-General may have an opportunity of deciding whether it is advisable to insert it in this Bill. If it is not inserted, I think it will be found that two other clauses we have passed will be practically inoperative. I move -

                    <para>- The new clause appears to me to be of a most vague and uncertain character. It provides that matter of an indecent or obscene nature shall not be permitted to go through the post-office. What is indecent and what is. obscene? Every postmaster or postmistress at any little post-office is to be endowed with the power of deciding as to the indecency or obscenity of matter. In this Senate we have 36 senators, the elect of Australia, so to speak, from a political point of view. I do not think we could agree amongst ourselves as to an advertisement being decent or indecent. Some honorable senators might consider an advertisement indecent when I should see nothing wrong in it, and <inline font-style="italic">vice versâ.</inline> Papers containing advertisements of Tattersalls sweeps were not allowed to go through the post-office in Queensland. In Victoria there is a law which seems to me to be of such a character as to be almost ridiculous, as to certain advertisements. I think, before we pass a proposal of this kind, we should have a definition of " decent " and " indecent." I quite agree with a number of honorable senators that some words are indecent, but I do not know that I could suggest a definition. It is not my business to provide a' definition. It is the business of the honorable senator who proposed this clause to do so. Let the honorable senator bring his definition before the committee and let us decide upon it then. If the honorable senator proposes the Victorian definition shall be against it, because I think that sort of thing has established a censorship which is altogether foreign to our ideas of British liberty, or Australian liberty, or any other Wind of liberty. Why should we set ourselves up as purists and say that advertisements referring to certain diseases shall not appear in the newspapers ? We know that those diseases exist and that people wish to be cured of them. We also know that certain individuals are specialists in regard to them. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, because it appears in a postal article, and the term "postal article" is defined as including a newspaper. Then again the question arises - what is the outside of a newspaper? I take it that you could very well- say that the side upon which the advertisements appeared was the outside of a newspaper. I do not think the clause is' necessary. </para>

                    <para>- There is a good deal in what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has said. I would point out in addition that clause 27 deals very fully with this matter, and gives the Postmaster-General most extraordinary powers. As far as newspapers are concerned, there is no doubt whatever that the Postmaster-General has absolute and arbitrary powers to refuse to send by post any newspaper containing - </para>

                <para>Seditious, blasphemous, indecent, or obscene matter, or which, by reason of the proportion of the advertisements to other matter therein, or for any other reason is not within the description aforesaid. </para>
                <para class="block">So that there is no doubt that, as far as a newspaper is concerned, the Postmaster-General has this power already. As to clause 41, probably its phraseology might be altered so as to include the bulk of the amendment before the committee. It would be very injudicious to have three clauses dealing with one class of offence, when people will have to read through a very long Act of Parliament to find the provisions bearing upon particular offences. The whole matter ought to be dealt with in one clause if possible. If necessary, that could be clause 41, to which the amendment could be added as a proviso. </para>

                    SARGOOD (Victoria). - It is true that to a large extent my proposal is covered by clauses 27 and 41. It will be noticed that clause 27 has been copied in part from section 4 of the Victorian Post-office Act. It was afterwards found that that provision did not cover the ground. Action was taken and the Full Court decided that it did not cover the cases contemplated. A clause similar to clause 41 was then introduced, but that was found not to cover the ground. Then the section I have submitted was passed as part of the Crimes Act, and subsequent to that a definition of the word "indecent" was put in the Crimes Act. It is not a definition such as I would care to read to the committee ; but' if honorable senators would like to read it they can see what was considered necessary by the Full Court.

                    Sargoodhas not satisfied me with regard to the definition which he has just handed to me.

As I have said previously, if those diseases are in existence why should not people who suffer from them be afforded an opportunity of knowing where they can be cured ?

                        <para>- Well, I do not know. That is another matter entirely. There is a book which has been said to be, and I believe is, one of the best books we have got, and it contains very many passages that would come under the heading of "indecent" under this definition of indecency. I suppose the honorable senator knows the book to which I refer. Does he propose to prohibit the use of that book in his family, or does he propose to cull out certain passages - to edit the book- and after it has been purified and purged and cleansed of its impurity will he permit it to be circulated in his family circle ? My experience has been that young people are not in the habit of reading advertisements. They very rarely trouble their heads with the advertisements that appear in newspapers. This definition appears in the Victorian Crimes Act. The honorable senator wishes to apply it to the whole Commonwealth. A great number of very reputable British newspapers have been stopped in this holy State of Victoria. So far as my experience is any guide, however, the standard of morality iri the old country is just as high as it is in Australia ; it is certainly as high as in Victoria. I refer to the personal morality of the people. The public and commercial morality of "the people of Great Britain is very much higher than the public and commercial morality of the people of Melbourne. </para>

                        <para>- I say with all. respect to honorable senators that the city of Melbourne stinks in the nostrils of Australia so far as its public morality is concerned. Is this not the land of the boom we have all heard of as occurring a few years ago - the boom which swallowed up in its vortex a number of innocent inoffensive people? And yet the very people who condone that boom come along with this pettifogging attempt to put down immorality. They strain at the gnat and swallow the camel with a vengeance ! In this inquisitorial Act which the honorable senator wishes to apply to the whole Commonwealth, Victoria includes such newspapers as the <inline font-style="italic">Dundee News.</inline> Dundee, I may say for the information of some honorable senators, is in Scotland, and Scotland is one of the most moral countries under the sun. The people there are much more careful of what comes under the eyes of their children than they are in Victoria. Then Victoria excludes the <inline font-style="italic">People's Journal,</inline> thirteen editions of which are published per week. It is one of the finest newspapers published in Scotland, a newspaper which I have read during the last 40 years, and from which I have derived a great deal of benefit. I do not remember ever having read advertisements of this particular class in that paper in my life, and could not tell whether they appear in it or not. My inclinations would not lead me to look for that sort of thing. I do not descend, as some of our Victorian people apparently are so well fitted to do, to the gutter. I look at the leading articles and at the columns of news. I examine the correspondence and read the. matter dealing with the questions of importance that were before the country at the time of publication. I never trouble my head about the advertising columns, and I believe that in that respect I am a fair sample of the vast body of newspaper readers. Are the majority who do not read these advertisements to be punished for the sake of the very small minority <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Of course the honorable senator will say that in this indirect method we shall stamp out the publication of this class of advertisement. I say, however, that these advertisements are just as legitimate as any other kind. J  Just  as consumption is a disease, so the matters referred to in these advertisements are also diseases. </para>

                        <para>- All these papers have been prevented by this inquisitorial law from coming into Victoria. Let us take the <inline font-style="italic">English Mechanic.</inline> What craftsman reads the advertisements in that journal <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> A man does not turn his attention to that particular part of the paper. He may do' 'so in some cases, but if a man takes the <inline font-style="italic">English Mechanic</inline> he does so in order to improve his knowledge of mechanics. The honorable senator, however, would deprive him of that privilege because some little advertisement to which he objects appears in. an obscure corner of the paper. I say that the interests of the majority ought to be considered rather than the interests of the minority. The clause which the honorable senator proposes to insert appears to me to be asking far too much power altogether;. It is inspired by the most prurient ideas. This sort of censorship is altogether unworthy of the people of Australia. If these newspapers can be circulated in Great Britain, surely we should have no objection to their circulation here. It is adopting altogether a Pharasiacal attitude to say that they are so impure and contrary to our ideas of good morals that we cannot permit them to be circulated amongst us. I do not think we ought to take up the position of censors in this way. What is good enough to be circulated in Great Britain cannot be too bad to be circulated here. Their standard of morality at home is quite equal to ours as far as I have been able to gather, and I shall certainly oppose this attempt to create in our midst a kind of Russian censorship. </para>

                        <para>- If we adopt this clause with a view to inserting the proposed definition which has been circulated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Frederick</inline> Sargood we shall be doing something which is altogether too sweeping. I do not see any harm in some of the advertisements which are referred to. The diseases to which they relate undoubtedly exist, and what harm can there be in allowing the publication of advertisements which purport to announce a cure for them. I fail to see how they can have any immoral effect on the people who read them. If a person of a pure mind reads them is that man or woman likely, to be degraded by reason of that act. I hope we shall not be led away. This is puritanical legislation to an extreme degree, and it will not have the effect of raising the morals of the community one iota. It will simply add to the list of offences under the Crimes Act, and deter the circulation of papers which are a benefit to the community. I am familiar with <inline font-style="italic">Reynolds' Newspaper</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">English Mechanic,</inline> and I think it would be a distinct advantage if they were more fully read in Australia. If we' are going to prevent such newspapers from* circulating in this country, we shall do more harm than by allowing these advertisements to be published. </para>

Unless we have such a definition we shall keep out a number of good newspapers. If honorable senators read the definition which has been circulated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Frederick</inline> Sargood they will see that there is great danger in it. I do not see why these specialists should not be allowed to advertise, as long as their advertisements are couched in reasonable language, just as well as specialists in the treatment of diseases, relating to the eye or the ear. We are not legislating against the cure of disease. We are here to further the cure of disease as much as possible. To take up the attitude which some honorable members have suggested would be very unreasonable, and I for one would not support it. </para>

I simply rose to point out that the alarm expressed in this quarter of the committee is founded upon an idea that a definition which honorable senators have seen privately will have to be provided. The honorable senator who has moved this amendment may or may not intend to propose a definition, but even if he does it is not incumbent on the. committee to accept it. </para>

I should be glad if honorable senators would take note of these particular clauses, because in some cases when we have had clauses under discussion. I have expressed my willingness to have them recommitted if necessary. Subsequently other parts of the Bill have been dealt with, and. the necessity for recommitting them has ceased to exist. The clauses I have noted down are these - Clauses 2, 5, 15, 16, 17, 19, 21, 27, 36, 68, 77, 78, 91, 92, 95, 103, and 142. I have circulated the amendments I propose to move on recommittal. </para>

                    <para>- It becomes necessary to make an amendment in this clause for the sake of bringing out the meaning more clearly, and also for the purpose of making more clear the meaning of the words " the defendant neglects to appear to the writ." The difficulty; that arises is this". It appears that; the almost universal practice of the justices is to regard the failure to appear when a man has been served with a process, or a process has come to his knowledge, as being a wilful neglect. That is generally the law, but I understand that there have been some decisions in Victoria which rather alter the effect of that, and make it really very doubtful how far one has got to go into the mind of the defendant to make it appear that his failure to appear has been wilful. We have, of course, to avoid these little legal conundrums wherever we can, and I propose to make an amendment here which will make it perfectly clear that when a man has been served with a summons, or when the summons has been brought to his notice, that will be taken as sufficient to consider subsequent failure to appear as wilful. That will save all the legal difficulty, and the other amendment I would propose in the clause is simply a readjustment. I move - </para>

                    <para>- I should much prefer that the word " wilfully " should be left in. This is a very extreme power that is given in this clause. We are going to provide that a man shall be bound by a process that he has not been served with. Brown, Jones, or Robinson may have told him of it, but he may have disbelieved them, and we leave it to a Judge or to a court to say that he ought to have believed them, and should have looked after it. That is bad enough on the face of it, and though we do find it absolutely necessary to make provision that if the process comes to his knowledge he shall be bound to take notice of it, the least we can do is to say correspondingly that if he does not take notice of it he shall be shown to have wilfully neglected to do so, which I understand to mean that he knew it was genuine, and wilfully availed himself of an opportunity of evading it. I think the word " wilfully " ought to stop in the clause. I think the words - </para>

                        <para>- Yes, but within what time is he to appear? The form of the writ is "ten days after service thereof." I suppose the form will now be altered, and we will say eight or ten or 50 days, or whatever the time may be after the service thereof, or after the issue of the writ becomes known to the defendant. I suppose the writ will have to be altered to something like that form, and I think the statute should provide for that. As to the bigger question of whether or not, or to what extent a man is to be bound by knowledge of a process he has never seen, I am really not sure that the word " wilfully " in such a case is strong enough. It is not merely that I object to the word being omitted, but I am not sure that it is strong enough. </para>

                        <para>- I am satisfied with it. Some of my friends here may tell me that a writ has been issued against me, and I may thoroughly disbelieve them. But I will still, under the clause, have had notice of it, though I have never seen it, and do not know what it contains, or what it is about. Some one says tome - " A writ is issued against you," and I laugh and say - " I do not think so. I do not know any one who has any cause to issue a writ against me. I cannot conceive it possible, but I suppose I will hear more about it if it be true." Can it be said in that event that I wilfully neglected it? Of course not. The thing is too ridiculous! Therefore, I want something more than a mere notice, which may be accurate or inaccurate. I think it is necessary to prove that a man has notice of the writ, that he knew about it, and knowing that a writ was issued against him, knowing what it contained and all about it, he wilfully neglected to appear to it, for the purpose of defeating the ends of justice. All these conditions we have to satisfy. It is not enough to know that a writ is issued against him. We have to prove that he has notice of what is in the writ so that he knows in respect of what matters it is issued against him. Really these things which we pass a little hurriedly sometimes may be most serious in their ultimate import. I am thinking aloud, because this thing was given to me at the minute and I have only read it now for the first time. It is doing away with the service. No man can complain if he does not know what is that which he has in his hands. But directly we attribute knowledge to a man of that which lias not been given to him, which he has never seen, we have to be very careful that under this general disposition which I am afraid we have to make things easy and comfortable in administration, we do not work the most terrible and gross injustice. The more I think about the clause the less I like it. I am inclined to think that there ought to be greater precautions taken. I have perfect confidence that the law will be fairly administered, but we ought not to rely on confidence; we ought to rely on law. And all we can be satisfied of is in having confidence that the law will be properly administered. I suggest that " wilfully " covers a lot of ground, because the term " wilfully neglects " must mean that the person, knowing all about it, purposely does not act. It covers an immense amount of ground. </para>

They dispense with service, they make notice sufficient, and then they go and strike out " wilfully," which I do not think has been omitted in any legislation I have known of. I think we ought to put in that the writ shall be taken to have been served on the day on which the man had notice. </para>

                    <para>- I am sorry that I do not quite agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir John</inline> Downer. I think, with all respect, he has rather confused two things. The proposition involves a twofold consideration. First, the bringing of the writ to the notice of the person served, and, secondly, something he has to do afterwards. With reference to the former consideration, I think his arguments are not appropriate for this reason - that the provision does not become operative unless it is shown to the satisfaction of the Judge that it was brought to the man's knowledge. Therefore, assuming that it is shown to the satisfaction of the Judge that it was brought to his knowledge, the position of that party henceforth ought to be exactly the same as that of a person served. Let us apply the word " wilfully " to a person served. Is it not superfluous to say that a person served with a writ should wilfully enter, an appearance <inline font-style="italic">1</inline></para>

                        <para>- Wilfully implies in that case that he might be served and might not know that he was to enter an appearance. But it follows, as a matter of. course, that if he gets a writ and reads it, or it is brought- to his knowledge that* he has been served with a writ, therefore he has to do something to enter an appearance. The ordinary presumption of law when a party served allows the stipulated number of days to pass by without doing anything is, that he is wilfully refusing to put in an appearance, either because he thinks he has not a case, or because he wishes to hamper the other party. The view I take on one side is that " wilfully " is to be read exactly the same as if it were used in reference to an appearance, which was to be entered by a person who had been served. It applies equally to both. </para>

I would suggest that it would be very much better not to tie the hands of the Judge, because the whole thing goes before a Judge, and if these difficult matters contained in the early part of the clause have been proved, and if the defendant wilfully neglects to appear to the writ, or is living out of the State, in order to defeat or delay a creditor - such court or Judge may, on the application of the plaintiff, direct from time to time that the plaintiff shall be at liberty to proceed in the suit in Such manner, and subject to such,conditionsas such court or Judge may deem fit, and thereupon the plaintiff may proceed in the suit against such defendant accordingly. </para>
                <para class="block">The first starting point is at what date shall it be taken that the defendant was served. The Judge will decide that, because he will be able to say that on such and such a date the first step must be taken, that the declaration must be filed, and that so many days after that a judgment may be filed. The matter will thus be left entirely to the Judge. I would suggest to my honorable and learned friend that nothing would be gained by laying down a hard and fast rule that on the date on which the writ comes to the man's knowledge it shall be deemed to have been served on him. There is no necessity for it, and one can easily understand cases where it might be a hardship on the defendant to have the proceedings taken from that date. We get all we want by leaving it to the Judge to fix the procedure after hearing all the circumstances. </para>

                    DOWNER (South Australia). - The view I take is that people are entitled to their rights quite apart from the view which any Judge takes. An ordinary writ is served on a man, and there is a certain number of days fixed, as a matter of course, in which he has to appear. In this instance, the Minister wants to attribute service where there is none, and I agree entirely with the argument of
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harney,</inline>
                    and I admit that my off-handed opinion was not as accurate as it might have been ; but now that we have the clause, why should we put the man to whom we attribute service in possibly a worse position than a man on whom we have effected service ?

                        <para>- I only submit that we ought to provide that service by notice shall be deemed to be personal service on the day on which the defendant receives notice. I am perfectly sure that the Judge will administer the provision in that way. The only question is whether when we fix times in respect to things we can deal with and we are starting a new procedure, by which we are attributing service where there has been none, we should not say that then the service shall be deemed to have been effected on the day on which the defendant has notice. That is all I am suggesting. I have sufficient confidence in any tribunal to be sure that it will act properly. At the same time I think it ought to be in the Act. </para>

                    (Western Australia). - A slight difficulty might arise if we substituted for the bringing to his knowledge that it shall be deemed to have been served on that day. For all practical purposes they are convertible terms. I think in the expression the notice " came to his knowledge" we have reference to a separate series of occurrences. The Judge may say - " I am not prepared to say that he got notice on Thursday, Friday, or Saturday, but there is evidence before me that he heard something on Thursday; and was told something on Friday, and I am satisfied that he got notice." It really ought to be left to the Judge to say under these circumstances - " I will fix a time."

                        <para>- As I understand my honorable and learned friend's proposition, really for practical purposes it is the same as mine, but his proposition might work out in this way, that the Act of Parliament would deem service to be on the day on which the party had notice. Therefore the Judge might be forced to say - " Now I may find as a matter of fact that he had notice on Thursday," whereas in point of fact he might not think that the evidence justified him in going that far. He might say - "I am morally certain that he had notice on Thursday, and I am more morally certain now when I see what occurred on Friday ; but from what occurred on Saturday and Sunday I am certain that he knew," although he would not be willing to fix the day to which all the evidence points as the day on which the defendant got notice. </para>

                    DOWNER (South Australia). - Notice is knowledge. It is not a casual remark from one man to another that is intended. No one has notice of a thing unless he knows all about it. Suppose he was told something about it on Wednesday, more about it on Thursday, and the rest of it on Friday, so that by adding together the bits of information he got the whole information on Friday, then he would get notice on Friday. I still retain my opinion.

I agree very much with the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer.</inline> The clause as it stood originally ought to have been sufficient. It appears to me that this amendment is asking for more power than should be given. There are only very rare occasions when personal service would not be possible ; and any one can easily understand how easy it might be for a document that was left at a man's residence in his absence to be mislaid or destroyed. Such things do happen. I understand that it is proposed to excise the word " wilfully." </para>

                <para class="block">The necessity for this clause has appeared to me from the suggestion made by my honorable and learned friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons,</inline> that there was some danger that in cases where the certificate of judgment had been filed in four or five different courts, it might be satisfied in one of those courts and yet remain on the records of the other courts as a blot on the defendant's title, or against his credit. Therefore it seems to me to be reasonable that there should be some way by which, when the judgment is satisfied either in whole or in part in any one of these courts where the certificate is filed, by some automatic process that knowledge may be conveyed to every other court, so that the record may be properly kept up where there has been a payment, or kept up <inline font-style="italic">pro tanto</inline> where there has been a part payment. The effect of the new clause will be that when a man takes out a certificate of a judgment, he may file it in any court. Immediately he files it in a court of one of the States, the Registrar of that court will notify to the court out of which the judgment has issued that it has been filed there, so that the home court - if I may so describe it - will always have a complete record of every place where these certificates have been filed. When any dealing takes place upon that judgment, it will be communicated to the home court, which will communicate it to the others. There will be regulations to carry out this provision, and I have no doubt they will effect the purpose we have in view - that no man shall suffer by reason of these certificates being filed in different courts when he has satisfied the judgment. </para>

                    <para>. - It will be within the recollection of the committee that when the discussion which took place on clause 12 was adjourned last week, an amendment by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harney</inline> was under consideration. The proposal was that the word " publication " should be struck out and the word " service " substituted. The point of the amendment was that the date from which the man's claim should run should be the date of the service of the notification on him, and not the date of the notification in the <inline font-style="italic">Government Gazette.</inline> That amendment alone would have been of no use, but it is intended by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harney</inline> to move another amendment upon a previous clause, the effect of it being that it shall be obligatory on the Government to serve the notification upon every person interested in the land taken. As I pointed out at the time, the difficulty in regard to that method of procedure is this : The way we have dealt with the matter in this clause, is that we have followed the practice which has been in vogue in New South Wales for many years. I understand that it has also been the practice in Tasmania. That is to say, where it is necessary to take land for public purposes, we notify by the <inline font-style="italic">Government Gazette</inline> that. the land has been resumed, and on that notification the land becomes the property of the Crown. Then within a certain number of days after the notification, any one claiming an interest in the land must make his claim ; otherwise the claim is not received. There is no obligation in New South Wales or in Tasmania to serve a notice ; and notice has not been served where land has been taken in New South Wales under such a provision. In moving his amendment, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harney</inline> admitted that it was quite right that when a notification was published the land should immediately pass to the Government. His contention was, however, that the owner of the land should get some kind of notification that the land had been taken so that he might prepare himself to make his claim. My difficulty in acceding to that amendment was that if we make it necessary to search out every person who is interested in the land, it may be a very difficult matter. It may take some considerable time. In the case of intestate estates, it is very often an exceedingly difficult matter to find out which are the persons interested as a matter of law, and, consequently to find out where they are and where they are to be served. </para>

                        <para>- I am coming to that point in a moment. If we have to notify each person interested there is a great deal of difficulty in getting the question of compensation settled. There is also the further difficulty about it, that if we start a claim for compensation from the date when the man is served, we shall have one party interested in the estate served on one day, another person served the next week, and another the next month ; and so we shall have the time for settling these claims extended over a very long period. By the process which is adopted in this Bill, and which has been followed in New South Wales and Tasmania, we fix one date - the date of notification in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> - as the date when the claims commence to run ; so that they are all ripe on the one date. We bring the whole question of the value of the land before the court, and the amount of compensation to be given is settled at the one trial ; and then the different parties interested come in and get their different shares. I propose to make an amendment, which, I think, is a fair compromise between the view put forward by my honorable and learned friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harney,</inline> and the view I have taken. I propose to make it obligatory upon the Government to serve the notice, if it can be served, upon the owner of the land immediately after the notification in the Gazette. If the owner cannot be served, it is to be served at his last known place of residence, or by registered letter. If the owner cannot be found after reasonable diligence, the notice is to be posted on the land, as has been done in Victoria. That having been done, I propose in the next sub-clause to make the date of claim still date from the notification ; but I propose to give the owner another month. That is to say, instead of making it 90 days after the notification in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette,</inline> I propose to make it 120 days within which the person whose land has been taken, or the person whose interest in the land is affected, has to make his claim. So that the net result of the proposed amendment is that we oblige the Government to serve the notice upon the owner if he can be found ; or, if he cannot be found, it is to be left upon the land ; and then, whether the' owner can be found or not, or is served or not, within 120 days after the notification in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette,</inline> the tune begins to run after which the claim must be made. It seems to me that this is fair to the owner of the land in the first place, because it makes it the duty of tha Government to serve him with notice if he can be found. No doubt he will be served if he can be found. When he cannot be found, the notice will be posted up on the land. In either case it gives a very long period - 120 days after the notification in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> - from which to date the making of the claim for compensation. If the owner has been served, 120 days is ample, and I think it also gives an abundance of time in which to find him. If he cannot be found ; if he is not accessible or available, it cannot matter much to him when the claim for compensation is to be sent in. In either case it will avoid the complication and delay attendant on having all these claims coming in at different times. It fixes one day for commencing the work, and enables that amount of despatch to be carried out in arriving at the question of compensation which we are anxious to obtain. At the same time I do not think that any injustice is done to the owner of the land. I ask your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> if I may do so, as to the best way of putting this amendment. I propose to put it as a -new clause before clause 12. </para>

                    <para>- I withdrew my amendment because the Vice-President of the Executive Council has really met me in the objection that I urged. The only difference between what I required and what the honorable and learned senator gives is that the interested parties are not to be served. Ample provision is made, however, for bringing the matter home to the knowledge of the persons most concerned, so that I think my requirement may be dispensed with. May 1 point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor,</inline> as he means this to exhaust two methods of bringing home to the knowledge of the owners the publication of the notice, that he ought to add after the word "be," line 4,, in sub-clause (2), the words, "served upon his registered attorney, or if there be none then." We know that persons leaving the country do register their attorneys, and therefore the}- could be served with notice. </para>

SenatorO'Connor, however, might possibly make his amendment . clearer in sub-clause (2). He might make it more evident that a copy of this notification must be left with the occupier,, if he inserted after the word "found" the words "or if such registered letter shall not have been delivered." Sub-clause (1) contemplates discovery of the owner in two ways - personally or by registered letter. I do not think that in the second clause the use of the word "found " completely includes personal discovery, or such discovery as is implied in the delivery and receipt of a registered letter. I have no desire to move this amendment, but the insertion of the words I have mentioned would more completely cover the meaning of sub-clause (1). </para>

                    <para>- So far as the experience of Victoria is concerned, the amendment which the Vice-President of the Executive Council has submitted, will be most ample and effective. There are very few allotments of land on a line of railway or in a district the owners of which are not known. Where they -are not known, the allotments are generally- small and insignificant. Let us take a case where land has been cut up into a number of small allotments. The <inline font-style="italic">greater number</inline> of the owners of these allotments are identifiable and observable with notice. The' municipal council makes diligent inquiry, and if after that exhaustive inquiry it cannot find the owner of a piece of land, the notice is placed upon it, and that is treated by the court as if notice had been served on the man himself. The municipal council can then levy upon the land, and actually lease it for a term of years until the rates upon it have been paid. That is a commonsense way of dealing with the difficulty. In Victoria we have had much experience in the cutting up of land, and I can assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> that this system has proved most efficacious. </para>

                    <para>- Senate. O'Connor has met very fairly the objection taken by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harney.</inline> I am almost inclined to think he has gone too far in giving 120 days notice. The honorable and learned senator might have simplified the work of the Government by having a more comprehensive definition of the word "owner.' <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor's</inline> proposal is open to what he pointed out last week was the objection to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harney's</inline> proposal. He has put upon the Government the making of the inquiry as to who and where the owner is. As Ave have a municipal roll, and as most of the States where a land tax is levied have a national roll, the Government would be perfectly right in providing that the "owner" shall be the person named in the municipal or national roll. It would thus avoid the necessity of making inquiries. It is hardly fair to cast upon the Minister, who is to administer this Act, the duty of inquiring all over the place for the owner of a piece of land. </para>

                    <para>- I think the Vice-President of the Executive Council has very fairly met the objection raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harney.</inline> The objection was that the owner of the land was not bound to receive the notice under the clause as it stood if that notice was only published in the <inline font-style="italic">Government Gazette.</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> argued that that objection would only apply to very few cases, but we do not want to do an injustice under any circumstances to any individual. I think the honorable and learned gentleman has met us in every way. He has apparently taken a clause from the present Victorian Act, which is also the law in South Australia, and has worked exceedingly well there. Apparently, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir William</inline> Zeal, it has worked equally well in Victoria. The honorable and learned gentleman has gone quite as far as is necessary in providing for the service of notice on the owners of land. When I argued the question last week I did not intend to imply that the Government should give notice to any one that might have some claim in an estate. All that I asked was that as far as possible notice should be given to the owner. With reference to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons'</inline> proposal I think it is already covered by the words of the clause. Surely it is part of the diligent inquiry. 0 </para>

                        <para>- I would point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> that really there is no danger of any ' difficulty or injustice arising in the direction he has indicated,, because in the first sub-clause, it is provided that the owner must be served with notice, either personally or by registered letter. If he cannot with reasonable diligence be found then a registered letter will be posted to, him. I presume that a registered letter would not be posted to him unless he was known. Then it appears to me that that being so sub-clause (2) comes in. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline>
                    did not exactly follow me. In clause 1, two methods of discovery are provided - (1) ordinary personal discovery and (2) discovery by means of a registered letter, if that letter is delivered. If he receives it the man is discovered through its agency. Sub-clause (2) only comes as a necessary complement to sub-clause (1), because it refers again to the question of discovery, and says that a copy of the notification shall be left with the occupier of the land, if the owner is absent from the Commonwealth, "or cannot after diligent inquiry be found." That might be meant. to apply simply to personal service. We ought to cover the chance of his being found by the receipt of a registered letter.

                    (Western Australia). - What I should like to point out is that the amendment suggested by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline>
                    is really in favour of the Government and of easy administration. Honorable senators will see at once that sub-clause (1) provides that the owner is to be notified by personal service or by registered letter. The second sub-clause deals with cases where that notification cannot be effective. It is only to the ease of the department to exclude the two means by which we provide for the notification before we allow to be done what is provided for in subclause (2).

But before we do something else it is necessary that we should exclude what should have been done before. By the clause as it stands we merely exclude the personal service, and if we have tried to serve him by registered letter and have not been able to do so, we cannot take advantage of the second sub-clause. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> wishes to provide that we shall be able to attempt to serve personally or by registered letter, and shall then be able to take advantage of sub-clause (2). </para>

                    (Tasmania). - I am very glad that the Vice-President of the Executive Council proposes to .accept this amendment, but seeing that we are seriously engaged in legislation, I rise to ask him whether it would not have been wise to insert the words I have suggested? As he has raised a difficulty about proof of a registered letter being delivered, I want the honorable senator to be sure that he is meeting that difficulty in the amendment.

                        <para>- I think the amendment proposed will meet the difficulty. By using the word " delivered " the difficulty would be raised, but when we say "if service by registered letter cannot be effected," it simply means that a man cannot be found, and there is no use trying to deliver a letter to him. </para>

                    <para>- Shortly, this clause provides that the Attorney-General shall forward a report to the Minister ; the Minister shall thereupon consider the case, and if he considers that no <inline font-style="italic">prima</inline><inline font-style="italic">facie</inline> case has been made out there is an end to the matter, and it is only where he considers that a <inline font-style="italic">prima</inline><inline font-style="italic">facie</inline> case has been made out that there is a valuation if the parties do not agree. The necessity for the amendment I intend to move is shown in clause 14. Honorable senators will see that the effect of the two clauses is that the Minister shall have it in his power to say whether a <inline font-style="italic">prima</inline><inline font-style="italic">facie</inline> case has been made out; if he says that there has been no <inline font-style="italic">prima</inline><inline font-style="italic">facie</inline> case made out it goes to arbitration, then compensation is sought to be fixed, and if the parties cannot agree an action lies. So, therefore, whether a person can ultimately vindicate his right is dependent entirely on the will of the Minister, because the Minister may say, " I consider that no <inline font-style="italic">primâ facie</inline> case for compensation has been made out," and if he does there is no right o action in the person. Clearly, that is, I think, a mistake in the drafting. It could never have been intended that the mere opinion of the Minister as to whether the persons had any right to compensation was to end the matter. I move - </para>

With a complicated property, and with, perhaps, several joint owners to consult, I can understand that a month might be too short a time within which to permit of an agreement being arrived at. If an agreement can be arrived at within a month so much the better, but is it well to tie the thing down in that way? </para>

                        will see that in clause 14 there is nothing to compel the claimant to institute the proceedings within the 90 days. He cannot institute them until after the expiration of 90 days. If within that time the claimant and the Minister do not agree as to the amount of compensation, the claimant may then institute proceedings; but, suppose that period has expired, he may then delay his proceedings as long as he likes.

                        <para>- In some Lands Clauses Acts I am inclined to think that the provisions relating to costs are not so favorable to the Crown as is this clause. I caii' quite understand that in some cases the land-owner may consider, and his . neighbours may consider also, that he has a good reason for disputing the amount offered to him. Supposing the Judge were likewise of that opinion, he might like to order each party to pay his own costs. I suggest to the Minister that he should put in the clause the words - "unless the Judge otherwise orders." I dare say that out of every 50 cases there may be an exception to the rule, but here we take away from the Judge the discretion which should be given to him. No one knows better than lawyers that costs are generally left to the Judge. It is impossible to lay down a hard-and-fast rule. Every case must stand on its own merits. I can understand an owner bringing an action, and not taking the amount awarded to him by the arbitrator, and his friends thinking that he had good reason for not accepting that valuation. But I doubt "whether the proposal of the Bill, permitting the parties to apply for a new trial, is the correct course. Here, again, I would point out that we are not dealing with arbitrators, who constantly make mistakes in law, who sometimes do not admit evidence when it is tendered, and in other respects admit evidence which is not really evidence. Therefore, in such cases there may sometimes very well be a motion to set aside the award. But here we are dealing with a skilled Justice of the High Court. Yet the clause says that after the matter is dealt with there may be a new trial. </para>

                        <para>- It appears to me to be a new trial before a Judge sitting without a jury. After the evidence has been heard by a skilled Judge sitting with out a jury it is a wrong thing to throw doubt upon this tribunal. It is all a matter of opinion. The land-owner will bring before the Judge the best evidence he can produce that his land is worth so much more than the Government is willing to pay for it, whilst the Commonwealth will bring forward the best evidence it can get to show that the land is not worth so much. And when, say £1,000 is awarded, what is the use of having a new trial because the owner thinks he should receive £1,200 ? It seems to me that the provision is not consistent with the rest of the Bill. </para>

The bulk of cases will be cases where questions of law arise. They may arise in a variety of ways - through evidence having been wrongly admitted, or the principle of assessment having been wrong. It may be difficult to decide on what principle the assessment should be made. Surely the claimant should go to the highest tribunal to settle such a question of law? </para>

                        <para>- No. I say that if it is a question of fact only the Full Court would never interfere, whether as to the amount or the basis of the calculation unless there was something demonstrably wrong about it ; but if the amount depended upon some wrong principle of assessment the court would, and ought to, interfere. By leaving the words of the clause as they are, according to the practice of the High Court, I think the honorable and learned senator will find that the court will only interfere where there is a question of law involved, or where the facts have been so dealt with that no reasonable man could come to the decision arrived at. With regard to the question of costs, this clause is advisedly drafted in its present shape following a great number of similar Acts. For this reason : there ought not to be any encouragement to bring actions, and there should be every compulsion reasonably exerted to make people come to an agreement. A man who takes an action against the Crown ought to know, and the Crown ought to know if it disputes a claim against a land-owner, that the costs will be against the party who has improperly made the claim, or who ought not to have resisted the claim. The clause makes the parties do their best to come to a settlement. </para>

                        <para>- No ; the honorable and learned senator's suggestion would put the claimant or the Government - whoever was in the wrong - in the position of being able to resist a claim properly made, knowing that they would escape costs in that way. ' It is very much better . to have a provision which will prevent people disputing claims or making them when there is no ground for them, whether the party doing so be the land-owner or the Commonwealth Government. We all know that in a great many of these cases it is a matter of " heads I win and tails you lose." A man may enter into long litigation with the Commonwealth, and when the end of it is reached he may not be able to pay any costs at all. I want to discourage people from bringing actions when there is no real ground for them. On the other hand, the clause puts an obligation upon the Commonwealth officer, who is responsible to see that the valuation made is a fair one, that he can stand by under the penalty of the Government being made to pay the costs if the Commonwealth is wrong. Similar .provisions to this have worked very well for a number of years in other States. If the departure is made which the honorable and learned senator suggests, encouragement will be given to people to bring claims against the Commonwealth, and the officers of the Commonwealth will be encouraged not to be as careful as they ought to be in making their valuations. </para>

                    <para>- I regret that I cannot agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> with respect to the payment of costs. I do not think' we can take as a criterion of the necessity of this provision what has been the practice in the various States under the Lands Clauses Acts, or any modification of those Acts that any of the States may have chosen to adopt in the past. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> has pointed out very clearly that there is a very grave distinction between the class of cases- and the manner in which they are to be determined under this Bill, and the class of cases" that have come up for consideration and the method of determining them in the past under the various Lands Clauses Acts of the several States. In the States cases we have had arbitrators. Our experience, at least in the case of those States who 1 have modelled their law upon the Land' Clauses Consolidation Acts of Great Britain, has been that where it has been necessary to resume land for public pur-' poses the land owner simply receives a notification from the public authority that ' a certain portion of his land is to be taken ' by the Government or by the particular body intrusted with statutory powers by the Parliament of the States. He is asked to notify whatever amount is due to him, not only for the acquisition of his land, but for the damage arising to the rest of his' property through any severance that is necessary. The owner makes an assessment accordingly; and we know that in every case the' man is exceedingly charitable to himself,; Where £500 would have paid him, he is' careful to ask for £2,000. The Government' then appoint their evaluators to determine what shall be paid to him, and the valuators perhaps certify that £600 is ample' compensation. The individual is tendered £600, and perhaps he refuses to take' less than £2,500. The matter then goes to arbitration. By whose compulsion does' such a matter go to arbitration? Suppose the arbitrators determine that the amount the man is entitled to is '£650. Is it not obvious that the arbitration is not due to the action of . the Government but to the obstinacy and greed of the private individual who claims £2,500, when the Government offers him £650? Yet according to the sections of the Acts from which this clause has been modelled, if only a shilling more was awarded to the owner, he would be entitled to his costs. Here we have adopted different procedure. We have gone away from the old rut, and have introduced a Justice of the High Court sitting without a jury, with power to determine the amount of compensation to be awarded to the individual whose property is to be acquired for public purposes. I think we should have full confidence in the gentlemen who are to be appointed to the high and responsible positions of Judges of the High Court of Australia. We should surely endow them with a discretion such as is intrusted to ' the Justices of the several State Courts, no matter what may be their jurisdiction, high or low. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> will recognise that this is new procedure. It is a departure from the procedure we have hitherto had in the States by which we invested a man's next door neighbour, perhaps, with the power of determining the compensation to be awarded to him in connexion with the acquisition of his land ; next door neighbour knowing when he gave his award that perhaps on a future occasion the claimant would be acting in a similar capacity towards land of his. When a man's property is to be acquired under the provisions of this measure, he is notified that perhaps the Government are prepared to give him £750. He may absolutely refuse it, and may then be offered £800. He may still refuse, and may be disposed to take nothing less than£2,000,knowingfullwell that under the rigid statutory provisions of this measure, if he can succeed in getting a shilling more than was offered him, the Government will have to pay the whole of the costs. I am not speaking merely in a theoretical sense. I have had some experience in cases of the kind, and I know exactly what is the attitude of some people towards the Government. In nearly all these cases the land-owners consistently regard the Government as a milch cow, especially where such provisions are in operation as exist in the old country. But we have deviated from that principle, and have intrusted to the highest judicial authority, to a man who is capable of considering the whole circumstances, the power of making an award. We should give to the Judge under those circumstances a certain amount of discretion, which, after all, does not exceed the ordinary limits of the powers with which the Judges of certain of our civil courts of inferior jurisdiction are intrusted. I believe the suggestion thrown out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline> which is dictated by past experience, ought to be adopted, and that we should invest the justices of the High Court with that little amount of discretion which is given to justices in any part of" the British Empire. We should put into the clause the words " unless otherwise ordered." If the justice recognises that the claimant has been awarded an amount disproportionate to what he is entitled to, he may give to him not merely the amount he should receive, but his costs. But where the man has obstinately held out against what the Crown has offered him, and the arbitrators have offered him something that is obviously very little different from, what he is entitled to, the justice should have the power of saying - "Well, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Proprietor, Mr. Owner, Mr. Claimant"</inline> - or whatever he may be - " you have involved the Government in these proceedings, and when £3,750 was offered to you, it has been found that you are only entitled to £3,800. As the difference is so small we consider that each party should pay its own costs." This is a discretion which we can very well intrust to the justices of such a tribunal as we hope to have erected in Australia before very long. I trust that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> will see his way clear to accept an amendment of the character suggested. It does not in vital terms alter the clause at all ; but simply carries out a principle we recognise in connexion with all our tribunals throughout the Empire. It does not violate the rights of any individual who comes before , the court to seek redress, simply because he has been forced to come there by the action of the Government. </para>

                <para>SenatorO'CONNOR. - I think there is a great deal in what has been pointed out in regard to the old condition of things under which these clauses were originally framed, and the present condition ; but it appears to me that there will be a sufficient deterrent against bringing these actions lightly, if the clause is left as it is, giving at end of it a discretion to the Judge. The Judge will see that the intention of the statute is that, unless there are certain substantial circumstances to the contrary, the costs shall follow the rule set out in the statute. The honorable and learned senator will recognise that, as we have amended the last portion of the clause, an amendment such as I have suggested cannot be made now, but I will undertake to recommit the clause, and alter it in the way I have mentioned. </para>

                    <para>- I trust the committee will not agree to the suggestion made by various senators and approved of by the Vice-President of the Executive Council. I would like to point out that even as the clause now stands it is not an exact transcript of the New South Wales Act, which, if I mistake not, provides that where the amount awarded is greater than the valuation notified to the claimant, he is to be given his costs. This clause has departed from the principle apparently laid down in the New South Wales Act. Section 99 of the New South Wales Act is the one which deals with the subject, and it says - </para>

                <para>If the verdict in any action of compensation brought, under the provisions of this division of this Act is for <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> sum equal to or less than the amount of valuation notified to the claimant, such claimant shall pay the costs of such action. </para>
                <para class="block">I see I was under a misapprehension with respect to the New South Wales provision. I was under the impression it was the other way about. It must be remembered that in this case we are taking a man's land from him against his consent, because if he is willing to deal with the Government for the land, there will be no action at all. It will then simply resolve itself into an agreement as to the amount to be paid, but where the Government and the owner are unable to agree upon the amount to be paid, and the Government are exercising its powers under this Bill for the purpose of acquiring his land, the claimant is entitled to some more consideration than a plaintiff in an ordinary action. </para>

If the position of the claimant in the matter of costs is to be entirely regulated by the discretion of the Judge we are introducing an unknown quantity. </para>

                        <para>- Why should we trust the Judges unless there is an absolute necessity for it. Why not trust the Judges in everything in the same way. A plaintiff may go into court and get £20,000 damages, and it might be left to the discretion of the Judge, and be in the Judge's power to say that he shall not have a penny of costs. I say that is contrary to the principles of natural justice and equity. I am arguing now in favour of the clause as it stands, I found I made a mistake about the New South Wales statute. I do not see any honesty or fairness in putting in a provision that notwithstanding the fact that the clause is in accordance with all previous legislation, the Judge shall say whether a man shall get costs or not. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, there is a jury there, and it is possible that a jury may make a mistake, where a Judge would not make a mistake. But where a jury give a claimant a larger amount against the Crown than was first offered to him, he gets costs according to the verdict which the jury give. But in this case another tribunal is appointed to deal with the matter ; a Judge hears the whole of the evidence, and deals with the whole matter himself. He may say that a man is entitled to so much money, and that costs shall abide the event whatever it may be. That is, as I think, it should be, and it should not be left to the discretion of a Judge in a case of this kind, to say that a man shall not get costs where he has practically won his' case. Where the Government are taking a man's property away from him, whether he likes it or not, he is entitled to a reasonable amount of consideration, at any rate. </para>

As the clause stands he would not get costs, but, as it is proposed to amend it, it will still be in the power of the Judge to say - " You shall have costs, although I have only awarded you 500." Is it likely that any Judge would do that? Is it at all likely that Judge will say to a' man - " You are entitled to a smaller amount than you could have got originally, and though you could have got a bigger amount originally, and I now give you a smaller amount, I will give you costs in order to build it up a little more"? </para>

                        <para>- I will give the honorable and learned senator that argument in, that it is only in an exceptional case ; but is it not still very much better that a man should know exactly what his position is so far as the question of costs is concerned. I am aware that it is not possible for men to know everything that will result from a law case, but I think it is well that every man who is compelled to go into court to maintain his rights should know that if he substantially wins his case he will not be deprived of his costs. This may to some senators seem an extraordinary idea to hold, but to that all I can say is that the idea on the other side appears more extraordinary to me, because I recognise the fact that the Government themselves deliberately and with a full knowledge of the tribunal they were creating included in the Bill a clause, which is substantially what I am arguing; for now, and it is only because of certain statements which have been made that they are prepared to depart from its principle. </para>

                        <para>- I hope the; honorable and learned senator will keep an. open mind on other matters, but I am. pointing out that what I am arguing for is' the clause that the Government have themselves placed before the Senate. The Government have found that a majority, of honorable senators are opposed to what they have proposed, ' and they are willing now to abandon the position they took up in -the first instance. I do not say improperly. They may have been persuaded by the arguments adduced in this Chamber to depart from their original proposal. If the Government see fit I cannot prevent them from recommitting the clause, but, although what I have been contending for does not commend itself to the majority of honorable senators, it still appears to me to be fair and equitable. I' do not see why, in a matter of this kind, we should leave any thing to the discretion of -the Judge, unless it is absolutely necessary. I say that with. all respect to the judiciary, and with all respect to the Judges now on the bench, or to those who may occupy the bench in future/. I believe every man who goes there will be actuated by the earnest desire to do what is-, right and proper. Still Judges sometimes; take peculiar notions into their heads, and sometimes make mistakes ; and if we can lay down a particular line of action to be followed I think it is very much better that we should do so, so long as we satisfy ourselves that it is fair and just. </para>

                    (Western Australia). - I am sure that Senators Gould and Keating will excuse me for saying that they have delivered very long speeches, and throughout those speeches have clearly shown that they are not very well up in the exact practice in these matters. Whatever its deficiencies in other respects, I think I can say, with the approval of every legal member of the Senate, that there is nothing at all unusual or unnatural in this clause. The suggestion made by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline>
                    was not that the - clause was in itself contrary to the ordinary legal rule, but that in this particular case we could improve upon the ordinary rule. The ordinary rule is, as this clause. says, that if the judgment in any action is for a sum equal to or less than the amount of the valuation notified to the claimant, the claimant shall pay the costs of the action.What does that mean ? Clause 13 says that after the Government have fixed the amount of the compensation they shall inform the claimant of the amount. He can take it or leave it. If he leaves it and brings an action he does so at his own peril. The court will decide the matter if an action is taken, and if the Judge upon his calculation thinks the claimant ought to get more than the notified value, h will say he was right in bringing his action and he will give him costs ; but if the Judge comes to the conclusion that he ought not to get more, or that he ought to get less than he was originally offered, he will say he was a very foolish man to bring his action and he will not give him costs.

It applies to the land all through, in the first instance with respect to the land taken itself, and in the other cases referred to to the value taking into account the damage by severance, or by the exercise of the statutory powers by the Minister injuriously affecting the land. I think it clearly means the land in reference to these heads of value which are stated. </para>

                <para>SenatorDOBSON (Tasmania).- I wish to ask the honorable and learned senator a question which was asked him before, as to whether he is quite sure "that, under clause 17, the Judge trying the matter may give a certain percentage for compulsory sale. I think the honorable senator told us before that the ordinary rule would be followed, but it occurred to me that, as the clause states exactly what a Judge shall allow for compensation and that it shall be the value of the land, estate, or interest of the claimant on the 1st day of January last preceding the date of acquisition, it is possible that a percentage for compulsory sale may not be allowed. I am asking whether the clause is not so worded as to exclude the Judge from giving the ordinary 10 per cent. margin? </para>

If a mistake is made, it is not fair to make it against the' owner whose land is compulsorily taken, and it is the practice often to add from 5 per cent. up to, I believe, 25 per cent. I would like the Minister to be quite satisfied that clause 17 allows that practice to be continued. </para>

                        <para>- Under exactly similar provisions in all the States it has been constantly the practice of the court to allow this 10 per cent., and it has always expressly been put upon this ground : There is no legal right to it, but by the ordinary principle of the administration of justice where a man's land is taken, it is always supposed that the value shall not be weighed in golden scales. We are not to be particular in such matters about trifles, and it is a fair thing where a man's land is taken to allow him a little over the actual value. We cannot restrict a Judge in dealing with this matter, and if we say nothing about this he will probably come to a conclusion that the whole value of the land is a certain amount, and he will assess it at so much. We cannot prevent him from dealing liberally - with a claimant in a case where his land is taken. The question has been raised in many cases in New South Wales, I know, and it has always been held there that it is the usual practice to direct juries in that way under an exactly similar section.. These cases will be tried according to the practice of the High Court, and that practice will be followed. There is a difficulty about putting it in so many words in the clause. There may be cases in which, although a man's land is compulsorily taken, nothing ought to be allowed for a forced sale. Supposing, for instance, that it really has not been a forced sale, that he has been very anxious to get rid of the land. He has had plenty of time to get rid of it, at a value which, it is proved, is the highest possible value he can expect to obtain. There may be cases of that sort in which the court would value rigidly according to exact evidence. </para>

                        <para>- I quite agree that it is a forced sale. The question is -whether a man suffers any damage by that forced sale. I know that a great many persons gain by a forced . sale. In all the States there must be numerous pieces of land in the case of which the best thing that could possibly happen to the owners would be for the Government to resume. I should not think that they would claim anything or be entitled to anything for a forced sale. If we leave the thing in the elastic way in which it is, the Judge, if he thinks there has been any damage by a forced sale, will allow it in his ordinary estimate of damages, but if there has been nothing he will not allow it. I think it is very much better to leave it as it is. It always has been left to the discretion of the Judge in each case, and especially so where we have these cases tried by the Judge himself. </para>

                    (Tasmania).- It has just struck me that I did not make the most of my point, and I apologize for not doing so. In almost all the States except Tasmania there is an unimproved capital value tax. Therefore we have no Government or national value of the land. In Tasmania we have a land tax on the total value of the land, and one can turn up a roll and see the value of every bit of land in the island, assessed by Government valuers, with the right of appeal on behalf of the land-owners, and the land is taxed a halfpenny in the pound on that capital value.

                        <para>- Yes, and the reason why this margin is allowed is that the compulsory taking may do an intangible wrong - a wrong which can never be reduced into words or into legal tests for getting compensation. May I add that the effect, in my opinion, of fixing anything like 10 per cent. would be that then the 10 per cent. would absolutely go as a matter of law. I move - </para>

                <para class="block">I am glad to say that this is not purely a legal amendment. It is one which ought to appeal to laymen, perhaps more than it does to lawyers. It is one upon which I have not formed very strong views, but I think it "would be improper if the Bill were allowed to go through without a discussion as to whether the proviso should be retained. Put into ordinary laymen's English, the proviso means this : Where a public work is put up, it may have the effect - in most cases it will have the effect - of greatly enhancing the value of the land in the locality. The clause says that if for the public work we take some person's land, we at the same time are to deprive him of the benefit he would derive as a resident of the locality from the public work. Now, looked at from his point of view alone, that seems exceedingly fair, because it comes to this : The Government take land at £500, and the work for which it is taken advantages the owner to the extent of £1,000. After the work is done he can sell his land for £1,000 more than before it was done. Therefore, it is. only fair looking at it solely in his case to say " this work has deprived you of £500 worth of land, but it has added £1,000 to your holding, therefore, it has done you no harm." The Bill says that that subtraction should be made, but we have to remember that there is another view of it. His neighbours from whom no land has been taken have got the full benefit of the enhancement. Why should he be deprived of it? Paragraph (A) says the intention is to substitute for the land taken a claim for compensation, but the Bill says " we do not substitute for the land its value, we substitute its value minus the benefit you share in as living in that neighbourhood. Everybody else gets his land plus a share of the benefit. You get the equivalent of your land minus your share of the benefit." Supposing that three owners A, B, and C have each a property which is benefited by the work to the extent of £1,000. Now, A, B and C, as between themselves, have no greater reason to be penalized than the other. A, B and. C have their lands benefited by £1,000 each by the work, but if a corner of A's land is taken he is to be deprived of that £1,000, at all events to the extent of the value of the land taken. I want honorable senators to realize what it comes to. There are three parallel pieces of ground and the effect of a railway running along in a certain direction is to make each piece of ground worth £1,000 more. It takes off a corner of A's land, and what happens ? A loses the £1,000 because we deprive him of a corner of his land, but B and C get £1,000 each and their land. Is that fair ; is it equitable? </para>

Let me bring home to the minds of honorable senators a view which puts the injustice very much more clearly. Take the work completed, take the enhancement given to the land of A, B, and C. Should A, B, or C get less money because the Government take his land than what he would get if a private proprietor were to take it ?' But put up that railway and let a private proprietor take a £1,000 worth of A's land, and he has to give £1,000. Let the Government take £1,000 worth of- his land, and they have to give him nothing. Is that fair ? </para>

                        <para>- With all respect it is not begging the question. The point I want to bring home is that clause 8 says that the Government take the corner of A's land and put down £1,000 compensation, which it is worth in the open market. Is that any reason why he should not get the benefit of the advantage to the neighbourhood the same as anybody else gets ? With B and C whose lands do not touch at all we leave them the land, but we give them the benefit. But with A we touch his land. We are not supposed, according to the Bill, to deprive him of -anything, but we are supposed to substitute foi" broad acres pounds, shillings, and pence. Do so ; give him the pounds, shillings, and pence which stand' for his broad acres, but give him the tangible benefit of the enhancement given to the whole neighbourhood. ' </para>

                        <para>- What do we say"? We admit to a man - "We are depriving you of £1,000 worth of land," but we say though we deprive you of £1,000 worth of land, though, on our own showing, we ought to pay down 1,000 solid sovereigns, still, the effect of that deprivation gives you an indirect advantage by being in the neighbourhood, and we shall subtract that indirect advantage from the sovereigns we ought to give you." If we are going to do that, why not have regard to the opposite process ? If the construction of the public work will do him an intangible injury by destroying the neighbourhood, are we going to give him compensation for it ? Nothing in the Bill says so.' Supposing the proposal is to put up a fever hospital, and we ask for 20 acres of his land for the purpose. What shall we do ? We shall compensate him for the land, no doubt, according to the market value. But shall we also give him an amount of compensation which is equivalent for the fall in the neighbourhood which the erection of the fever hospital may create ? If ' we are going to deduct from him the increment, we should add to him the decrement in the value of the land. I can well understand the fears- of persons who would argue that all this increment ought to be a matter for the State. I am not going to say whether that is right or wrong. But I submit that if the State is going to take the increment, let it take it impartially from all. Let it not take it from one as it does here. If it is intended to say, though we have taken this man's land, he has got his participation in the benefit we have done the neighbourhood, therefore we shall give him no money, I say deduct from all persons something which is equivalent to their participation in the benefit which is derived from the public work. </para>

                        <para>- That may be. At the present moment - I do not say and will not say whether I shall advocate it or not - I am not going into that great question of land nationalization. I am only looking to this aspect : Deal relatively justice to all parties, and do not by the public work give one person the benefit which the whole neighbourhood acquires, and deprive another person of that benefit together with his land. The first time this question came to be discussed, so far as I can learn, was in 1867 in'a case in court. It was the case of Eagel against the Charing Cross Railway Company, reported in the Law Reports, 2 Common Pleas. The proviso to this clause, I may mention, does not appear in the English Act. The section in that Act is exactly the same as this clause with the proviso blotted out. A case came on for arbitration for the assessment of value in these circumstances : There was a person deprived by the public works of an easement to light. The arbitrator found that that deprivation ought to be valued at JE600 odd, but he also said at the end of his report - " I find that the result of the public work is to add to the market value of the house in question £1,000." This finding came up for review before the Judges. It was argued by counsel on behalf of the pro- . rooters of the work, which would be equivalent to the Government here, that the person ought not to get £600 for this reason : that although on the one hand he had lost, on the other he had gained £1,000. What did the Judges order in that case? " What," they said, "have we to do with this man's participation in a good that was common to the whole neighbourhood ? All we have to see is that he receives an equivalent in sovereigns for the wrong done to him in destroying his easement." </para>

Act, and in the case of <inline font-style="italic">Harding</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">The Board of Land and Works,</inline> 11 Appeal Cases, page 208, the decision of the Chief Justice of Victoria caine before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. My honorable and learned friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor,</inline> if he takes the trouble to read that case, will be able to discern a good deal .between the lines, as I have done. The Chief Justice of Victoria read 'the proviso as undoubtedly it only can be read, that the person whose land was taken was to derive no benefit from the carrying out _ of the public work. The Privy Council Judges deprived the section of the interpretation which the Chief Justice gave to it, and gave a decision to this effect : " We do not hold that this section deprives a person of his share of the benefits that accrue to the locality as against what represents the value of the land taken, but we will construe it to mean that the intangible benefit is to be set off against the intangible loss he suffers by reason of severance." </para>

                    <para>Their Lordships have had great difficulty in coming to a conclusion as to what was the intention of the Legislature in the latter part of this section. They cannot agree with the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court when he says that the policy of the last part of the section is obviously to enable the Government in the construction of railways or other expensive works, to recover by way of set-off to the compensation for land taken or injuriously affected a deduction for benefits resulting to the land-owner from the formation of the particular work.' He does not seem to have considered that there would be lands adjacent to the railway which would be enhanced in value by the making of it, but no part of which might be taken by the board. " The owners' of these might be equally benefited with the owners of land taken, or even more so, and would lose nothing, whilst the latter might lose the whole value of their land that was taken. If this was the intention it might have been clearly expressed. </para>

                <para class="block">That is the opinion of the Privy Council concerning this proviso, and I hope that the committee will agree that I am not wrong in reading it. Whatever it may be worth, the Senate 'of Australia ought not to be above considering the opinion of the Privy Council in regard to such a matter. The view I have formed with regard to the matter is, that to do all-round justice, we need something in the nature of a Betterment Act. But that, I think, is impracticable at present, and until it becomes practicable we ought to treat all persons in the neighbourhood on a like footing, and ought not to say that where land is taken we will deprive the .owner of that which we give to every one else in the same neighbourhood whose land we do not take. Clause 8 expresses an untruth when it says that the moment the Governor-General in Council notifies that the land is to be taken, and it is published in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette,</inline> a claim for compensation is substituted for the land so taken. I say give effect to that, and place down upon the corner of the land you take the sovereigns that are its equivalent. When you have done that your work is done. Whatever benefit accrues to the neighbourhood the owner of the land is entitled to as much as the owners of the land that is not taken. I did not introduce this matter with a view of bringing up any old-fashioned debating society arguments such as we sometimes hear. Nothing of the kind. I did it in an entirely practical spirit. It seems to me, as a person whose mind is habituated to the principles of justice as they are dealt out in the courts, that when an Act of Parliament perpetuates the principle that no more than the coin, in so many sovereigns, which land is worth, shall be paid to the owner of it, then the person whose land is coined into sovereigns should be put in no different position than the person whose land is not so taken. That is the simple way of putting it. If I and two of my honorable friends in this committee have land, and a railway is to pass through the vicinity, are any of us to be put in this position : We may be told at first that the railway will not go through or touch our lands. We should all be very jubilant with regard to that assurance, feeling that we should all be richer by perhaps £500, or perhaps £1,000. Then, say, is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> to be suddenly deprived of his jubilation because the railway takes a turn through his land ? Why should he be put in a worse position than, say, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> and myself? The turn the railway takes will benefit our land just as much as it will benefit the land of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> in the case I am supposing. But in the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould,</inline> the Government give him sovereigns for his land, but deduct something from what he should receive on account of the extra value given to the rest of his land, which extra value <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> and myself would also receive, though nothing is deducted from us. I hope the committee will excuse me if I have dwelt upon this question at some length. I think it is well worthy of discussion. I am not for a moment arguing that it is not a fair thing to do this, if we only look to the individual whose land is taken. I think the really equitable doctrine is the socialistic doctrine of betterment. But that is not what I am arguing' about at the present time. Until we arrive at that state of perfection in which we can do something in the way of adopting the principle of betterment, let every one stand on the same basis, and do not, in the name of all that is reasonable, put the man who has sovereigns instead of acres in a worse position than the man who retains the 'acres and has not had them converted into sovereigns. </para>

                        <para>- I understood that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harney</inline> proposed to strike out the whole proviso. Listening to his arguments, however, they appeared to be unanswerable, not only in favour of the retention of the proviso in question, but also in favour of the addition of another entirely in favour of the general principle of betterment. It appears to me that the honorable senator's argument is simply this : that the benefit conferred upon the land of one man is equivalent to the benefit conferred upon that of another.The honorable and learned senator illustrated his argument by the case of, say, A, B and C, and he argued that an injustice was done to A because some benefit was conferred upon B and C. That is equivalent to saying that if the State does something for the benefit of one man, it does an injustice to others-. If that were so, we should not pass any laws at all. Whatever laws we passed will benefit some persons. Take the Tariff. The passing of the Tariff will confer a benefit upon some merchants who, in anticipation of its provisions, have taken goods out of bond and stored them in their warehouses. I do not know a law that Parliament could pass that would not confer a benefit on some one. But are we to refrain from passing laws because of that ? Legislation would never be made at all if it were to be held that the benefit conferred upon one must be conferred all round. </para>

                        <para>- We have tried this principle in New South Wales, and although I am free to admit that many difficulties attending the general application of it are manifest, we have no reason for believing that it has been an absolute failure, 'whilst in many instances in the construction of railways we have found benefits resulting from it. Suppose it was proposed to construct a railway to Western Australia, what a monstrous position it would be for the owners of some of those sandy wastes - for they are little better, if my honorable friends from South Australia will allow me to say so - to make claims for compensation on account of their land being taken. </para>

                    <para>- In New- South Wales we passed what is called the Moore-street Resumption Act, by which a street adjoining the General Post-office was widened. The persons whose land was taken away were paid for it, but the whole neighbourhood was taxed, according to what is known as the betterment principle. I was so struck with the force of the argument of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harney</inline> that I suggested to him that after the word " shall " in this clause it might be well to insert the words " so soon as a betterment tax is enacted." I am not regarded by some persons as being very radical, but I think there are strong arguments in favour of the Government having the unearned increment. I shall support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harney's</inline> proposal if the matter goes to a division. </para>

We are dealing here with a certain proposition to give compensation to somebody, and we are also taking as a set-off against that compensation any benefit that he may receive. That is all that this clause deals, with. This Bill is not a betterment Bill, and I only hope that senators who are so frightened of conferring favour upon one or two individuals, and not conferring favour to the same ' extent upon everybody else, will support a Bill when it is brought down for the purpose of securing to the Commonwealth by some form of taxation, or in some other way, the real benefit of improvements, the people of the Commonwealth make themselves. Why not go on now and pass the clause dealing with the specific question that is before us, and, as soon as every honorable senator has made up his mind to introduce a measure which will provide that every individual who may be benefited by any federal improvement shall pay something for that, we can argue it out, and we can impose such taxation or rates upon them as will give the benefit to the people to whom it rightly belongs <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> As the question stands now, we are dealing with one party we compensate, and let us stick to that at the present time. Let us give him fair compensation, but let us see that the Commonwealth is not going to be robbed. One of the arguments <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harney</inline> has used was so ridiculous that I am almost ashamed to refer to it. . It is that because this law does not exist in Western Australia- </para>

                        <para>- They are useful guides; and that is exactly the reason why I am going in the opposite direction to the honorable and learned senator, because I know that in England the public have been robbed, times out of number, for the purpose of putting money into the pockets of private landowners. I know also that in Western Australia the same thing has occurred. The same condition of things existed in other States of the Commonwealth in years gone by, but as the result of their experience they concluded to alter it; and it was partly through the experience of England and partly, probably, through the experience of Western Australia, that South Australia and other States have had backbone and common sense enough to protect the general public against individuals, and so have made these laws. I hope that we in this Senate will take sufficient interest in the people to see that their interests are not sacrificed to those of </para>

                    <para>- I recognise the fact that the arguments adduced in the speech delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harney</inline> might, to a certain extent, induce honorable senators to follow out the idea which was evidently running in the honorable and learned senator's mind. But we must bear in mind that we have had experience with regard to the proposals now submitted by the Government, almost daily, and we are practically following out what has been the result of legislation in nearly all the States during the past few years. We have also to bear in mind that the circumstances of our States are entirely different to the circumstances of Great Britain. Here in our States all the works practically are done by the Government at the expense of the community at large, and the weak point in the argument of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harney</inline> appeared to me to be that he failed to recognise the fact that the community as a whole is interested in the carrying out of public works, and that those works are not carried out for the benefit of one section of the community or of any private company, but for the benefit of the community as a whole and at the expense of every taxpayer in the community. That being so, it appears tome only a fair thing that we should protect the Government or the State as far as we reasonably can. </para>

                        <para>- We do not confiscate the land. I am speaking of the position as between the owner of the land and the State, and surely in the dealing between these parties we must consider the position of the State, or the community at large, as much as the position "of the individual owner. If we do that, this becomes a matter of absolute justice. Let us follow <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harney's</inline> argument a little further than the honorable and learned senator saw fit to carry it himself. He says that if we leave a little bit of ground in the hands of the original owner he should be entitled not only to the value of the land taken from him, but also to the enhancement of the value of the land left to him, in just the same way as people adjoining him are entitled to the enhancement of the value of their land by the construction of the public work for which a portion of his land was taken in the first instance. The probability is that these men will be getting 50 per cent. more, because they will have a larger area of land than the person whose land was taken by the State. Under the proposal the honorable and learned senator would advocate and support, if he is going to do equal justice, why should he not say that if a portion of A's land is taken away, and B's land is enhanced in value to the extent of £1,000, A should also receive £1,000 as well? Take another case again where A's land is entirely taken away, and land belonging toB and C are in consequence increased in value, why should not A say that because his land is taken away for the erection of a public work and that has enhanced the value of adjoining blocks held by B and C to the extent of £1,000, he is also entitled to £1,000 ? We might carry this argument to such an extent that it would lead to the absolute ruination of the State attempting to carry out such a principle. All that we have to do is to consider the position as between the owner of the land and the State. If A, as an ordinary individual, choses to improve his own land, and the improvement he makes enhances the value of the land held by B and C adjoining, are we going to give something to A in addition to the natural enhancement in value of his land by the expenditure of his own money, because his expenditure has also increased the value of the land belonging to B and C ? We cannot carry out that principle. A, instead of spending his own money, allows the State to spend money upon his land, and what claim then has he got to the enhancement of value due to the land taken from him. If we were going in for legislation on the betterment principle, it might be a fair thing to say that all whose lands are enhanced in value by improvements upon certain lands should assist in paying the cost the Government are put to. But that must be under a betterment Bill, and a Bill of a very different character from the one at present before the committee. If we are going to make this a betterment Bill, in addition to a Bill for the acquisition of land by the Commonwealth, we will have a very long job in front of us, because we will have all sorts of provisions to insert in order to make such a Bill work fairly and equitably in the interests of the community at large. I think that in this matter it is right that we should follow the principle laid down in the Acts passed by the various Legislatures of the State, and decide that as between the State and the individual we shall not penalize the State, because the action of the State has conferred an improvement in value upon property that the individual holds. I think the provision in the Bill is one that we might fairly, and should properly,accept. </para>

                    <para>- I have listened with very great pleasure, and a good deal of profit, to the very lucid arguments of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harney</inline> with reference to this particular matter. I consider the honorable and learned senator's argument is unanswerable. It certainly has not been answered by any of the honorable senators who followed. The position the honorable and learned senator takes up is that equal justice should be done to every member of the community. We have heard something about socialism here to-night. I profess to be a socialist, and the backbone of the creed of the socialist is, equal justice to everybody. I contend that this provision, so far as it applies to the individual whose land was taken, is perfectly fair ; but when we come to consider the matter in relation to other members of the community it is most unfair. Why should the person whose land is taken be placed in a position different from that of other members of the community? His land is increased in value by the resumption, but he has got to return a portion of that increase to the Government. The land belonging to other people and situated close beside him is also increased in value, but they are not called upon by the Government to return anything. </para>

                        <para>- They have the increase without being called upon to return any portion of it to the Government, while he has to pay back a certain proportion of his increase to the Government. I wish to put them all on the one footing. If we could get at these other land-holders in the same way as you get at this particular landholder, I would say extend the principle to everybody, but it is impossible. The only way we can accomplish that is, first, by placing them all, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harney</inline> has contended, on an equal footing, and then levying a betterment tax all round. Suppose that on some future occasion the Commonwealth decides to levy a betterment tax. it will be taxing this particular individual twice. He will have paid in the first instance, and when the betterment tax is imposed he will have to pay again. That is a position in which no citizen should be placed. If the honorable and learned senator will move that this provision be excised, I will support him, with the -view of imposing a betterment tax on some future occasion. We will have laid the foundation on which we can build up the betterment principle, but if we go on in this fashion we will have no foundation. We will have inequalities which it will be impossible to smooth away when we come later to deal with the imposition of a betterment tax. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable and learned senator asks me if we have any right to lay the foundation for a taxation Bill. I think we have, arid in any case I am going to proceed on the assumption that we have, until the contrary is conclusively proved. Even if I had not that object in view, desiring as I do that equal justice should be given to every one, I do not see why. one man, simply because a railway line touches or passes through his hand, should be compelled to pay back a portion of the increased value which accrues from the construction of the railway, while other people in the same locality, and receiving the same . benefit, are not called upon to contribute anything. I think we should consider everybody alike. That is a very good principle to begin with, but this provision does not do that. It is perfectly just so far as the individual concerned is affected, but it is not just with regard to other members of the community. If we could get at them in some fashion I would be quite willing to let the clause stand as it is, but we cannot. </para>

                        <para>- This is going a little too far. The Commonwealth, I know, can resume any land, but we do not propose to do that in the meantime, and, perhaps, the more moderately we go to work the more we will be able to do. If the Commonwealth attempted to bolt such a big meal as the honorable senator suggests the probability is that it would not be able to digest it. I asked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harney</inline> what Iris purpose was, and I think I was quite justified in doing so, because the honorable and learned senator, after making an able speech, sat down without proposing any tiring. Does the honorable and learned senator propose to excise this provision ? </para>

                        <para>- We are, and it is only a question of extent. I think I may describe myself in this matter as a practical socialist who, when he finds he can get a little bit of socialistic - benefit, does not throw it away because he cannot get something else which may be unattainable for many years. Coming back to the real matter we have to decide here, I have been much interested in the argument of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harney,</inline> who put his contention in a very able way. But the honorable and learned senator has wandered' a good deal from the question we have to decide. The principle upon which all these acquisitions of land are based is that when we take land for public purposes and for the benefit of the community at large, it is not fair that an individual, one member of the public benefited, should pay for all the benefit. We must try and equalize the sacrifice as much as we can. Therefore we pay him the fair value of his land. We pay him also the amount of damage which has been done by a public work, but we pay him no more than that. </para>

                        <para>- I think my honorable and learned friend is mistaken about that. If, over and above the value of the land we pay him, an additional value has been given to land by the expenditure of public money on a public work, why should we pay him any part of that? I admit it may be that other persons besides the owner of land taken have been benefited, but why should we pay the owner of land taken more than he has lost? Because, after all, that is what we have to deal with. The person whose land is being taken comes to us for compensation, and we are bound to give him the compensation which will put him in the same position as he would have been in, as regards the portion of land, before the work was constructed. We do that if we give him the value of the land, and the damages, and let him have the benefit, so far as it goes, of any additional compensation. Looking at the thing practically, we all know that, in most cases, the benefit which a man derives from the public work is infinitely greater than the amount which is deducted, as against the value of the land taken.For instance, if a road goes through a property, it makes accessible a property which was inaccessible before, and thereby adds 20 or 30 or 40 per cent. to its value. </para>

                        <para>- I am making an assumption. I admit that it does not do so always, but there are many cases in which it does. Why should the person whose land is taken be paid the value of the whole land taken ? Why should not he who benefits so much also contribute something to the public work by which he benefits - why should he not contribute to the extent of having a set-off of any advantage which had accrued to him? That is a principle which I do not want to elaborate at any length, because I do not think it is necessary. If there is one thing more clear than . another it is that in Australia we have determined to apply this betterment principle wherever it is possible, and on this ground that where a benefit accrues to a man, not by his own exertions or expenditure, but by the expenditure of public money and by the advance and prosperity of the community, if he wants to get any benefit from the community that must be taken into consideration. That is a principle which has not only been followed here, but which has been followed, and followed with increasing frequency, in the legislation of Great Britain herself. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harney</inline> has quoted a judgment from one of the Lord Justices of Appeal, I would mention that even such a House as the House of Lords itself has approved of the principle of betterment in relation to local works. </para>

                        <para>- My honorable and learned friend need not talk about robbing, because, as a matter of fact, the person who comes for compensation has his claim truly and well adjusted, and there is no doubt everything is always awarded on the most liberal scale to persons whose lands have been taken compulsorily for any public purpose. I merely made that quotation to show that not only is it adopted in Australia and other parts of the world, but that even in Great Britain and amongst persons of the most conservative class of opinion the principle is recognised - whether you extend it far or whether you do not - that a person who derives a benefit from a public work when his land is taken, shall not have the total value of the land, but shall have the value of the land less the amount of benefit, which he, for his adjoining land has received. I hope the committee will not assent to the amendment. </para>

                    (Queensland).This principle operates very unjustly in some cases. Supposing that a railway goes through a man's home paddock, and cuts off the only permanent water supply, the portion not cut off is then valueless. The property
                    <inline font-style="italic">is</inline>
                    completely destroyed, and if the man owns any land adjoining, according to the last proviso, the enhanced value of that land has to be taken into consideration as a set-off against the damage he suffers. But if a neighbour on the other side has a property which the railway does not touch in any way, he has the full advantage of the enhancement in value. It would be far better for the man if the Government took away the whole of his land. The house portion of the property is destroyed when his water supply is cut off, and the water supply portion is really valueless, because it is low, swampy ground. In a case of that kind, unless a man gets a very high compensation, he is a great loser by the railway going through his property.

                        <para>- Yes ; and under the law as administered in several States - in New South Wales, for instance - in a case of that sort, the man would be entitled not only to the value of the land taken, but to the amount by which the land adjoining was rendered less valuable by reason of cutting off the place where his water was ; he would be entitled to that wherever it was. So that whatever the law may have been in the case which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferguson</inline> was thinking of, certainly in this clause there is the most ample provision for doing justice in a case of that kind. </para>

                    <para>- I am quite certain we all recognise that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harney</inline> has raised a most interesting discussion. I was at first under the impression that he was going merely to raise a discussion and not follow it up to its logical issue, and move that the proviso be omitted. I understand that he has moved that the proviso be omitted. That being so I think he will not object if I put his arguments in so clear a light that every honorable senator can see exactly what they mean. The obvious intention of the proviso is to see that the Commonwealth does no injury to an individual when it takes over his land ; that it leaves him, at any rate, in as good a position as he was in before it interfered. We all recognise the right and desirability of interference and we attempt to provide that the interference shall do no individual injury. What <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harney</inline> wants us to do is not merely not to do injury to any individual, but also so to legislate that we preserve the relative values of all persons properties. He wants us so to legislate that not merely we do not deprive any man of any value which is attached to his land, but that we also keep constant the ratio of value between his land and his neighbour's to the nth degree, to use an algebraic expression. I frankly confess that in that attempt we shall be trying to do a good deal more than we could possibly by any method of legislation succeed in achieving. Moreover, if his argument is followed out logically, it practically means that if we cannot benefit every one equally we should refrain from carrying on any works which will give a large amount of benefit to the community generally although the equality be not clearly maintained. </para>

                        <para>- Undoubtedly that is the logical issue of the honorable and learned senator's argument, because he says - "In this case if we do some work which will benefit B and C it is not giving the same amount of benefit to A." It is quite possible that' we may do some work which, while it will not injure any one, will put some persons in a worse position while it puts others in a better position. In other words, by merely changing the relative value of these persons lands we are not really doing any act we need feel ashamed of doing. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harney</inline> says that unless we always keep constant the ratio of value to the <inline font-style="italic">nth</inline> degree we should not legislate in the way proposed. That is practically his argument extended to its logical issue. I venture now to ask him if he likes it presented in that form; if he is prepared to accept the logical conclusion of it ? </para>

If it is the logical outcome of his contention, then I shall suggest to him that his case is bad. If it is not the logical outcome of his contention, then I shall wait with interest to hear him suggest to me in what way my contention fails, in what way I carry his argument to a conclusion which is illogical. </para>

All I contended for was that so long as the clause remains there, in the absence of a proper betterment system, we were treating persons in the same neighbourhood unequally, and inequality is the principle of injustice.

                        <para>- How often do we in our deliberations say - " Such and such a thing would be good, but we cannot impose it upon one, since we have not the means of imposing it equally on all." It is a proposition which we frequently use. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> has said that all this clause purports to do is simply to take the individual's land and to give him compensation, and that if the result of the work is that he derives as great an advantage from his share of the improvement to the neighbourhood, as he loses by the piece of land taken, he ought to get nothing. May I put to him the position from the Government point of view <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> If the Government require 100 acres of land, is it asking them too much to say - " You will be good enough to pay for the area what it costs in the open market, the same as Tom Jones or Robinson would have to pay <inline font-style="italic">"1</inline> Surely, the Minister will not deny that that is a reasonable thing to ask the Government to do; and that is all we&gt;want them to do, because if they give for* the 100 acres what anybody else would have to give, then they will take no account of those natural advantages which are incidental to the accumulation of human beings, and not to them or the other person. We have to recognise in society that if two or three persons club together, and build their houses, every additional person who* comes adds an increment for which he renders no.immediate service to them. <inline font-style="italic">We</inline> recognise that as a principle incident to the accumulation of men in communities. Why should we in these particular cases interfere with that natural principle ? If a bank manager comes to a neighbourhood where a railway has been run, and wants to put up his building, he has to put down his money for his acre of land, and he cannot say - " Oh ! but my bank, you know, will improve the beauty of the town," and. other persons will come here on account of its erection who otherwise would not come." He cannot enter into these intangible unnatural forces which add to the value of things. He simply pays his money for that which he takes. But the Government, just because it is the Government, is going to say - " We have to buy the land for this railway for you, and we are not going to do what everybody else does - we are not going to pay you for what we take. You will be kind enough in our case to suffer a subtraction by reason of your share of an intangible benefit" which we say the Government get. </para>

It says to them - " We give you the right to compel persons to allow you to take their land, if you pay for what you take." The Government here do no differently. All they say is - "Instead of deputing some body else to do it, we do it ourselves." There is absolutely no difference between the two. </para>

                        <para>- Must I really put it again? Where is the difference between legislative authority under which the Government say - "Tom Jones, go and take the land," and legislative authority under which the Government say - " Government, go yourselves and take it." Both of them derive their right from legislative authority. I do seriously press this question on the committee. I have no interest in the world except my conception of what I believe to be justice. It seems to me to be a grossly unfair thing to say to a man - " We want your land, and you will not be a sufferer by reason of our taking it, because we shall plant down its equivalent in sovereigns," and when you have taken his land and he says - " Put down the equivalent in sovereigns," the Government should answer - "My friend, the equivalent is the intangible and visionary benefit which you in common with your neighbours derive." </para>

                        <para>- Does it not ? The Government say - "We want a hundred acres of land." The moment they speak, the hundred acres become worth £10,000 in the' market. If a bank wishes to purchase a property of that kind it has to plank down its ten thousand sovereigns, and no matter how much the neighbourhood increases in value, and whatever the amount of good that arises from the work done, the person owning the property only gets what represents the market value of the land taken. But if the Government say exactly the same thing, "We want 100 acres of your land," they are not to put down their £10,000. How do the Government carry out their contract? They say that the whole neighbourhood has benefited, but that they will not give to the man whose land they have taken any share of that benefit. Is that fair ? Clearly it is not. If a private railway company takes a person's land they are compelled to pay for it. Why then should not the Government give the property-owner the market value of his land? What is the difference between the promoter who is deputed by the Government to bike land compulsorily, and the Government that takes the land compulsorily? There is no difference - absolutely none. That is the reason for the position I have raised, and nothing could be stronger. If any honorable senator thinks it worth while to investigate the matter further, I commend the decision of the Privy Council in the case I have quoted. To reduce the matter to an algebraical proposition, individuals whose property adjoins the land taken by the Government retain the value of that land plus <inline font-style="italic">x,</inline> the value to the neighbourhood; but if the land is taken, they substitute money for land - they give to the owner the value of his land minus <inline font-style="italic">x.</inline> Is that fair ? </para>

                    (New South Wales).I should like to draw the attention of the Vice-President of the Executive Council to the rate of interest proposed under this clause. Sub-clause (2) says that the rate shall be 3 per cent. per annum. That appears to me to be altogether too low. I do not wish to suggest any figure which would be unfair to the Commonwealth, but, at any rate, the States themselves do not borrow at 3 per cent. And if they are paying more for their public loans than 3 per cent. it is not unreasonable to say that the Government shall pay at least the rate of interest that they would have to pay if they borrowed. I would suggest that 4 per cent. should be substituted for three. That rate is low enough. Very few people who have money invested in property are obtaining such a low return as 4 per cent.

                    <para>- I have pleasure in supporting the amendment. Four per cent. is the very lowest rate upon which money is lent on mortgage. Lenders are paying4 and 4½ percent. If the security is gilt edged, with a large margin, you can borrow at 4 per cent. I believe that two-thirds of the land the Government will have to take for the purposes of the federal capital will be found to be mortgaged, and none of the mortgagors are paying less than 4 per cent. They are probably paying 4 per cent. and upwards; and if you take the lowest minimum rate for mortgages, 4 per cent. is a fair thing. Then I desire to point out that I think that the rate of interest ought to be taken, not from the date of notification in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette,</inline> but from the date on which the owner surrenders possession of the land to the Commonwealth. It appears to me that, although this may not be a large matter, it may run into some hundreds of thousands of pounds if the Government are taking over large properties. When the Government are acquiring land for the capital, and take up enormous blocks of land, the purchase money will be considerable, and whether you pay a man  4  per cent. from the date of notification in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette,</inline> or from the date the Government gets possession, will be a very different thing. If the Minister will agree to make it date from the time of taking possession by the Government, and that the interest shall be at the rate of 4 per cent. I shall be satisfied. </para>
