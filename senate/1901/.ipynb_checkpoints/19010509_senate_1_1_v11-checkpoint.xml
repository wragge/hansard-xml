      <para>HIS MAJESTY'S HIGH COMMISSIONER was pleased to address to both Houses of the Parliament the ' following speech declaring the message of His Most Gracious Majesty the King : - "Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives : " My beloved and deeply-lamented grandmother, Queen Victoria, had desired to mark the importance of the opening, of this the first Parliament of The Commonwealth of Australia, and to manifest her special interest in all that concerns the welfare of her loyal subjects in Australia, by granting to me a special commission to open the first session. " That commission had been duly signed before the sad event which has plunged the whole empire into mourning, and the King, my dear father, fully sharing Her late Majesty's wishes, decided to give effect to them, although His Majesty stated, on the occasion of his opening his first Parliament, that a separation from his son at such a time could not be otherwise than deeply painful to him. " His Majesty- has been pleased to consent to this separation, moved by his sense of the loyalty and devotion which prompted the generous aid afforded by all the colonies in the South African war, both in its earlier and more recent, stages, and of the splendid bravery of the colonial troops. It is also His Majesty's wish to acknowledge the readiness with which the ships of the special Australasian Squadron were placed at his disposal for service in China, and the valuable assistance rendered there by the naval contingents of the several colonies. " His Majesty further desired in this way to testify to his heartfelt gratitude for the warm sympathy extended by every part of his dominions to himself and his family in the irreparable loss they have sustained by the death of his beloved mother. " His Majesty has watched with the deepest interest the social and material progress made by his people in Australia, and has seen with thankfulness and heartfelt satisfaction the completion of that political union of which this Parliament is the embodiment. " The King is satisfied that the wisdom and patriotism which have characterized the exercise of the wide powers of self government hitherto enjoyed by the colonies will continue to be displayed in the exercise of the still wider powers with which the united Commonwealth has been endowed. His Majesty feels assured that the enjoyment of these powers will, if possible, enhance that loyalty and devotion to his throne and empire of which the people of Australia have already given such signal proofs. " It is His Majesty's earnest prayer that this union so happily achieved may, under God's blessing, prove an instrument for still further promoting the welfare and advancement] of his subjects in Australia and for the strengthening and consolidation of his empire. " Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives : " It affords me much pleasure to convey to you this message from His Majesty.

          <para>- I would remind the Senate that the time has arrived for electing a President, and, as I understand that there is not likely to be a unanimous choice in the first instance, I think it would be well if we were to lay down at once a method of procedure by which in the end the will of the majority might prevail. As honorable members are aware, the House of Commons' practice would guide a body of this kind in the absence of express direction by ourselves. I think it will be evident that, in the event of there being more than two candidates, the putting of several motions successively would very likely result in the election of a President who would not' be the choice of the majority of the House. The experience, I think, of all of us who have had much to do with deliberative bodies is that, in these circumstances, there is only one way of ascertaining the choice of the majority, and that is by the system of what is called exhaustive ballot. I propose therefore that, inasmuch as under the circumstances which are likely to arise, it is necessary to have some other procedure than that of the House of Commons, the Senate should lay down for itself a form of procedure to be adopted during this election of President. I put my proposal in the form . of a motion, which I ask the consent of the Senate to submit without notice. It is as follows : - </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>That if no more than two candidates are proposed, the House of Commons,' practice be adopted ; that if more than two candidates are proposed, the Senate proceed to ballot ; that all candidates except the two highest on the first ballot drop out ; that if on the first ballot any candidate has an absolute majority of the votes given, he shall be declared elected President ; but if no candidate has such absolute majority, a second ballot be then taken, and that the candidate then obtaining the highest number of votes be declared elected President. </para>
        <para class="block">That, I think, will commend itself to honorable members as a method by which we can, in a most certain way, elect a President who shall be the choice of the majority of the members of the Senate. I would like also to make a suggestion. I do not intend to put it in any formal way. Considering the nature of the office and the duties of President, and considering also the qualifications, the well-known character, and ability of the gentlemen who are likely to be nominated, it would be very much better for honorable members to content themselves by simply moving and seconding the candidates that they propose. I need not enlarge on the reasons which I think will commend that course to the Senate. I make that suggestion in the hope that honorable members will see that it will be conducive, perhaps, to good results, if that procedure be followed. I propose the motion I have read in order that the Senate may have the procedure settled for the purpose of this first election of a President. </para>

          <para>- I should like to ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> whether it might not be well to adopt the House of Commons' practice after the first ballot has eliminated the third candidate. If in the first instance there be only two candidates, it is proposed that the House of Commons' practice be adopted ; and there seems to be no reason why, when we have eliminated the third candidate, the voting on the two who remain should not be open, according to the House of Commons' practice. I would suggest that an august body, such as we hope the Senate will always be, should not shrink from open voting upon the determination of the highest office in the gift of this Chamber. I think that we should be doing honour to ourselves by adopting that course, because I am sure that, whatever our views may be as to the respective candidates, we shall give the most loyal obedience to whoever may be chosen, and aid him in maintaining the dignity and prestige of this Chamber. </para>

            <para>- I think the Senate will admit at once that it is not from any desire that any <inline font-weight="bold">Senator has</inline> to conceal his opinions as to the candidate who ought to occupy the chair that we propose to adopt the system of ballot. It is done to get rid of the difficulty which very often arises owing to the cross voting which occurs where you have three motions submitted, and in consequence of which you may have a person chosen as President who is not the choice of the majority. It appeal's to me that, once having adopted the method of ballot, it should be carried right through. Therefore, although I quite assent to a good deal of what the honorable member has said, I think it will be a simpler and more satisfactory process if, when once the ballot begins, it is carried right through in the ordinary way in which these ballots proceed. </para>

            <inline font-style="italic">- X</inline>take it that the point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Josiah</inline> Symon is that there is an inconsistency in the motion as it is presented, in that whilst it is proposed if there are only two nominations, that we adopt open voting, in the event of there being more than two we are, having eliminated the surplus number, to have a ballot. To put the matter in another way, if we are to have open voting for one set why not for the other, or if, having reduced the number to two, we are to have a secret ballot, why should we depart from that principle if there are only two nominations ? I am not prepared to say that there is very much merit in one system over the other. But I think that, whatever system we adopt, there should be uniformity, and I would suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> that he might amend his motion so as to make the procedure in the one set of circumstances uniform with the procedure in another set of circumstances. </para>

          <para>- Yes ; but I am inclined to agree with the last speaker. We know, so fur as human beings can know in the circumstances in -which we are placed, that there will be at least three candidates. Under the circumstances, the first proposition in this motion will certainly not arise. The procedure should be uniform throughout, and I think, therefore, that the first part of the motion might be omitted, and that we. might say generally that the voting shall be by ballot, and that, if there are more than two candidates, it shall be in the manner <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> has proposed. It is not a matter of very much consequence, to tell you the truth, nor is it worthy of a very great amount of discussion, but if it will prevent conflict and save time, I would suggest that the first part of the motion be struck out, and that the one method of voting be adopted. </para>

          <para>- I appreciate the desire of honorable members to get to business, because Upper Houses are not deemed to be bodies which are anxious to do business in a rapid way. I dare say it will come as a surprise to those who have occupied positions in other Parliaments that such a feeling exists. Knowing nothing of the capacity of either of the gentlemen who are about to be -proposed - not even knowing their names, because I am not in the confidence of those who are prepared to submit nominations - I think that the mover and seconder should in each case give us some reasons why we should vote for their particular candidate. We are about to appoint a gentleman to a very high office, and I agree that he should be one who can fill it with dignity and impartiality. My great desire is to cast my vote for an honorable member who will endeavour to give us just decisions whenever the standing orders of the Senate have to be interpreted, so that I do not at all fall in with the proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> that the candidates should simply be nominated, that nothing should be said either for or against them, but that we should proceed forthwith to vote. </para>

          <para>- I have very much pleasure in seconding the amendment. I do not think the Senate can be divided in the opinion that whatever method we adopt should be a uniform one. If it is wise to adopt the system of ballot under certain circumstances, surely it is wise even if there are only two candidates. With regard to what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> has said, I think the proposal of the Vice President of the Executive Council was only meant as a suggestion. Personally I do not agree with it. We come from another State, and we are not closely in touch with the public men in the community in which we are now living. We desire to know the qualifications of the gentlemen for whom we are asked to vote. It is all very well for those who live in Melbourne or Sydney to say they know the merits of the various gentlemen who are to be proposed for this office, but realizing as we do that the office of President is a most important one, we, as Senators coming from far-off portions of the continent, desire to hear what can be said either for or against the . individual candidates. </para>

What he proposes is that, under all circumstances, this election shall be by ballot. I think that might be carried out by a very simple alteration at the beginning of the motion. I do not want to enter into any verbal discussion; but the honorable member will see, if lie reads his amendment, that it leaves a portion of the motion which is inconsistent with it. If the honorable member desires it, I will add a few words to the motion to make it fit in with his view. We are dealing with matters of substance now; and I think it is the general wish of the House that this should be simply a motion to proceed by ballot under all circumstances. </para>

          <para>- I wish to express my opinion that the amended motion is not a satisfactory one to the public whom we are supposed to represent in this Chamber. It is not satisfactory for the simple reason that it still provides for a secret ballot. If there is one thing above another that we have to do in this Chamber it is to let the public outside know exactly on which side and in which direction we cast our votes. I for one am against any attempt at secret voting in the Senate, and I am, therefore, distinctly against the amended motion. If honorable members who have been honoured by the people of Australia by being selected to represent them in the Senate are ashamed to cast their votes openly let them say so, and let the public know it. I am not. I am quite willing to vote openly. If there is one place in the whole of Australia where this course should be adopted it is in the legislative halls of the Commonwealth, and particularly in the Senate. I desire to direct the attention of honorable members, through you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Blackmore,</inline> to' a most irregular proceeding of this afternoon, and I am very much astonished that the representative of Queensland, who is sitting on the Ministerial bench, has not thought fit to interfere in the matter. I refer to the fact that very important motions are being moved, and that copies of them have not been handed to honorable members. We know no more of them than the general public. A surprise motion has been sprung upon us. </para>

          <para>- In seconding the amendment I desire to say that the proposition appears to me to be an extraordinary one. The honorable gentleman who brought forward the motion seems to forget altogether that we are here in our representative capacity to appoint the first President of the Senate of the Commonwealth Parliament, and that our constituents are just as much interested in how we vote upon this question as they are in how we vote on any other subject. For that reason, I decidedly object to any attempt to throw the veil of secrecy over the proceedings of the Senate. The motion appears to me to be entirely opposed to the traditions of Parliament. Why should there be secret voting? Do honorable members object to the public knowing for whom they vote? I think it is the right of the people who sent us here to have that information given to them. ' There is no need for me to prolong this discussion. My mind is made up ; and I am decidedly opposed to anything in the way of secrecy. </para>

        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator GOULD</inline>(New South Wales).I am perfectly certain that honorable members do not desire to hide from the public the way in which they record their votes in this election or on any other occasion. I certainly understood when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> tabled his motion originally that it was done really with the object of getting over a difficulty that might arise by means of open voting if there were more than two candidates proposed. Any one who knows how these things operate in deliberative assemblies must be aware that where three or more candidates are proposed it frequently happens that the man elected is not really the <inline font-style="italic">bona fide</inline> choice of the majority. If there are three candidates one man's name is put first of all before the House, and the honorable members who are going to support the other two generally vote against him. By that means a man who is only acceptable to the minority, possibly, succeeds. Therefore, I think there is very good reason for supporting <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor's</inline> proposition. I understand that certain sections of honorable members have held secret caucuses, and determined whom they shall support. While they come before the public and give a public vote we do not know what their own honest convictions are, because there have been debates and votes behind the back of Parliament. I am very glad to hear, however, that some honorable members feel now that it is desirable the public should know the direction in which their votes are cast. I want the public also to know that they are being cast on the independent judgment of honorable members, and not at the dictation of a majority of any particular section. </para>

          <para>- I think honorable members have to a great extent overlooked the fact that to-day we have to form a precedent in regard to the election of President of the Senate. We know that in the House of Commons the invariable practice has been to elect the Speaker on the voices by open voting, and, as far as I am aware, the practice in the Australian States has always been in the same direction. Is it desirable that we, meeting here to-day as a new elective body, should without very grave consideration start a new system in regard " to the election of our President which will be a precedent for all time <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> That is not "the way in which we should enter upon the business of the session. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> first addressed us on this subject, he distinctly pointed out that his only motive for advocating election by ballot was to eliminate any candidates above the number of two, and that he had originally intended, in case there were only two, that the election should be by open voting. I was perfectly prepared to go with him as far as the adoption of the ballot for eliminating the extra number was concerned ; but, since he has now adopted the amendment suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline> I am perforce compelled to support the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson,</inline> who strongly advocated election by open voting. To my mind it is really a most serious matter that we should attempt to establish to-day a precedent entirely different from the precedents which have been in vogue for countless years, both in Great Britain and in these States. If it had been possible to move as a further amendment that the method adopted by the House of Commons should be followed, so that we might have the advantage of al1, the experience which, has been brought to bear on the subject in that Chamber, I should have been prepared to support it. As this cannot be done, I shall strongly support the amendment. </para>

          <para>- I shall strongly support voting by ballot. What I had hoped was that we should have met- the whole of us - to quietly select our President, and that we should then have adopted the method adopted, I believe, in the British Parliament of some one moving that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. So-and-So</inline> should be President, when he would have been conducted to the chair. That is what I and a great many honorable members had hoped would have been done. We should then have avoided waste of time and have avoided also the warmth which has been introduced this afternoon. We, in voting by ballot, will record our votes in the direction which we think best in the interests of the country. We are not afraid to express our opinions. I think it is well known how the vote will go. It is better, in the interests of the candidates themselves and in the interests of the Senate, that we should adopt this method, seeing that we have entered the chamber with the supposition that there will be three candidates. If we had adopted the other method of quietly arranging it, then of course it could have been done as it is done in the British House of Commons, and there .would have been no loss of time. I shall support the motion that the election be by ballot, and I am quite sure that those who sent us here will be satisfied that we are acting in the interests of the Commonwealth, and are not, as some of our friends seem to think, seeking to adopt some clandestine way of doing our work. </para>

          <para>- This matter is very much more important than perhaps some honorable senators seem to think. The point that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> has just put is one that deserves, at any rate, our very serious consideration. It is a pity that there should be the slightest element of irritation or heat. Although some honorable senators behind where I sit have been emphatic in the expression of their views, I am quite certain that it has not been with .any idea of importing any undue heat into this discussion. At the same time, I think that none of us will shrink from making known the votes we give, whether upon a personal matter or any other matter, so long as we have the honour to be members of the Senate. We are about to establish a precedent. There are precedents, of course, for balloting for committees and so on in the different legislative bodies. . But then it is apt to be forgotten that there are no proposers and seconders of the men who are to form those committees. On such an occasion us this, even if we adopt the ballot, we incorporate two systems into one. The proposer and seconder in each case give their votes absolutely in the eye of the world, and are to be exposed, if such a thing were possible - which it is not - to be associated with the particular member chosen, or with those in opposition to him, whilst others are to have the advantage of recording their votes in secret, though not in any clandestine way. </para>

            <para>- No advantage in what ? What does the honorable member mean by that remark? There is nothing clandestine about it, but it is a double system of voting. You are having open voting, in so for as the proposers and seconders are concerned, and you are having - what you do not have when you choose a committee by ballot - voting by ballot as to all others who support any particular candidate. I think we ought to look upon this as a precedent. If we are to do this now, then we must be prepared to do it for all time. Usually the choice is made 'at a meeting before the formal sitting of the legislative body, and then the members come prepared to support practically unanimously a particular choice. It is unfortunate that that was not done in this instance. There may have been difficulties in the way I admit, but I think it would have been well if some such arrangement had been possible in this particular instance, and nobody could have called it a caucus or anything of that kind, because we should have assembled informally as a Senate, and with the view of deciding this question right out of hand, and then come here for the purpose of recording our votes. I do not know whether there is any precedent for anything of this kind. We are establishing one. I think it will be an unfortunate one, and that it would be . very much better for us to adhere to the system of open voting which has always prevailed than to adopt a compound system which has no precedent to justify it. </para>

It will be necessary, I presume, to have a proposer and seconder for each of the different candidates. </para>
