                    <para>- On Thursday last, when speaking relative to the, in time, possible importation of worn silver coin to be withdrawn by the Commonwealth mint, I said that something like &#163;70,000 of worn silver coin was sent from Australasia annually to the Imperial Mint. I find that I made a mistake. I ought to have said that for the twenty-eight years ending December, 1899, the imports of silver coin to Australasia averaged &#163;70,000 a year more than the exports - really imports &#163;88,000 or&#163;89,000 per annum as against worn silver exported, averaging &#163;18,000 a year. Needless to say, as our population is greatly in excess of what it was 28 or 30 years since, the figures must be expected to show a substantial annual increase ; still I was surprised to see by the Imperial Mint returns for the year 1900 that the exports of silver coin for Australasia totalled &#163;297,000 - surely quite exceptional. </para>

                <para class="block">If the clause remain as it is it will practically destroy the shipping of Port Adelaide. From information I have gathered since last week it appears that the clause will mean that ships coming to Port Adelaide will be tied up to the buoys practically for seven days. Instead of reading that entries shall be made not later than seven days, the, clause, for all practical purposes, might just as well read that entries shall not be made within seven days, because it virtually debars goods from being unloaded within that time. If there arc three consignees, and one, whose goods are on the top of the cargo, is not anxious &#39;to have them landed, but desires to have the whole of the seven days to enable him to look round for a customer, he may render it impossible for the other two to get at their cargo. It might be argued that the goods of the consignee who desired delay, would be sent on to the wharf ; but, while that would be all right, in Melbourne, where there are Government wharfs and sheds, and the charges are not for wharfage, but for harbor dues, it would not do in Port Adelaide, where the wharfs are privately owned, and the owners would not allow the goods to be stored. Goods so landed in Melbourne are, theoretically, still on board the ship, and under the responsibility of the master or ship-owner ; but at Port Adelaide, if the wharf were required, the ship would have to pull off and be tied to the buoys until the seven days were up, and the consignee was compelled to pass his entries. There is no shed accommodation at Port Adelaide, even if the captain were prepared to allow the goods to be landed at his own risk ; and I submit this amendment in the interests of that port and other ports which are not provided in the same manner as Melbourne with plenty of Government wharfs. The amendment is practically a compromise with Melbourne, where, I believe, the period is fourteen days before a consignee is compelled to pass entries. </para>

                        <para>- Even if the period is seven days, the ship-owner is practically responsible for the goods in the Government shed for that time, and is necessarily anxious to be relieved of the responsibility. I can quite see that the clause might suit Melbourne shippers and importers very well, while in South Australia, and I believe in Western Australia and Tasmania, it would be simply ruinous. </para>

This is a very serious matter, and only this morning I received from the Chamber of Commerce in South Australia a request that the Senate would alter the clause in the manner I have suggested, on the grounds that the circumstances and facilities in South Australia are not suited to the extended time for vessels to hold the unentered goods, as provided under the Bill ; that the shed accommodation on the wharfs has not the capacity to receive the goods as landed ; that the wharfs and sheds are private property, and the shipowners are therefore unable to provide the accommodation, if so inclined; that the result of the circumstances would be, that if steamers had prior claim to shed accommodation, all sailing ships would be compelled to hold their cargoes for seven days before commencing to discharge, which would cause great inconvenience and loss to the trading community besides probably increasing the cost of freight to the consignees; that the shipowners having to make themselves responsible for all goods landed into the shed, and all expenses for handling, would have to protect themselves at the expense of the consignees ; that the present system, allowing 24 hours for steamers and 48 hours for sailing vessels, has been in practice for a great number of years, and the present appliances have been built to suit that system, and have given such general satisfaction that the representative meeting held was strongly of opinion that existing methods should be continued ; and that the suggested amendment would not interfere with the term, as originally embodied in clause 67, as the collector has power to extend the period whenever necessary. </para>

                    <para>- The clause ought to be allowed to stand as drafted. When goods are put on a lighter, an entry has to be passed before they can be landed or transhipped. For instance, the mail steamers come to the semaphore at Port Adelaide and lighter, say, 300 tons of goods. . These goods are taken to Port Adelaide ; but so long as they are lightered, and until they are landed, they are looked on as being still in the ship&#39;s hold.. The reason why I do not object to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford&#39;s</inline> amendment is, that it simply is that these entries shall be made as soon as the goods are unshipped. I take it that his reason is that the Customs-house will then secure that directly the goods are taken out of the ship, whether they are landed on the wharf or put into a lighter, the entry shall be made ; or that the entry may be made before the goods are taken from the ship. The Customs-house officers have control. There is the question of whether when the goods are shipped into a lighter they can be said to be landed. There is no officer in charge of them, and they may be taken anywhere. They are not under the same strict control as they will be if the entry is once passed. However; I have no objection to the amendment, and do not think it will produce any. inconvenience. </para>

                    <para>-**! cannot consent -to the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Charleston.</inline> .! can well understand - :and the position commands a certain amount of sympathy - that -any alteration <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> the existing practice or law dealing with shipping matters -will be viewed with .a certain amount of alarm in any shipping community. We therefore find that in South Australia, where a . 24 hours&#39; provision has been the rule, there is no doubt a considerable amount of .alarm when the proposal is made to extend the period to seven days. On the other hand, <inline font-style="italic">&#62;in</inline> Victoria and Tasmania, where the seven days&#39; rule applies, a great deal of alarm would be felt if it were proposed to alter the term to 24 hours. The real fact is that this is one of those instances in which we have to assimilate our methods of dealing with mercantile matters. I take it that the only way in which we can deal with them is to put them, all on a basis right, fair and reasonable to the shipper, the importer, the owner of the goods, the owner of the ship, and at the same time efficacious for the purpose of collecting the revenue. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Charleston&#39;s</inline> amendment would have the effect of putting pressure upon the shipowner or shipmaster to bundle goods out, whether he was ready to put them out or not. Because under this provision, if the entry is not ready, or if the  material is not ready for making .an entry, the collector may cause the goods to be removed to a warehouse, and if they are not claimed and entries passed within six months, they may be- sold, whilst if they are perishable goods they may be sold at any time the collector thinks lit. I take it that in the particular cases contemplated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Charleston,</inline> there is no question of welling the goods, but they would be removed to a warehouse. So that the .result would be to bring pressure to bear upon the shipowner to have the goods put over the side, whether matters were ready for making an entry or not, under a penalty of having to incur the -cost of removing the goods to a warehouse,- and of -paying: rent for the warehouse. If w/e use the Customs-house as a means of bringing pressure to bear upon the ship-owner or the consignee, we shall be using it for a purpose that was never intended. What we have to see is that a sufficient time is given to enable the ship-owner and the owner of the goods to (have everything ready for the purpose of making his entry ^before <inline font-style="italic">he,</inline> is compelled to put the .goods over the  side. These Jaws will apply not only to ports like Adelaide, Melbourne, and Sydney, but to smaller ports where there may be little accommodation. I should like to direct the honorable senator&#39;s attention especially to the wording of the clause. The 7 days is .the maximum. The .goods can be unloaded within 24 hours, . if they are ready. The unloading can be done as early as possible ; and I think honorable senators who know anything about shipping will be aware that there always is strong pressure .upon &#39; the  shipowner to get goods landed as soon as possible. Heavy expenses are incurred while the ship is at the wharf, and wharfowners are anxious to get rid of the ship. If a ship can be unloaded in 24 hours that will be done, but if it cannot be conveniently done - if the consignee&#39;s- invoices are not in shape, or he cannot get at them, or any of the multifarious movements of commerce prevent them from being dealt with - it is &#39;only fair to give a reasonable time within which to make the entry. I would also point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Charleston</inline> that it is always open to the Customs-house officials to give a permit to allow the landing of goods at any time, if there is any necessity for it. It will be admitted that the Customs-house officials, the shipping officials, and the consignees in all these States work harmoniously together. Questions in dispute may occasionally arise as to the value of goods, but in the interests of all parties it is advantageous to get the .goods landed as soon as possible. If pressure is .to be brought to bear, the people who own the wharfs referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Charleston</inline> will take good Gare that, if goods are piled up on the wharfs, and are left longer than necessary, some extra charge is .made for their accommodation. They wall take care that the shipowner and the owner of the goods suffer if there is unreasonable delay. That is the kind of pressure which is legitimate enough asia matter of business. But to put on pressure by the Customhouse, when in doing so we may place importers and owners and consignees of goods in a very difficult position - and perhaps put .upon them -the &#39;necessity of incurring expense in storing goods - is not reasonable. The Adelaide shippers, of whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Charleston</inline> spoke particularly, will find that the real remedy for their trouble will be in a fair and expeditious administration of this law. On the other hand, if .the proposed amendment were agreed to, and there was a east-iron rule that entries for goods had to be .made within a certain period, there might be many cases in which this could&#39; not be conveniently done, and a .good deal of loss and inconvenience would result. I, therefore ask the committee to leave the clause as it is. </para>

He will say, &#34;I am not going to allow these goods to remain on my wharf.&#34; Then there will be trouble. People who are desirous of obtaining their goods, will not be able to get them. It is easy enough in Melbourne, where the goods can be landed and stored in a. Government shed without any expense to the consignee ; but the case is different in Port Adelaide. If the clause is allowed to stand as it is a most -serious injury will be done to the trade of&#39; Port Adelaide, because the ship will have to be sent from the wharf back to the buoy, and will have to be tied up at the expense of the owner, whose men will not be able to do any work. Honorable senators must see that, for the reasons stated by the Adelaide Chamber of Commerce, it is desirable that the clause should be amended as I suggest. I hope that the committee will not place the people of Port Adelaide under the 12 az disadvantage- this clause would impose upon them. </para>

                    (Tasmania).Prom a practical experience of -upwards of 30 years as a ship agent,- 1 have never found any difficulty placed in the way of consignees getting possession of their .goods, because airy particular consignee has not been in a hurry to get his entries passed. The practice in unloading sailing ships has been that where ;woods are come across, for which the entries have not been passed, they are taken up and put on deck, and when the other goods -required have been taken out they are put back until entries have been passed for them. It very often happens that goods for which entries have not been passed are taken out of the ship and placed in the King&#39;s warehouses. We have had the seven days&#39; period allowed in Tasmania, and I have seen ho delay in consequence. The full seven days is seldom required, and there is no trouble about it.

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator CHARLESTON</inline>
                    (South Australia). - In answer to that, I can quote a case where a dry goods merchant has been extremely anxious to obtain his goods as quickly as possible. He has passed his entries as soon as the ship has been sighted, and has urged upon the captain to facilitate the landing of the goods. The captain has started to discharge, and after working* for half an hour, he has come upon goods for which entries have not been passed, with the result that the unloading has been stopped at once, and the dry goods merchant has been compelled to wait the full 4S hours, until the owner of the other goods has been forced to pass his entries. In the case of steamers, the time allowed at Port Adelaide is -24 hours, and the Collector of Customs often gives a permit to land goods at once. People, knowing that the time is limited, have everything ready to pass -their entries, and there is no difficulty. Why should one man be permitted to delay the unloading of a ship for a number of days while he is trying to dispose of the goods he has on board ? I may perhaps better explain the difficulty by an illustration. If I had a number of cases of spirits to land, and I was not anxious to get them immediately, as soon as I heard of the arrival of the ship I would look around to see if I could dispose of these goods. Under this provision I should have seven days in which to do it, with the result that for that time I would delay passing my entries.&#34; It has been said that in some cases goods are landed and stored, but at whose expense ? In the case I have instanced, I would say that it should not be done at my expense, because I would insist that I had seven days in which to pass entries.

                    <para>- I hope the different circumstances of Port Adelaide will be taken into consideration. The merchants, shippers, and traders in South Australia know something about their own business, and when they have asked us to consider this question from their point of view, the representatives of that State at all events ought to give some attention to the arguments which they have advanced. What may be suitable for Melbourne and Sydney may be very unsuitable for Port Adelaide. We must recollect that Port Adelaide is only a port of call, and not a final port, and if we place difficulties in the way of doing business there, the result may be that cargo will be earned past Port Adelaide and taken on to Melbourne and Sydney, and perhaps shipped back again. When it is considered that at Port Adelaide all the wharfs and all the stores are in private hands, the great difference between that place and Melbourne must at &#39; once strike anybody. No captain of a ship or any other authority can send goods into a private store or land goods on a private wharf without the consent of the owner. It is all very well to say that goods may be unshipped and put on to a wharf or into a store, but while that may be true of Melbourne it is not true&#39; of Port Adelaide. There the owner of the store may say - &#34; Who is going to pay me for storing these goods <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> I will not&#39; take them unless some one is responsible.&#34; The man who does not want his goods landed may say- - &#34; I will not pay you ; I do not want to have my goods sent into your stores ; it is against my interests to land them at present, and I claim the full seven days allowed by the Act.&#34; These circumstances should all be taken into consideration, and I do not think the Vice-President of the Executive Council has met the objection at all. The fact is that we should have different rules for different ports. It may be all very well to provide for seven days for New South Wales and Victoria, but ships which have 200 or 300 tons of cargo for Port Adelaide, and 2,000 or 3,000 tons for Melbourne, do not want to stay at Port Adelaide any longer than is necessary. They want to transact their business there as quickly as possible, and get to the place at which the bulk of their cargo is to be delivered. I venture to suggest to the Vice-President of the Executive Council that the fairest way will be to leave the number of days allowed for passing entries in the various ports the same as at present. We should not force Victoria to adopt 24 hours, or South Australia to adopt seven days. Let the time remain as at present until we see how this thing works out. I admit that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> may be correct in saying that Sydney wants more than seven days, but the honorable senator should consider that those interested in other ports may prefer a different time. I hope the matter will be arranged fairly to all the various States, and that the circumstances of each port will be taken into consideration. </para>

                    <para>- It would be rather difficult to arrange in the clause for various periods for different ports, but as there is such a difference in the practice, the clause might be amended in such a way as to allow the periods to be fixed &#34; as prescribed &#34; for different ports. That would leave the matter in the hands of the Minister, after consulting .the collectors of customs at the various ports, to prescribe the most suitable time for each, within which entries should be passed. </para>

                        <para>- I still think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Charleston</inline> is under a misapprehension, but, at the same time, I have always recognised that in bringing federation into operation we should be extra careful of the sensibilities of every portion of the Commonwealth. Therefore, if there is a possibility, consistently with the interests of the revenue, of arranging this matter according to local conditions, I shall be very glad to make the necessary amendment. I would not like to pronounce an opinion on the question of whether it would be allowable to have a regulation of trade differentiating one port from another in regard to this matter. That may be quite possible, but the very objections which would apply to treating ports differentially would apply i to a Bill as well as to regulations, so that I there need be no difficulty in that respect. I wish to guard myself from saying that I think such a proposal as has been suggested could be carried out. I am quite willing to follow the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Richard</inline> Baker, and to allow regulations to be made by the Customs authorities, that is by the Executive Government. Regulations will have to be made in regard to hundreds of matters, and this question may well be left to regulations giving the authority which is given here to expand even those regulations if it is necessary. I propose to amend the clause so that it will read in this way - </para>

On the other hand, if it is not possible to do it constitutionally or in any other way, it will not be done.

                        <para>- I do not think it is necessary to say so. It will be quite open to make different regulations for different ports in other matters. There is no use in loading up the clause with the suggestion that there may be differences,when perhaps, it may be found that there is no necessity to have any differences. On the other hand, if it is necessary, and if it is possible constitutionally to make different rules for different ports, it can be done by the wording I suggest. </para>

                    (South Australia.) - I ask leave to withdraw my amendment. At the same time, I would like to have an assurance that the regulations can be so framed as to suit the different conditions. It is extremely difficult to make one suit of clothes fit every person, and I can see very clearly that under federation, where the States conduct their trade under various conditions, it will be almost impossible to have one regulation to guide them. If the words &#34; as may be prescribed &#34; will give all the elasticity which is essential to the successful conduct of the business, I am quite prepared to accept them, and at a later stage, if necessary, we shall have another opportunity to discuss the matter. I hope that
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline>
                    will inform his colleagues that it is the desire of the Senate that the regulations shall be so framed as practically to meet the working conditions of the various ports.

In the case of a ship, hundreds of such entries may have to be passed, and the non-passing of any one entry may lead to a heavy penalty. I do not propose any amendment, but I ask honorable members to bear this clause in mind when we come to the provision that the minimum penalty shall not be less than one-twentieth of the maximum. I shall ask honorable members to strike that provision out, or to allow the minimum to be reduced. </para>

                    <para>- It seems to me that the Government are running great risk in accepting amendments which are proposed on the spur of the moment, and of which honorable members have had no notice. I know of one important Act in the Victorian Legislature, the object of which was entirely defeated by an amendment of a vital clause made at the instance of a. private member. If I were representing the Government I should insist on all amendments being printed, so that every honorable member should have an opportunity of considering them. </para>

                    <para>- I think the word &#34; direct &#34; ought to remain. These transhipped goods are intended to be taken out of the port, and do not pay duty ; and if they are not sent direct to the ship, a. call might be made on some coaster, and a portion of the cargo left there for the purpose of being smuggled. The clause is an exceedingly involved one; and it is difficult to understand the latter* part of it. </para>

It is unreasonable to go beyond that, when the goods have been unshipped under the direction of the collector, permission for which, I presume, is only given after the entries have been passed. The master is, however, to be made responsible until the goods are removed, just as if they had been on board ship all the time. So that, in the event of a robbery or anything of that kind, the master or owner is responsible, although he has placed the goods in a safe place approved by the collector.

It may be necessary, if entries are not passed, to place goods out of the ship for the sake of expediting unloading before there has been an actual delivery by the ship-owner or the consignee.

                        <para>- If the bill of lading provides for any different method, I presume that the contract will have to be carried out. But there will be no real difficulty about the matter. A certain time in most of these cases is allowed to the consignee to take out his goods. It may be necessary for the ship-owner and master to put the goods out of the ship before that period has arrived. Under those circumstances, the owner or master still remains liable. This is not an unusual provision. </para>

                    <para>- This clause shows how necessary it is in the interest of the ship-owner that the time of landing the goods shall be limited as much as possible. In South Australia entries have to be made within 24 hours. Steamers come to a port and leave it again within twelve hours, when they have not many tons of cargo to land, and are able to get a permit to land it from the Collector of Customs. The goods are put into a shed for the 24 hours, and then the consignee must take his goods, or they are at his risk. Under that system a steamship would be released of liability in less than 24 hours, whereas in the other case to which I referred, the liability would, under the clause, remain for seven days. If goods are landed to suit the convenience of the ship-owner, it should be at his expense. </para>

                    <para>- The honorable senator has been on the wrong track, because this particular clause has nothing to do with the time within which people may pass entries. This has to do with the case in which a man has neglected to pass any entry at all, and goods are landed from a ship under the collector&#39;s permit. The ship wants to clear, and the goods are placed in some secure spot selected by the collector. The question then arises - at whose risk are they to remain? It appears to me that they should remain at the risk of the persons at whose risk they would have been, supposing that they had never been landed from the ship. That is- exactly what the clause provides, and that is the proper course to pursue. Under these circumstances, I shall have to vote against the proposed amendment. </para>

But is it reasonable to provide that if these goods have had to be landed in consequence of the neglect of the consignee to pass his entries, and in order to facilitate the business of the ship, which, after all, only conveys the goods from port to port, the ship-owner shall be the person responsible in the event of anything happening to the goods after they are landed

                    I say the consignee should be responsible, the man through whose neglect it has been necessary to land the goods, and place them in the warehouse.

                    <para>- There is another point to which attention has not been directed. It not infrequently happens that goods are landed under a special permit from the collector for the convenience of the ship. Not long since a ship having a large consignment of goods for my firm called at Perth, and by special permit of the collector a considerable portion of those goods was landed at Perth, and subsequently brought on to Melbourne. Honorable senators will agree that, in such a case it is right that the ship should be responsible, and not the consignee. This is an exceptional transaction, and the clause appears to me to provide the only way in which it can be dealt with. </para>

                    <para>- The position depicted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Frederick</inline> Sargood is quite correct, but there is another position about which the honorable senator said nothing. Where the landing of goods is for the convenience of the ship it is quite right that the owner should be held responsible. But supposing the landing of the goods is owing to the default of the owner, ought the same liability to attach to the ship-owner then ? What I should like to know before giving a decision is whether there may not be some clause in the ordinary bill of lading dealing with a matter of this kind. It is possible we may be doing something here which may trench upon some old established shipping custom. </para>

                        <para>- The clause is really in the interests of the ship-owner. The owner of the goods can get them at any time by passing entries. There is power under Clause 67 to deal with a neglect to pass entries. Under that clause the goods maybe removed to a warehouse and in case entries are not passed for them or they are not claimed they can be sold. A shipowner, for his own convenience, may wish to get a collector&#39;s permit by which he can put the whole of his goods out on the wharf. That may be necessary to secure expedition in unloading the ship. The consignee is then in a position to pass his entries and take the goods. But until the goods are lawfully removed they are at the risk of the owner of the ship. Where goods are removed from a ship under a permit in that way, and the ship goes away, it will be open to the collector to take action under clause 67 if entries are not passed for the goods. He will take possession of them and put them into a warehouse, and they will be dealt with in the ordinary way. It must be remembered that the ship-owner is not responsible for the goods for all time, but only until they are lawfully removed, and <inline font-style="italic">they</inline> would be lawfully removed by action taken under clause 67 for the purpose of recovering the duty. A collector would not leave goods for any length of time without taking steps to get the duty upon them. This clause is necessary for the protection of the revenue, and for the convenience of ship-owners in these days when the rapid unloading of ships is of the utmost importance to them. </para>

The clause requires the entries to be passed within a certain time, say seven days, but the bill of lading may require the consignee to take possession of the goods within 24 hours after the ship&#39;s arrival. He is not bound to pass his entry for six days, but the ship-owner may say to him - &#34; You are bound to take your goods within 24 hours, and, therefore, we shall land them at your risk.&#34; In the clause, however, we say that the goods -

                <para class="block">The consignee ought to take his goods within 24 hours of the ship&#39;s arrival, but he fails to do so; is the master then at his own expense to have the goods landed ? Under the clause the collector gives his permit in order that the goods may be unshipped, which is done at the expense of the ship-owner. Then the ship-owner has to pay all the expenses of the goods in the warehouse until the consignee takes lawful possession of them, or the collector takes them out; and during this period of four or five days they are at the risk of the shipowner or master of the ship. It is all very well to say that he protects himself by the bill of lading, but, when he attempts to sue under it, this section is placed before the court, and surely the statute law must override the provision in the bill of lading. In a case like that we are throwing an undue hardship on the master of the ship. It is not a question as between the Government and the ship-master, but as bet ween the shipmaster and the consignee. </para>

                    <para>- -I support the contention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Major Gould.</inline> It is not fair to put on the master of a ship the responsibility of goods being burnt which had to be landed by the default of the owner. The goods may have been landed, the owner may have had an opportunity of entering and taking possession of them, but he did not do so, and the goods were put in a warehouse which that night was burned down. In such a case it would not be justice to demand from the ship the value of the goods which had been destroyed by fire. Moreover it seems to bring about a conflict between the conditions which exist in most bills of lading and the wording of the clause. I should be quite willing for the clause to stand if some words were added to make it apply to a case where the landing was only for the sole advantage of the ship, and where the owner of the goods could not be called on to enter them with the speed desired. </para>

                    for the explanation. I can easily understand the reference- to &#34;skipped&#34; when he tells me that goods can be subject to the operations of pouring. It is quite obvious that goods can be repacked ; but it is not so easy to understand how spirits can be both poured out and repacked, and therefore I understand that the goods referred to in this case are spirits.

                    <para>- I propose to substitute the word &#34;three&#34; for the word &#34;four&#34; in line 1, so that there shall be three classes of licensed warehouses, and then to omit Class I&#39;ll. It will be observed that the first class includes warehouses belonging to people who follow the business of warehousing, and take in goods for all kinds of importers. The second class includes private bonds that belong to importers who are in a considerable way of business. The fourth class includes a warehouse in which, by authority, goods that are to undergo some manufacturing operation may be placed, and the- manufacturing process carried on with a view to- avoiding waste. Then we have something which is to be called a&#34; machinery warehouse, but whether it is to be a private or a general warehouse, or- both, we do not know. This provision appears to me to put on the importers considerable and unnecessary hardship. If an importer has a bonded warehouse of his own, why should he not be allowed to put into it a piece of machinery which he imports ? </para>

                    <para>- I do not think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> has made out a case for an alteration of the clause, the policy of which is very plain. We have general warehouses and private warehouses, and the third class of warehouse is intended to enable places to be used for the storage of machinery and other similar heavy goods. Machinery only will be stored there, and the inspection by the Customs officials thereby made easy. Some of these machinery warehouses at present in Victoria are, I understand, simply open yards; in fact, any place fit for storing such goods may be used as a warehouse, and the clause is a convenience to importers and owners of machinery. </para>

I cannot see any occasion for multiplying warehouses in the way indicated, and I therefore urge that the limitation- I have suggested be adopted.

                    <para>- I go further than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford,</inline> and ask where is the necessity for the warehouses mentioned in Class IV., when general or private warehouses can cover all requirements? I do not see why we should have four classes of warehouses when two would be sufficient. A man might put machinery or any goods used in the course of manufacture in a general warehouse, in the same way as he could put them in his own private warehouse. </para>

                    <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> are to be envied for coming from a State where there is such great freedom in connexion with commercial matters. In Victoria, however, it is absolutely necessary, in the interests of the commercial public, that there should be machinery warehouses. It would not be impossible to put machinery in a private warehouse, but it would be costly ; and there is no necessity to store machinery under cover. As a matter of fact, there are, and have been for years, five machinery warehouses in Victoria the fee for which at present runs from &#163;1 to &#163;25, while the fee for a general warehouse, would be &#163;200, and for a private warehouse &#163;50. Manufacturing warehouses are absolutely necessary. A Customs officer is needed there the whole of the time, and in Victoria the charge is &#163;200, and if another locker is required, another &#163;150. But foi.- private warehouses the charge would not exceed 2s. per hour, or a lump sum of &#163;50. </para>

As to the desirability of manufacturing warehouses there need be no question ; but I look with a great deal of suspicion on the power given to the Minister in connexion therewith. It is not at all desirable that the Minister should have power, at his own discretion and without interference from Parliament, to limit the class of manufacture, trade, or process that may be carried on in a warehouse ; and I shall presently submit an amendment taking away that power. </para>

                    <para>- I am not particular as to the language of the clause, but I can tell the committee where the idea of it came from. It came from South Australia, whence so many good ideas emanate. I do not remember the actual wording of the section in the South Australian Act, but I can give honorable senators an instance in which, while I was Treasurer, I adopted such a practice as would be permitted under this clause. I have no doubt that I did it under legal authority. A man in South Australia wanted to manufacture starch. Starch is made from a good many articles, one of the principal of which is rice. In South Australia we had a duty of so much a pound on rice, lt was not a protective, but a re venue duty. This gentleman wanted to use inferior rice which he imported from various parts of the world, and, as Treasurer, I granted permission to him to import such rice duty free, on the understanding that it was dealt with in a bonded warehouse, under the control of a Customs official, and was used only for the purposes of making starch. That was encouraging an industry precisely in the same way as one could be encouraged under this clause. The Treasurer should be able to do that in certain cases. We may want to impose a duty on articles used for ordinary purposes of consumption, but may desire that those articles shall come in free if they are to be used for manufacturing purposes. Under this clause that could be done. It is therefore necessary to have some such provision, and discretion must be given to some one. It appears to me that the giving of the discretion as here proposed is right and proper. </para>

If that is so,&#34; does the Minister seriously mean that the manufactures which may be carried on in a bonded warehouse should be only such as are determined <inline font-style="italic">by</inline> the Minister ? </para>

                        <para>- The real point of the matter has been put by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford.</inline> That is, that it is necessary to give some control to the Minister in respect of dutiable goods which are allowed to come in free for the purposes of manufacture. But, beyond that, it is not required to give the Minister any other control. It seems to me that it was never intended that the power should go beyond what I have stated. I admit that as the clause is drawn, it is open to the interpretation that it is left to the Minister to decide what manufactures shall be permitted in this manner. There is no necessity for giving that power to the Minister. Therefore, as there may be a misunderstanding, I propose to consent to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould&#39;s</inline> -amendment, but to make the matter -per- fectly clear, I move - </para>

                    <para>- I do not propose to take any exception to the insertion of these words, but they are not necessary. The Minister is not&#39; compelled to license any premises at all. If he thinks that any premises will afford opportunities for fraud, he can, without giving any reason at all, refuse a licence for them. He can, therefore, absolutely protect the department without the insertion of these words. Before he will grant a licence for a warehouse the person applying for it will no doubt have to satisfy him that the premises for which he asks a licence are suitable for the kind of licence he applies for. The clause would perhaps be more comprehensive without these words than with them. The Minister could grant a licence subject to such conditions as he might think fit. </para>

Surely it would be better to give the Minister power to issue . licences subject to such terms and conditions as to him should seem fit. If we are. going &#39;to provide for a regulation, we can only deal with one class, and new regulations may be required to deal with each case.

                    <para>- Why not &#34; a particular account <inline font-style="italic">&#34;?</inline> It seems to me that under the circumstances a particular account ought to be taken. It is evident that an officer could not properly perform his duty without taking a particular account; otherwise he would not know what the goods were. Duty has to be paid upon goods, and for that reason, and because the officers might otherwise lose the run of the goods, it is necessary that a particular account should be taken. There is no doubt that the power of dealing with matters by regulation is useful, but when it is clear that a matter must be dealt with in this clearly defined way there is no use in leaving it to be dealt with by regulation. </para>

Whatever the class of goods may be of which an account has to be taken, certain details will be required. Whether the duty is to be paid by weight or by measurement, various details will require to be considered ; but I contend that it would be better to say that the account to be taken shall be &#34; as prescribed.&#34; I am certain that, whether the words I suggest are inserted or not, the officers will be directed as to the particulars that are required. I have no desire to press the amendment.

                        <para>- I do not think we could leave it to the collector ; it would be a bad thing to give him any more authority than is necessary. He might allow it in one case and not in. another where it might just as fairly be allowed. Honorable senators will see that in regard to some goods, such as spirituous liquors, upon which the duty must always be high, there will always be a temptation to evade the payment of the duty where possible, and if we permitted repacking in such cases we should risk the loss of a large quantity of goods. That is the reason why in all cases the authority to pack and repack and bottle is restricted, and the work is to be done under authority only. It is exactly the same principle as that of allowing goods to be imported in certain sized packages only. At first sight that seems to be a very grave interference with the liberty of the subject, but it has always been recognised that if dutiable articles are allowed to be imported in smaller packages than the sizes specified smuggling is facilitated, and the detection of smuggling made more difficult. This is really a. regulation of that kind. We must take it that the regulation will be reasonable, and that there will be no more interference than is necessary. </para>

                    <para>. - Where dutiable articles are allowed to be warehoused for manufacturing purposes, and a portion of them is used in the manufacture of goods, then the duty which is prescribed represents the proportion of the article which has been used for manufacturing purposes. Supposing, for example, that a certain amount of caustic soda is necessary for the manufacture of soap, and that it is a dutiable article ; it is allowed to go into the factory, and when the soap comes out for home consumption the regulations prescribe the amount of duty which shall be paid on the caustic soda it contains. That, I think, is the explanation of the clause. </para>

It is to be &#34; as prescribed by regulation.&#34; It does not say clearly that the duty is only to be proportionate to the duty on the goods used in the manufacture of the article. Supposing that so much caustic soda was used in the manufacture of a parcel of soap as would entitle the revenue to a duty of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5,</inline> there is apparently nothing to say that the collector could not impose a duty of &#163;10. We want the clause to be so clear that there will be no necessity for an appeal. It is desirable that an amendment shall be made to carry out what is really the intention of the clause. I am not prepared at the moment to suggest the form of the amendment. </para>

                    <para>- I understand exactly what the clause aims at, and although the language is possibly a little involved, still it is evident what it means. Supposing that a man is manufacturing an article, we allow him, under certain rules and conditions, to store in his warehouse any dutiable raw material which he requires to use in the manufacturing process. We do not want to charge any duty in respect of any portion of the dutiable article which he may export in the manufactured goods. But we want him to pay the duty on the dutiable article which was used in the manufactured goods entered for home consumption and sold to the merchants. As I read the clause, it expresses that meaning, though perhaps not so clearly as it might do. I think it will accomplish that object. Under no circumstances will the regulations be able to impose a duty higher than that which is prescribed in the Tariff. </para>

                    <para>- A suggestion has been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Charleston</inline> to substitute the words &#34; as may be required by the Tariff.&#34; Take the case of a soap manufacturer who uses raw material which is subject to a duty. He is not to be charged the duty imposed on soap, but the duty chargeable on the raw material he used if it is liable to a duty. This is purely a matter of calculation, and it is to be based on the Tariff. Any regulation which imposed a duty heavier than was justified by the Tariff would be <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires.</inline> It is only on the dutiable ingredients used in the manufacture of the soap that the manufacturer has to pay duty when the soap is entered for home consumption. I do not see how the meaning could be better expressed than it is. </para>

I think it might be made very much clearer than it is, but I am not prepared with an amendment, and in the face of the assurance from the Minister we might very well allow it to go as it is.

                    <para>- This clause is to enable the collector to interfere where he thinks there is fraudulent dealing with goods. The storing of goods in a private warehouse is a privilege granted by the Crown, and the clause simply leaves it to the discretion of the collector to withdraw that privilege, if he considers there are sufficient grounds for doing so. If there be reason to believe that goods are being dealt with in such a way as to cause loss of revenue, there must be this power of control. </para>

The clause as it stands enables the collector, for some whim or fancy, or on suspicion, to order the owner of a private warehouse to remove all goods within a few hours, or pay duty on them.

                    -- This clause is really for the benefit of &#39; the owner of the goods. Goods which have been in a warehouse for some time may have become lessened in weight or in value, and if the duty had to be paid on the goods as they had went into the warehouse, a grave injustice might be done to the owner, for whose benefit the fresh measurements or weights are taken. A special officer has to be called in to do the work; and it is only right that the owner should pay the cost, seeing that it is quite sufficient for the Government to have the work done once. If the clause be amended in the way suggested, it would be left iri the power of the Government to either grant or refuse the request of the owner, and the next clause deals with one set of circumstances under which this request may be made. That clause provides that warehoused&#39; goods which are subject to
                    <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem,</inline>
                    duty, arid which have deteriorated in value, may be re-valued on the application of the owner, and that the duty shall be paid according to the result if&#39; the&#39; collector is satisfied that the deterioration has been accidentally caused. The deterioration may be in value, or by loss of weight, and it is only reasonable that the party who wants the re-guaging or remeasuring should pay the expense. . If the amendment bts carried it would be much against the interests of the owners of- goods.

                    <para>- I would point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Charleston</inline> that if the committee strike out the- words to which he has taken exception, we have to suppose that a locker is a competent officer to handle- all kinds of things. It is absurd to suppose that for the salary paid to these officers, we can can have men competent, say, to gauge spirits and &#39;then to turn round and examine a bale- of calico goods. These examinations, if at the instance of the Government, should be paid for by the Government, but if for the benefit of the importer should be paid for by him. It is not unreasonable to suppose that the Government will send a competent officer, and in such cases the person asking for the officer should pay for his service. </para>

It is possible that in a great port like Melbourne there may be- a subdivision of duties. It is only fair that a warehouse-keeper who asks that goods should be re-gauged or re-weighed, should not have to pay again if the work is done by a locker whose services he has already paid for.

                    <para>- I do not think the honorable senator, should, ask me for any such promise. The- position of the Government is quite clear. In the first place, re-gauging and re-measuring is skilled work, and the services- of those who do it should be paid for. In addition to that, very often a great deal of labour is involved. Take the case of warehouses where large casks of sugar, or cement are dealt with. Some one must pay foi: these services. If the labour of pulling down this sugar or cement is for the benefit of the owner of the goods, why should the Government pay for it? The line of- division between <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Charleston</inline> and the Government is absolutely deal-, and I believe the majority of the committee will be of the same opinion. </para>

                    <para>- I think that ought to be a new clause, but at the present time I see no necessity or reason for it. It seems to me that without amendment the clause serves precisely the same purpose. It provides that where goods subject to. an <inline font-style="italic">ad. valorem</inline> duty have deteriorated in value, and the deterioration has been caused accidentally, there may be a re-valuation, and. duty shall be paid according to the result of the re-valuation. I take it that is the object of the honorable senator&#39;s new clause. </para>

                        <para>- It goes a little further than that. The clause we &#39; are dealing with allows a re-valuation of goods which have deteriorated, but which are actually in the warehouse ; but what I suggest would permit a re-valuation for the purpose of fixing the duty whether the goods were subject to <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> or specific duty, and though they may have been destroyed in the course of delivery, either from the ship or from the warehouse after duty has been paid. </para>

                    <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> has pointed out that a later clause will practically deal with the point which is raised by this amendment. Clause 156 provides that where goods have received damage or been pillaged on the voyage, or have been damaged, pillaged, lost, or destroyed whilst under Customs control, a remission of the duty shall be made. The amendment carries this opportunity of giving the remission a little further in favour of the importer, who loses his goods by some unavoidable accident; but it does not carry it so far as was suggested earlier in the evening. - that is, beyond the first man who has to receive the goods. It would not be construed as some honorable senators seem to anticipate, to enable not only the first man, but possibly the second man, to demand a refund of the duty. Supposing a tobacconist had taken a lot of dutiable goods out of bond, and that they were destroyed by fire on his premises, he would not be entitled to a remission of the duty because the operation of the amendment is limited to those cases where the goods are destroyed in the delivery from the warehouse, or the shipping thereof. It could only apply to some accident which occurred immediately after the payment of the duty. When a man pays the duty he anticipates the sale of the goods in order to recoup himself the amount of the duty and the cost price, and when he has -had no opportunity of making a sale of his goods, surely it is reasonable to refund the duty he has paid. Once the goods are put into a man&#39;s premises he has an opportunity to protect himself by insurance. If the principle is once admitted that a man is to be entitled to a refund of the duty under such circumstances as are mentioned in clause 156, surely it is equally reasonable that he should not be put to the loss of the duty where an accident happens immediately after the duty is paid, although the goods are not at that moment under Customs control, but are on the way to his place of business. If any man who lost his goods by fire or avoidable accident could come down on the Government for a refund of the duty, it would be manifestly unjust in the interests of the Commonwealth generally. Such a provision, would lend itself to fraud and robbery in all directions. &#34;Under the amendment there would be no more opening for fraud than there would be under clause 156, if the goods were pillaged on the voyage. It is a reasonable and fair amendment, and when we find that it has been the law of Great Britain since 1876, und perhaps for years previously, we may assume that there is very good reason for having such a provision in our law. &#39; It may be urged that the fiscal policy of Great Britain is different from what the fiscal policy of the Commonwealth will be ; that while only a few goods are subject to duty there, a large number will be subject to duty here. That objection could not apply to this provision because, whether it is inserted in a protective or <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> free - trade Tariff, the principle is based on abstract justice, fair play toward the importer and honesty. It will not defraud the Government in anyway, because the goods which have been destroyed will have to be replaced by dutiable goods. Only a certain amount of dutiable goods can be consumed within the year, and whether a large quantity of dutiable goods is consumed by fire or not, practically the amendment will not make any difference to the Government, but will enable them to do an act of justice towards a person who, through no fault of his own, has had valuable property destroyed before he has had an opportunity of getting back a Celll. of the duty he has paid. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think there is really very much difference of opinion as to the principle which ought to be adopted, but this amendment is very different from the one which was suggested, as I understood it, when the matter was first mentioned. Whilst it may be a very fair thing to allow a remission of duty where the goods have been damaged while under Customs control, it is a different thing when the goods are damaged after they have passed out of Customs control. By comparing clauses 156 and. 30, it will be seen that we have done in a shorter way everything that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> asks for. Clause 156 says - </para>

Until the goods are in the ship in which they are to be taken away, they are under Customs control, and the Bill provides for every contingency which the honorable senator&#39;s amendment aims at. If the accident takes place in transit from the warehouse, and before the actual delivery is complete, say, in the case of transhipment, we give the owner the right to demand the remission of the duty, and that is all the English Act gives. While I thoroughly concur in the principle the honorable senator wishes to adopt, I say that that principle is already carried out in the clauses I have mentioned. </para>

My amendment covers a case of loss in which duty has actually been paid on the goods.

                        <para>-I am willing to accept the principle up to the point that, wherever an accident happens while the goods are actually under Customs control, there should be a reimbursement of the duty; and that is provided for in the Bill. If the duty has been paid and anything happens when goods for home consumption are being delivered by lighter from the warehouse to a wharf, then, delivery not having been completed, the owner of the goods is entitled to a reimbursement of the duty under the clauses I have quoted. But if the goods have been actually delivered on the wharf or in some other way, and they are being sent to somewhere far inland, surely the honorable senator does not ask that in case of accident the Government are to be held responsible fora reimbursmentof the duty until the goods actually reach the place of final delivery!When once the Customs officials deliver the goods for home consumption they ought to be able to wash their hands of the matter, otherwise there would be a great deal of difficulty with claims made in respect of the subsequent destruction of the goods. The English section does not go a single step further than the clauses to which I have directed attention. </para>

                <para>SenatorLt.-Col. NEILD. - It would never happen that goods for home consumption would be sent in a lighter to the wharf . When the Customs officers part with the goods at the door of the bond, there is an end to their control.However, I do not think that the question is worth fighting. If goods imported for home consumption are lost in transit in the Commonwealth, the duty would be only a small portion of the loss, unless the goods happened to be spirits or something of that kind ; and so long as goods are water borne all risk can be covered by marine insurance, which would entail no more trouble on the owner of the goods, while the expense would be infinitesimal. </para>

I should think that delivery of goods for conveyance byrail,say, to Bourke, would be complete when they had been handed over to the railway people, and delivery of goods for conveyance by sea to a port in Queensland when they had been placed on board the steamer. It is to meet the internal only that, in accordance with the English practice, I ask the committee to accept the amendment.

That is exactly what Senator Pulsford is asking the Commonwealth Government to do with reference to the just dues of those who have Customs transactions. If it is unreasonable &#39;in one respect.it is unreasonable in .another. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> first made this proposal, I was inclined &#39;to .waver .a bit on account of .my generosity ; but realizing the position in which the- Commonwealth has placed i itself in respect to -those goods while they are under Commonwealth control, I hold that the Customs department has done all that is necessary, and that could be expected of it. I hope that honorable senators will take the truly, commercial .and financial view, and treat the customers of the Commonwealth Customs department just as financial and commercial men -treat their customers. </para>

                    (Tasmania). - It seems to me that this debate hinges almost entirely on the meaning to be attributed to the word &#34;delivery.&#34;
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline>
                    has given to that word a meaning that is limited practically to a single act. In other words, &#34;delivery&#34; according to him seems to represent something instantaneous. Clause 30 says that goods shall be subject to the control of the Customs department from the time of importation to the time of delivery. We have to give to the word &#34; delivery &#34; in. that clause an instantaneous effect. We have to regard it as a single act. It would allow no opportunity for loss. But it is evident from reading the English Act that &#34; delivery &#34; can mean something else. It seems to me to distinctly imply a process spread over a certain amount of time. The English Act says -

                <para class="block">It is obvious that if delivery were an instantaneous act, the word &#34; loss &#34; could not be used in connexion with it. ,It would be absurd to say that one could lose an article subject to duty if it only underwent a change of hands. But inasmuch as a loss in delivery, is contemplated, I contend that &#34; delivery&#34; must mean .a , process. In the English Act it means something represented better by a process than by .an instantaneous act. </para>

                    (New South Wales). - Allow me to give .an illustration . to &#62; the committee. Supposing that 100 tons, of sugar lying in a bonded warehouse at the water&#39;s side- have had ;&#163;500 cash paid in duty upon , them. it may take one, two, three, or fo.ur days perhaps to deliver that sugar in lighters to the warehouse. When one-half of the sugar has been .delivered there may be .an accident . on the river. Some, vessel may collide with the lighter and half the sugar mav be- lost. Is it not a fair thing that the Customs department should refund to the owner of the.sugar the amount represented by. the sugar that has been lost &#39; at the .very door of the warehouse1? That is a thing that might easily happen, and in a great country like Australia it is a fair and proper thing that we should have a reasonable clause in our Customs Act so as to secure that the revenue derived from goods refers only to goods that are consumed; and not to goods that do not go into consumption.

                <para>That is, where it is delivered into a ship. In those cases where there is an accident unavoidably occurring in the delivery, there may be a remission of duty. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> is perfectly right in his statement about the meaning of the word &#34; delivery.&#34; It means handing over the goods out of the warehouse into the hands of the person who takes them out for home consumption. I quite agree that that is not one instantaneous act. Supposing there is a water-side bond; that goods are being slung out of the bond into the ship in sling brakes, and that they are damaged, neither under the English Act nor under this Bill could there be any doubt that there is a right to the remission of duty. Supposing the goods are delivered into a lighter safely, and that they are damaged while the lighter is taking them to another ship or to another store, it is quite clear that the English Act would not give protection under those circumstances. The English Act does not give anything more than protection before delivery, or while the delivery from the warehouse is going on, and until it is complete. It is complete when the goods are handed over into the control of the owner of the goods, or into the control of his agent, or into his lighter, or to his drayman, or to whoever else maybe deputed to receive them. If the owner sends his dray for the goods, and in the course of taking them a cask falls, and all the bottles in it are smashed, no duty would be payable, or there would be a right to remission ; but if, after the cask is got on the dray, and while it is being taken through the streets, an accident happens - after the goods are outside the control of the Customs - why should the Customs be obliged to remit the duty? Under those circumstances the Customs, having no control, could not know what was happening to the goods. It must be obvious that the cases I have referred to are the only cases contemplated by the English section. It must be admitted also that the words &#34; until delivered for home consumption &#34; must mean until completely delivered for home consumption, because if while the goods are being delivered any * accident takes place, they are still under the control of the Customs. This is the way to test it. Suppose that while the goods are actually in the slings it is found that there is something wrong about them - that there has been some smuggling - the Customs would undoubtedly have the right to stop them in the slings. Undoubtedly, therefore, delivery is not complete at that stage. Just in the same way, there may be at that stage a claim for remission of duty. Under these circumstances there is no need for the amendment, as all that the English Act provides for is provided in this clause. </para>

That should show that they have an interest in these warehouses. Although the Customs are here dealing with private individuals, the warehouses are in a sense public, and under public control, and there seems to me no reason why the Customs officials should not aid iri the collection of the dues for these warehouses, it is a common provision which honorable senators will find in all these Customs statutes. </para>

                    (New South Wales).Senator O&#39;Connor pointed out the double charges that are running through this matter, and advanced that as a reason why this clause should remain as it is. But the double charges only run for six months, and we, have a provision in the Bill under which the Government may have to wait for three years before they get their duty. If the owner of the warehouse is prepared to wait for three years for his rent, why should he not be allowed to do so? It should be entirely a matter of private arrangement between the owner of the goods and the owner of the warehouse in which they are bonded.

                    <para>- The reason for the clause .is that the warehouses are licensed, and pay a rent to the Crown, and, to a certain extent, it is the manifest duty of the Government to protect the owners of them. It is not as if this clause entailed needless interference on the part of the Government, because the power given is permissive and not mandatory, and under certain conditions it is desirable that the Government should be able to move in the matter. The clause seems to me to be a reasonable one. </para>

The owner of a warehouse should recover his .money as any ordinary person would have to do. I could quite understand this proposal where goods were bonded in a King&#39;s warehouse.It would be reasonable in such a case that the collector should have power to sell goods for the purpose of defraying the warehouse charges; but it is not reasonable to give an ordinary individual owning a warehouse this extremely summary way of collecting his money. </para>

                    <para>- I am inclined to agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> in his original attitude with regard to this clause. In changing from the arbitrary number &#34; six &#34; to the arbitrary number &#34; nine &#34; I do not think we can be said to have done any one any good. Whether we leavein&#34;six&#34; or &#34;nine&#34; it is desirable that the person who owns the goods should have some notice of the intention to sell, and there is no such provision in the clause as it stands. Before <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connoraccepted</inline> the amendment to insert the word nine,&#34; I was about to suggest that a way out of the difficulty would-be to give the collector power to sell at one month&#39;s notice. These warehouse charges may be looked upon as a second mortgage for a fixed term of six months, the Government having the first mortgage for the fixed term of three years, for the payment of duty. A mortgagor has the right to one month&#39;s notice, even if his term is fixed. But under this clause, unless the owner of the goods keeps his eyes open, and has a full knowledge of the due date, he may see his goods sold entirely against his inclination. I think the clause should provide - </para>

                    <para>- While under this clause there <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> a power given to destroy goods which, in the opinion of the collector are not worth the duty payable on them, there is no provision made for consulting the owner, who may think that the goods are worth considerably more than the duty payable on them. The consent of the owner should be got before the goods are destroyed. In the second portion of the clause it is provided that the licensee of the warehouse shall be able to recover rent and charges on the goods from, the owner, and under these circumstances it seems to me that it is not fair to the owner that the collector should destroy the goods without his consent, merely because, in the opinion of the collector, they are not worth the duty payable upon them. </para>

But under this clause, when the Customs authorities propose to do something else, there is the owner ready to hand. I am troubled to know how they are to find the owner under this clause if he cannot be discovered when required under clause96, when a notice is to be served on him for his own benefit.

                        <para>- Surely my honorable friend does not say that the term &#34; combustible or inflammable goods &#34; means only goods that will burn. What is clearly intended are such goods as benzine, naphtha, fireworks, petroleum, kerosene, gasolene, and matches.Why should there not be a power in the Customs-house officer to see that care is taken in the storing of such goods? If there must be a power placed in his hands it cannot be limited by putting a definition by the Bill, because there may be a combination of goods which it may not be possible to foresee in any system of regulations . It is so much to the interest of the Custom-house itself, as well as to that of the owners of goods and the keepers of these stores,that everything should be worked amicably, and to the mutual convenience of all parties that it must not be presumed that the Customs-house officials will take upon themselves unnecessarily the power of throwing out goods, or making any unreasonable conditions. They will exercise these stringent powers only when they are essential. It must be admitted that there ought to be a power of this kind, to be used when the occasion arises. </para>

                    <para>-The expression used here is the correct one. The object of having free goods entered at all is that the Customs-house officials shall have a complete knowledge of what is on board a ship. When the clearance is given the ship may go away, and the three days may run after she has gone.We must keep control, and the object of the provision is to compel an entry to be made, so that we shall know all about the goods before we give the certificate of clearance. </para>

                <para class="block">The words to which I take exception are not necessary for the protection of the revenue. The revenue cannot suffer, because the exporter cannot get any drawback until the goods are actually beyond his control, and in possession of the ship. It is unjust to the exporter to ask for security from him when such goods are beyond his control. Any one wishing to send to England some Boomerang Brandy would be surprised if he were asked to give security that the goods should be delivered in London. The general practice in Tasmania is that security is given by the ship-owner or agent by a general bond, lt is evident that this provision is taken from a very old Act, passed at a time when the owner of the ship was usually the owner of the goods. I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> said the other day that the clause was inserted to prevent goods being returned. But the exporter could not prevent goods being returned. The revenue is sufficiently protected under clause 12.1, where it is provided that no drawback may be recovered unless a certificate is secured from the port of landing. </para>

                    <para>- Clause 121 certainly gives a very great security for the carrying out of the law, because it is required that a certificate shall be given to the Collector of Customs of any goods subject to the control of the Customs. This certificate is to be produced in proof of the due landing of the goods exported. The collector may refuse to allow any other goods to be exported by any person who has failed to produce a certificate concerning, any previous goods exported by him. The clause now under discussion makes the person who has exported the goods give a certificate that they have been dealt with according to the entry, and in default he is not allowed to export any other goods. It puts a block upon his dealings with the Customs-house, and makes him careful to see that the entry is carried out. That is to say, if the goods are to be exported to a certain place, he takes good care that they go there. That is the purpose the clause has in view. I am not quite certain that clause 121 is sufficient. It seems to me to be necessary that the Customs should have some provision with regard to the goods themselves. Clause 121 is all very well after the goods have gone, because it provides that a certificate shall be given. But that certificate can only be made effectual as a remedy if the person who has given a wrong certificate wishes to export more goods. In this clause it is provided that a certificate shall be given that the goods are landed at the place for which they are entered. Therefore the person who exports goods will take good care to know what is going to be done with them. I do not see any hardship in the owner of goods having to give a security of this kind. </para>

                    <para>- I do not think that the Vice-President of the Executive Council thoroughly understands this matter. He speaks of it as being a simple affair. As a matter of fact the clause is really a copy of a very old section of a very old Act. An exporter may send goods to New Zealand ; all he does is to pass the drawback entries absolutely correctly. The goods then go on board a ship, and the exporter loses all control over them. Whether the ship reaches its destination, or whether the goods are re-landed in Victoria, he has no power whatever over them. The Bill asks the exporter to give a certificate to the effect that the goods shall be landed at the place to which they are entered. To ask him to do that is to ask an impossibility. What happened when this provision was in force in Victoria? There was then a considerable trade between Victoria and New Zealand. The Customs department required a certain form to be signed by the merchant in Victoria and then a declaration had to be made by the customer in New Zealand that he had received the goods. It was carried out for a few months, after which the New Zealand buyers simply rebelled. They said they would not bother to sign these declarations, and that the Victorian Customs must look after their own interests. Our friends in New South Wales very wisely stepped in, and, not requiring this absurd declaration, took the trade from Victoria. A similar thing will happen again if this provision is to be enforced. First of all it is impossible for the seller to sign such a declaration honestly, and, secondly, he cannot carry it out. It is nonsense to punish him for what he cannot do. </para>

                        <para>- This provision is on the statute-book in all the States except Tasmania, where an amendment was adopted a little while ago putting the duty of giving the certificate on the master of the ship. But the master&#39;s certificate may be of little value to the Customs officials in the event of his never coming back again. I really do not see that there will be very much advantage in adopting the Tasmanian system. On the other hand, I freely admit, after the statement of experienced gentlemen like Senators Macfarlane and Sargood, that there is a good deal of difficulty in carrying out the provision, which has been to some extent a dead letter. As the same effect can practically be obtained under clause 121, and as the amount of benefit which is derived from having this clause upon the statute-book does not appear to be worth talking about, I shall consent to the amendment. </para>

                    <para>- The honorable senator is quite right in thinking that it will be necessary to have a clearance at every port. That is provided for in the Bill. The long elaborate section of the English Act is not really necessary. The honorable senator will see that the clause as it is will apply. If a ship going from one port to another - say, from Perth to Adelaide - does any business at Adelaide, it must be entered with the Customs there, and then the ship must get another clearance if she is going out again. If there is no dealing with the Customs-house at all, and the vessel simply lands passengers, her clearance outwards may not be necessary, but wherever it is necessary to get a certificate of clearance, these particulars must be given. </para>

I know that it means a detailed, statement of the cargo carried, and that it does not include stores. But according to this clause the master of a ship would be precluded from taking stores on board,&#39; because they would not be referred to in the manifest.

                        <para>- There is another reason why stores should, not be specially referred to in the clause, and it is that we are dealing now with a matter which is regulated by a well-recognised and established practice, and if we depart from it by inserting here; words that are not usually found in existing Acts, we may be doing something to the disadvantage of - the ship-owners themselves. I understand that the same kind of provision is to be found in other similar Acts. </para>

I presume that when this Bill has been finally passed we shall- be favoured with a list of regular tions, extending perhaps to twice the length of the Bill, and which will be added legislation.

                        <para>- It was pointed out very clearly on clause 112 that it was not a reasonable thing to expect a merchant, who had disposed of his goods, to give a security of this character, and that is one reason why the clause was amended. Having amended clause 112, clause 121 is unnecessary, as well as undesirable. When a merchant has exported his goods and has lost absolute control of them, how can he be afterwards held responsible for the due landing of the goods in any other part of the world ? It is quite unreasonable to require a certificate of this kind, and how much more unreasonable is the latter part of the clause, which says that the collector may refuse to allow any other goods, subject to the control of the Customs, to- be exported by any person who fails within a reasonable time to produce such certificate of the landing of any such goods previously exported by him ? Is that a reasonable provision to put into any Customs Bill, and is there any necessity for it in order to protect the Customs revenue ? We have already recognised the fact that, once goods are exported, the man who exports them cannot by any possibility be responsible for the due landing of them in any portion- of the world, and now under this clause we are going to enact that the collector may require from&#39; him a certificate of the due landing of the goods. We recognise that&#39; the exporter cannot be responsible, and then we go on to say that if he does not give a certificate on a matter which cannot be within his knowledge, he is not to be allowed in future to export any goods which are &#39;under Customs control. </para>

                    <para>- Nearly all the- business which is done in goods which go out under drawback, or which, are subject to Customs control, is Inter-State business. After the uniform Tariff comes into force, there will be very little business of that kind done, and therefore&#39; the- position is-widely different when the provision is made to refer to traffic which takes place between Australia and Europe: Supposing that a sailing-vessel takes such goods from Australia to Europe. In the ordinary course she will be from three to four months, perhaps five or six months.) in -making the voyage. Before it is- possible to get the certificate out, even if it can be obtained at the other side of the world, much more than six months may elapse, but all sorts of things may happen to prevent the obtaining of the certificate in Europe. For instance, the importer in Europe may fall out with his shipper, and may be unwilling to &#39;do anything to oblige him ; and. with every desire to obtain the certificate the exporter may find it absolutely impossible to do so. In this way month after month may elapse- and business may be- entirely blocked without any fault on the part of the shipper, and yet he may b&#38; branded as being constructively a swindler. Again, a vessel which happens to founder at sea, in the absence of any information, will not be listed as lost until probably nine months after her &#39;departure from Australia, and until she is so listed it will be impossible for th&#39;e shipper of the- goods to give a satisfactory explanation. That is an&#39; instance <inline font-style="italic">iti</inline> which there would be prolonged delay in giving the required information. In many other cases it would be absolutely impossible for the shipper to give -the information. </para>

                    <para>- The committee will see from the form of the clause that it is really a reserve power. It is not to be enforced in&#39; every case. It is not part of the ordinary routine on the outward shipment of goods ; it is simply a reserve power, and the question is whether it ought to be given. It is to be assumed that the powers given in the Bil! will be- exercised reasonably. If they are- not to be exercised reasonably we might just as well tear up&#39; the Bill, and any Customs Acts in force in the States, because in all of them powers are given which if exercised unreasonably or unfairly would turn the Custom-house into the most oppressive engine of tyranny that one could possibly imagine. It is only because these powers are necessary and have to be exercised on certain occasions that they are to be intrusted to the hands of these officers with the belief, generally well justified, that they will not be put into execution unless the necessity arises. Government officers, like every body else, do not like to undertake heavy responsibilities without some reason. Customs officers do not take upon themselves the exercise of these powers unless there is some justification. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator is often in a position in which it may be to his interest to take one view of the Customs officers&#39; duty, and to their interest to take another view. I think, considering his position, he shows a wonderful fairness in dealing with the Bill. At the same time, no one can deny that it is sometimes to the interest of persons not to take the same view of the matter as the Custom-house officer. What cases is this reserve power intended to deal with ? Goods are landed here to be exported to New Caledonia or some other place outside the Commonwealth. They go into a bonded warehouse and are re-shipped without payment of any duty. But, instead of going to New Caledonia or to the islands, or to whatever place they are shipped to, they are taken away to some part of the Commonwealth, for instance, to Northern Queensland or to Western Australia. To deal with such cases this reserve power is given. If it is found that there has been smuggling going on, and that a particular person has been identified with that smuggling, it is within the power of the Customhouse official to say to him, if he has been connected with the goods - &#34;We wish to have a certificate from you that the goods have been disposed of in accordance with your export entry.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- Not necessarily, because there may be a person who was in charge of the goods. After all, the certificate is not like the evidence of a person who actually saw the goods landed. Any information which a person can depose to is sufficient. It is not to be sworn to ; it is simply a statement of information. It is a power which ought to be in the hands of Customs officials when they find that any suspicious dealing has been going on with regard to the export of goods. If a Customhouse officer suspects a particular person he will say - &#34; I want a certificate of the landing of the goods in accordance with the entry.&#34; What difficulty is there in giving that power <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> It is a power which must be exercised with care. It involves responsibility, and if it is exercised with care, can there be any doubt that it will be put in force except in cases where it is highly necessary that it should ?

                        <para>- It is in force in New Zealand for the very same reason as it is required in the Commonwealth. New Zealand is an island, with Australia not very far off, and it would be perfectly easy for a ship to clear from New Zealand for Australia, and to run back to that colony after a while and smuggle in the goods. So here, where Australia is one fiscal area, it would be perfectly simple for a ship to clear for New Zealand or the islands, or some other place outside the jurisdiction, and to , come back and run the goods into some part of the Commonwealth. This power cannot touch or affect the honest trader. The very form of the clause shows that it is intended as a reserve power to be put in force only where Custom-house officials have reason to suspect that some smuggling, or illegal dealing with goods, Ls going on, and to enable them to trace it out if necessary, or, at all events, to enable them to treat as a marked man any one whom they find has been so engaged. I hope that the committee will regard this as one of those powers which are necessary for the protection of the revenue, which really cannot affect the honest trader, and which, following the very good precedent of New Zealand, ought to remain for the collection of the customs of Australia. </para>

                    (New South Wales). - The Minister has whittled away the value of the certificate. He says that there is no difficulty in giving a certificate. If anybody can give a certificate, as he says, what is the good of the clause, unless there is some proof required in support of it? If there is no means of punishing the person who gives a false certificate, what is the good of the provision ? I submit that, according to his own explanation, it is of very little value.

                        <para>- No; all the man has to do is to give a false certificate, and then the clause is no good at all. Does that not show how the value of the clause is being whittled down? If a man is going to defraud the Customs in the way which is contemplated, is he likely to make much trouble or difficulty in giving a certificate that his goods have been landed in the proper way ? If the Customs officials require proof of the landing of the goods, they have to go outside the Commonwealth and get it from people over whom we have no control, who can snap their fingers in our face. It shows how little value the clause is. It is not necessary to have any suspicion of fraud ; there is not even to be an allegation of fraud or any suspected case of fraud. How much better it will be, if the clause is to remain, to place this power in the hands of only the comptroller. As he has the right to delegate any authority to a collector or other official, it would get over the difficulty of the power being possibly acted upon by any Customs officer. </para>

                <para class="block">That is not a reasonable provision to insert, and it would be almost unworkable. I would also suggest that if a man does not produce his certificate he shall be liable to a penalty. Put in a penalty of &#163;100, or whatever sum you see fit, but eliminate those words. With that alteration you will be able to punish a man who fails to produce his certificate by inflicting upon him a pecuniary penalty, but if the Government have sufficient ground to charge the man with the commission of a fraud, such as smuggling, they can indict him and punish him. It may be that a man may &#39;not be able to give a certificate for some reason or other, and when it cannot be given he has a very severe punishment placed on him. Surely a penalty of &#163;100 will be a sufficiently severe punishment, and it will be entirely in the discretion of the court to- say whether the penalty should be &#163;100 or 100s. </para>

                    <para>- Some time ago I asked a question about papers presented in another place, and as to whether they could not be presented in the two Houses simultaneously. I understand that these papers have already been laid on the table of another place. It is only fair that all papers shall be presented simultaneously, so that we may know exactly what we are doing in connexion with debates that arise. </para>

                        <para>- Some time ago instructions were given that papers should be simultaneously laid on the table of both Houses, and I understood that that was being done. But it appears that there has been some mistake about the matter. I can assure the Senate that my honorable and learned friend the Postma&#34;sterGeneral and I have put matters in train for insuring that in all cases papers shall be laid simultaneously upon the table of both Houses. There may be a difficulty in cases where there is a heavy bundle of documents which have not been previously printed, and it may be necessary to have them formally sent from one Chamber to another. But where it is possible there will be a simultaneous &#39;laying on the table Of both Houses of papers, so that the first intimation that documents have been presented shall be from the papers themselves, and not from any outside source. </para>
