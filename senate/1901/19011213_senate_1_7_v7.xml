          <para>- I desire to put on record my protest, not only against the general character of this Bill, but also, and more particularly, against the way in which it was introduced here and carried through its various stages. In effect it is a postal tariff, and it ought to have been accompanied with all the information that is necessary for its due consideration. That information ought to have been in the hands of honorable senators sufficiently long to enable them to grasp all its details. The Bill should not have been proceeded with until the public of Australia had had a reasonable opportunity offered them of understanding how its details would affect not only the finances of the States, but the various and complicated business interests. I hope, however, that the other House will be afforded fuller details before the Bill is debated, as it is one of great financial importance. It ought to be an understood thing that an important measure affecting the finances of the States generally, and even affecting important business interests, should not be rushed on either House, and should not be passed until the whole of Australia has had an opportunity of carefully considering all the details and of expressing public opinion thereon. </para>

          <para>- Before the Bill is read a third time I should like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> to explain to me the effect of the first schedule. In Tasmania many newspapers are sent separately by the proprietors to private individuals. If these newspapers come under the second section of the first schedule, which provides that there shall be1/2d. postage paid on newspapers posted within the Commonwealth for transmission therein, for each newspaper the subscriber will have to pay l1/2d. Will it be possible under the first portion of the first schedule to post in one parcel all the newspapers which are going to a district? Supposing, for instance, that a dozen subscribers to a newspaper live in a small country town, will the Postmaster-General allow the proprietor to bundle together those newspapers, although they are separately addressed, and allow the postmaster at the country town to distribute them to each subscriber? </para>

          <para>- It is through a misapprehension of the wording of the schedule that a good deal of the opposition which was manifested in the first place against the provision arose. We take newspapers in bulk, and weigh them and carry them at the rate of1d. per lb., no matter how many or how few may be in one wrapper, but all separately addressed. We go further than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> desires. We not only accept them and weigh them by bulk when they are to be sent to one separate district, but we do exactly the same if they are to be sent all over the Commonwealth. Newspapers separately addressed all over the Commonwealth can be brought by a proprietor or newsvendor to the post-office, and there weighed in bulk and charged at the rate of1d. per lb. The rate, therefore, for a newspaper weighing 4 ozs. or less - and that is a heavy weight for a daily - would be1/4d. If the newspaper weighs 2 ozs. - and a number of them weigh less than that - the rate will be one-half of a1/4d. each. That is a very slight burden indeed, and it is a great concession, because, in five States, newspapers are taken in parcels to be delivered to one person at 1d. per lb. The concession we have made in the schedule is that we accept them at the same rate and deliver them separately to the addressees. I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> on consideration will see that the Bill has not been rushed through in any way. It is a measure for amending the rates with regard to the transmission of certain newspapers and telegrams. When the second reading of the Post and Telegraph Bill was moved in June, I was asked to state the intentions of the Government with regard to the rates. I was afterwards asked the same question several times, and the answer always was that as soon as that Bill became law I should introduce an amending Bill. I feel sure that honorable senators generally were expecting that I should fulfil my promise. The newspaper rates are those which were recommended by the conference of permanent heads of Postal departments that sat more than a year ago, and brought up by their report. So that I cannot see how the Senate has been in the slightest degree taken by surprise. I told honorable senators that I proposed to introduce a schedule amending the existing rates in such a way as to attain uniformity among the States. That has been done in this Bill ; and I do not think any scale of rates would have answered the end in view better than the scale proposed.Whenthe measure was introduced there certainly was no protest against going on with it in committee. . If there had been a strong feeling expressed against proceeding, I certainly should have yielded at once. </para>

If we are to have a system of life assurance for our public service we must have it on those of good health, and must have a different arrangement as to persons who are not physically strong. But it would be a very cruel thing to deny the right of any person to enter the service because he was not physically strong. Such persons are unable to find employment where physical exertion is required, but may be quite capable of mental labour. </para>

          <para>- Exactly, they are to get a minimum wage on account of mental ability. If we refuse admission to the clerical division to people who are not physically strong, it will mean that no such person will be able to earn his living. If the banks and other large institutions followed the example of the Government, they also would prescribe that unless a person was physically strong they would not employ him. If the avenues of mental employment are closed to such persons, they will have to starve. I do not mean that persons suffering from consumption, and diseases of that description which would be injurious to their fellow workers, should be allowed to enter the service, but there are physical ailments which would by no means incapacitate a man from doing clerical work. We employ 8,000 civil servants, and if the Commonwealth takes over other services, we may employ double that number. It would be very cruel if people on account of physical infirmities were not allowed to enter the service. It would be carrying out the Darwinian theory of the &#34; survival of the fittest,&#34; and those who were not physically strong would bo left to starve. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator PLAYFORD</inline>(South Australia). - If we are to adopt the principle of the minimum wage as laid down last night so energetically by the labour representatives, it will be perfectly proper to say that only strong men shall be allowed to enter the service. That is the logical conclusion of the arguments used yesterday. I hold, on the contrary, that there are many men who are not physically capable of doing a certain amount of work, and who are not worth a certain wage, but whom it would be a cruelty to keep out of the service altogether. Now those honorable senators who voted for the minimum wage see the effect that is going to be produced. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> voted with the labour party last night, but now, in the kindness of his heart, he recognises the mischief that would be done by carrying out the principles then advanced. </para>

He might live as long as a man with two legs or two eyes. The fact is that we have made a. great mistake in inserting the minimum wage provision as it will prevent a number of men from earning wages of &#163;80, &#163;90, or &#163;100 a year, and it will prevent many from getting into the service, simply because they cannot come up to the standard of work which will be fixed. </para>

            <para>- We are touching, in. this clause, on one of the most painful problems that have to be considered, and that is, what is to be done with persons who are afflicted with such bad health as to be disqualified for ordinary occupations. In the interests of the public service, I think that they ought to be debarred from entrance to it. Very painful cases have sometimes come under my notice in administering a department. What, for instance, is to be done with an officer of a department who develops consumption? He cannot be turned out upon the streets. He may be entitled to no pension or gratuity, and he refuses to resign. He cannot be permitted to continue to work in a room crowded with other persons, and in one or two such instances what I have had to do has been to give such men practically permanent sick leave. The service must be protected against cases like that. </para>

          <para>- It appears to me that sub-clause (2), of clause 30, leaves the door open for the continuance of a practice which has existed in most of the States of keeping on probationers in the public service <inline font-style="italic">ad infinitum.</inline> There is nothing in the clause to make it compulsory upon the commissioner to take a man off the probation list and put him upon the permanent staff, and under this subclause (2) he may remain on the probation list for ever. If no one suggests a better amendment I am prepared to move the omission of the word &#34;may,&#34; with a view of inserting the word &#34; shall.&#34; It does seem to me that it should be compulsory upon the commissioner to take some step to remove probationers to the permanent staff after six months&#39; probation. </para>

          <para>- This appears to me to be a merciful provision. If we strike out &#34;may &#34; and put in &#34; shall,&#34; it will mean that the officer to whom the commissioner will not give another six months&#39; probation must be dismissed. Under the clause as it stands, if, after a probation of six months, the commissioner comes to the conclusion that an officer is not giving satisfaction he has the option of giving him a further six months&#39; probation, but if the alteration proposed is agreed to, and he must either annul or confirm the appointment at the end of six months, he will annul it. </para>

        <para>SenatorFRASER (Victoria).- The apprehension I have is that any number of temporary hands may be kept on under this clause for a life-time. It would be better to provide that after a probation of twelve months an appointment must be confirmed or annulled. </para>

I do not wish to do anything harsh, and perhaps we should not be in too much of a hurry to dismiss a probationer after six months. I still think, however, that my original contention holds good, and that it is not desirable that in the public service we should have a number of temporary hands employed for an indefinite time.

        <para>SenatorFRASER (Victoria). - I grant that the words proposed to be inserted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> may be sufficient, but in some departments of the public service in Victoria a great number of probationers have been employed for years and years. They go in for six months, are put off for a week, and then go in for another six months, and that practice is carried on regularly. Under this sub-clause there is a danger of a probationer going in for a year, coming out for a week, and then going on for another year. Unless the clause is well drawn that practice may be introduced into the Federal service. </para>

It is very desirable that he should draft a short provision, which would render it impossible for a probationer to re-enter the service, except after an interval of twelve months ; otherwise we may have a continuous series of temporary officers with breaks of a week, possibly of a day. </para>

          <para>- There is evidently a real danger to be apprehended. Even under the Victorian Act these evasions have taken place. This sub-clause is certainly more elastic than the section in that Act, which provides that the appointment shall be for a period of six months absolute, and goes on to say that at the end of that period the Governor in Council may not extend it, but confirm it, and if it is not confirmed he ceases to be in the service. That section has been evaded to a considerable extent in this State. </para>

The effect of such an amendment would be to disqualify a man not for a short time, but for ever. Supposing that owing to the exigencies of the finances the commissioner had to retrench, and that he discharged any probationers.

            <para>- The object of the probationary period is to find out whether the probationer is a man who should be admitted. As the clause reads now, if at the end of six months the commissioner is not satisfied with the officer, he may allow another six months to see how he shapes, and at the end of that time he has to decide whether the officer has shown himself fit to be admitted. The committee is now asked to provide that if the commissioner then annuls the appointment, the man is not to be eligible for re-admission at once, but may be eligible for re-admission at the end of twelve months. Only two reasons, it seems to me, can be advanced for making that distinction. One is that during the period of twelve months he may so improve that he may become fit for another trial, but I think that is entirely unlikely. </para>

          <para>- The Postmaster-General does not quite grasp the case. In the public service we have an ebb and flow of work. There are times when there may be a sudden increase of work, and then it may be very desirable to take on for a limited period men who have been out of the service for a year. If the commissioner has not power to re-engage those men for a limited time, he may have to take for a limited period men who have had far less experience. The amendment gives a little elasticity which the service requires, and at the same time is just and fair, not only to the service, but to the probationers. </para>

        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir FREDERICK</inline>SARGOOD (Victoria). - At first sight there would appear to be considerable force in the argument of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> but I think he will see, on reflection, that if financial stress arose, there would be every inducement to keep on the probationers at &#163;40 or &#163;50 a year, and to . dispense with those who were drawing high salaries. First of all, we wish to get into the service capable men. They are to be taken in as lads, and allowed six months in which to show their adaptability to the position. If they display their suitability the appointment is confirmed. If, on the other hand, they are not quite up to the mark, but the commissioner thinks that a little more time may qualify them, there is power taken in the clause to give them another six months&#39; trial. Then if he still fails, his appointment is absolutely annulled. That, I think, is quite right, and we ought not to go beyond that. Neither should the young man be taken back as a probationer. He has had two chances, and that should be enough. But it does not necessarily follow that the young fellow shall not be employed in the public service at all. He could be employed under clause 40 in temporary employment. That, it appears to me, is the way in which the equities of the case could be met. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator CLEMONS</inline>(Tasmania).- The reason for my amendment is that it is notorious in the public service that there have been temporary officers whose services have been dispensed with, but who at the end of a week or a fortnight have been taken on again. I have put the amendment in a modified form, because I recognise what some honorable senators state, that we should not be too harsh with these men, and should not say absolutely once and for all - &#34;You shall never become a probationer, and never have any chance of entering the service.&#34; </para>

            <para>- We are not dealing with that. What I say is, that at the end of twelve months the probationer will have had two chances to pass the examination, whilst other candidates will have had no chance at all. If this amendment is agreed to it will mean that many a young fellow will say - &#34; Oh, I don&#39;t care about the examination, because if I can&#39;t pass it now, I shall have another chance in twelve months.&#34; Hence he will waste his time. He will be like Mahomet&#39;s coffin, hanging between Heaven and earth. If he fails to pass in twelve months he should lose his chance. </para>

            <para>- I regard this as a very wise provision. We want to fill up the ranks of the service in the clerical division with young fellows. It is preferable if they are destined to enter the service that they should take up the profession soon after they leave school. As a rule a young man does not stay at school until he is 21 years of age, and we do not want to leave the door open for the service to be entered by those who have tried some other walk in life and failed. Moreover, the salary for a man who enters the service in the clerical division is at the beginning only &#163;40 a year. How is a man with a wife and eight children to keep himself and his family on &#163;40 per annum ? He has to be three years in the service before getting the minimum wage of &#163;110. The object of inserting this clause is to secure for the service useful young men who have only recently left school and are just starting life. </para>

But I quite agree that the age must be fixed. It would be a great mistake to appoint men of 28 or 29, because at that age they have responsibilities which would not enable them to live on the small salary we propose to pay. </para>

          <para>- I think the age might very well be extended. Our object is to get as good men as we possibly can into the civil service ; though I am not one of those who believe that we require specially good men. So far as my acquaintance with the civil service goes, the work is very largely a matter of routine. The impression that has been strongly borne in upon my mind is that this age limit prevents us from getting the best men in the Commonwealth. Private firms leave themselves open at all times to avail themselves of the best talent they can get ; but our Government deliberately shut the door against all who do not enter the service between sixteen and 21 years of age. It is desirable that we should have men in the service who have had a varied experience of life. If we put a lad of sixteen into the Post-office he knows nothing but Post-office business, and often not much of that. His mind runs in a particular groove, and he can see nothing outside of it. He has no experience of the general business of life, and his lack of experience makes him more or less incompetent for the very work he is paid to do. According to this provision, if a man were wanted in the Customs department the public service commissioner might take a man out of the Post-office and set him to do Customs work ; but it would not be possible to take a man who had been Customs clerk for a large firm, and who intimately knew all the <inline font-style="italic">minutiæ</inline> of Customs business, and put him in the department. Yet, it must be evident that such a man would be a valuable acquisition to the staff. We ought not to be so hide-bound in our management of the service, which should be open to any man capable of passing the examination and showing capacity for the work required of him. </para>

            <para>- I am not a slave to the idea of working up. We should leave the door open to the appointment of men of the best capacity we can find at all times. I have seen extraordinary anomalies in connexion with the public service. I remember a case in Queensland where a man who had been a draftsman in the Lands office, but who was retrenched, was appointed within a few months to be chief clerk in the Police department. What on earth could that man know about police work ? That is an instance of the stupidity of this iron-bound rule. Would it not have been much better to appoint some solicitor&#39;s managing clerk who was Veil acquainted with police business and criminal procedure? I remember another case where a school teacher in Queensland was appointed clerk of patents. He knew nothing whatever about patents. He was afterwards appointed Under-Secretary for Agriculture. I am certain that a young man could have been obtained in Queensland much more fitted for that position -than this ex-school teacher could possibly be. He was a scholarly man, and no doubt a good teacher, but could not have had sufficient knowledge of the kind that would qualify him for the position of UnderSecretary for Agriculture. We ought to extend the age limit. I think 35 would be a fair limit. We should, to use a phrase of the Right Honorable George Reid&#39;s, &#34;let air into the public service,&#34; and not make a close preserve of it. as seems to be the idea of some honorable senators. Let the friction of competition work within the departments, and I believe that we shall have an improved Commonwealth service instead of one of the pattern so often complained of at present. </para>

          <para>- I I am afraid that the honorable senator&#39;s recommendation, if adopted, would not only let in the air, but would also let in some abuses. Honorable senators must know that there are often complaints that outsiders, through a little political or social influence, are introduced over the heads of worthy men in the service. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart&#39;s</inline> proposal, if adopted, would permit that kind of abuse to continue, because the honorable senator would extend the age to 30 years. The honorable senator also would allow any position in the public service to go to a stranger who had not been previously in the service, and as to such, a person having special knowledge, the special knowledge sometimes is really only in the matter of exercising influence. We should adopt the clause as it stands if we wish to secure a useful and efficient public service. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator PEARCE</inline>(Western Australia). - When I raised this point I had not previously considered the full effect of clause 31. On further consideration I think it is better to leave clause 32 as it stands in order to meet the objection stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe.</inline> But if that is done, we should recommit clause 31, in order to place the clerical division in the same position -as the administrative and professional divisions, in the matter of the admission of persons who are over 21 years of age, with the condition that such appointments are laid before Parliament. There is much force in the objection raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe,</inline> that by extending the age in this case, we might inflict injustice upon those who have gone through the probationary period between the ages of sixteen years and 21 years. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator DOBSON</inline>(Tasmania). - I hope the clause will be retained as it is. I object to the proposal to extend the age, because if we wish to train persons to become efficient officers and clerks, the heads of the different departments must get them when they are young. That is the experience of men of business, and it is the practice also in the army and in the navy. Unless a man is a bank manager or a good customer, he cannot get a young man into a bank at the age of 24 or 25, because the banks want youths who can be trained. I have been much astonished to hear the arguments used by my honorable friends who have declaimed against political influence. By this amendment they are proposing to open the door to the very thing which they profess a desire to shut out. The Bill -provides that persons may enter the service at sixteen years of age, and not over 21 years, and it is now proposed to increase the age to 23 or 25 years. If we allow grown-up men to come in and compete with lads who have entered the service at sixteen years of age, we shall have this result - that in two or three years&#39; time the man who entered at 23 or 24 years of age will be an efficient clerk, and the boy who has entered at sixteen will also be an efficient clerk ; but when the chief accountant or chief correspondence clerk wants a good man, although these officers will both be in the same grade, other things being equal, he will naturally select the man who has eight or ten years more experience of life. The unfortunate boy who made up his mind from the start to enter the service will be handicapped by being placed alongside, perhaps, half-a-dozen men who have been allowed to enter the service eight or ten years later. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator FRASER</inline>(Victoria). - I think we might extend the time for two or three years for the simple reason that many boys do not leave school until they are over 21 years of age. Parents who are anxious that their boys shall get a university education, keep them at school until they are over that age. Some persons are very precocious at seventeen or eighteen years of age, and others are the reverse at 21 years. I think it would be better to extend the age to 23 years. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir FREDERICK</inline>SARGOOD (Victoria). - My feeling is that if we wish to thoroughly demoralize the service from. top to bottom we shall adopt the amendment suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart.</inline> As has been pointed out, a number of lads enter the service, after passing an examination, with a view to devoting the whole of their lives to the service. It is in the interests of the Commonwealth that we should have in the public service capable men gradually trained, and who know all the ropes. But if this extension of age is agreed to, political influence will be brought to bear upon Ministers to appoint some hanger-on of Members of Parliament, who may be 23 or 25 years of age. The Minister will make the appointment at &#163;40 a year, because the law provides that that shall be the salary to begin with. There is an additional objection in the fact that that will lead to the appointment of seniors to do junior&#39;s work, and as a large employer of this class of labour, I unhesitatingly say that there is nothing more demoralizing in a large office than to put a senior alongside a junior to do similar work. The trouble will not stop there, because shortly after the man is appointed, some kind friend will ask a question in Parliament as to whether it is a fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Soandso,</inline> a married man with a couple of children, and 25 years of ago, is only receiving &#163;40 a year. Parliament will sympathize with such a case, and a special vote will be passed to increase that man&#39;s salary, and that will place the whole of the lads who are honestly working their way in the service in an unfair and unjust position. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has stated that these changes from one department to another result in putting a square peg into a round hole. That may very occasionally happen, but not to anything like the extent generally supposed, because clerical work throughout the departments is practically the same. I strongly advise the committee to pass the clause as it stands, if they wish to keep alive a healthy spirit of emulation, and a feeling amongst public servants that they will be fairly treated. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator CLEMONS</inline>(Tasmania). - I am inclined to think that the age should not be greatly extended, if extended at all, because looking at the clause more carefully I find that the limit is 21 years on the last birthday, and that really opens the door to persons who are practically 22 years of age. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Eraser</inline> used an argument which I think has some weight. I do not agree that there are many boys at school at 21 years of age, and I am afraid that those who. are would never be fit for the public service of the Commonwealth. I agree, however, that there are a good many boys of 21 attending the universities, and we should remember, that under clause 43 provision is made for allowing any public servant who has passed an examination, conducted by a. university in any of the States, to obtain certain exemptions in the matter of examinations in the service. It may be a very desirable thing to encourage youths who have attended the State universities to enter the public service. </para>

            <para>- I recognise what. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Zeal</inline> says, but there is a provision permitting a university man in the clerical division to escape certain examinations. As the limit under the Bill may extend to 21. years and 11 months, I think it will give ample opportunity for youths who have passed through a university course to get. into the clerical division. </para>

          <para>- I ask honorable senators to pause before they alter this clause. This provision is the result of years of experience, and it is found that boys entering the service require a probationary period before they obtain a permanent status in the service. A similar practice is. adopted in commercial, banking, and insurance houses, and is found to work well. There are many objections to allowing persons to enter the service after a certain age. One strong objection is that to do so will be to cause dissatisfaction amongst the employes. The question raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> with reference to lads who have had a university education is met in the Victorian Public Service Act, because a boy who has passed in an honorable way through a university is under that Act as a matter of right eligible for a position in the professional division of the Railway department. It is with a view to encouraging efficiency in the service that this provision has been adopted, and I hope the committee will agree to the clause. </para>

            <para>- This amendment, I take it, means that if the application is put in just before the applicant becomes 21 years of age, he shall be eligible for appointment even when he is 25, 26, or 27 years of age. The evils of admitting men of mature age would be as bad under this amendment as under any of the other amendments proposed. I think 21 years is a fair limit, and it would do no harm even if the minimum limit of age were lowered. I think that the junior ranks of the civil service should be filled by youths, and not by men. </para>

If this Bill is not passed within two months, they will be debarred from entering the federal service. It is a. hard-and-fast rule, dating, in my opinion,, from the wrong time, because it depends on the provision we make in this Bill whether many an old officer shall be transferred, or be dismissed on account of his age. I can quite understand that in the Commonwealth there may be at least 50 old men who are hoping that this Bill may <inline font-style="italic">hecome</inline> law within the next two months. </para>

        <para>The clause provides that persons in the railway or other service of a State shall be eligible to be transferred to a position in a corresponding division in the Commonwealth service, but it bars the transfer of all those whose employment is of a temporary or casual character. It has been frequently stated in the chamber by Senators Sargood, Dobson, and Playford that in some States there are a number of officers whose employment, in the language of their State Acts, has been of a temporary character, Although some of these men have been employed for ten or twenty years. For instance, the employment of the &#34; pro and tem &#34; men in South Australia would certainly be held to be of a temporary or casual character. If this privilege is to be allowed to those who have the distinction of being permanent officers, it should also be extended to those who are under the disability of being known as &#34; pro and tem &#34; officers. After all, it does not bind the Commonwealth to take over any men. It is left with the commissioner to decide whether the services of any men shall be Accepted. It gives the men the right to apply for an appointment, and if their application be approved they can be appointed to a position in the corresponding division in the Commonwealth service. I think that the Government might very well accept my amendment. </para>

        <para>SenatorDRAKE. - To make them eligible is practically to hold out hope to such men that they can get into the Federal service. If the State has been employing these men for five, ten, or fifteen years, and they are to be continued in employment, out of charity, surely it is the State which should find them work? What the clause contemplates is that there might be in the Railway department of a State an officer occupying a high position whose services might be very much desired by the Federal Government, and it is considered that he should not be debarred from entering our service. But its object is not to throw the service of the Commonwealth open to a number of men who are getting near 60 years of age, who are not permanently employed and whose services perhaps are not particularly required by the States. I think that there should be some limitation of this kind made. </para>

          <para>- I cannot follow the line of reasoning which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> has adopted. To me it is absolutely illogical. In this Bill the right is reserved to the commissioner to go into any State and engage any man whose services, in his opinion, would be of value to the Commonwealth. That is right so far as it goes. But there is another section of civil servants to be considered, and that is &#34; provisional and temporary&#34; hands who have been employed for years. However desirable it might be to employ any provisional and temporary hands, whose services would be valuable to the Commonwealth, it is proposed in this clause to cut off the supply from the service. If the services of a man would be valuable to the Commonwealth by all means take him, but do not limit your choice. Unless this amendment is made, possibly the very man who would be most valuable to the Commonwealth might not be eligible simply because he was called a provisional servant. I do not think that the opposition to the amendment is worthy of a Minister of the Crown. </para>

          <para>- We have now reached a very important clause, dealing with a subject which has not been touched upon in the discussions upon preceding clauses. It gives to the Minister the power to put on temporary assistance in his department whenever he thinks it is necessary. The clause brings up the whole question of temporary appointments. Temporary assistance is necessary sometimes in order to carry on the business of the departments, but the appointment of temporary officers should be surrounded by safeguards, and it should not be within the power of the Minister to make them even for a nominally short time. The amendments which I have circulated require that temporary appointments shall be made on the recommendation of a responsible officer, and not at the mere dictum of the Minister. I intend to move, first of all, that the words - &#34;in the opinion of&#34; be omitted. Then I propose to insert after the word &#34; department,&#34;the words - &#34; upon the report of the permanent head or the chief officer of such department, is of opinion that.&#34; The clause will then read - </para>

            <para>- The honorable senator surely forgets what transpired in Victoria before the Public Service Act was passed. I have known cases in which appointments have been made in the teeth of the permanent officer. I am providing that the Minister shall not act without having the advice of his responsible officer. I mention the permanent head, because we are in a position different from that of the States. There is now a permanent officer over the whole department, and what was formerly called the &#34; permanent head &#34; in the States, becomes the chief officer. The chief officer of a department cannot communicate with the Minister except through the permanent head. My object is that the Minister shall not, on his own motion, be allowed to make temporary appointments. &#39; Take, for instance, the Victorian railways. A recent report has shown that, within the last five years, the temporary officers have increased from 712 to 2,630. </para>

            <para>- I am speaking of what I know, and I think I know a great deal more of the departments than the honorable senator. I am anxious to prevent this abuse of temporary appointments, which is not fair to those permanently employed. I know of one department in which there are eight officers who have been temporarily employed for an average of over four years, and one of them has been on the temporary staff for seven years. If we wish to have a healthy system we must take some steps to place the employment of temporary officers on a proper footing. If my amendment does not carry out that object, I shall be glad to accept one that will. In my opinion, the clause as it stands at present is very dangerous, and leaves too much power in the hands of the Minister. I therefore move - </para>

          <para>- This provision for calling in temporary assistance in certain cases is very much safeguarded, because it cannot be exercised unless the commissioner is unable to provide the assistance from some other department. The objection is that the Minister may capriciously, and against the advice of the permanent head, call in temporary assistance. I think that the Minister does not act except on the recommendations of the permanent officers of his department. This amendment is only one of a series to be proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sargood.</inline> In one of his amendments he introduces the words &#34;whenever the Minister of a department, upon the report of the permanent head or the chief officer of such department, is of opinion,&#34; and that would provide for the continuance of the very evil the honorable senator has pointed out. because under such an amendment the Minister could, upon the report of a chief officer, override the views of the permanent head. </para>

I do not go as far as many honorable senators in thinking it advisable to place all power in the hands of the Minister, but in this matter of temporary employment I think Ministers may be trusted. </para>

Is he to go round from room to room to inquire if a man is wanted here or a boy there ? That would be a practical proposal, but, under the amendment the honorable senator proposes the Minister would have no knowledge except upon the report of his permanent officers and he is not likely, against their advice, to incur the odium and risk of proposing employment that is not required.

The item is certainly worthy of serious consideration. This is the first occasion upon which it has come before the Commonwealth Parliament. It is an expenditure to which the States&#39; have been committed by State legislation, and the Federal Parliament is to be committed to it, to some extent, without any consideration as to whether we are doing justice to the Empire, or justice to Australia. The hurried manner in which this Bill must be dealt with this afternoon precludes any general discussion. It would be better if some temporary arrangement could be made so that we might deal with the item on the Estimates. We should then have time to thoroughly discuss it, and to obtain full information upon the subject. </para>

          <para>- I think it is well that this question has been raised. I would ask honorable senators to consider whether it is not desirable that the squadron, instead of remaining in Sydney Harbor from years&#39; end to years&#39; end, should sail round the coast of Australia and make calls at different ports. For instance, Victoria contributes something like &#163;29,000 or &#163;30,000 per annum towards the cost of the squadron, and it is only once a a year - during the Cup festivities - that the exigencies of the State are considered to require its presence in the Bay. No doubt the colonies made a splendid bargain when they agreed to contribute to the maintenance of the auxiliary squadron. </para>

Having entered into this bargain, we should derive as much benefit from it as possible. I am sure that if some of the vessels of the squadron called at the principal ports of the Commonwealth two or three times a year, instead of remaining in Sydney Harbor all the year round, it would be a good thing. It would be far better for us to pay the cost of the coal required to enable these vessels to go from port to port, and to exercise their men in rough seas, than to allow them to lie idle in Port Jackson. </para>

          <para>Provided always that the claim made by the Imperial Government, under this head, does not exceed the annual payment of &#163;91,000. &#163;126,000 is the annual cost of the squadron subject to modification from time to time. The accounts show that for this year the amount is &#163;106,000, but it is necessary, I am told, to ask for less than the actual amount in order to leave full opportunity for discussion on another occasion. The amount of &#163;126,000 may be subject to some adjustment, but it is estimated that that &#39;will be the contribution of the Commonwealth under that article of the agreement. AVith regard to the warships being moved about from place to place, when the-agreement was entered into, New Zealand and one other State made the stipulation that one vessel should periodically visit its waters. With that exception the movements of the squadron have been left, and wisely left, to the control of the Admiral. We must all recognise that we do not pay this sum in order to have the opportunity of seeing the ships occasionally, and perhaps deriving some advantage from their calling in at different ports. We pay the money as a protection to Australia, and for that reason it is recognised that the movements of the fleet shall be under the control of the Admiral, </para>

I do not think we should expect that it should be turned into a perambulating  show. If it be necessary that it should be taken everywhere, it might ultimately be found necessary to take Port Jackson with it. We do not feel that we could spare our beautiful harbor. It offers facilities for the squadron which have been recognised by the Imperial Government. I should not be willing to consent to anything arranged on a Commonwealth basis being turned into any undue advantage to the State I have the honour to represent. If it could be shown in any way that the other States are unfairly dealt with, I should be anxious to put that right, but we should not forget that these matters are in the hands of the Admiral representing the Imperial authorities, and if we trust him to do the best for the service I think we shall generally be satisfied with the result. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator DOBSON</inline>(Tasmania). - If, as I believe, it is a fact that the ships of the squadron stay longer in Sydney than in other ports the right reason has not yet been stated correctly. It is not done on account of the excellence of the harbor of Sydney,&#39; because I venture to think that the harbor of Hobart is quite as good as, if not better, than the other, but the head quarters of the navy are at Sydney, with all the Imperial stores and the Imperial officers to superintend all repairs. We have such magnificent waters, not only in our harbor at Hobart, but at Norfolk Bay, that the Admiral comes down almost, annually to carry out certain manoeuvres and gun practice there, and he is going to do the same in January. We have frequently had a man-o&#39;-war which has needed repairs. In many instances we have not had the material or the machinery requisite to repair her. In other instances the repairs have been tolerably large, and we have not been able to do them as cheaply as they could be done in Sydney. In another case, the officers at head-quarters would have had to come down to Hobart and do the repairs. Honorable senators will see at once that whatever State contains the head-quarters of the navy, is far more like!}&#39; to see m&#39;eno&#39;war more often than other States. We cannot have material and repairing officers and engineers sent to each State. I should not like it to be thought that because I asked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> whether the amount was increased by about &#163;10,000, I have any objection to that increase. I have always thought, and said, that the contribution we pay for the protection of Australia to the navy is a very beggarly one. I make this remark because I have read in the newspapers that all the State Premiers when they met here recently were impressing on the Federal Ministers that there must be retrenchment, especially in defence. It appears to me to be the one department in which we can have no retrenchment. </para>

But if we wish to do justice to the Empire, and to take up the position in the world which other nations think we are going to take, from our action in reference to the war in South Africa ; we shall have to see, no matter what it may cost, that every boy and youth in the Commonwealth is possessed of a rifle, and the necessary ammunition to enable him to join a rifle-club and learn how to shoot. My idea of retrenchment is to give every boy and man a rifle and ammunition. I desire no floating batteries, no land batteries, and no gunships. I wish to see that the very element of the great colonial defence is formed, and. hot dashed to. the ground by silly notions of retrenchment. </para>

But in this Bill there is no recognition of the fact that a large part of the so-called volunteer forces of Tasmania is really a militia force. I find votes for militia in other States, but none for the militia in Tasmania. </para>

Therefore it is not necessary this month to ask for a larger amount than is set down in the schedule. The total- amount voted in the three Supply Bills on account of Tasmania was, for the headquarters staff, &#163;1,540, permanent forces, &#163;1,885 ; mounted infantry, &#163;400 <inline font-style="italic">;</inline> artillery, Launceston, &#163;200 ; Southern Tasmania, &#163;200 <inline font-style="italic">;</inline> and engineer corps, &#163;200. So that the defence force of Tasmania has not been in any way overlooked, and it is in consequence of the amounts voted on previous Supply Bills that it is not necessary to ask for a larger amount this month. </para>

            <para>- Contingencies amount, so far as concerns the head-quarters staff, to &#163;460, and so far as concerns the permanent forces to &#163;600. These amounts compare favorably with the votes for other States. In regard to the Post and Telegraph department, I can assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> that it is no gratification to me to be away from the other House when references are being made to the department of which I am the head. The honorable senator wants to know the reason why it has been proposed to close certain post - offices. That has been done in accordance with a policy of reasonable economy, of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> appears to approve. In pursuance of that policy, which I have endeavoured to carry out equally in all the States of the Commonwealth, I issued instructions to the officers that they should use reasonable economy, and inform me of any expenditure being incurred which might be saved. In regard to the two particular offices mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> - Erskine-ville and Darlington - it was reported to me in the case of Erskine-ville that there was a post-office 35 chains -away in one direction, &#34;and another office 44 chains away in the other direction. Surely there is no necessity for a post-office between these two other offices. The officers recommended that the official post-office should be discontinued, that a letter-box should be placed in its stead, and that some provision should be made for -the sale of stamps. In the same way in regard to Darlington, that was an office which was only about 40 chains away from the post-office in George-street west, and not very far from Redfern Post-office in the other direction, and from another office the name of which is not in my memory at the present moment, but which was not far away. I have looked carefully into the reports from the officers ; they are to the effect that this accommodation is not really required, that economy can be effected, and that the offices in question are really superfluous. I want the committee to understand that each case is dealt with on its merits in any particular State. Of course, some people who are living in the district are not satisfied with the decision, and think that these post-offices ought to be continued. The permanent head of the department, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scott,</inline> is leaving Melbourne in the course of a few days, find I have instructed him to confer with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dalgarno,</inline> to make all the necessary inquiries, and probably visit the places himself, so that he may report to me as to the necessity or otherwise of continuing these offices. I should like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> distinctly to understand that the policy adopted with regard to New South Wales is exactly the same as the policy adopted with regard to other States. We have also taken steps to close offices in other States which are considered to be superfluous, and where that can be done without restricting postal facilities. But each case will stand upon its own merits, and if I find on inquiry that a good case is made out for the continuance of the offices in question, nothing will give me greater pleasure than to continue them. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator PULSFORD</inline>(New South Wales) - The distance between post-offices is only a matter of detail. If the population in a district was very dense there might be a sufficient reason for the continuance therein of an additional post-office. I presume that the Postmaster-General in having the matter fully considered will bear in mind, not merely the distance between other post-offices, but also the use that is being made of the offices, and the amount of business transacted. It would have been more to the point if the Postmaster-General had dealt with the population surrounding the post-offices rather than the distance between them, but I am glad to hear that arrangements are being made for the case to be carefully considered on its merits. 25 d </para>

          <para>- The matter which I am going to mention ;&#39;is one that I should not have brought up except for the fact that we shall be shortly adjourning for a few weeks, and there will be no opportunity of referring to it during that time. I asked the Postmaster-General a question regarding it earlier &#39;in the day. From what has been published in the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane Observer,</inline> a perfectly reliable journal, published from the <inline font-style="italic">Courier</inline> office, which deals with the subject in three columns of matter, there appears to be serious neglect on the part of some postal officials. As far back as October, 1900, a certain firm made complaints in regard to missing letters. Investigations were initiated which led to the conviction of a boy employed in the post-office at Goondiwindi. The firm in question found it necessary to make continued complaints. These complaints were made occasionally in connexion with the western mail, and - though it will hardly be believed - it was some seven months after this first conviction that the firm was able to get the department actively to move in the matter. The head of the firm, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beirne,</inline> is one of the most straightforward, and one of the cleverest business men in Queensland. He made constant complaints about these missing letters, but could get no satisfaction from the department, which, indeed, chided him for not opening his letters himself, and told him that the fault must be in his own firm and amongst his own employes. They forced him to employ detectives, who were at the business establishment for some time trying to find out a reason for the letters being missing. The employes of the firm, numbering about a couple of hundred, were placed under a very unjust suspicion. The detectives could find nothing wrong in the firm, and, as I have said, some seven months appear to have expired before the Brisbane postal authorities took active steps to endeavour to trace the missing letters. Even then there appears to have been some bungling, because when it was discovered that one of the &#34; trap &#34; letters which had been posted in Brisbane went astray, they did not discover who had the letter, nor do they appear to have discovered it to this day. It is very unjust that some one in the department in Brisbane should have placed the whole of the employes of the firm I have mentioned under a suspicion that should not have attached to them. Of course we all admit that very few instances of anything going wrong in connexion with the Post-office occur. It is a great tribute to the honesty of our Post-office employes, and a sign of our advancement in civilization, that we should be able to conduct our postal business so well. But in Queensland there is evidently something wrong on the face of matters. I would urge the Postmaster-General to cause full inquiries to be made into the whole question. Nothing short of that will satisfy those who have read anything in connexion with the case. It was very strange that the Postmaster-General had not received official intimation about the matter, as he stated this morning. I believe that he has some information in connexion with it now. But for some months past this unsatisfactory state of affairs has been going on, and I think the Postmaster-General ought to have been acquainted with the failure of his department to discover who was responsible for the loss of these letters. Some 60 or 100 letters have been missing. It is stated that the complaints have only been made in connexion with this one firm. If that be so, it is rather in favour of the department if they can claim that they did not take steps because of the fact that only one firm made the complaints. But when a conviction was secured some twelve months before, and the firm in question continued to make complaints, and when the detectives could discover nothing wrong in the firm&#39;s establishment, the department should have taken proper steps earlier than it did to inquire into the matter. I do not wish to blame the Postmaster-General, but I am sure he will recognise, when he reads the newspaper articles in question, that the firm has great cause for complaint. That firm is receiving an undue advertisement from the exposure which has taken place in Brisbane. During some months it has had to suffer from the reports which were being circulated to the effect that it was not safe to send money orders to this firm because they would not carry out their promise to send parcels in response thereto. I do not think it can be claimed that any endeavour is being made to simply advertise this firm. </para>

            <para>- This is one of the unfortunate cases which must necessarily happen occasionally in connexion with the Post-office - the case of dishonest persons interfering with letters. lean hardly express any opinion upon it now, because it has only just come under my notice. I have no doubt it was some time ago that these dishonest practices were first discovered, and an inquiry was made. Since then, as I understand from a brief glance at the papers, the Postal department and the police have been engaged in endeavouring to discover the offenders, but nothing was made public until the 7th December. It must be understood that in these cases where an endeavour is made to track down offenders and punish crime, it is not desirable that the whole matter should at once be made public. On the 7th December, this matter appears to have been made public in a paper issued in Brisbane, and on the same date the Deputy Postmaster-General sent his report to Melbourne, covering a long report from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Crosby,</inline> the Superintendent of Mails, which I have not had time to read. The papers only came under my notice today, while the Senate has been sitting, and it must be understood that as the letter was posted in Brisbane on the 7th December, and this is the 13th, only six days later, there has been no delay. I have not yet had time or opportunity to go into the matter, but I will see that a full inquiry is made upon the spot by the Secretary of the Postal department.

            <para>- I understood the honorable and learned senator to say that when it is necessary to track down an offender, it is a great mistake to publish an article of this kind, and I wish to point out that the article was published several months after the department appears to have failed to do anything. I know the gentleman who conducts the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane Observer,</inline> and I have a very great regard for him. I believe him to be thoroughly straightforward, and I know he would not publish such an article unless he was sure there was good foundation for it. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator PULSFORD</inline>(New South Wales). - I should like to ask the Postmaster-General if he will endeavour to have the accounts of the various Sstates presented to us, arranged in future on some uniform system. In some of the States they are arranged under three or four headings, in the case of New South Wales under five headings, and in the case of South Australia under two headings. In the case of the South Australian accounts, there is &#163;19,000 out of a total of 31,000 under the heading of &#34;contingencies,&#34; while &#34;contingencies&#34; for New South Wales are given at &#163;7,000. It will be seen that it is quite impossible for honorable senators to have the least idea of what is meant by headings varying in that way. I suggest that it would be a great advantage to Parliament if the accounts of the variou tates were in future presented under uniform headings. </para>

They may decide to visit them while members of the Senate are engaged in discussing the Tariff. If it is necessary that members should visit these sites before coming to a decision as to where the federal capital should be, I should like to know when it is proposed that members of the Senate shall visit them.

If we postpone the proposed visit indefinitely we may land ourselves in such a position that our work here will prevent our making the visit at all, and we shall not be able to come to a proper conclusion. I think a week during our recess might be spent in this way, and that would be preferable to postponing the visit indefinitely. Some honorable senators seem to think that the time is coming when the Senate will have very little to do. When we first came here I was inclined to think that our Chairman of Committees would not have much to do, but I see very little prospect of that time arriving for some years. We have legislation in front of us that will keep us going for months. I should like to know if the Postmaster-General is in a position to say when he thinks the proposed visit might be made. </para>

I hope that course will not be followed. I hope we shall not spoil our Christmas holidays by sandwiching into them a week spent in a hunt after the federal capital. I do not see that there is any special hurry in this matter. The federal capital will keep. Are we not quite comfortable where we are?

            <para>- I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> that it is not desirable that we should undertake a trip to the sites suggested for the federal capital during the Christmas recess. We want a holiday on this occasion, and those who can get away are anxious to return to their homes, and spend Christmas in the usual style. Honorable senators would hardly like to put in their holidays in travelling from site to site.. If a time should come, as has been prophesied, when the Senate will not have any work to do, it will afford us an admirable opportunity to pay these visits of inspection. I may mention as a matter connected with the subject of this motion, that one other paper has been laid upon the table of the House of Representatives - a communication from the Premier of Queensland. There is no copy available to lay on the table of the Senate, but the paper will be printed and copies will be distributed in the usual way. </para>

            <para>. - In rising to move the adjournment of the Senate for a longer period than usual, I wish to mention that, having in view the desirability of obtaining as long a holiday as possible without any detriment to the public business, it is considered advisable for the Senate to adjourn at its rising until the 22nd January next. I understand that another place will adjourn for a much shorter period, but there is a considerable amount of business to be dealt with by that Chamber, which will not be ready to come before us until perhaps a fortnight after it re-assembles. There is one unfinished Bill before the Senate, but having consulted a number of honorable senators, I have come to the conclusion that we should adjourn until the date that I have named. As this will be the first time that we have adjourned for a similar purpose, I trust that I may be permitted, on behalf of the Government, to wish you, sir, and honorable members of the Senate, a very happy Christmas. I Hope we shall meet again in January in good health and spirits ready to proceed with the work of the session. I move - </para>

I have also been requested by several members of the party to which I belong - and I am sure I join with them in their desire - to express the wish that you, sir, may enjoy a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. I hope that honorable senators will meet again on the 22nd of next month in good health and good temper, prepared to proceed with the business of the country. </para>

            <para>- I certainly object very strongly to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson&#39;s</inline> suggestion.I object also to the lengthy holiday proposed by the Postmaster-General. While there ore important matters urgently requiring legislation, we ought to take a holiday in these exceptional circumstances similar to that enjoyed by business people, who suspend their labours only for a fortnight or ten days. To a certain extent we have, at the present time, a disorganized civil service. I have no fault to find with the management, but we have a. civil service being administered under six different Acts, and great injustice is being done in many cases. While we have an Electoral Bill - to the urgent need of which T have frequently called attention - and standing orders to be dealt with, I think we ought not to adjourn for so long a period. If we were to adopt <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson&#39;s</inline> suggestion we should wake the Senate subsidiary to the House of Representatives. The Electoral and Franchise Bills are very, important measures. If an honorable member for South Australia in the House of Representatives wore to die, that State would have to be polled as one electorate, in order that his successor might be returned, and a great deal of expense would thus be involved. I have objected on several occasions to the policy of sitting only three days a week. </para>

We ought to do all we can to carry out the wishes of those who have been separated from their homes for so many months. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> has no responsibilities, and, therefore, is not anxious to go away: I can understand that other honorable senators of more mature age and with increased, responsibilities must be anxious to return to their* homes. I think we have done very well. I rose at tho request of several honorable senators sitting beside me to express their concurrence, as well as my own, in the hearty good wishes tendered to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> by. the Postmaster-General. I am sure that if he had thought of it the Minister would have included the Chairman of Committees and the officers of the House, to whom we arn so largely indebted, for a great deal of courtesy and valuable assistance, and. lost if not least, I wish to tender our thanks to our worthy Ministers. On all occasions they, have fought their Bills with the view of getting them through, but they have always fought them as became courteous gentlemen, and I think we are also indebted to them. </para>
