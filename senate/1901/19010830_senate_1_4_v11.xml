                    <para>. -I rise to ask leave to move a motion without notice to further the consideration of the Customs Bill. When a Bill is reported with amendments it is necessary to set the adoption of the report down for a later day. If we report the Customs Bill to-day with amendments it cannot be recommitted until next sitting day. I ask the House, therefore, to suspend the standing orders so as to enable me, on the motion for the adoption of the report, to move the recommittal to-day. If this is done new clauses can be dealt with on recommittal, and the final adoption of the report may be set down for Wednesday, and on that day it will be open to any honorable senator to move for a recommittal. On the other hand, if we have done with the Bill to-day the third reading can be taken on the following sitting day. </para>

                <para class="block">This amendment must appear to every' honorable senator as quite reasonable. We have provided for where the services of the locker may be required the whole of the time. That provision may do very well in large ports like Melbourne and Sydney. But in South Australia the custom has been to allow the warehouses to have the use of a locker for half-a-day. His services, are devoted to practically two warehouses, attending at one in the morning and the other in the afternoon of one week, and then reversing the procedure during the next. Without this amendment it would be practically impossible to carry on most of the warehouses in Port Adelaide. Not only would the expense be greater, but they would not be guaranteed the services of a locker when required. It is quite evident that if they had to depend on a locker whose services might be obtained at so much per hour, they would have to go to the Custom-house each day for a locker, unless they have a large staff- - what we call "glut hands." It might happen very often that these warehouses would not be able to have the services of the locker, and that would throw their whole business into such confusion as to practically spoil their utility. Seeing that the warehouse lockers are under the control of the Customs, and that the small warehouseman has to pay a very heavy licence-fee, and to give security for a very heavy bond, I fail to see why he should not have the services of <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> locker quite as much as one who can utilize a locker's services for the whole of the day. </para>

                        <para>- Supposing that the locker is required for half-a-day only in each week, if you run out the cost of his services at 2s. an hour, the sum, together with a lump sum not exceeding £50, will come to £70 a year. If the services of a locker are required for a certain time, his services have to be paid for at the rate of 2s. an hour, and, in addition, a lump sum, which cannot exceed £50. It is very desirable that there should be an elastic provision of that kind. It would apply very fairly to the case which has been suggested. I admit that there ought to be a provision made for warehouses which do not require the whole services of the locker, and I think that those cases are met by the provision I have indicated, which applies to a great number of cases besides the one put by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Charleston.</inline> I do not think it is necessary to fix a scale. While these warehouses should be encouraged wherever they are necessary, it seems to me that they should all be dealt with on one reasonable basis, and where they get less than the whole services of a locker those services should be paid for at so much per hour together with a lump sum. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator CHARLESTON</inline>
                    (South Australia). - I think the third paragraph provides more especially for private warehouses where the services of a locker are required only occasional, and not regularly. In this Bill we have made great provision for private warehouses rather than for bonding warehouses. Supposing that a tobacco manufacturer or a spirit merchant has a private bonding warehouse. It is only occasionally that he requires the services of a locker, and then not at any fixed hour. &gt; When the services of a locker are required, he rings up the Custom-house and asks that a locker may be sent down ; but that is only done at irregular intervals. I am trying to make, provision for warehouses requiring the service, of a locker on at least one-half of every working day. In South Australia they have always had the advantage of such a provision as I am now striving to insert in this schedule. By leaving the schedule as it stands we shall encourage private warehouses to the detriment of the public bonded warehouses, and I venture to think that in doing so we shall be running a greater risk of loss of revenue than by having, bonded warehouses, such as we have now in South Australia, which give very heavy securities for their good conduct. There are at least seven well-known firms at Port Adelaide which have been doing business there for many years, and which, unless the amendment I, recommend is made, will have to go to the Customhouse every day and ask that they may have a locker sent to their warehouses. If my proposal is adopted there will be a locker allotted to A and B, who will know that his services will be available for each for one week in the morning and the next week in the afternoon, and so on. Consequently, their customers will know when to come and their business will be conducted without loss or inconvenience. Unless we provide that they shall have the service of a locker the chances are that sometimes a rush may be made on the Customhouse for lockers, and those who are doing a regular business may not be able to obtain the services of one. That would cause very great loss and inconvenience to the trade of our port. The locker is entirely under the control of the collector, and his services would be quite as fully occupied in attending to two- warehouses as if the two were combined into one, requiring the services of a locker all the time. I fail to see why
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline>
                    should object to the provision. The paragraph- as it stands would not meet the requirements I am striving to provide for, because the warehousemen want to be quite sure that the services of a locker will be available to them for a half -day every day. I do not see* how the revenue can be jeopardized in any way ; and while we are striving to guard against loss of revenue we ought also to seek to protect the commercial community from inconvenience and loss. If my proposal is acceded to, greater facilities will be granted to the commercial community, and I am sure that it will aid materially in the conduct of business.

                    <para>- The amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Charleston</inline> is strictly in accordance with what has been the practice in Victoria and other States for the past 30 years or more. This practice cannot be followed under the third paragraph of the schedule, which provides for a totally different service. In Victoria to-day bonding warehousemen- sometimes join together, one paying £100 and the other the balance of £150, so as to make up the amount of £250. That has been the practice for over 30 years. It is also .the practice in Adelaide. But I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Charleston</inline> is not quite accurate as to the charge in Adelaide. I have a return' showing the charges in the various States, and I find that in Adelaide and Port Melbourne, two bonds requiring the services of one locker may have those services for a fee of £75 each, making £150 for the two. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Charleston</inline> is extra liberal in his proposal, and Adelaide merchants would pay more than they pay now. Still, as £200 is to be. the maximum amount for the services of one locker, I think it is reasonable that if two bonds want a locker the £200 should be paid between them. It does not necessarily follow that each must pay £100, because one bond might require a locker two days a week, and the other four days. It would be very much better to leave the division to be a matter of departmental arrangement. That would carry out what is the practice to-day.

                        <para>- We are dealing with general bonds, not private bonds,- and general bonds that only want such- a small amount of the time of a locker as that are not likely to exist. The Minister may depend upon it that we do not as a rule take the services of a locker for longer than they are required. But it is important in dealing with this matter that we should be able to make an arrangement with the Customs that a locker shall come say on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, and go to some other firm on the other days of the week. That is purely a matter of arrangement between the bonds and the Custom-house officers. _ It has worked admirably, and it would be a pity to attempt to disturb what has answered very well so far as the Customs on the one hand, and the merchants on the other, are concerned. With regard to the extra charge, that would be restricted to private bonds as it is now. That is where my amendment comes in. There are four different classes of bonds. No. 1 is the general bond ; the second is the private' bond ; the third is the machinery warehouse ; and the fourth is the manufacturing bond. The manufacturer, as a rule, requires the whole services of <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> looker, but if not, two manufacturers can take the services of one locker between. them. I urge the Minister to accede to this amendment, as it will distinctly facilitate the business of both the Customs and the merchants. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Charleston,</inline>
                    that what he desires cannot be carried out under the paragraph as it stands. It seems to me that it can, and that in some cases the paragraph would operate more conveniently than the proposal he makes. The provision as to £50 per annum shows that an arrangement may be made with the Collector of Customs for the partial services of a locker. What is there to prevent an arrangement being made under this paragraph that a locker shall give his services for three days to one firm and three days to another
                    <inline font-style="italic">1</inline>
                    M.\r point is that the practice that is now carried out in South Australia and Victoria could be earned out under this paragraph. An arrangement could also be made, if necessary, for a locker to give
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Ms services</inline>
                    in the mornings to one firm and in the afternoons to another. That would secure all
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Charleston</inline>
                    desires. But there may be other cases where the services of a looker are only required for a third of the time. In that case payment should only be made for the third of the time.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Charleston's</inline>
                    amendment would not provide for such a case ; but this paragraph appears to me to give the collector sufficient power to carry out the practice which at present exists, and to make an arrangement by which the services of a locker may be secured for any time, long or short.

                    <para>- I agree with the Postmaster-Gene i-al, that under the paragraph as it stands, an arrangement, even more convenient than that suggested <inline font-style="italic">hy</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Charleston,</inline> can be carried out. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Frederick</inline> Sargood says that one warehouse may re, quire the services of a locker for two days in ' the week, and another warehouse for four days. Under the paragraph such an arrangement could be carried out. So could an arrangement whereby one warehouse had the services of a locker for one <inline font-style="italic">day</inline> and another for five. It all depends upon the warehousemen themselves. The paragraph I does not say that one warehouse is to have one locker. It simply says that a certain j amount is to be charged where the services of a locker are required. I am sure that if the paragraph did not bear that construction every honorable senator would assist <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Charleston,</inline> because we desire to make it as liberal as possible for the warehousemen. If necessary it might be provided expressly that where one or more warehousemen combine they may have the services of a locker on the same terms as if one warehouse had his services. But I think the paragraph provides for that already. </para>

                    (New South Wales).There should not ' be any great difficulty in arriving at an agreement on this schedule, because speakers from both sides
                    <inline font-style="italic">o£ the'</inline>
                    chamber have expressed a desire to make the measure as convenient as possible for the general public, consistent with the safety of the revenue and the practical working of the Bill. The only point is - does this schedule provide in the most convenient way for all classes of cases that are likely to present themselves ? I think it does not. It seems to me to be simply a matter of arithmetic. I am going to take the case instanced by the Postmaster-General. He pointed out that the holder of a bond might wish to have the services of a locker for half-a-day, on every day in the week. The services of a locker under the scale of charges set out in the third paragraph would involve the payment of 2s. per hour, with an annual charge not exceeding £50. I think I am correct in saying that in no case is an annual charge of less than £25 made. I take that to be the minimum. Now 2°s. per hour for four hours for six days a week would mean that a small bond holder requiring the services of a locker half-a-day a week would be paying £155 a year, which is more than the amount required for the services of a locker in a larger bond. The Government may say that although £25 has been the minimum annual change hitherto, they may make it lower than that. I invite the Government to say that they will charge a less amount. I take it, however, that £35 would be the irreduceable minimum. In that case it means that one of these small bonded warehouses would be paying £5 a year more than a larger bond requiring the whole services of a locker. The schedule does not equitably provide for the case

For that reason I urge that the Go- vernment might reasonably . either adopt the amendment suggested or some modification of it, to meet such cases as arise. As a further reason for making the amendment, I ask what objection can there be to the continuation of a system which already prevails in one of our great cities ? Surely the Government ought not to be anxious to disturb or break away from an existing system which is doing no harm, but winch seems to be a great convenience. The Government do not want to make legislation coming from the Federal Parliament distasteful to those who' have to work under it. We ought to shape our legislation so that it shall be as little irksome and disturb existing conditions as little as possible.

                    SARGOOD (Victoria). - 'There is one -other point from the Customs point of view to which I should like to direct attention. I know that the Customs authorities always prefer to have the services of these lockers definitely engaged, instead of having a number of men waiting about, kicking their heels in the expectation of employment at 2s. an hour. The suggestion made by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline>
                    is a perfectly satisfactory one, and is now acted upon, and, where two bonds want a locker between them, the locker is secured and the cost divided between the two.

                    has suggested is practically, the same as what I have suggested. I want to provide that the services of a locker can be absolutely obtained by two warehousemen, and in the amendment I have submitted it will be seen that I have simply followed the phraseology of the Bill. I should like to say that there need be no. fear of altering the schedule, because, as presented to us now, it is not the schedule as originally introduced by the Minister for Trade and Customs. We will not be altering the work of that Minister, and by inserting the words I propose we may only be conforming with the desire of the Minister for Trade and Customs himself. I can assert that paragraph 3 is solely intended to meet the cases of private warehouses where the services of a locker are required only intermittently. It will be seen that the time occupied by the locker in going from a private warehouse :to the Custorn-hou.se, or between two private warehouses where he is only intermittently employed, must be charged to some person other than the locker; and this charge of £50 is intended to enable the Minister to charge the warehouses with the locker's time in passing to and fro. Where there is a fixed payment for a locker there is of course no such loss of time. I fail to see why the Minister should not agree to my proposed amendment.

There seems to be an obstacle in the way of that to begin with, because it might be that two small bonds would practically be charged the sum that should be charged for three; for a small bond might not require the services of a locker for half-a-day, and whether they were required or not they would have to be paid for. That would be manifestly unfair. It had better be left entirely in the hands of the Customs department and the warehouses, as a matter for arrangement between them under regulation. </para>

                        there was power under this Bill by which the Minister could make regulations to deal with this matter, it would be all right. But no such power exists, and these fees are absolutely fixed and defined by the Bill.

                        thinks the amendment would be unfair to the small men ; but I ask that honorable senator to reconcile his ideas of fairness with the figures I have already given, which show that a small man under this schedule may be required to pay more for half the. services of a locker than the large warehouseman may have to pay for the whole services of a locker. There is no power of regulation in the Bill by which the Minister can get away from that. If there was such a power it might be the best way out of the difficulty.

                    <para>- I am entirely in accord with the amendment proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Charleston,</inline> because it is in the interests of the smaller importers, and we ought to be careful to conserve their interests in a Bill like this. The more competition there is amongst the importers, and the greater the facilities given to small men and large storekeepers to import directly, the better it will be for the people generally. It is proposed under the schedule that the charge for the whole services of a locker shall be £200, and in certain cases £150. Then there is a provision by which a charge of not more than £50 may be made, where the whole services of a locker may not be required, but it also stipulates that a sum of 2s. an hour may be charged. If we work that out as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has done, we shall fmd that the cost to each of two people who take, the services of a locker will be £145 a year, and that will come very heavily upon the small importer. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Charleston's</inline> amendment is a very reasonable one, and, as it is calculated to break down any possibility of monopoly in the importing line, it ought to 33 supported. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Charleston,</inline>
                    and at the same time remove a difficulty that exists in the minds of some other honorable senators. I think the whole difficulty would be met by the insertion at the beginning of the schedule of the words - " where one or not more than two warehouses require the services," and so on. Those who have had any experience in Victoria and in the other States must have come to the conclusion long ago that it is not wise to have a large number of small warehouses, because it leaves room for the evasion of duties.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Charleston's</inline>
                    idea is that where one warehouse requires the services of a locker for half-time there should be a fairly liberal allowance made.

                        <para>- It very often turns out that they are a detriment to the revenue. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Charleston's</inline> amendment only applies to a case where half the services of a locker are required, whereas there may be a case in which one of two warehouses may require the services of a locker for two days in the week, and the other for four days in the week ; but there may be two warehouses that require the services of a locker for three days each in a week, or for half the day each of each working day. Under the amendment I suggest, this would all be provided for, and it would at the same time prevent the multiplication of small warehouses. The other paragraph of the schedule provides amply, to mv mind, for warehouses that only require the services .of a locker for a few hours in each week, and I think they are liberally enough dealt with. To give effect in a broader way to what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Charleston</inline> requires, if the honorable senator will withdraw his amendment, I will move the amendment I have suggested. </para>

                    <para>- Before leave is given to withdraw the amendment, I would like to say that it is evident both honorable senators are seeking to obtain the same thing. The objection to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor's</inline> amendment is, that under it two men must combine together in order to obtain between them the services of a locker. That could be arranged in places where there are two, four, six, or eight warehouses ; but where there is an odd number, it will be seen that one warehouseman may be .unable to get the advantage suggested, and to secure the services of a locker he may have to pay £200. Under the circumstances I think it will be better to accept the amendment suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Charleston.</inline> It is reasonable that if a man requires the services of a locker for half the time he should be able to obtain them, but under the suggested amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> the odd man would be precluded from doing so. </para>

Any one who is approved by the Minister can, on the payment of a £50 fee, obtain the privilege of a private bond for his own goods, and can in addition get the services of a. locker as he requires them at 2s. ian hour. It is manifestly unfair that we should place private bondholders in a better position in any respect than those who have invested very large sums in general bonds. In Melbourne over £300,000 is invested in general bonds, and we must take care that we do not do anything operating unfairly towards them. Private bondholders - and there are very few of them - are perfectly content to pay £50, and 2s. per hour for the services of a locker.

                        <para>- I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has told us that the fee generally has been £25. To fix the sum at £50 is to place the owner of a small bonded warehouse at a considerable disadvantage. I cannot admit that he is being placed at an advantage over the owner of a large bond in this respect, because the latter pays £200 a year for the services of the locker, and if he wants an additional locker he pays £150. The fee is supposed to be included in what he pays for the services of a locker. We are now dealing with the case of the small bonded warehouse which only requires the services of a locker fora few hours a week. It is reasonable that the Minister should have the power to fix the fee in proportion to the work done. If the fee is fixed at £50, without a power of reduction, it may mean a crushing burden to a man who is engaged in very small operations. I think it is fair to allow a discretion to the Minister. </para>

                    SARGOOD (Victoria). - In Victoria there is practically only one private bond, and there is not the slightest objection to a fee of £50 being paid. It is not in the interests of the Customs, and consequently of the public, to encourage a large number of small bonds. It is an element of very great danger, and undue facilities should not be given in that direction. In Victoria there are 26 machinery bonds each paying £25, one paying £15, and one paying £10, and an open yard paying £1.

                        <para>- That is really a repetition of a statement which has been made here twice, and implies that the small trader is less honest than the big one. I deny that a man's honesty is in proportion to his worldly goods or the extent of his operations. When we remember that these bonds, small or large, are under the control of the Customs officer, and can only be entered when he is present, what greater facilities for fraud exists in a room which is large than in a room which is small ? It does not appear to me that there is any force at all in the imputation that the smallness of the bond bears some relation to the attempts at fraud which can be carried on. The proposal as it stands, giving the Minister a discretion to fix the fee at a sum not exceeding £50, is a very fair compromise between the two sets of circumstances with which we have to deal. It may be undesirable to multiply the bonds without limit. On the other hand, it is equally undesirable to place any restriction on the fair carrying on of commercial operations. While the first proposal submitted by the draftsman put £25 as a fixed minimum, we are asked now to give the Minister a discretion to put £50 as a maximum for small bonds which only require the intermittent services of a locker. In New South Wales there is a very large number of bonds in respect to which the fee is charged under Ministerial discretion, and a more beneficial exercise of that elasticity it would be hard to find. In New South Wales, and it must be the same in Victoria, the varying circumstances of each bond and of each town are such that it is practically impossible to provide for them in any regulation. All you can do, having stated the limits within which the Minister may go to, is to leave it to him to fix the fee according to the circumstances of the bond and the requirements of the place. </para>

                        <para>- In inland towns it is not fixed, but is a matter for Ministerial discretion. In the towns on. the Darling which are in. the habit of receiving supplies by river when the depth of water permits the fees are regulated. In one town with three storekeepers, each requiring his own private bond, the charge for the services of the locker is portioned out amongst them in proportion to the size of the bond, while in another town with five or six stores a different rate is charged. The amendment is really an attempt to force small men - who may otherwise have their own bonds - to become customers of the large men. Ought we to do that? If the smaller traders are prepared to warehouse their goods in the large bonds, they can do it irrespective of the schedule. We place no obligation on them to establish their own bond. But, on the other hand, we ought to make reasonable facilities by which, if it is <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> convenience to them, they can have their own bonds. </para>

                    <para>- I desire to move an amendment in the definition of "collector" and of "officer." The first word has a gradually descending importance until, practically, it includes every officer ; and I propose to omit all the words in the definition after the word "place." I have frequently drawn attention to the extraordinarily wide interpretation given to the term "officer." Junior clerks, female searchers, boatmen, and all persons employed by the Customs in any capacity are included in the term. In the English Act there is- no interpretation of the word, but throughout its provisions the, general practice is to speak of the proper officer, or the officer duly authorized. I propose to have this definition - "Officer" means any officer doing duty in the matter in relation to which the expression is used. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know on what standard the honorable senator decides whether a person is somebody or nobody. The officers have to perform very important duties, and it may often happen that a junior officer may be told off for an important service, and it may be impossible to have that service performed by any officer who would be described in this amendment as the principal officer of Customs. How would you distinguish a principal officer of Customs, if he is to be the only officer who comes under the head of collector ? The amendment would paralyze the action of the department in outside or small places, where it is impossible to have the services of a principal officer. There are hundreds of duties to be performed all over the Commonwealth which must be intrusted to officers who have the powers of the collector given to them. What is the honorable senator afraid of <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> If he is afraid that these officers are not sufficiently high up in the department to be intrusted with these powers <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Surely that is a matter which must be left to the comptroller. The amendment, if carried, would alter the whole structure of the Bill. It would destroy the usefulness of a great many provisions, and for what purpose? Because the honorable senator is afraid, to trust the carrying out of these duties to what he calls nobodies. 1 would like him to remember that these duties will have to be carried out by the Minister and his officers, with full responsibility to the public and to Parliament. That is the safeguard we have that these duties will not be intrusted to persons who are not fit to perform them - not a cast-iron provision which would bind down the commissioner not to employ any officer except one of the principal officers in the department in duties which might be performed by a junior clerk. As an illustration, take clauses 36 and 37. Clause 36 provides that - </para>

                    <para class="block">There again the collector signs the entry, that is to say, the clerk assigned to that duty signs the entry. According to the honorable senator's view, that would have to be done by a principal officer. The result would be that it would be quite impossible to work the clauses, and that a large number of principal officers would have to be employed at .high salaries to carry out work which could just as well be done by any officer whom the Minister or the collector of Customs assigned to the duty. I hope the honorable senator will see that this amendment if carried would be a most serious one, and would paralyze the action of the main portion of the Bill, while there would be no advantage whatever from it. </para>

                    <para>- I am rather astounded at the explanation which the honorable and learned gentleman gives of what is involved in the interpretation clause. What is an interpretation clause for ? It is to define the meaning of expressions. This paragraph of the clause goes a great deal further than any explanation. It professes to describe what is meant by " collector," but it goes on to include every body in the Customs service. What is the use of having such an explanation <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> The honorable and learned gentleman, with absolute sincerity in his speech, but- if I may say so without offence - probably with his tongue in his cheek, tells us that it is necessary in defining " collector " to include the errand , boy. 1 suppose that when he moves the second reading of the High- Court Bill he will, in an interpretation clause, show that "Chief Justice" means "Tipstaff"; and when the Defence Bill is brought in we may expect to find that "General Commanding " includes " drummer boy." The same absurdity can be carried into every Bill in which Ministers, for our instruction, may show what tortures the English -language is capable of. I cannot understand it, and I cannot conceive a gentleman of the Minister's education and experience being serious in such a statement. The object of defining "collector" is to show who is meant. If everybody is meant, we do not need an interpretation clause at all. It seems preposterous that such large powers as are given in various portions of this Bill to the collectors should be exercised by anybody in the service. Does the honorable and learned gentleman mean to insinuate that when a police measure speaks of the " Inspector-General " that term is to include the rawest recruit <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> If that is so, all interpretation clauses are of no use whatever, because apparently every power conferred upon a Minister may be exercised by everybody in a department, and every officer is vested with equal authority. This is simply burlesquing legislation. I shall support the amendment, because it only seeks to place words that are fairly reasonable in their right place, and not in a wrong place. </para>

                <para class="block">Surely that is wide enough for any sensible rendering of the word " officer." In the English Act no such interpretation is given, but the word officer throughout the Act itself is used as referring to the proper officer or the officer authorized. Under the term " officer " here used, the office boy or some female searcher, or boatman, may masquerade and perform duties that it was never intended they should perform, and for which authority has not been given them. </para>

                    (New South Wales). - Until this moment I really thought that the honorable and learned gentleman knew something about the English language and the meaning of words. But I begin to doubt it. I am amused at the view he puts forward in. defence of this definition. The definition imposes no limitation at all, and states that the term " officer" shall include anybody and everybody employed in the Customs service. There is nothing to indicate any check upon any officer. It is ridiculous. However, I am not going to waste the time of the committee by further discussing it. The Bill belongs to the Government, and if they choose to make it ridiculous, it will be to their discredit.

One officer may have a certain duty alloted to him, and another officer another duty.

                        <para>- It was my intention to ask the committee to go right through with this Bill to-day, and to deal with the new clause and the recommitted clauses. But yesterday my right honorable colleague, the Minister for Trade and Customs, had an interview with a deputation which brought forward some very important matters for consideration, some of which are involved in the new clauses to be proposed by other honorable senators. My colleague has had a conversation with me this morning, the result of which is that we think there is sufficient matter m what was brought before me yesterday to entitle it to consideration in connexion with the new clauses which are to be proposed. Without expressing any opinion as to what we intend to do about the matter, we think it desirable to have a consultation before the new clauses are dealt with. When progress upon this Bill is reported, I shall ask the Senate to proceed with the Beer Excise Bill, which is one of those measures that require to be passed into law before the Tariff can be proceeded with.

                    <para class="block">This is one of those machinery Bills which are essential for the collection of the revenue, and therefore one of the measures which must precede the introduction of the Tariff. I move the second reading of this Bill now, in pursuance of the intention I stated a little while ago, to press on all these matters which are foundation Bills for the introduction of the Tariff at the earliest possible moment, in order that Ministers may be in a position to introduce the Tariff as early as possible. There is nothing new in this Bill relating to the excise on beer. The provisions are those which are in similar Statutes throughout the Commonwealth. The general principle of it is that, in order to secure the payment of excise on beer, the business of brewing 'beer, and selling beer from a brewery, is to be carried on under certain safeguards, and under the inspection of public officers. There is a prohibition, in the first place, against beer being made except by licensed persons, and on licensed premises. Certain fees are charged for licences, and securities have to be given by the licensees for carrying out the provisions of the Bill, and there is the right of supervision by an officer of the Government. The officer of the Government is to be supplied with accommodation hi the brewery necessary for the carrying on of his duties, and the brewer is obliged to keep certain books, accounts, and diaries which will give full information as to the processes of his manufacture, the quantity of materials used, and his transactions generally, in order to enable the Government to know the quantity of beer he is brewing, and what he is doing with it. The usual provisions are made for carrying out these safeguards, so that the officer may at any time be in the position of having a full acquaintance with everything the brewer is doing, in order to see that the proper amount of duty is being paid upon the beer as it is made. The dutiable- contents of certain vessels are fixed, and then there are a number of provisions as to the payment of duty. The duty is paid by stamps. Stamps of a certain value, having relation to certain quantities of beer, are sold to the brewer, and he is obliged by law to affix the stamps either to the top of the cask or case in which the beer is sent out, or to the delivery note sent with the cart when the beer is being taken away from the brewery. Provision is made that under no circumstances shall, beer be allowed to go out of the brewery without these stamps upon it, the result being that it is insured that the duty is .paid by means of these stamps before the beer leaves the brewers. In order to secure the fulfilment of the law, severe penalties are provided for the printing of these stamps, or having them unlawfully in possession, and for failing to cancel the stamps when the goods are being opened after they have been sent out from the brewery. I do not know that there are any other provisions in the Bill which it is necessary for me to call attention to, because, as I have said before, the provisions generally are those with which we are all perfectly familiar in the different States, and they carry out the principles I have indicated. The principles of the Bill may shortly be stated to be that, in order to secure the payment of the excise, the Government take care that the beer is manufactured under Government supervision and control, and that no beer leaves a brewery without the payment of duty by means of stamps. </para>

                        <para>- I am- sure there will .be very little debate on the second reading of this measure, because we must recognise that it is necessary that a Bill of this character should be passed before we can proceed to the consideration of our customs and excise duties. With the assurance of the Vice-President of the Executive Council that the Bill is substantially in conformity with the Bills existing in the different States dealing with a similar matter, I have no doubt the Senate will be prepared to carry the second reading -with very little delay. There are, however, one or two matters in connexion with the Bill which will require a little consideration in committee. One has reference to the position of houses belonging to breweries which are licensed for the sale of wines and spirits. We know that the object of. the clause dealing with the matter is to prevent the possibility of any illicit distillation or illicit sale on the part of brewers. As at first introduced, this clause was rather Obnoxious, because it made a hard-and-fast limit -with regard to the distance from the place where the beer was brewed, or the place in which wines and spirits could be sold. Clause 20 originally provided that no brewer should sell .spirits in his brewery or at any place within 50 yards thereof, but the clause has been amended since it was originally introduced in the other House, and it now provides that no brewer shall - </para>

                    <para class="block">There is no doubt that the provision for the permission of the collector will be found a very valuable provision if honorable senators do not insist upon making the clause a little more definite. I understand that j.n New South Wales and in the other States brewers have been in the habit of having a place within this distance of 50 yards for the sale of spirits, and, notwithstanding that that is technically a breach of the law, it has been permitted, because it has enabled the brewer to have a much better supervision over his premises than he could possibly have if he were compelled to sell spirits at a considerably greater distance away from his brewery. In New South Wales, many of the brewers have been in the habit of establishing these places within this distance of 50 yards, not selling in the brewery of course, "but very close at hand. If we can get an assurance, as no doubt we shall, from the Vice-President of the Executive Council that no attempt will be made under this Bill to interfere with places already established, there will be no difficulty in passing the clause as it stands. But unless we can get that assurance, it will be necessary, in fairness to persons who have expended large sums of money, and upon whose reputation and character "there is no stain, that honorable senators shall see that they are enabled to conduct their business as heretofore without objection. </para>

                    <para class="block">Of course, it is only on the quantity returned that the duty should be remitted ; but instead of having a full barrel of ale a man may only have half the barrel, and that half may be absolutely destroyed. It is only fair and reasonable that beer which is absolutely unfit for human consumption should not be used to compel a man to pay duty ; and I suggest that there should be no limitation with regard to the quantity of beer that may have been withdrawn from a vessel before it turns out to be bad and unfit for use. Again, there is the question as to the limitation of time, and as originally proposed the limitation was 30 days. That has been extended to 60 days ; but it must be remembered that in many instances brewers have to send their beer a very considerable distance away. If we take the case of the larger States, where communication is not frequent or rapid with some of the outlying places, a large amount of time must necessarily be expended in sending and returning goods of this kind. For my part, I should prefer that there should be no limitation ; but if there be a limitation I hope it will be of a very wide character. I do not know that there are any other points in the Bill to which I desire to direct attention, but other matters may crop up as the Bill is being dealt with in committee. I think the Minister will find no trouble in dealing with this Bill, and in getting it through with a fair amount of expedition. I observe that some of the definitions in this Bill are a little more restricted than in the Customs Bill, and some of my honorable friends, who noticed that matter in the Customs Bill, may deal with it in this Bill when we get into committee. </para>

                        <para>- I would like to ask if the words, " to the exclusion," as used in this clause, are strictly correct, because I notice that in section 109 of the Constitution the words " shall be invalid " are used. It appears to me that it would be as well to follow the words used in the Constitution, and it would be better to say after the word "Parliament"- </para>

                        <para>- These words have been very carefully considered, and I think they are better than those suggested. The Constitution Act simply declares the effect of our legislation. There is no doubt that any State Act which would be inconsistent with the provisions of this Act would be invalid without any declaration to that effect at all, and this wording merely serves to make plain the application of the Bill. In saying that it shall apply to duties imposed by the Parliament, and to the exclusion after the imposition of such excise of the operation of all State Acts relating to the excise on beer, the intention is to make it perfectly clear that until the imposition of excise by the Parliament of the Commonwealth, the State Acts may remain in operation for the purposes of the revenue. </para>

                        <para>- I think we should have some further explanation with regard to this clause, which is really of very great importance. I do not see any similar clause in the Customs Bill, and this seems to indicate some intention on the part of the Government to follow one course with regard to excise duties, and another course with regard to customs duties ; I mean with regard to the bringing in of what we are all looking for, the uniform Tariff. I presume the uniform Tariff will impose not only duties of customs, but also duties of excise, and I should like to understand from the Vice-President of the Executive Council whether this clause indicates any intention on the part of the Government to bring in these duties of excise in any different way to that which may. be proposed by the Government with regard to duties of customs. </para>

                        <para class="block">But in order to make it perfectly clear that the operation of the Beer Acts in the different States shall cease after the imposition of the uniform duties the other words are added. In the State Acts there may be provisions which it is necessary to keep in operation right up to the imposition of uniform duties of excise, and for that purpose the clause is put in this form. The honorable senator has noticed that there is no similar provision in the Customs Bill. In that Bill we deal with a great variety of legislation in the different States. For the purpose of the bookkeeping sections of the Constitution, it may be necessary to keep alive provisions of State Customs Acts which cannot be applicable to the collection of revenue after the imposition of uniform duties. Therefore it is thought better to leave all questions under the Customs Act to the operation of section 109 of the Constitution. </para>

The section of the Constitution upon which we are relying under the Customs Bill is section 109, leaving it to the interpretation of the enactment which is in question in each case, in the light Of that section, to determine whether or not the Act is in force. There is no such difficulty here, and therefore we can put the provision plainly on the face of the Bill. The honorable senator can rest assured that this matter has been carefully gone into, and that it is necessary, in order to state plainly what the effect of the Act and its application is, to have the clause in that form. . </para>

                            <para>- It is impossible to give that information. It altogether depends on the form of the Act imposing excise duty. The collection of the duty may commence on a certain day, the day on which the proposal is laid on the table of the House, or on a later date. I cannot make any statement about the date at present. The honorable senator will see at once that it is a part of the general policy of the Tariff which it would not be desirable to make a statement about at the present time ; but we shall have regard necessarily to the date of the collection of the duties in deciding the day on which the proclamation is to be made. </para>

I understand that in the strict sense of the word no such thing as a quart bottle of ale is sold in any State. What is sold is a reputed quart of ale, and six reputed quarts go to the gallon. The brewers will be compelled to pay duty on ale which is not in existence unless we bring this definition strictly into accord with the facts. I want the definition to be put in this form - "Quarts" or "pints" means quart or pint - bottles of glass or stone, and includes bottles reputed to contain quarts or pints, six reputed quarts or twelve reputed pints to be held to contain one gallon. </para>

                            <para>- Under this definition the bottles may be of either glass or stone, and with regard to the other difficulty, it is simply a matter of arithmetic. The words of the definition include both the reputed quart or pint and the actual' quart or pint. What my honorable friend aims at is really included in the definition. </para>

                        (Tasmania). - It is a very important thing that the brewers should not have to pay on more ale than the bottles contain. The duty on a dozen of ale in the one case would be 1 2s. 6d., and in the other 17s. 6d. The brewers are rather concerned about this phraseology. Although I, as a lawyer, think that the Minister is right in what he says, still there is the possibility that a collector may say - " Here is a quart bottle; four quarts goto a gallon. I do not know anything about reputed quarts, and I shall charge you duty on a gallon." As it involves the payment of duty, I think the definition ought to say what it means.

An Act of this sort must be worked very largely by regulation, and the reference is throughout these clauses- to the working 'of the Act, which, of course, will include the regulations. If the amendment which my honorable friend suggests were made, it would be necessary all through the Bill after the word "Act" to insert the words "and regulations thereunder." It is to save the repetition of that phrase that we adopted this method in the interpretation clause. The only regulations which could be proved as binding under the Act would be those which had been properly made and laid before Parliament. No other regulations could be enforced. </para>

                        <para>- Some brewers are dissatisfied that every year they should be called upon to give a fresh security or bond for the annual licence. They say that they have to pay a stamp duty in some States on each occasion. The amendment I intend to propose in the clause is to the effect that when the security is given, it shall be security, not only for the licence for that year, but also for the renewal of the licence. There is no danger in making that amendment, because under clause 18 the collector may require the applicant for the renewal of the licence to give fresh security, and if it is not given, he may refuse to renew it. If, after a bond has been given three or four years back, one of the sureties dies, or from being a millionaire becomes practically a pauper, the collector may ask for a fresh bond. But my object is that there shall be no need to get a fresh bond when only a renewal is required. I move - </para>

                        (Tasmania). - I take it that when a licence is issued security is given for that particular licence, and when a new licence is issued the security is dead. In Tasmania, licensees have to give a new bond every year. The bond in future will be so worded as to be a security not only for the licence this year, but for all future years, until the collector asks for a new security, under clause . 18. Clause 18 is inserted because a bond may be given by a gentleman who is worth say £.10,000 this year, and next year may not be worth 10,000 farthings. The surety may before the end of the year become a poor man, and the collector must have the right to ask for a new bond on that account.

                        <para>- I do not think there is any difficulty about it. The intention is to allow this bond to be given once and for all. It may extend for a number of years as long as the collector is satisfied. That is why power is given in clause18, so that if a man's credit is going down, or the business is conducted in a way that makes the bond not worth so much, a new security may be demanded. There is no reason why the bond should be for more than a year. If it is only for a year it will only hold good for a year ; but the amendment will enable the bond to be given for a longer period if necessary. </para>

                        <para>- It has been suggested that the power contained in this clause is rather an enormous one to put into the hands of a collector - that he can, for any offence whatever, cancel a brewer's licence. Under the Tasmanian Act, even for an absolute attempt to evade payment of duty, there is a fine of not less than £100 and not more than £200. Under our own Customs Bill, even for smuggling, it is not proposed to take away an importer's licence. But under this clause," the whole of a man's trade, so far as it concerns the one article he manufactures, may be taken away from him. This is an enormous penalty to impose. Therefore, I ask the Minister if he will not agree to amend the clause so as to provide for an appeal against the decision of the Minister ? </para>

                        <para>- I do not see the matter in the same light as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson.</inline> This clause gives to the Minister a power - which may be exercised or not- to take away a brewer's licence where there has been an offence against the measure. Offences against such measures are mostly of a serious character. Generally speaking they are connected with the management of a brewery, and would have the effect of preventing proper supervision, or leading to the concealment of details of the working of the brewery, or some other means of defrauding the revenue. There are numbers of offences for which forfeiture of the licence would not be too severe a penalty. So long as the licence is continued the licensee has the right to carry on his business. There is no other way of stopping him except by cancelling his licence. If a man cooks his accounts or alters his books in such a way as to defraud the revenue for months at a time, it is not sufficient to impose a pecuniary penalty. It is not to be supposed that forfeiture of the licence would be insisted upon for a trivial offence. Here arises the old question of giving large powers to the Minister, and trusting him not to use them in trivial cases. </para>

                            <para>- That is the case. Every one who has had to deal with administration is aware that the real difficulty is to get Ministers to uphold the law strenuously. There is a much greater tendency to give way and be lax in the administration of Acts. This is a power that should be in the hands of the Minister for the prevention of the defrauding of the revenue. The only punishment that is adequate to a serious offence is taking away the licence. This is a very different thing from taking away a publican's licence. In that case a man has to comply with certain rules, which are made in the interests of public morality. But the rules that will have to be complied with under this clause affect the revenue, which will be left open to be plundered if a brewer who resorts to these practices is allowed to continue to carry on business. </para>

The power conferred by the clause may be , used very harshly. In any case a pecuniary penalty ought to be sufficient for a first offence. I suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> that the clause might be modified so as to make it approximate more closely to the procedure adopted in most Licensing Acts. We should probably meet the wise by inserting the word "twice" before the word "convicted." </para>

It is not proposed for a moment to make the clause mandatory, but to say that it may be in the discretion of the Minister to cancel a man's licence if he has been twice convicted. For a first offence the penalty provided may be adequate punishment if enforced to the maximum, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> must see that it is better that the Minister should have full power to punish more severely any repetition of the offence. </para>

There is no doubt that where these powers are given there should be some limitation of the offences that are to render a licensee liable to the cancellation of his licence. Before <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> made his suggestion it occurred to me that the clause might be amended so as to provide that this power should not exist with respect to trivial offences. </para>

                        <para>- I find that under the Licensing Act of Victoria, which affects the product of the brewer, there is provision for the removal or the cancellation of the licence, and it is looked upon as a very serious punishment, and can only be inflicted in the case of a third conviction. Of course such a punishment affects not merely the licensee of the house, but also the owner of the property. In the case of a brewery, a comparatively small offence by the holder of the licence should not be followed by so serious a punishment as the cancellation of the licence. I believe 'the power should be exercised only upon a second conviction, and I would prefer that it should be as in the Victorian Licensing Act, only upon a third conviction. </para>

I have had as touch experience 'in Connexion with these matters as most 'honorable senators ; I have interviewed Ministers in Connexion with such matters, and I. do not believe that what has been suggested is possible. The Minister leans rather too much the other way, and if he errs at all it ison the side of leniency. The suggestions made appear tome to show a want of confidence in. the administration of the Common wealth, which I think is regrettable. We must leave some discretionary power of this kind in the hands of the Minister. </para>

I am sure the committee will see that it is the repetition of an offence which is the great thing. No Minister would think of forfeiting a man's licence for a smalloffence,nor do I think he would do it for a first offence, even of a grave nature. But if the offence is repeated, the Minister should have this power. From a cursory glance at the Victorian and Tasmanian Acts, so far as I can see, they contain no such provision. There are penalties of £100 and £200 provided for not stamping beer, and for using formerly used stamps or false stamps, but there is no provision for forfeiting a licence for any offence. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> has not given us a precedent for this clause, and it is not contained in the Acts to which I have referred, I hope he will accept my amendment. </para>

                            <para>- I did not suggest anything so absolutely preposterous. I do not see that because there is an example - and perhaps a shocking example - to be found in the legislation of one of the States, that is a reason why the representatives of the other five should accept a provision of this kind. This seems to me to be a very harsh clause, and though it may appear an extraordinary thing, I venture, with a great deal of diffidence, to offer my support to the amendment proposed by my erratic friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson.</inline></para>

If this power is given in a case where a man has been twice convicted of an offence, the clause will be a strong deterrent, and there will be less likelihood of any offences under the Bill being repeated.

It will be recollected that in the early part of this year a number of deaths occurred in the United Kingdom from drinking arseniated beer. In Australia at any time some impure substance may be mixed with beer, and in a case of that kind the Minister should have power to cancel the brewer's licence. There may be in the trade extreme cases which would need the extreme penalty of the cancellation of the licence. </para>

                    <para class="block">This amendment, if made, will meet the case of two very well known breweries. The first is the Cascade Brewery, which is situated at the foot of Mount Wellington, in Hobart - about two and a half miles away from the delivery store and the bottling establishment. All the amendment seeks to do is to enable the collector to grant a permit to remove certain beer to the bottling establishment and delivery store, to be there bottled and dealt with. The amendment is also absolutely necessary on account of the stamp. The carter's note has to be so dealt with that the duty stamp will be half on one part of the note and half on the other. Therefore, if half is retained at the brewery and half at the bottling store, there is no part to go to. the purchaser. It will be some advantage to the revenue to allow the bottled ale to be delivered from the delivery store. The proviso to the amendment is designed to meet the case of a brewery at Ballarat, which has three different establishments. When I asked the manager why he could not allow the bottled ale to go from one establishment, he said - " Some of my customers prefer the north brewery, others the south brewery, and others the east brewery. Each customer likes his own particular brand, and so I am ordered to send bottled ale from a particular brewery. Ale in bulk has to go to the brewery where all the bottling plant is, and in that way I desire to carry on my business." The amendment enables a permit to be given by the collector or any of his officers for the removal of beer in bulk from one brewery to another in which the bottling is carried on. I think there can be no objection by the Minister <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> my amendment. </para>

                        <para>- There is a good deal in what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> says as to the case of breweries such as he has described, and 1 understand that in several State laws a provision of this kind is made. The amendment no doubt will lead to increased work on the part of the collectors. It will necessitate closer supervision. On the other hand, I find that there is a penalty of £1 0&lt; ' for a breach of any of these conditions. If beer is removed contrary to a permit - if the provisions of the law are not carried out - the offender is liable to a penalty of £100, and to the penalty of the forfeiture of his licence. I do not see much harm in the amendment. </para>

                    <para>That after the word "beverage," line 2, the following words be inserted - "and has been returned in the original vessel to the brewery from which it was delivered, or if it is destroyed by the permission of the collector, a refund of duty shall be made in manner prescribed." </para>
                    <para class="block">The clause as it stands says, that not more than an eighth of the quantity shall have been consumed, and that it shall have been returned to the brewery in the original vessel within 60 days. Two limits are imposed - one as to quantity, and one as to time. The trade think that there ought to be no limits if they are to be dealt with in a reasonable, manner. They quite agree that the beer should be returned in the original vessel, or else that a certificate should be obtained from the collector that the beer was destroyed as unfit for human use. If they give that evidence, they say they ought to have a refund of the duty paid by them. In some cases it may be reasonable to have a limit, but the one-eighth might be exceeded by a gallon. The ale might be sent to a district a long way from a port or a train, and it might not pay the brewer to incur the cost of bringing it back to the brewery. On the other hand, he might be ' kept waiting there simply because the collector's officer did not come along and give a certificate that the ale might be destroyed. In that instance, the limit of time existed, because the officer was not on the spot, and through no fault of the brewer. The brewer is entitled to a refund of duty without putting in this limitation as to quantity and time, which might impose a hardship upon him. </para>

                        <para>- I do not see my way to consent to this amendment, the purpose of which is to allow duty to be refunded when it has been paid on beer which becomes unfit for human consumption, and which may be returned at any time and without any limit as to quantity. The clause is intended to meet the case where, perhaps, beer has been sent away, and some of it may have been consumed, and where the rest may have become sour and unfit for consumption before one-eighth of the total quantity has been consumed. But for the protection of the revenue the beer should be returned within a reasonable time. </para>

                            <para>- These leavings are frequently endeavoured to be returned as beer that has gone bad, and a refund of duty is demanded. We should be disregarding the purpose of this Bill, which is for the protection of the revenue, if we left open the door to frauds of that kind. If a man has had beer for a reasonable time, and has consumed the principal portion of it, it is only right that the duty should be paid, and the clause is only intended to meet cases where beer has gone bad through some cause, after only a small portion has been consumed. </para>

I must ask my honorable and learned friend to absolve the brewers from doing what he says the publicans do. Does he mean to say that the publican and the brewer act in collusion - that the publican puts into a cask the drainings aud leavings of other casks and sends the beer to the brewer, who then makes a demand for refund of duty? I have never heard of such a thing. </para>

                            <para>- It may take place, but I have never heard of it. We might perhaps leave in the 60 days provision, but as to the quantity I must ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> to give way a little. What is the. use of saying that a refund may not be made if more than one-eighth of the cask has been used ? Suppose half the beer goes absolutely bad, and the publican goes to the brewer and gets half a cask of good beer in its stead. There should then be a refund to the brewer on account of the half cask that has gone bad. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that the general practice is at present that where any portion of the beer goes bad the Government refund the duty on that portion to the brewer. If the "Vice-President of the Executive Council can see his way to provide that when at least half the beer has gone bad there shall be a refund of duty, it will be a fair provision. In New South Wales I believe there is no restriction placed on the return of beer at all. In that State if only a quarter of the beer is left in the cask, and the rest goes bad, an allowance would be made in respect of it. We do not want to do an injustice to the brewers. </para>

It is only in the free houses that df a brewer sends bad beer the publican can send it back. In the majority of instances publicans in tied houses cannot do so. It is more than their position is worth. I have drunk beer myself, and I know that in a majority of the tied houses the beer is not nearly as good as one gets in free houses. Every one who has drunk beer knows that. The simple effect of the clause will be that brewers will take good care that the beer they send out will not go bad, and in that sense it will be a useful provision in the public interest. </para>

                        <para>- The more I look into this clause, the more dangerous it seems. The system of making a refund of duty on beer because it is likely to go bad is peculiar to the brewing trade. I know of no other trade in which the duty is refunded because an article goes bad. The importers of beer get no refund. Consequently, I do not see why there should be any refund at all; but, like other honorable senators, I have been waited on by those interested in the trade, and, as I understood them, they frankly acknowledged that there was a very great temptation in the 'direction <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> has referred to of filling up casks with water. One of them said plainly to me, " It is easy enough to let a cask stand open in the yard in <inline font-style="italic">wet</inline> weather." This was said to me by a very high authority - an expert. If one-fourth instead of one-eighth were provided for in the clause, it ought to be satisfactory. I shall vote against the proposal to make the quantity one-half. </para>

                        <para>- When this matter first came up I was disposed to vote against both the clause and the amendment, but I feel inclined now to stand by the clause. There is the greatest possible danger in a provision of the kind. It is not a question of whether the brewer or the publican is given to fraud. But suppose the publican does return a cask, what is to prevent a brewer adding to that quantity of beer by putting in spoiled beer, and then pretending that the publican has returned it all to him ? </para>

                        <para>- Compromises over clauses of an Act of Parliament should not be treated quite in the same way as bargaining between man and man, and if the Vice-President of the Executive Council was prepared to agree to some compromise with me, and I tried to get something more, I should have no business afterwards to come back to him and hold him to his offer. But when a Minister offers one something by way of compromise, it is because he considers the offer a fair one, after hearing the discussion and the amendments proposed. I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> must now believe that one-fourth would be as fair as he thought it would be half-an-hour ago, when he mentioned the matter to me. The honorable and learned senator must know that brewers lose an enormous quantity of ale upon which they have to pay duty. </para>

                        (Tasmania). - The Minister has stated that he mentioned the matter to me privately, and that I subsequently repeated what he said to the committee. If I have done anything wrong, I tender my apologies to the Minister ; but when an honorable senator who submits an amendment is informed by the Minister in charge of the Bill that, as a compromise, he will agree to a certain course being adopted, that can hardly be taken as a private communication. I hope the Minister does not mean to accuse me of making use of a private communication.

                        <para>- The point raised is, I think, a sound one, and perhaps the better way to get over the difficulty would be to commence this clause with the words - " Except as provided in section 27 no beer shall be removed from any brewery or delivery store." The clause would then make provision for the delivery of beer from either the one or the other. </para>

                        <para>- This clause has been pointed out to me as a most serious one affecting secrets of trade. I am told that all these breweries have their own particular mode of brewing. I regret that this Bill, like the Victorian Act, does not make it penal to have certain drugs in the brewery. It does appear unfair that the officer, after having access to all these inner secrets, should be able to go and sell that information to some one, or probably get an engagement, and Start in opposition. Surely there ought to be some means of protecting a brewer against such robbery. </para>

The power of supervising, for the purposes of revenue, what is going on in the brewery would be quite useless without a power of this kind, lt is similar to that which has existed before. </para>

                        <para>- I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sargood</inline> that there is a very considerable danger of trade secrets leaking out through the inspectors. I suppose that what establishes the superiority of one brewery over another is the manner in which the ingredients are used in the manufacture of the beer or the proportions they use in the making of it. There seems to be nothing to prevent an inspector, if he were dishonest, from communicating these secrets to others at a very considerable profit to himself. We appoint an inspector, whom the brewer has no power over, and who, under the Act, becomes acquainted with the exact mode of manufacturing. That knowledge will be exceedingly valuable to another brewer. It may add in a certain degree to the security of the brewers if the inspectors have to make a declaration of secrecy in the same way as officials in the Post and Telegraph departments are required to do. </para>

                            <para>- have a strong objection to these declarations if they can be avoided. I find that this clause does go beyond the provision in all the Acts I have seen, in giving the right to the officer to be present at the making of the beer. There may be some sacred and mysterious process in some part of the brewing. There is no desire to pry into that process, and I think the clause will be quite as effective for revenue purposes if that portion is omitted. I move - </para>

Adulteration is carried on to a large extent at present, and we know that cases of poisoning have occurred in Great. Britain through noxious drugs being put in beer. There have been cases in Australia where brewers have been found importing such drugs. It is our first duty to look after the health of the people rather than after the interests of the brewers. It is quite competent for us to insert in this Bill a provision prohibiting the use of noxious drugs. </para>

                        <para>- No one will deny that it is a right thing to forbid even the presence of articles of the kind mentioned in the amendment in brewing establishments, but we must not forget that this is only a Bill for the purpose of enabling excise duties to be levied effectively, and for taking such precautions as are necessary for the prevention of fraud. The provision the honorable senator has referred to is a proper provision to be inserted in a Health Act, and in most of the States there are Health Acts which contain such provisions and give power to inspectors to carry out the duties which would be involved in conducting matters of this kind. </para>

                            <para>- That is a very different thing. It is a matter which is better dealt with in the State Act dealing with the adulteration of food. If we insert a provision of this kind in such a Bill as this, how is it to be administered ? The officers under this Bill will be charged with the duty of looking after the interests of the revenue, and it seems to me they should not be charged with duties which properly belong to inspectors under a Health Act or Foods Adulteration Act. I have no hostility to the spirit of the amendment, but I do not think this is the right place for it. </para>

                        <para>-I trust that the Government will take up the same position on this matter as they took up in dealing with the Customs Bill on the question of the importation of oleomargarine. If oleomargarine is a deleterious substance, surely impure beer adulterated with these chemicals is quite as injurious; An amendment has been agreed to, under which a Customs officer would not require to be present at the making of beer, and that is the time when these ingredients will be added. That renders it all the more necessary that this amendment should be accepted. Under a Health Act only occasional visits are made by inspectors, but the excise officer would be constantly on the premises of a brewery. I trust the committee will not accept the advice of the Vice-President of the Executive Council, but will deal with this matter as it is dealt with in Victoria, and not in a Health Act. </para>

If it is accepted as an amendment to clause 56, any one who waters beer to increase its bulk will be subject to the some penalty as a person who adulterates beer with poisonous substances, and no one would say that there should be the same penalty for the two offences. I suggest that the amendment should be withdrawn with a view to proposing it as a new clause when the Bill is recommitted. </para>

It is exactly to the same purpose, and one clause appears to have been cut out of one Act, and the other to have been cut out of another Act, in the drafting of the Bill, if I may apply the term to an operation evidently performed with the scissors.

                        (New South Wales).That is not a correct statement. Clause 42 says that no bottled beer shall be removed from a brewery unless a label is affixed to each bottle, but clause 57 does not say anything about removing beer from any other place than a brewery. Surely it is not intended that there shall be two labels put on a bottle of beer. No such thing as a bottling establishment is mentioned in either clause 42 or clause 57. There is only one place where the beer can be bottled, and that is in either the brewery or the delivery store. Surely it only wants one supervision for one label to go on one bottle.
