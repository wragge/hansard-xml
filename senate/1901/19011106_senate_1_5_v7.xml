                <para>I regret, as I am sure every honorable senator does, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> is unable to be present to move this motion. I believe that I express his sentiment when I thank <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer</inline> for the very courteous position which he has taken up. It is also due to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer</inline> to say that, throughout the proceedings of the Elections and Qualifications Committee, he was uniformly courteous and considerate to his fellow members. I am only doing my duty in putting on record this acknowledgment of his urbanity and courtesy in the chair. I desire to correct a misstatement which has been made in the press that members of the committee have taken strong political sides. I do not believe that any honorable senator has been actuated by political bias. I cannot be charged with political bias, inasmuch as the opinions of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> and myself on some political questions are as wide asunder as are the poles. Having met him on several occasions, not only in the Senate, but in the old Federal Council, I know that he is a very strong free-trader, and, as I take the opposite side of the fiscal question, I cannot be charged with being biased in favour of him. In the inquiry, I took the course which my judgment and conscience dictated to me as correct. I consider that the majority of the committee have all along taken the correct view - namely, that the petitioner had been negligent in the presentation of the petition, and that, inasmuch as he had not complied with the conditions of the procedure which ho adopted, he was out of court. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> ought therefore, in all fairness, to be allowed to take his seat in the Senate. This is a matter to which I gave some thought and consideration while I was a member of the committee, and some time ago I moved accordingly. Therefore, this is not a new proposal so far as I am concerned. I hope that the Senate will adopt the motion and that the sitting member will consequently be entitled to take his seat. When this question was before the Senate on the 24th July last, I regretted very much that I was notable to be present. I communicated with the Vice-president of the Executive Council with a view of having the subject postponed, if possible, until I was able to be present. Unfortunately, circumstances were such that the honorable senator could not comply with my wish. I thank the honorable senator who paired with me on that occasion, so that my vote was not really lost. The elections for senators in the State of Western Australia, as in some of the other States also, took place on the 29th March of this year. I presume that the elections in that State, as was the case in the other States, were conducted in accordance with the existing law of the State. Therefore, if any dereliction of duty occurred on the part of any candidate, or if he violated any law, he must necessarily have violated the law of his own State. I am not aware that there is any other law under which the elections could have been held <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> was elected at that particular time. I understand that some time elapsed before the actual declaration of the poll was made, but that does not alter the fact that he was duly elected on the 29th March. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> violated any provision of the law of Western Australia, surely there was sufficient time for the petitioner and his friends to take any action which they deemed advisable, and to lodge a petition in due form and in due time in accordance with the practice which was ultimately adopted by- them. It is alleged in the petitioner&#39;s behalf that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> was guilty of bribery and illegal practices, that he used undue influence in promising certain persons sums of money for supporting his candidature, and that he or his agent gave to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Croft,</inline> the Secretary of the Political Labour Party and the Trades and Labour Council of Western Australia the sum of &#163;50. These are the charges which are alleged against the sitting member. If they were proved, then undoubtedly <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> would have some difficulty in retaining his seat. Indeed, speaking as a person who has had considerable experience in political matters, and in the conduct of elections, I say that if these charges were proved or could be proved, the sitting member, would not bo entitled to retain his seat. Petitioner Saunders, after a long delay, which is inexcusable, took action under the law and practice of Western Australia. He did so of his own free will. I presume that he waa&#39; advised by his legal advisers to take that course. At any &#39;rate, he voluntarily elected to proceed under the Western Australian law and practice. Therefore, it was most natural that, inasmuch as he was advised to adopt that procedure, he should of course and of necessity have complied with the provisions of the Western Australian Act. &#34;Under that law, a certain course has to be taken, and certain rules must be adhered to, before a petition can be heard. The question arises - did the petitioner comply with those rules and provisions under which he and his legal advisers choose to proceed <inline font-style="italic">t</inline> I contend that he did not. Some honorable senators have contended that he did all that he was capable of doing. I contest that statement. That is the view I have taken all along, and my position is strengthened by the evidence given by the Clerk of this </para>
                <para class="block">Senate in accordance with the resolution passed by the Senate on the 25th July last. When this matter was before the Senate on the previous occasion, it was said that the petitioner had done all he could to get a hearing. Let us see how far that is the case. Sections 146 of the Western Australian Act lays down certain rules to be followed. Those are the provisions under which the petitioner elected to proceed - I presume in accordance with the advice he received from his legal advisers. Those rules lay it down, first, that there shall be a petition, and, secondly, that the petition shall be addressed to the House affected, and presented by a member or left with the Clerk within 40 days after the return. Further, it is laid down that the petition shall be signed and attested, and, fourthly, that it shall be accompanied by a deposit of .&#163;50. It has been alleged that petitioner Saunders complied with every one of those conditions, and that that is all he had to do and could do. How very innocent the petitioner was ! So the allegations made in his favor would lead us to believe. But I do not agree that the petitioner was so innocent ; and certainly I do not believe that his advisers were either innocent or ignorant regarding the law. There was no innocence in their conduct in the petitioner&#39;s case, but an exceeding lack of activity and vigilance. For that lack tho petitioner was entitled to pay the penalty, and not the sitting member. Of course the petitioner and his advisers had before them all the rules with which they had to comply. It has been contended that so soon as the petitioner left the petition with the Clerk he had done his duty. That is the whole point. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sargood</inline> went so far as to say on the last occasion that it was &#39;not the duty of the Elections and Qualifications Committee to enquire whether all the rules of procedure had been complied with, but to go on with the case. Nothing in the instructions given by the Senate could be taken to have that effect. The Senate gave certain instructions to tha committee, who very justly and properly found that, inasmuch as the rules adopted by the petitioner had not been complied with, the petition should not be further considered. In deference to the resolution passed by the Senate on the 25th Jul}-, the committee made further investigations, and exercised, so far as they were capable of exercising, all the care they could in endeavouring to obtain evidence, with the view of presenting their report to the Senate. They examined the  Clerk  of this Senate as to whether the petitioner had complied with all the rules with which he was bound to comply, and whether he was the innocent person some honorable senators would have us believe. I will take the liberty of reading the evidence tendered by the  Clerk  as to whether the petitioner and his friends actually were in a state of innocence, and whether they knew what action had to be taken, not only with regard to the lodging of the petition and having it signed and attested, and with regard to the deposit of &#163;50, but also with regard to the time when the petition should be presented, and as to its presentation by a senator. The petition was presented to the  Clerk,  and, in so presenting it, the petitioner and his advisers were perfectly cognisant of what had to be done, in addition to the fulfilment of the conditions to which I have referred. The Senate met on the 9th May, but the petition was not presented to the  Clerk  until the 23rd May. The majority of the committee, after hearing the evidence of the  Clerk,  presented their report, together with the reasons for the position taken up by them. By so doing, they vindicated this Senate and the  Clerk  against any implicit charge of negligence on their part. It cannot be contended that the  Clerk  was to blame or that the Senate was to blame. The only person to be blamed, and the person who should suffer, is the petitioner himself. Surely it is wrong and manifestly unjust that the sitting member should be harassed, and put to enormous expense in view of the fact that the neglect to which I have referred rests entirely with the petitioner. In Parliamentary practice nothing is more strongly insisted upon than rigid adherence to the conditions as to time in the lodging of a petition. No blame attaches to the sitting member, and he ought to be held innocent until he is proved guilty. From my own experience in connexion with election petitions - which goes back as far as1880, when in the town of Lichfield, I had something to do with the unseating of a member - as well as from reports I have read of proceedings on petitions in the English courts the utmost vigilance is insisted upon on the part of a petitioner. If any concession is to be made it should be given to the sitting member, and particularly to the State which has suffered the loss of one representative in the Senate for months past. The Senate met on the 9th May. The petitioner was here on the8th of May, but he did nothing for a fortnight. The petition was not even signed until 23rd May, 35 days after the return of the sitting member, and on the verge of the 40 days&#39; limit. On 23rd May, it was taken to the  Clerk  of the Parliaments, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Blackmore,</inline> who never regarded the lodging of it with him as equivalent to its presentation to the Senate. Nor did the petitioner regard it in that way. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Blackmore</inline> was examined before the committee on the 15th August, and gave evidence as follows : - </para>

                <para>Some statements were made, and some discussion took place in the Senate during the recent debate on this subject, as to what took place between yourself and these two gentlemen when the petition was left with you. Will you kindly tell the committee what did take place ? - Two gentlemen entered the room which I was then occupying, and came to the desk where I was writing, and said - &#34; We have a petition to lodge with you.&#34; I said - &#34;Certainly.&#34; It is a common thing for honorable members to leave petitions with me, so that I may hand them to them in the Senate when they are wanted. They said - &#34;This is a petition referring to a disputed return which will be challenged,&#34; and they referred me to a section of the Constitution, and said that it had to be presented under conditions prescribed by the law in Western Australia, the Commonwealth not having yet provided the <inline font-style="italic">modus operandi. As</inline> it happened, my attention had never been drawn to the law of Western Australia, and I did not know it ; but they were good enough to produce the Electoral Act, and show me the sections governing the procedure in regard to presenting a petition against the return of a member. Then they opened the petition, and showed me that they had complied with the provisions of the sections of the Western Australian Act. Then they went on to say - &#34; You will observe by this Act that we have to lodge &#163;50 with you as a deposit.&#34; I said - &#34; Very well, I shall receive that, and indorse on the petition that you have lodged it as security for costs. I shall give you a separate receipt, which you can take, so that you may have an extra guarantee.&#34; Then we got into conversation, and they began to talk about further procedure. I said at once then - &#34;As an officer of Parliament, I cannot give you any advice or take any action myself in a matter referring to the unseating of a member, but I may tell you what is the common law of Parliaments with regard to all petitions, and that is, that they should be presented by a member of the House, to whom the petition is addressed.&#34; I particularly guarded myself against referring to any class of petitions ; I said - &#34;All petitions.&#34; Then, of course, as is natural, there was a little more conversation. I said - &#34; Mind, whatever I say to you is non official. Being an officer of Parliament, I cannot interfere in this matter.&#34; But as we got on in conversation, I simply made this remark - &#34;By the way, I might point out to you that there is some difference of opinion as to whether the Constitution Act refers bo the mere technique or <inline font-style="italic">modus operandi</inline> of getting a member returned, or whether it goes further, and applies to matters after the return. My own opinion is that it does not.&#34; To the best of my recollection, <inline font-style="italic">and</inline> I think I am right, that is the extent of what passed between us. </para>
                <para>Was anything said about a member ? - I beg pardon, I am glad bo be reminded. When I mentioned about the common law being for a member bo present the petition, they said, bo the best of my recollection -&#34; Oh, yes, we have thought of that, and we have a member in our eye.&#34; Then they asked - &#34; Would there be any difficulty in getting the petition from you ?&#34; I said , &#34;No,I shall lock it up, and I shall bake it down to the chamber every day, and put it in my drawer of the table, and as soon as a member comes up bo me and says that he has undertaken to present it, I shall hand it to him.&#34; I said - &#34; Until some one comes up to me for the petition, it will go back to my office each day.&#34; That is the extent of what passed between us. </para>

                <para class="block">I think that evidence proves clearly that both the petitioner and his legal advisers had full knowledge of the fact that it was necessary for an honorable senator to present the petition to the Senate in due time and that form, and the Clerk was merely to be the custodian of the petition for the time being. That condition the petitioner did not comply with, and it remained for the Vice-President of the Executive Council to obtain the petition from the Clerk and present it to the Senate. He presented it on the 27th of June, whereas it should have been presented to the Senate on the 28th of May, therefore it was nearly a whole month too late. If ever there was neglect on the part of any person having dealings of this kind it was shown by the petitioner in this case. In view of the evidence, which has been given clearly, distinctly, and concisely, showing that the petitioner and his advisers had full knowledge of the conditions it is now too late In the day to try and persuade honorable senators that the petitioner believed he had performed his duty and complied with the rules of the Western Australian Act when he handed the petition to the clerk. He and his friends deliberately adopted the Western Australian Act, and so far as they knew there was no other law by which they were to be guided. They fulfilled some of the obligations of that measure, but did not comply with the condition that the petition should be presented by an honorable senator within a certain time. I cannot swerve from my position in the slightest degree that the petitioner&#39;s neglect is unpardonable, and that the penalty of his neglect should be that the petition should not be entertained. The honorable senator petitioned against should be entitled to take his seat. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> even asked the  Clerk  whether the petition was going to be presented. The  Clerk  was unable to tell him, but the petitioner was here all the time from the 8th of May. What was he doing&#39;&#93; &#34;What were his legal advisers doing ? </para>

                        <para>- I know from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator .De</inline> Largie, who travelled on the same ship as the petitioner, that he came over on the 8th of May. With regard to the merits of the petition I know absolutely nothing, and I care nothing ; but with regard to the seat of the sitting member I care a great deal. I care not upon what side in politics an honorable senator may be against whom a petition has been presented, but I care a great deal about having justice done. It was not my business to inquire into the merits until the preliminary necessary proceedings had been complied with. They were not complied with, and I know of no court in the world in which one can secure the hearing of a case except upon complying with certain conditions. It was the 27th of June before <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> presented the petition, and it was then received for the first time by the Senate. It has been contended that the Senate is the court, but if so the petition should have been before the Senate in due time. If it was impossible for the petitioner to comply with that condition he should have moved the Senate in the matter. He should have explained that it was impossible to comply with that condition, and he should then have asked :for further time. There was no effort or attempt to do that. The petition was not presented to the Senate in time, nor was any extension of time asked for. I think I said in the earlier part of my remarks that it was contended, on the 24th of July, that the Senate instructed the committee to inquire into the merits of the case, and report upon them to the Senate. When were those instructions given, and by whom ? I believe that that was the contention set up by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sargood,</inline> but I deny that any such instructions were given. I want to know where those instructions are. If the Senate has given instructions, I shall be very pleased to see &#39; them. Certainly the Senate appointed a committee to make an inquiry and report, but upon what <inline font-style="italic">1</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sargood</inline> says, upon the merits of the case, but I deny that. I say that it was with regard to the preliminaries being taken into consideration prior to the merits of the case being inquired into by the committee, whether the court was the Senate or the committee. It was to consider whether the rules voluntarily adopted by the petitioner and his legal advisers had been complied with or not. If the Senate were the court, the Senate would be very guarded indeed in entering upon the consideration of the merits of the case, without inquiring whether the necessary preliminaries had been complied with prior to the hearing of the case being granted. So far as I am concerned the contention positively falls to the ground, inasmuch as I am not aware of any definite instructions having been given by the Senate. When this question was before the Senate very great compassion was bestowed upon the petitioner, inasmuch as he was an innocent man and had clone all he could do. The Vice-President of the Executive Council was exceedingly strong on that point. He told us that no person could gainsay that it was an utter impossibility for the petitioner to do anything else than what he did. I do not agree with that statement at all. I should be very slow indeed to question the authority of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> on legal matters, but I say that this petitioner did not do all that he should have done. He complied with certain of the rules ; why did he not comply with them all <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Who is to blame for his want of compliance <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> It certainly could not be his legal adviser ; otherwise that gentleman could not have given the question the consideration which he should have given it. I should be very slow to believe that the petitioner or his legal, adviser were without knowledge that a further condition had to be complied with, It was not complied . with. I think the sitting member is entitled to all the consideration and compassion, and not the petitioner. I have no prejudice in the matter, but I have a great desire for fair play and justice. Whether the person whose seat is petitioned against is a political opponent of mine or not, .as a member of this Senate, he shall have the fullest consideration and compassion from me, and I shall consider also the State which he has the honour of representing, rather than a petitioner who is absolutely at fault and guilty, according to the snowing of the Clerk, as is demonstrated beyond question and beyond doubt, of the grossest negligence. I say that this element of innocence, so much talked of, and the statement that the petitioner had complied with every condition he was capable of complying with, greatly influenced the Senate in dealing with the question in July last. If my advice had been taken before the report was presented on the 11th of July, and the committee had presented, not merely a bald report, but giving reasons in detail to guide the Senate, I am vain enough to think that a different conclusion would have been come to. Unfortunately a bald statement, exceedingly concise, but without any explanation as to what led the committee to adopt the report, was presented, and in consequence of the lack of detailed information which, I think, should have been supplied, the Senate acted hastily, and, I think, in a way contrary altogether to that in which it would otherwise have acted. </para>

                        <para>- There is another element which I think should not be overlooked. There is the contention that the Senate is the court, and that there should be no limit to the time within which a petition may be presented. If that contention holds good, what is the position of honorable senators ? A petition may be lodged against any honorable senator to-day, to-morrow, next year, or at any time during the term for which he has been elected. Are honorable senators prepared to take up that position, and contend that there should be no time limit for the presentation of a petition. I, for one, decline to do so. I know of no law which one may violate, and with respect to which there is no rule laid down, fixing a limit of time within which a prosecution for such violation shall take place. I am sure honorable senators will see that to adhere to the doctrine that there shall be no time limit in the case of the presentation of the petition against a member of the Senate would be most dangerous. </para>

I hope that the Senate1 will this afternoon deal with the matter once and for all, and that if a penalty has to be&#62; paid it should not have to be borne by the: sitting member, and indirectly by the State: of Western Australia, but by the petitioner who showed gross negligence and a lack of that vigilance, attention and care, which he and his legal advisers must of necessity have: known were required when the petition, was presented. </para>

                    <para>- I was very glad to hear from the speech made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> that he recognised at all events the fairly judicial position I endeavoured to assume throughout this inquiry, although I may tell the-. Senate that I had great temptation at times to be a little in judicial. It appeared to me, to use the words of my friend, to. be a matter which did not require any temper or any feeling of compassion; but simply and solely a sense of justice, and that is the point of view from which I propose to deal with it. This is not a question of compassion for the sitting member, or for the petitioner, or of mercy here or there, but we have to see that we do not begin our record with a refusal to inquire into that which needs inquiry, and with a determination to resist justice at any price. I know no more about the merits of this case than a man in the moon. But the principle of it seems to me to be in a nutshell. &#34;We are sitting under a new Act of Parliament, which provides that a question relating to a disputed election shall be determined by the House concerned, and that the conduct of the election shall follow the law relating to the Lower House in the State where the election took place. The elections for the Senate, as the elections for the House of Representatives, had to take place according to the law of Western Australia. Whether the return was disputable depended on the law of that State, but the tribunal to decide the question was not a tribunal appointed by the law of Western Australia, but the Senate itself. There you have the whole thing in two or three words, absolutely and utterly beyond question. We had no rules, and immediately we met came a petition relating to a disputed election. The petitioner did not know what law to go under, or what procedure to follow. The Clerk said to the petitioner - &#34;The common law of Parliament is that a petitioner has to get a member to present the petition, but I do not know how it is governed by this Constitution. It seems to me that the election had to take place under the law of the State, but when it goes beyond that point I do not think that law does apply.&#34; I am pleased to know that the Clerk&#39;s views and my own agree on that point. The question we have to try is whether this is a <inline font-style="italic">bona fide</inline> petition or not. If it is not <inline font-style="italic">bona fide,</inline> away with it. But, if it is <inline font-style="italic">bona fide,</inline> has there been gross negligence? On the 23rd May the petition was left with the Clerk ; on the 6th June notice was given for the appointment of a committee of disputed returns; on the 12th June that committee was appointed, but by the standing orders it was inoperative until about the 23rd June.

                        <para>- The Clerk did not know whether that was the proper way for the petitioner to proceed. May I be allowed to say that the course followed was in accordance with the usage not merely of Western Australia but of Victoria. We talk of negligence. There is no fixed statutory duty, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> said, for a petitioner to present his petition within a certain time. If there is a fixed statutory duty, it comes under the law of Western Australia, and that has been complied with. The law of Western Australia requires the petition to be left with the  Clerk,  and the House to send it on. The law in Victoria is the same, and gentlemen in both Houses in this State have told me that they know of no case in which there has been a motion to refer a petition about a disputed return, but that it has been left with the  Clerk  as a matter of course, and sent on by the  Speaker  without a motion from any honorable member. I do not say that that is conclusive in the slightest degree, but we have no fixed time, and it is only a question of whether the man was diligent or negligent? If there is a fixed law it will be the Western Australian law, and the petitioner complied with it. </para>

                        <para>- That was the question at issue between the minority and the majority of the committee on the first occasion. Now, approaching this matter with a desire to do even-handed justice, I ask where was the negligence ? The petitioner left the petition with the Clerk on the 23rd May. No one complains that it was not left in time. Where is his negligence after that? He left the petition with the Clerk, and that, according to the law of Western Australia and Victoria, is the proper course, and it is the only course in other places, which have statutory courts, and complete methods of procedure by which the thing works itself out without any motion. Therefore, there would seem to be no negligence. But it is said that there was negligence because the petitioner spoke to the Clerk of the Senate, who said that he did not know what the law of the Constitution was, but that under the law of Parliaments some one ought to present the petition. That, however, was not the law of Western Australia, or of Victoria. What had been going on <inline font-style="italic">t</inline> On the 23rd May the petition was presented to the  Clerk.  On the 6th of June, notice of motion was given for the appointment of the committee. On the 12th .June, the committee was appointed. On the 23rd June, the committee became operative and could proceed with business. On the 27th June, the petition was presented to the Senate. .During the whole interval from the 23rd May to 27th June, between the time when the petition was lodged, and when it was referred to the committee, the petition lay with the  Clerk. </para>

Whether the petitioner assumed that he had to act under the law of his own State of Western Australia, or under the law of the State in which the Senate was meeting, Victoria, the lodging the petition with the Clerk was equivalent to its presentation to the Senate, and the rest was a matter of course, a perfunctory act. </para>

No one could be more happy to be relieved of the position I occupy than myself ; but, at the same&#34; time, if this Senate wishes it to go forth that we are not a mere political body, allowing party considerations to tread upon the sanctity of justice, we should continue this inquiry. &#34;Whether it be continued by the present committee or some other body I care not. I shall be glad to be out of it. At the present time I look upon the subject simply as a person knowing nothing of the merits of the case, but as a fair-minded man of the world accustomed to studying cases, with a desire to arrive at reasonable conclusions. From that point of view, I say that nothing on the part of the petitioner would justify this Senate in denying to bini the right to an inquiry, and to the justice which he demands. </para>

                    <para>- I think that if this Senate has anything to deplore since we first met in this Chamber, it has been the illness of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser.</inline> If he had not been ill we should undoubtedly have had at the present moment a majority report from the Elections and Qualifications Committee, as it was at first appointed to inquire into this petition. That majority report would have met with the approval of the majority of the Senate. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser&#39;s</inline> resignation from the committee resulted in a dead-lock, and led to the difficulty with which we are now faced. On the last occasion when this question was before the Senate - leaving out the time when we had to decide whether the chairman of a committee had a deliberative as well as a casting vote - I contended that there was no evidence to prove that the petitioner had not done all that he could possibly have done under the circumstances. It was my belief at the time that the petitioner really thought that when he presented his petition to the Clerk of the Parliaments, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Blackmore,</inline> he was doing all that he ought to have done under the law of Western Australia. Being under that belief, I thought we had no right to take advantage of the ignorance of any individual on a matter of this kind, particularly as it was the first time any petition had been presented to the Senate on a matter relating to a disputed return. As there was no law on the subject, I thought that we had no right to take advantage of a mistake that an individual might easily fall into. Therefore I voted with the majority, in favour of referring the matter back to the committee for the purpose of making still further inquiries. The committee have taken no evidence on the merits of the petition, but they have, I understand, heard the lawyers on each side. &#34;We have before us no report as to what was said  <inline font-style="italic">hy</inline> these learned gentlemen. But we have before us the evidence given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Blackmore,</inline> our Clerk, and that evidence shows that the advisers of the petitioner are not such wonderfully ignorant persons as might have been supposed. I entirely disagree with the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer</inline> when he says that there is no fixed law on the subject, and that if there is a fixed law the petitioner complied with it. I contend that, so far as the Commonwealth is concerned, there is no law on the subject, but  it was certainly understood that the elections of senators were to be conducted under the laws of the States concerned. There is no  doubt  in my own mind that that was the intention of the framers of the Constitution. It is the commonsense position. Therefore, there was a law on the subject, and the petitioner&#39;s advisers knew it thoroughly. Yet in the most unaccountable manner they failed to comply with the conditions of that law. Take the evidence of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Blackmore.</inline> The petitioner or his representatives came to that gentleman with their petition. Did they look upon the mere fact of lodging the petition with the Clerk as a compliance with the law of Western Australia ? Decidedly not. The)&#39; said, &#34; We have in our eye a senator who will present the petition.&#34; Is it to be supposed that, if they had their minds thoroughly made up as to the procedure they ought to adopt, and if such procedure had been in the direction of simply leaving the petition with the Clerk, they would have thought it necessary to do any more? Nothing of the sort. But they distinctly said, &#34; We leave it with you &#34; - to do what with it ? Was the Clerk to present it to the Senate? Decidedly not. Was he to hand it to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President</inline> ? Decidedly not. He was to hold it in his hand for the purpose of safe custody, and give it up at the proper time to a senator who would present it to the Senate - the very procedure which the law of Western Australia prescribes. Therefore, the petitioner knew thoroughly well what he  had to do, and it is not for us to inquire how it is that he neglected his duty. I suppose that there is scarcely a senator who would not have presented that petition if he had been asked. I should never refuse to present any  petition  if it were respectful, even though I disagreed with what it asked for. There is never any difficulty in obtaining a senator to present a petition. But the petitioner&#39;s advisers waited day after day, although they knew exactly what procedure had to be taken. They absolutely neglected the petition and the procedure. So far as the deposit is concerned, they had paid the money. They had complied with the whole of the law of Western Australia, except in regard to the presentation of the petition, which they had prepared in proper form, and had ready for presentation. It was not left with the  Clerk  as a compliance with the law of Western Australia. Therefore, the petitioner did not comply with the law&#39; of Western Australia, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer&#39;s</inline> contention, that if there is a fixed law governing the case they compiled with it, is a mistaken one. There is a fixed law, but they did not comply with it, and as they neglected to do so, they must suffer the consequences. </para>

That has been shown to be the case in regard to a petition presented to the House of Representatives against the return of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline> Solomon.

But here we have a man deliberately coming to the Clerk of this House, knowing what to do, and doing it up to a certain point, and then neglecting to attend to a certain matter. Therefore I shall vote for the motion. </para>

                    <para>. - I sincerely hope that the Senate will not be led into taking the course involved in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey&#39;s</inline> motion. To do so would be, in the first place, to absolutely stultify the Senate itself, and, in the second place, to deny justice to the petitioner, on grounds which are in themselves not only untenable, but, it appears to me, absolutely farcical. I cannot understand how any honorable senator who remembers that we are dealing with the question of the rights of the petitioner, as well as the rights of the sitting member, could come to the conclusion that, on the flimsy grounds which have been put forward by one section of the committee, and by the mover of this motion, we should deprive any one of the slightest right which any mau might claim, much more than that we should deprive him of the right of sitting in this Senate. A great deal of time has been expended already upon this matter. I do not wish to devote any more time to it than is absolutely necessary, but I feel that the credit of the Senate is involved in the course which is to be taken now, and, therefore, I think it necessary to state, in a very few words, the position in which the matter now stands. The Senate referred this petition, on 27th June last, to the Elections and Qualifications Committee. The committee was appointed for the .express purpOSe of dealing with this question, because, although it is a standing committee, open to consider any other petition, there was actually no other petition in existence when it was appointed, and it is unlikely that any other will come before it. The committee having been appointed as the tribunal to consider this question, the petition was referred to it on 27th June last. Since that time the matter has been before the committee, and now a member of it asks us to take action. In what circumstances ? It has been considering the matter from the 27th June until the 6th November, and has at last arrived at a position in which it is equally divided and cannot determine upon any conclusion. That is the report which it brings before us. </para>

But whatever the reason may be, the committee, being absolutely unable to agree,, has brought up a report to the Senate which deputed it to inquire into the matter. In that report the members say practically - &#34; We are equally divided ; we can come to no conclusion.&#34; That being the case, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> .gave notice of the motion, which has been moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey,</inline> to the effect that the petition be no longer entertained.

As I have said so far as my own opinion is concerned, I hold that the Act and practice of Western Australia have no application whatever. The committee never said so for a moment. But .there was no practice and no procedure. The Senate might have adopted- and I venture to think it was the duty of the Vice-President of the .Executive Council when lie moved in this matter to have formulated - sessional orders governing the limitation of time within which petitions should be presented, and the procedure that should have been adopted. That has been done in every instance with which I arn acquainted </para>
                </quote>
                <para>And so on. I quote from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> page 2890. Therefore the honorable and learned senator admitted that the law of Western Australia did not apply. But the law of Western Australia has been dragged in to the detriment of the petitioner in a curious way. -It is said that it is quite true that the law of Western Australia does not apply ; that there is no procedure which does apply ; that no procedure has been laid down by the Senate which could have been followed, but, because the petitioner himself followed the law of Western Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I sincerely hope that no honorable senator is going to allow himself to be influenced in dealing with this matter by the consideration that he has been making his seat safe by creating a precedent of this kind. I trust that the matter will be decided entirely upon the consideration of the rights and justice of the case. Of course it is true that the Senate might at any time lay down rules relating to the presentation of petitions. But these rules in effect would be standing orders which practically could not apply to a case of this kind, the petition having been presented before they were formulated. No rules could have been formulated before, because in the nature of things a court of this kind is created only after election, and it has no power to create standing orders until the Senate itself is elected. It could not make rules in regard to the presentation of petitions which would have a retrospective effect. It is, therefore, idle to say that petitioner was bound <inline font-style="italic">by</inline> rules which had no existence. It is because he adopted to a certain extent the law of Western Australia, but did not adopt it in full, that we are asked to say that he must be taken to have failed in his compliance with the conditions necessary to be observed before he can be heard on the facts. </para>

                <para class="block">That is to say the committee having reported that the law of Western Australia prevented an inquiry because the petitioner had not complied with it, the Senate taking even a wider ground than that said, &#34;There is no law which prevents a petition being inquired into.&#34; If there is no law to prevent that, then the law of Western Australia does not prevent it. I hope that no honorable senator has so mean an opinion of the intelligence of the Senate as to advance the opinion that because the words &#34; the law of Western Australia&#34; were not used in that resolution, therefore the Senate expressed no opinion as to whether it applied or not. The sole ground for the report of the committee was that the law of Western Australia did not apply, and, therefore, that the petition could not be entertained. The Senate, however, sent back the petition with the intimation that there was no law - meaning the Western Australian or any other law - which prevented it from being entertained. The petition was considered, but the committee could not arrive at any conclusion. Now they report again with the sole difference in regard to the facts that in the meantime they have taken the evidence of the Clerk. I appeal to any honorable senator who looks at this matter in the same way as he would look at any case involving the decision of the smallest possible claim or right, to say whether there is anything in this evidence except in regard to the law of Western Australia. And if the law of Western Australia has no application, is there anything whatever which is relevant in this evidence given by the Clerk? What is the effect of it? The effect of it is simply this : This petition was lodged with the Clerk with a deposit. A conversation took place as to what the procedure was. I am not going into the details now, but the petitioner seemed to intimate that he was inclined to think that the petition might have to be presented by somebody. The Clerk stated what he believed to be the general parliamentary rule, but expressed no definite opinion about it, and he told the petitioner and his friend, very properly, that there was some doubt as to whether the Constitution applied the laws of the. State after the election or not. </para>

                        <para>- The Clerk told the petitioner that in some cases these petitions were to be presented, but he was doubtful whether the law of Western Australia applied or did not. The whole matter was left in a state of doubt and uncertainty, and what is there in that which would deprive the petitioner of the right of having his petition considered if he had that right before ? If we say that the law of Western. Australia is to be applied, that is a different matter, but it is admitted that the law of Western Australia cannot be applied unless upon the ridiculous assumption that because the petitioner has adopted it, we should therefore apply it against him. In what other way does it deprive him of the right which he has to have this petition decided by the Senate? Now, let me state as concisely as possible what, in my view, the right of the petitioner is. Under the Constitution, this Senate is the court by which these petitions are to be tried. From the very nature of things, no procedure could be laid down, or has been laid down, for the trial of these petitions. The Senate, therefore, is the court to try these petitions, unhampered by any procedure of any kind whatever. </para>

                        <para>- Will the honorable senator tell me what the provisions of the short Act should have been, or how any Act could have such a retrospective effect as to deprive, after a petition had been presented, any man of his right under the petition ? With all respect to the honorable senator, if that is the ground upon which he comes to this conclusion, I think he will see upon reflection that he is wrong. The Constitution has provided no general law for the trial of these claims, and it must therefore leave the procedure to the Senate itself. At the time the petition was presented, Parliament could not possibly have provided any procedure, and whether Parliament ought to have provided procedure or not, no procedure was in existence. Under these circumstances, what was the right of a person presenting a, petition to the Senate? Surely, if he brought his case before the Senate in the way in which such matters are ordinarily brought before such tribunals, he did sufficient so far as he was concerned ? He did that on the 23rd May <inline font-style="italic">by</inline> presenting the petition. It is then in the hands of an officer of the House. Then what has he to do ? In Victoria, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer</inline> has said, the practice is to lodge the petition with the Clerk. In New South Wales the petition is lodged either with the Governor - that is, the Executive Government - or with the Speaker, to be presented by them to the House. According to the law of Western Australia, it is lodged with the Clerk. How could any one suppose that in regard to this petition to the Senate, which had no procedure laid down, a procedure unknown to any other Legislature should suddenly be adopted for the purpose of preventing an inquiry being made? Unless the Senate is prepared to adopt that view, I can see no reason whatever why the evidence which has been given by the Clerk should make any difference in the conclusion which the Senate arrived at upon the other occasion. Of course, I admit at once that, the Senate being the sole judge of procedure, it would have the right to say - &#34; Well, this petitioner has taken a very long time ; he has taken months to formulate his claim. On the face of it we can see from that that he has been guilty of such negligence that we ought not to entertain his petition.&#34; The Senate, under these circumstances, would be perfectly justified in laying down its own rules, and in saying that under these circumstances it would not listen to the petitioner. I take it that if a petition was presented, say, so late for instance as at the present time, the Senate would be perfectly justified in coming to such a conclusion. But is that the case here ? Is there here any element of neglect whatever ? On the contrary, did not this petitioner follow exactly and in every particular, so far as he could follow it, every known procedure in bringing his petition before the Senate ? I have spoken of the matter entirely upon the rights of the petitioner and of the sitting member. Something was said here about the innocence or want of innocence on the part of the petitioner. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know who alleged it. I know that with regard to the majority of honorable senators it was no ground whatever for the decision arrived at.. Whatever his innocence or knowledge was, it did not affect his rights in any way. I say now that we should decide this question entirely apart from any knowledge or want of knowledge on the part of the petitioner. It is not a personal matter at all, and not a question of mercy or commiseration in any way. It is a question of what the petitioner&#39;s rights are, and if he has the right to be heard, he ought to be heard. If he has not that right, the action should be taken which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> suggests. Those should be the only considerations. I have referred to the evidence for the purpose of showing that it makes no difference whatever in the facts that were before the Senate when we came to a conclusion on the last occasion. The Senate having come to the conclusion that this petition should be entertained, and that there was nothing in the law to prevent its being entertained, it is now asked to retrace its steps, and to refuse to hear the petitioner. Why <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> On precisely the sane grounds - no other substantial ground - that were before the Senate on the last occasion. I say that it is trifling with the Senate, and trifling -with its position as a deliberative body, that a committee, which has been instructed to do a certain thing, and which has certain principles laid down for its direction, should send a portion of its members here to ask for a further decision, to ask for a reversal of the former decision of the Senate, and that this petition should no longer be entertained. The additional ground they have given - that there has been an unexplained delay and want of diligence on the part of the petitioner, which has been prejudicial to the sitting member - is absolutely without any foundation. In the first place, it is said that the law of Western Australia has not been complied with. Although the sections were referred to in the last debate, I should like to tell honorable senators substantially what the law is that has not been complied with. In the first place, the petition is to be presented by a member or left with the Clerk within 40 days after the return. That has been done. It is to be signed by the candidate or by a person qualified to vote at the election, and certain formalities with regard to witnesses are to be followed. That has been done. A deposit of &#163;50 has to be lodged. That has been done. All these conditions have been complied with. Then it is said that the next condition, section 147, has not been complied with. </para>

And would it not be the grossest injustice to shut out the right of petition here, and refuse to hear this petition because the Senate having the petition before it did not take some action in regard to referring it to some tribunal for inquiry <inline font-style="italic">1</inline></para>

                        <para>- It is the most grotesque injustice that could possibly be perpetrated to send away the petitioner from this Senate, and refuse to hear his petition on this technical ground, which has absolutely nothing whatever to recommend it, and which if followed would certainly be utterly unworthy of the position of the Senate, charged with the duty of inquiring into these petitions, and would bc a discredit to everybody concerned, in avoiding the duty which the Constitution has placed upon it. As I said on the hist occasion, I know nothing whatever as to the merits of this petition. It is a matter of exceeding regret to me, as it must be to every member of the Senate, that this question has dragged on for so long without being brought to a conclusion. I think the way in which we solve this difficulty now is a matter for very serious consideration. On the one hand we are asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> to solve it by frying directly in the face of what we have already decided, and by coming to a conclusion which has nothing whatever, either in law or in fact, to recommend it, and refusing to entertain this petition first because the petitioner has not complied with a law which has no application ; and secondly, because he has been guilty of neglect, when it is perfectly obvious that there no neglect can be pointed to that he has been guilty of. That is one way out of the difficulty which is proposed, and which it is impossible for the Senate to follow in justice to itself, to the petitioner, or even to the sitting member. There is another way suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer.</inline> I presume that as his motion is a contingent notice of motion relating to the same matter, I shall not be out of order in referring to it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer</inline> suggests that the committee should go on. That is also impracticable, because it is quite evident that a dead-lock would occur. Both these courses being impossible, I intend to suggest a course which will do justice to both the petitioner and the sitting member, which may be followed with credit by the Senate, and which is the only practical way it can find out of the difficulty into which it has got through no fault of its own. The committee having had for months the consideration of the petition in hand has found that it is unable to agree about it, and it has come to the Senate for instructions. The only way out of the difficulty is - first, that the committee be discharged from further inquiry; secondly, that steps may be taken if necessary for rescinding in accordance with the standing orders the resolution appointing the committee ; and, thirdly, the appointment of a new committee to which the petition may be referred. I have spoken to the President, and he has permitted me to say that, if requested by the Senate, he will undertake the very responsible duty of appointing another committee. </para>

The way out of the difficulty suggested by the committee is to take the view of one section of it in opposition to a resolution of the Senate. That cannot be done.

                    <para>- I hope that the Senate will not carry the. amendment, because it must be quite evident to every one that it will be utterly impossible to get an impartial committee after the case has been discussed so much as ite has been. If another committee were to take up the work it would be in a worse plight than we are in and, goodness knows,, the committee has not been a happy family. The decision of the committee is practically a majority decision. If it had not been for the unfortunate circumstance which caused <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> to retire, the motion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> would have been practically the decision of a majority of the committee. Therefore, to appoint another committee would be unfair, not only to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> but to the Senate as a whole and the present committee. I do not see how it would be possible, after every one has committed himself on one side of the question or the other, for the Senate to appoint a committee which would be impartial. </para>

                        <para>- We have expressed ourselves very freely as to the procedure under the law which applies to the petition. The whole case hinges so much on the procedure that we could not possibly- get away from the remarks we have made in the Senate and the votes we have given. In the last debate on this question, there was some doubt as to whether the petitioner had received a fair deal in bringing the petition before the Senate. There seemed to be some question as to whether the officials had done their duty ; whether it was the President or the Vice-President of the Executive Council who should have presented the petition. But, with the evidence of the Clerk in our possession, there need be no further doubt about the matter. The petitioner made it clear, when he presented the petition to the Clerk, that he intended to go on, and according to the law of Western Australia, he knew perfectly well the way to go on with his petition, and his very failure to proceed after having said that he was going to proceed in a certain direction proves that the neglect rested solely and wholly with himself. I ask the attention of honorable senators to the following passage from the evidence of the Clerk :- </para>

                </quote>
                <para class="block">My point is that the word &#34; entertaining &#34; meant that the committee should inquire into the matters of the petition, and that they should then have given us a further report on the merits of the case after hearing the evidence. They allege that because they have taken the evidence of the Clerk, therefore something new has arisen which justifies them in reporting again, on the ground that they have made further inquiry. I desire, if I am in order, to cut that ground from under their feet, by saying that I do not recognise the Clerk as having given any evidence affecting this matter, excepting the fact, which everybody knew before, that he did on a certain day receive the petition and the &#163;50 deposit. Another point is that the Senate has already decided that the law - it does not say what law - does not prevent the petition from being entertained. As I understood their arguments, it appears to me that Senators Glassey, Playford, and De Largie, are relying on the ground that the law of Western Australia does apply, that that law has not been complied with, whereas the resolution of the Senate was that the law of Western Australia did not apply, and that there was no law whatever to prevent the petition from being entertained. I would also point out that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> himself ridiculed the idea of the law of Western Australia applying. He emphatically stated his opinion that that law did not apply at all. I am sure, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> that we shall look to you to prevent the Senate stultifying itself, and to see that whatever resolution we pass is in accordance with constitutional practice, and is not a resolution which, by a side wind, undoes something which we did weeks ago after the most thorough inquiry. My first point is that no law prevents the petition from being entertained; and my second point is that the petition was referred back to the committee to be entertained for inquiry, and that that has not been done. The committee have not entertained the petition except by simply examining the Clerk on matters which any court would be bound to take cognisance of. They have by doing that sought to show that they have taken evidence which justifies them in their further report. I contend that it does nothing of the kind. </para>

                    <para>- The only reason why I have risen to speak to the substance and merits of the question is that I feel that, if the motion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> is carried, the Senate will practically, although not technically, stultify itself. I also feel that the Senate will do an act of the very gravest injustice upon grounds which honorable senators would not for one moment entertain if they realized that they were taking upon themselves the position of judges. We have been told that it was the duty of the petitioner in this case to comply with the law of Western Australia as far as he could ; and yet, because the unfortunate petitioner did comply with the law as far as he could, but did not comply with every absolute particle of it, the whole law of Western Australia upon the subject must be taken as our guide in this case. It is said that the law of Western Australia ought to apply, because the petitioner himself thought it ought . to apply. Would any honorable senator advance such an argument before a court? Honorable senators might as well say that if a certain litigant imagined that certain facts were in his favour, those facts would have to be taken to be in his favour. The committee having been told to take back their report for further inquiry, we immediately heard rumours that in all probability they would not entertain the petition, and would refuse to take evidence and to hear the case on its merits. 1 think that almost every honorable senator believed emphatically that the meaning of the resolution passed by the Senate was that the committee were to inquire into the merits of the petition, and examine such witnesses as both parties tendered. But all they have done is to comply with the instructions of the Senate technically by putting the Clerk into the box and taking his evidence. I affirm that there is no evidence whatever to justify the additional report of the committee, except as to facts which we have had all along, and of which we were bound to take judicial notice, that our custodian of records - our own Clerk - had received a certain petition, together with security for costs, which the Western Australian law said every petitioner should deposit. </para>

                        <para>- We are going to adopt the law of Western Australia that there should be security for costs, and that the petition should be lodged with the Clerk. Then we have to look at the law of the Commonwealth itself as contained in the Constitution. It is nonsense to say that the whole of the Western Australian law must be complied with because that law requires the Legislature to send a petition to the court. That process has no application to our procedure whatever. The Legislature in Western Australia might have found that the &#163;50 deposit was made by a cheque which was dishonoured by the bank, or might have had various other grounds to justify it in not referring the petition to the court. But here the Senate itself is the court, and the petitioner presented his petition to our Clerk together with the necessary deposit. The whole ground upon which the further report of the committee is justified is that our Clerk has testified what we all knew all along. </para>

                        <para>- Surely we all knew that the petition had been presented and that the &#163;50 had been deposited. If honorable senators are allowed to take that point, then I will say - what precious fools the members of the Senate made of themselves by discussing this matter for hours some weeks ago ! Every one knows there are some things of which we have to take judicial cognisance. There are certain things of which a judge takes judicial cognisance. When we have a Clerk and documents are left with him to be dealt with in a way to be determined afterwards, we are bound to take judicial notice of the fact that those documents are in his custody. Then is it not ungracious, ungenerous, and unjust not to take into consideration also the fact that no machinery whatever was formulated under which the Senate could hear petitions of this kind in its own fashion. We have not had time to devise our machinery for dealing with election petitions, and yet honorable senators are not willing to make allowances for the petitioner, who could not have known exactly what machinery he had to comply with. I think that if petitioner is refused the justice he asks for, we shall be doing a very grave injustice to him, and shall be putting the Senate in a humiliating position on the first occasion when wo are asked to perform a judicial act. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; but up to the present there are no rules governing this questions. W e have no more to do with the law of Western Australia than we have to do with the law of South Australia or Victoria. The only law that we have to consider in this connexion is section 47 of the Constitution, which deals with disputed elections. The preceding section does not affect the question now before the Senate. That has to do with the election of a member under the laws of a State, unless in the meantime the Senate has taken certain measures. </para>

                        <para>- Surely <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> would connect that motion with the formation of the committee which had to consider all questions. I fail to see why he should attempt to limit the powers of the committee as appointed on 6th June. On the 27th June this question was referred to it, without any limitation of its powers. Therefore, I am justified in saying that the committee was not only empowered, but practically directed, to make full inquiries into all matters relating to the election. The honorable senator says that the petition was not lodged in time. Up to the present moment any member of the Senate is liable to have a petition lodged against his return, until the Senate takes some steps either by act or standing orders, fixing the time within which petitions may be lodged. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> will find that in the draft standing orders there are three or four rules providing for this matter, but up to the present time there is nothing in the Constitution or in our standing orders requiring a petition to be lodged within a certain period. </para>

                        <para>- That is beside the question. Perhaps I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> as to the mode in which a petition should be dealt with, but the Constitution itself places the matter solely within the determination of the Senate. In this case the Senate decided to request the President to appoint an Elections and Qualifications Committee. That was done. It then decided that this petition should be remitted to the committee for inquiry and report. The committee met, and there was a considerable conflict of opinion as to what the preliminary proceedings should be. Unfortunately, up to the present time there has been no finality in the proceedings of the committee in regard to this question, nor is there any likelihood of finality. Even assuming&#39; that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey&#39;s</inline> motion was carried, and that we decided not to entertain the petition, I do not think there would be anything to prevent the petitioner from bringing up another petition on the following day. The motion is not that the Senate should decline to entertain another petition, but simply that this petition should not be entertained. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer</inline> very properly took up the ground that justice should be done. The word &#34;justice&#34; is sometimes open to two interpretations. There is such a thing as &#34;legal justice,&#34; if I may use that term, and there is also &#34;equitable justice.&#34; That they are not always synonymous terms so far as disputed elections are concerned is proved by the fact that under the Victorian Constitution and parliamentary standing orders it is laid down that the strict legal procedure need not be followed in relation to elections, the object being to insure that the equities and justice of a case shall be ascertained. </para>

                        <para>- We both want to see justice done. The petitioner has adopted, rightly or wrongly, a certain procedure which in my opinion does not affect the case in the slightest degree. The Senate has decided that the petition should be received, and has forwarded it to the committee. The committee is hopelessly divided, and cannot come to any decision. A most unfortunate delay has taken place, entailing very heavy costs and loss of time upon both parties. Western Australia has lost the services of a valuable representative during all this time, while the Senate itself has been deprived of the services of a valuable member. Seeing that this delay has not arisen from any fault on the part of either the sitting member or of the petitioner, but has been due rather to the want of action on the part of the Senate itself, it is hard that the parties should alone have to suffer. The question is, What is to be done ? It appears to me that it would be useless to remit the matter to the present committee. On the other hand, it would be a very serious thing to adopt the proposal submitted by the leader of the Senate and practically discharge the committee. I certainly have never known of a case of that kind in my experience. The difficulty would be overcome if the members of the committee could see their way clear to resign and leave the matter open to the President to take what action he might think fit in the circumstances. I should hesitate a great deal before taking such a stringent and novel action as that recommended by the leader of the Senate. I should rather see the matter delayed a little longer before we are asked to vote upon such a strong proposal. </para>

                        <para>- My sympathy and vote would, as a rule, go together, but I recognise that there is such a thing as justice to be done to the other side. A man has a right to petition against the holding of a seat by any senator, and it would be a very serious thing to deny the right, even if the petitioner has delayed in taking action or followed the wrong procedure owing to some misunderstanding. As a matter of fact, I think the whole procedure was wrong from beginning to end, .and that the petitioner need have paid no attention whatever to the Western Australian Act. Since I looked into the matter I have always thought so. Still he did adopt a certain course, and the committee are under the impression that because he adopted that course only to a certain extent he is therefore to be put out of court. I cannot go so far as that. If it comes to a division to-day I shall be compelled to vote for the amendment, but I would very much rather not be called upon to pass what I think would be to a certain extent a slight upon the committee. Under the circumstances, if I were a member of the committee I should unhesitatingly resign. </para>

                        <para>- I have always grave doubts until my mind is made up. I think every honest man should. &#39;I try to see both sides if I can. I may be wrong, and perhaps I am wrong now, but I do not claim infallibility. I believe that this petition should have been presented by a member of the Senate, because I hold that if the Government take up a matter of this kind, it is only a question of pushing the wedge home, in order to get rid of a number of honorable senators. I have seen that kind of thing done in times past. I therefore hold that the Government should be the last to take up a position of this kind, and it cannot be denied that there are members of the Senate who would have presented the petition. In my humble opinion the petitioner had just about made up his mind to abandon the thing. That is how it struck me then, and strikes me now. </para>

                        <para>- We know that the House of Representatives has already thrown out a petition upon grounds similar to those upon which we are asked to throw this out, namely, that the petitioner had not complied with certain procedure. It would be absurd to say that the petitioner need not adopt any procedure. The petitioner in this case deliberately adopted the procedure of Western Australia, but when he came to a critical point he abandoned it. Speaking of the matter of justice, I do not think we have any right to do injustice to the sitting member, because the petitioner has failed on many points in regard to his petition. Holding the opinions I do, if a division is called for I shall have to vote with my honorable friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassev</inline></para>

                    <para>- On the 25th July last we had this matter before the Senate, and after carefully listening to the arguments of legal gentlemen on either side, and being left hopelessly befogged as to whether the petitioner had done all that was required of him, I then recorded my vote in a certain direction. I thought I was justified in so recording it, using my own opinion as a layman and entirely disregarding the opinions given by legal gentlemen on both sides in the Senate. AVe had then no evidence before us that would enable a layman to make up his mind, and the arguments from either side were equally convincing, or unconvincing. But since that date, on the 15th August, something transpired which has put into the hands of honorable senators evidence which might cause them to alter the opinions they expressed on that occasion, evidence which, had I then been in possession of it, would have made me record my vote in another direction. The Clerk of the Senate has given evidence to the committee showing that the petitioner knew what procedure he ought to have taken. I did not know that when the matter was previously before us, because that evidence had not been given. I wish briefly to justify the change in my opinion, and the change in my vote. I said then I was giving a vote for the motion proposed by the Vice-President of the Executive Council in order that the matter might be referred back to the committee, because I had been led to believe that the petitioner had done all that he could reasonably be expected to think he had to do. I find from the evidence given by the Clerk that he did not do all that he knew he was expected to do, and I shall, therefore, have to vote for the motion submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey.</inline></para>

                        <para>- A new trial would take place in regard to the petition, and justice, if it be possible to mete out justice in this particular case, would be given to either side. The difficulty I have is that I do not desire to pass a vote of censure upon the committee, and I do not by my vote wish to take a course unknown in the annals of our parliamentary history. Under the circumstances it would be a good thing if the debate were adjourned for a few days or a week in order to allow the committee themselves to take a certain course. If the committee did not feel it is their duty to do so, I should be prepared to vote in the way I think right in the matter. I hold that there should be an inquiry into the merits of the case. I hold that strongly, and if to-day I have to record my vote it will be in that direction. The whole thing is unfortunate, and I believe that if the course I suggested were taken, and a new committee was formed on the nomination of the President, there is no reason to doubt that the new committee would approach the case in a judicial frame of mind, and do justice to both parties. If in the present circumstances I am compelled to give a vote to-day, it must be in the direction suggested by the leader of the Senate, in order that we may have a new committee to hear the petition on its merits. Since we came to the last decision on this question I hold that the committee have not given the matter the consideration which they should have given it. That, of course, is a matter of opinion, and honorable senators have the right to differ with me as to that. I repeat that I think it would be a good thing to adjourn the matter for a day or two, in order to see if we could not discover some way out of the difficulty the </para>

                    <para>. - There are only two comparatively unimportant points on which the Senate is not in accordance with the other House. When the Bill came back from that House, it was accompanied by a schedule of 104 amendments. We disagreed with seven of those amendments and agreed to a number of others with consequential amendments. The other House has given way in the case of six of the amendments on which we disagreed, and has taken exception to our consequential amendments in only one case. I would not like to say that either of the two points of difference between the Houses is in itself unimportant, but I think as compared with the great importance of the Bill they sink into insignificance. It is exceedingly desirable that the Bill should be passed. The date which is fixed for the Bill to come into operation is the 1st of December, and there is a general feeling throughout Australia that as soon as possible uniform regulations should come into operation. I desire to have regulations ready to be tabled immediately the Bill becomes law. It is also desirable that a Bating Bill should be introduced dealing with newspaper postage and telegraphic rates, and I hope to be able to bring it forward during the present season. For all these reasons, it is very desirable that we should come to an arrangement with the other House, and seeing that it has met us very fairly, it is not unreasonable that we should yield to them in the two matters which are outstanding. There are only two, because the three amendments are substantially the same. The question is whether the word &#34; seditious&#34; shall remain. The objection which has been taken in the other House to it is that sedition is a thing which it is impossible to define. </para>

                        <para>- It is a difficulty almost amounting to an impossibility, and their contention has been that it is not desirable that there should be a power to interfere in any way with correspondence on the ground that it contains matter which could come under a word, the definition of which is so difficult, if not impossible. The offence can be dealt with in another way. My sympathy goes always in the direction of maintaining the utmost secrecy with regard to correspondence. My inclination is to preserve everything passing through the Post office inviolate as far as that can possibly be done. I should prefer that the Postmaster-General should not be charged with the duty of stopping any correspondence on such grounds. I move - </para>

                        <para>- I think it is desirable to retain the word &#34;seditious.&#34; If we do not have some provision of this character, what sort of stuff may get into the columns of newspapers and be disseminated throughout Australia <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> I do not think there is any other clause which gives the Government any power to check the issue of matter which may be of a very grave and serious character. I am quite sure that the Postmaster-General is not a man who would pull up a newspaper for anything which was not of a serious character ; but we can all conceive of publications which would be so gravely seditious that it would be his duty to stop their circulation through the Post-office, even if this word were taken out of the clause. Therefore, I think we shall only be doing our reasonable duty if we allow these words to remain in, and authorize the Postmaster-General to stop the carriage of newspapers which contain matter of a very gravely seditious character. I hope the Senate will insist upon the maintenance of the word. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator does not seem to realize what his protest or objection means. The other House have met us in the most friendly way by accepting over 100 of our amendments without any question whatever. If the honorable senator had been present when our second message went down, he would have seen that we were met in the most friendly manner by the other Chamber. Are we going to hang up this Bill because certain senators think that there are existing in the Commonwealth certain dangerous persons who are likely to disseminate sedition ? I have been amongst crowds of people in all parts of the Commonwealth, and I think that we are a very law-abiding community. The position taken up elsewhere is, that these offences, if committed, may be dealt with under the State Acts. Furthermore, the other Chamber is of opinion that it is very difficult to define the word &#34;sedition.&#34; Such being the case, I think we should give way, and let the measure go through as soon as possible. </para>

We believe we have one of the best forms of Government on the face of the earth. We certainly should not allow a small section of the community to spread broadcast literature that will poison the minds of the people. I hope that the Senate will adhere to the word and will reject the amendment of another place. They only made this amendment by a majority of one. It should not be difficult to get that one member to go over to the other side. Let us therefore adhere to our previous decision. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator PULSFORD</inline>(New South Wales). - I should like the committee to bear in mind that since this Bill was first introduced the President of the United States has fallen a victim to assassination. That was an act of sedition, and there is a very strong awakening throughout the United States as to the evil consequences that follow from sedition being preached in the newspapers. Publications such as have appeared in the past in America are today being curbed, and efforts are being made to punish the authors. If we remember these facts and do our share to keep down such dangerous publications we shall do well. There is no desire to hang up the Bill, and the remarks of the Postmaster-General and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> on this point might very well be met by the representative of the Government in the other House saying that the Government want to get the Bill through at once and that this end will best be served by the amendment not being insisted upon. </para>

                    <para>- I do not think that any honorable senator who loves liberty, as we all profess to do, will have the slightest sympathy with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> in his attempt to Russianize our institutions. The honorable senator tries to frighten us with the bogy of the assassination of the President of the United States. He says that that assassination was brought about by the reading of seditious literature in the newspapers. But will he give us a definition of sedition ? It appears to me that although <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> is a most serious student of the question of free-trade, and a tremendous authority upon statistics, he has never studied history. If he cares to look into the history of Great Britain, he will find that the people who, less than 1 00 years ago, advocated the franchise which at present exists in that country, were taken up, tried, and transported for sedition. We ought to learn from the experience of the past. We cannot promote liberty by stifling discussion. After all, who is to judge of what is sedition and what is not ? A number of people in Australia would consider it seditious if I were to get up and advocate the abolition of the monarchy and the institution of a republic. But I claim that I have a perfect right as a citizen of this country to advocate any change in the system of government if I consider that our present system is capable of improvement. </para>

                        <para>- Why should it lead to that ? Does not the honorable senator see that the conditions to-day are entirely different from what they were a century ago ? At the beginning of the last century only a very limited number of people possessed the franchise. If they wanted any change in the Government the only way they could obtain it was by violence. It is perfectly well known that if the Duke of Wellington had not backed down in 1832 there would have been violence. The people of England were quite prepared for rebellion at that time, and if the Duke had persisted in refusing the franchise there certainly would have been bloodshed. We stand in a different position to-day. The people have the power in their own hands. Every man possesses the franchise. When the ballot is in the possession of every citizen there is no reason to resort to the bullet. There is not the slightest idea that anyone in Australia is going to advocate the use of force to bring about any particular change in our political system. If any one does, he offends against the laws of the country, and if he can be tried under the common law, there is no need to make this postal measure a special vehicle for legislation on the subject. I shall certainly support the Postmaster-General in the attitude which he has taken, up. </para>

                        <para>- Those four words stood in the Bill originally, and they seem to be exhaustive of the character of the offences against the law which can be committed by a newspaper. Why should we eliminate from these words one which will render those which remain not exhaustive of the possible offences that may be committed? If we strike out the word &#34;seditious,&#34; we leave uncovered the power given to the Postmaster-General to remove papers that commit offences that are of frequent occurrence. It has been said that there is more difficulty in defining sedition than there is in defining indecency or obscenity. We must allow a certain discretion to the administrative officers in this case ; but I take it that &#34; sedition &#34; instead of being less definite in character is considerably more definite than either &#34;indecent&#34; or &#34; obscene.&#34; It has already been defined by Stephen. The definition he gives is - to incite any person to commit any crime in disturbance of the peace, or to raise discontent or disaffection among Her Majesty&#39;s subjects, or to promote feelings of ill-will and hostility between different classes of such subjects by unlawful means. Let me put this to the committee. Suppose we were to substitute for the word &#34; seditious,&#34; the definition of it which I have quoted. Is there any one here who would argue that a newspaper that attempted to excite discontent or disaffection by unlawful means ought not to be removed from the register <inline font-style="italic">1</inline></para>

                        <para>- The definition of unlawful is the doing of something by any means that are not warranted by the law of the land. No reason can be advanced for making an exception in favour of newspapers that offend other than by publishing indecent or obscene matter. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> said that the House of Representatives had treated us very fairly, that they had consented to a hundred or more of our amendments, and that it would be somewhat discourteous to run foul of their wishes over a mere trifle. If it is an immaterial amendment, I want to know why the House of Representatives persists in demanding that we should eliminate from the category a word which is included every day in the stereotyped phrase? Any one who has read a law book dealing with offences that can be committed by newspapers must know that the word &#34;seditious&#34; is always coupled with the words &#34; indecent, &#34; &#34;obscene,&#34; and &#34;blasphemous.&#34; If the House of Representatives want us to depart from this time-honoured category, and the amendment is immaterial, why should we give way ? If it is material it becomes material because those anxious to have the word eliminated from the Bill see that it designs to interfere with something that they anticipate may be committed. If they think it immaterial, they have no ground to stand upon. If they think it material their ground must be that they apprehend there will be something published, which, to the ordinary impartial judicial mind, would answer the description of being seditious. </para>

Any one of these is said to be contrary to public policy. It is entirely contrary to public policy that a newspaper should be allowed to remain on the public register which could be dealt with in a court as being contrary to the law. If the matter complained of is not contrary to the law, then it is not seditious, and the newspaper will remain on the register. If it is contrary to the law, and capable of being dealt with in the courts, then the newspaper should not be allowed to remain on the register. </para>

                        <para>- The answer to that is obvious. The Postmaster-General, in carrying out the provisions of this measure, has to do a great deal at his own risk. If he removed a newspaper from the register on the ground that it contained not merely seditious but offensive or indecent matter, and action were taken with the result that it was proved that it did not contain that matter, then this measure would be no answer by the Postmaster-General for his action. I have nothing further to urge. It certainly does seem to be somewhat extraordinary that this exception should be asked for in the case of seditious language.

                    <para>. - It appears to me that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hanley</inline> has not given sufficient weight to the reasons which exist against a provision of this kind, altogether outside the domain of lawyers. It is right that what is seditious is merely a question of degree, that the sedition of today may be the popular parliamentary cry of a few years later. If the honorable and learned member&#39;s definition is to be accepted - and no doubt it is a true and proper definition of what is seditious - then anything which involves an attack upon the existing state of things, and suggests that it should be carried out by unlawful means might be sedition. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harney</inline> knows, the term unlawful is not confined merely to offences of violence. The term may apply to means that are not recognised by the law. If a combination to bring about an alteration of the law, or it might be a strike, or any combination which in the old days was unlawful, no doubt a Judge would have to hold it to be seditious. The difficulty of giving a power of this kind may be described very shortly. The power is to be exercised by the Postmaster-General upon his own initiative and responsibility. He has an arbitrary power, before the matter is decided, of saying whether the newspaper is to be carried through the post or not. The question of sedition will involve in most cases political considerations, and that is the great difference between dealing with this and questions of indecent and obscene matter. In dealing with indecency or obscenity one deals with something upon which the whole community are in a certain sense agreed. The whole community are certainly against what is indecency or obscenity, but in regard to what is seditious the people are not unanimous. There is a party always trying to bring about a certain condition of affairs. It is not a wise thing to place within the power of any administrative officer the light to decide a question of this kind, which may be very largely a political one. </para>

Every honorable senator will recognise that freedom of speech has advanced very much since the days - some 30 or 40 years ago - when these words were recognised as proper.

                        <para>- And seditious also in some respects. Is it wise to place this power in the hands of a Minister controlled by the decision of a Judge of the High Court? If the question came before the High Court, the Judge would have to decide simply whether, according to the definition laid down by the law, the matter complained of was seditious or not, and he would be bound to follow such a statement of the law as that which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harney</inline> read. That is to say, we might have a question of whether or not a newspaper should be carried through the Post-office determined by the Judge on a statement of the law pronounced by some eminent Judge 50 years ago. This discretion of the Minister is to be controlled by the cast-iron rule, which must be administered by the Judge who has to deal with the matter under this measure. The question is whether, considering all the powers that have been given already to the Postmaster-General, considering the other remedies still left for dealing with seditious matter, it is wise to place a power in the hands of the Postmaster-General, in the exercise of which there might be a great deal of doubt and difficulty. I think it must be evident that it is an exceedingly arguable question whether this power should be given. It certainly is against all tendencies of modern thought and freedom of speech to give such a power. We have to remember that this Bill contains many matters with which the other place disagreed in the first instance. We have come almost to a conclusion, and if there is a fair reason why we should give way in regard to any of these amendments, then for the sake of completing legislation we should give way on this particular point. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator PULSFORD</inline> (New South </para>

I should like the Senate to remember that the remarks we have had from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> amount to very little more than special pleading ; he has been showing us what we know : that there are questions of sedition which may be difficult at times to define. But honorable senators are not likely to imagine that the Postmaster-General would for a moment think of removing from the register of newspapers, or of stopping from transmission through the post, any newspaper because of the fact that it contained an article simply of a debatable character. The clause is inserted in order that the Potmaster-General may have power where liberty - which is precious to us all - has degenerated into licence, and where evil is likely to follow. In these circumstances I hope that the Senate will retain the words originally inserted in the clause by the Government and always supported by the Senate. </para>

To-day, because something in connexion with the political morals of the people cropped up, he takes the opposite direction. One day he is flying with the wings of an eagle, and the next with the wings of a dove. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> was continually croaking that we were getting away from the condition of things that existed 50 years ago.

                        <para>- If the honorable senator had lived in the days of King William, I suppose he would have hanged him. They were all seditious in their turn, but they came out on top, and of course they were great men. That is the reason why I think we should not further delay an important measure of this description by going into the particular phases of loyalty or disloyalty which may be involved in such a term as seditious. It depends upon the administration of the department at the time, and upon the administration of justice afterwards. One honorable senator sitting as a judge in the case of a certain expression might declare it seditious, while another might declare that it was not. The history of Great Britain has furnished hundreds of examples where, even in connexion with the administration of the law, party prejudice has led people astray. I hope that, in the interests of the country, nothing will occur to retard the passage of this Bill. We have ample opportunity in the Commonwealth or in the different States to pass laws to deal with those who act against the interests of their country, and we should not introduce our party inclinations or feelings in the discussion of this measure. I hope the Bill will be carried in the way in which it left the House of Representatives, and that it will become law as expeditiously as possible. </para>

                    <para>- This is by no means a new question. Wo are aware that certain honorable senators were opposed to the inclusion of the words &#34; seditious &#34; and &#34; blasphemous &#34; in the Bill, but the Senate determined to insert those&#39; particular words, and at the instance of Ministers. Clause 27 was debated at considerable length, and amendments were made in it, but the words &#34; seditious &#34; and &#34; blasphemous &#34; were left in by the Senate. The other House struck those words out, and when the Senate was called upon to consider the matter again, we met the other House by omitting the word &#34;blasphemous,&#34; and retaining the word &#34; seditious.&#34; Now the Senate is asked to say that the matter is so little worthy of consideration that it is prepared to back down at the request of members of the House of Representatives. </para>

It has been said that &#34; seditious &#34; is hard of definition. We have heard a definition of it, and honorable senators must bear in mind that the matter will be entirely in the discretion of the Postmaster-General. He will not be compelled, because of a legal definition, to say that a paper shall not be permitted to go through the post-office. We may assume that the discretion will be exercised wisely, and that it will not be merely for a technicality that a newspaper will be interfered with.

                    <para>- The next amendment of the Senate to which the House of Representatives has disagreed requires a little explanation. It will be noticed that two amendments in the clause were rendered necessary by the omission of the words &#34;seditious blasphemous,&#34; in the other House. The Senate proposed to re-insert the word &#34; seditious,&#34; but in order to make the sub-clause read grammatically, it became necessary to insert the words &#34; if such issue contains,&#34; before that word. The two amendments hang together. If our amendment to which the other House objects is insisted upon, then of course we insist upon the consequential and grammatical amendment. I feel myself obliged to ask the committee not to insist on the amendments. I regret the result of the division on the lost amendment, because I think it is calculated to hamper the passage of the Bill. Perhaps I should have explained before, that the Bill has made three passages backwards and forwards, and that according to our standing orders our power of dealing with the matter by means of messages will be exhausted on this occasion. If we insist upon disagreeing with the other House, it will be necessary to ask for a conference. I think that the importance of getting the Bill into operation is so very great that it far transcends-- </para>

                    <para>- I accept your ruling, sir, , but I would point out that we are asked to undo by a side-wind, what we did at an earlier hour. It is perfectly certain that had the committee not insisted upon retaining the word &#34; seditious &#34; in the first part of the clause, it would willingly have accepted this amendment as being consequential. I ask the representatives of the Government whether it is fair, having ascertained the opinion of honorable senators, to attempt now to get the decision of the Senate reversed. Some honorable members who voted previously may now be absent. There were 28 votes recorded, and the probability is that if another division is taken there will be fewer votes recorded. If the same senators are present I have no doubt that the division will be precisely the same as the last one, because the principle is exactly the same. I can not conceive that any honorable senator would be prepared to stultify himself by voting in one way at half-past six o&#39;clock and in another way at 8 o&#39;clock. We are asked to stultify the decision we arrived at this evening, and to make the clause absolutely inconsistent. The Senate has to be guided by its own sense of what is right and what is wrong. We have had this question under discussion on four or five occasions, and we have invariably come to the one conclusion. Is it consonant with the dignity of the Senate or with the representatives of the Government that they should say - &#34; We disapproved of the decision given, but we may by a chance vote reverse it and make the clause inconsistent.&#34; Is it reasonable to adopt a course like that? I submit that it is not. The Postmaster-General has said that the other House have conceded a great many points to us. </para>

                        <para>- I will assume that they did so most generously. Take the usual course which is pursued in relation to Bills. We sent a Bill to the other Chamber; they sent it back to us with amendments ; we accepted some of those amendments. Whether we accepted them wisely or not, we did accept them. That showed that we were willing to consider any of the points which they thought important. But, having given way as to the words &#34; blasphemous,&#34; another place wants us to give way as to &#34;seditious.&#34; The matter was regarded by the committee as a matter of principle, and not as one of no consequence. Why should it be regarded as unreasonable for us to stand by our own principles in this matter <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> I am quite certain that a number of honorable senators who voted for the retention of the word &#34; seditious &#34; before the dinner hour believed that the whole question had been settled on that division. Is it fair, therefore, that on the chance of one or two senators being absent through a misapprehension of what the Government would do, the Postmaster-General should go behind their backs and say,&#34;&#34; Now that these senators have gone we are going to try to induce the committee to reverse the decision that has been arrived at&#34;? In other words the Government ask the committee to say that a thing which is black at half-past six is white at eight o&#39;clock. The Postmaster-General may say that this is a matter for a conference between the two Houses, as we have determined one way and the other Chamber has come to a different conclusion. But if we consent to the amendment it will simply show that the committee does not knew its own mind, and that the conference will be a means of ascertaining what the mind of the committee really is. I will ask those honorable senators who voted with the Government before half-past six, out of respect to the Senate, to vote in the opposite direction now. I regret that the Government feel justified in adopting this course. I should have preferred to see them respect the decision of the committee. They should not take advantage of a mere chance vote at an hour in the evening when many honorable senators did not know that such a division was about to be taken. If the Postmaster-General had intimated earlier that the Government intended to divide on the subsequent amendments, and those honorable senators to whom I refer had left, it would be their own look out ; but was it conceived for a moment that the division taken at half-past six was other than a <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> division to settle the whole question? I have heard members of the Government themselves, when defeated in this Chamber, say - &#34; We look upon this matter as being settled, and any amendment consequential - on what- has been done shall be made.&#34; That is <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> fair way to treat the committee, but it is not fair to those honorable senators who may have been under the misapprehension that the Government would abide by the decision given earlier, that the Government should now seek to reverse that vote. </para>

                    <para>- I do not know why the Government should be asked to study the wishes of the fourteen honorable senators who voted for the retention of the word &#34; seditious,&#34; rather than the wishes of those who voted for its elimination. Those who were in favour of the amendment made by the House of Representatives are entitled to just as much consideration as. those who voted against the acceptance of the amendment, especially considering that those who voted against the amendment were not a majority. Had there been a full House I feel sure that the majority would have been in favour of the amendment of the House of Representatives. I think it can also be said that the question now before the Chair is not on all fours with that on which the committee previously voted. If honorable senators will turn to the Bill they will find that the question wc dealt with before the dinner adjournment was that of removing from tho register newspapers containing seditious, blasphemous, indecent, or &#39; obscene matter. But this is a question whether the Postmaster-General shall have power to refuse to transmit such newspapers. Under subclause 4, the question is whether the postal authorities will have power to destroy them. It has been urged in favour of this provision that the newspaper proprietor has power to appeal to a Judge. But if the circulation of his paper is stopped, and the copies of the issue have been destroyed, the matter is already judged so far as his property is concerned. Therefore, the question now raised is a different one than whether the Postmaster-General shall have power to remove the name from the register, because that action in itself does not inflict any irreparable injury, inasmuch as the proprietor can proceed to get an injunction to have his. name registered. In any case, his property is not destroyed, and the circulation of his. paper is not interfered with. Therefore, it can fairly be said that this provision, raises a different question to that raised in. the preceding sub-clause. The fact that some honorable senators who voted in the previous division are now absent is one for which no blame can be laid upon the shoulders pf the Government. It is the business of honorable senators to be here to deal with matters as they arise. I hope that the Postmaster-General will insist upon this amendment, if only in justice to those who supported the Government on the previous question. </para>

                        <para>- Yet let the committee make no mistake about what I mean. It is this - that it is no particular concern of the honorable and learned member to see tins Bill carried. We have spent months upon this legislation. It is legislation for which the whole Commonwealth is waiting, and we have got so far with it that the matter upon which we are now engaged and the question to follow are the only things which stand in the way of the completion of the measure. I can quite understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> is a member of the party that has no particular desire to see this legislation carried out, or to see the legislation carried by this Senate up to the present time passed into law. I suppose that is party politics. I do not know that I am out of order in imputing to the honorable and learned senator that he is a strong party man. I am only calling attention to it to show the value of the arguments of the honorable and learned senator about the position of the Government and the consistency of the committee. The honorable and learned senator wants to make it impossible for this Bill to become law without inconvenience, and wishes to embarrass the Government in any way he can. </para>

                        <para>- I will leave the committee to judge of the correctness of that statement. I hope the committee will not allow the passing of the measure to be frustrated by what is a party move on the part of the honorable and learned senator. I have no hesitation in saying that although this particular amendment involves probably the same question as the amendment dealt with previously, the last division was taken at a time when honorable senators did not thoroughly realize the position in which the question stands. I am quite certain that many honorable senators who voted in that division would have recorded their votes differently if they had realized the true position. At all events the subject is of such importance in regard to the carrying of this measure that I feel justified in asking the committee to reconsider it. It is not a mere matter of whether this or that is or is not inconsistent. The position of the Government is that we shall fight this question on every occasion when we can possibly do so. We shall fight it now and upon the next amendment, and I hope we shall be successful in reversing the decision which the committee have already come to, and which, I fear, was arrived at without really proper consideration as to the consequences which that vote involved. What is it we are talking about? I could well understand that, if it were a matter of vital importance to the administration of the measure, we might insist upon the clause as it left the Senate being retained so far as this particular provision in it is concerned. But what does it amount to? We have given over to the administrators of this postal measure a large number of powers. Amongst them we have given them the power which involves a decision by one man, an official, of a question which it is exceedingly difficult to decide. That is, whether a particular statement is or is not seditious. I am free to admit that there are many statements about which there can be no doubt whatever, and which the Government ought not to allow to be disseminated through the post. On the other hand, there area great many statements and exhortations to action which may be highly disapproved of by the Government of the day, but which are not seditious. What more dangerous weapon could we put into the hands of the Government of the day than the power to stop, through the post-office, the publication of some particular doctrine ? Then the newspaper proprietor has an appeal to the court, which, however, cannot be expected to decide the question on the grounds of principle, but will simply look at it from the point of view of the hard-and-fast, cast-iron rule laid down by Judges in the definition of what is seditious. We are, therefore, face to face with the question of whether, after all, it is a wise thing to hand over that power to any one man. I can understand that power being given in regard to publications that are obscene or indecent. That is a matter of judgment not involving political feeling or party considerations. But the publication as to which the question of sedition is raised may be one which simply contains a condemnation of particular views. Therefore, I have no hesitation in saying that, although this is a Government measure, I feel quite satisfied on a consideration of the matter that the inclusion of a clause of this kind in a Postal Bill is a mistake. Do not we all know that in the history of the empire, in the history of England, and of Ireland, and of Scotland, there are numerous cases of men having been arrested and imprisoned for making speeches which would be within the ordinary rule of political controversy at the present day. </para>

                        <para>- Licence may be an abusive epithet, but that does not help us to settle the question. What one person might call licence, another would call liberty. I am speaking of the substance of the matter - I do not care what we call it - and the tendency is to give more perfect freedom of speech. Where freedom of speech is such that it obviously outrages the system of government itself, there are abundant opportunities for bringing the culprit to justice through the ordinary process of the law. This proposal does not take away the right to prosecute for seditious libel, nor to deal with an offender in any way which the criminal law will permit. The person so charged may be brought before the court, and have his case tried in a proper way, with a jury to decide whether he has been guilty of sedition or not. This puts the power of appeal ultimately, however, in the hands of a Judge, who has to decide as a naked question of law whether the particular publication is seditious or not. </para>

                        <para>- But we must have a definition of what is seditious. If there was an appeal to a Judge, the only question which he could decide would be whether the matter complained of was seditious within the meaning of the law. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harney</inline> frankly admitted a little while ago that the law as to what is sedition has been laid down consistently. If the Judge decided that the matter brought before him was seditious, there would be no remedy whatever against the stopping of the publication, because the Postal Bill goes on to say that the decision of the Judge shall be final. I do not care about quoting law books, as a general rule, but the whole matter turns upon the question of what is seditious, in the sense of the way in which a Judge would be called upon to determine it. I should like to quote now from a great authority - Stephen&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Digest qf the Criminal Law.</inline> It gives a definition of what is a seditious intention, and it is a definition which would be acted upon by any Judge who was called upon to decide the matter - </para>

                <para class="block">I have no hesitation in saying that if some person should be so rash as to publish in a newspaper the opinion that the time had arrived when party Government should be brought to an end, or that we should have a president elected here and some resort to the American system, no one would suppose that the foundations of society were in danger of being subverted. Yet a Judge would be bound to hold that such a statement was seditious, and, if a Postmaster-General, acting upon that view of the law, were to stop the publication, that stoppage would be adhered to. I ask the committee whether, considering the nature of the proposal which was made here - considering how out of touch it is with every tendency of thought and feeling upon the question of freedom of speech - it is right or wise in any circumstances for us to insist upon retaining that word in the Bill. Adherence to this amendment might necessitate a conference with the other House at a time when every moment is valuable. There is another aspect to which we are entitled to call the attention, of the committee. It is true we might have a conference with the other House, but that would mean the interruption of business in both places. </para>

                        <para>- It is all very well to say that, but it would be an entirely new procedure, so far as the Federal Parliament is concerned. It would involve constitutional questions as to procedure and practice, and all simply because the Senate insisted upon retaining something which ought not to have been in the Bill originally. It is one of those things which may be copied from Bill to Bill, going back to times when the powers of Government and freedom of speech were very different to what they are now. </para>

                        <para>- What of that? The Government are not infallible. They may make mistakes which other people may make. I think that if I had been speaking to the matter originally I should have said that it went too far. We are dealing with the position as it is. I ask the committee to remember that they are likely to miss the fruits of the long labour which they have devoted to this Bill, and to throw back this very necessary legislation. In any event, the proceedings would be protracted if the committee adhered to its determination. I ask the committee to assent to my honorable and learned colleague&#39;s proposition, and to take steps to make the Bill law in the shortest time possible. </para>

                    <para>- The observations which have just been addressed to the Senate would have had a good deal of force, perhaps, if they had been used when this matter was first discussed this afternoon. I take it that we will try to give some sacredness to our own decisions. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has said that this case is different from the one with which we dealt this afternoon. Personally, I thought at first that this should have been a consequential amendment. I see now that it is a different case, but different only in being very much stronger. What we decided this afternoon was that the Postmaster-General should be at liberty to remove from the register the name of a newspaper one of whose numbers contained seditious matter. What we are now asked to do is to allow the number which we decided this afternoon should incapacitate further issue of the whole paper, to be itself disseminated. There may, perhaps, be senators present now who did not vote on the last division, but whatever their opinions may be, I would ask whether they are prepared to allow a Bill to leave the Senate which provides that an article containing certain matter is to destroy further publication of the whole newspaper, but, nevertheless, that that article itself is to be freely published. That is what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> seriously asks us to do. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> said there were fourteen to fourteen on the last division, and he asked why should the opinion of one fourteen be regarded as more important than that of the other? My answer is that it is so by virtue of the Constitution which says that where the numbers are equal in certain circumstances, the vote shall go in a certain way. It was by a reference to that rule of the Constitution that those who favoured the retention of this word succeeded. Therefore they are entitled to the preference if we are to have any regard for the Constitution under which we work. The Vice-President of the Executive Council has entered once more into the argument on its merits, and I wish to reply to one or two remarks which he made. He said that this measure was one of vital importance. </para>

                        <para>-The honorable senator told us that probably these words were copied from some previous Act. I am quite sure they were, because the words &#34;seditious,&#34; &#34;blasphemous,&#34; &#34;obscene,&#34; and &#34; indecent &#34; are always used together as exhaustive of the offences which papers can commit. Why should we in this case depart from the ordinary rule, and adopt words which are not exhaustive ? It has been said that this will give the Postmaster-General a monstrous power, but by sub-clause (5) there is an appeal to a Judge. If there was no appeal there would be some force in the argument which has been used, because it might be said that sedition was a matter which could only be fairly ascertained by a judicial inquiry. We have the judicial inquiry provided for in this case, and the proprietors of newspapers will, therefore, not be dependent on any haphazard decision which a Postmaster-General may give. It has been said that this is a dangerous power because political opinions differ and Governments are always changing, but I am unable to see any connexion between politics and sedition. Sedition is creating disaffection or discontent by some unlawful means, entirely irrespective of whether a free-trade or a protectionist Government is in power. No one could put this view more strongly than did the Vice-President of the Executive Council when the measure was introduced. But it has pleased the Government in another House to entirely forget the Senate, and for certain political purposes to allow the elimination of this word. They wish to force upon us the conclusion they have come to on account of political exigencies, and they justify the course they have taken by the most flimsy arguments I have ever heard put forward by any person priding himself upon logical reasoning. </para>

                    <para>- I may be dull of comprehension, but I see a great deal of difference in the position the Senate is in now and that in which it was previously. Previously the penalty for what was interpreted as sedition by Heaven knows who - for no one can tell who the Postmaster-General or his deputy might be - was the removal of the publication from the register. The object of a newspaper being registered at all was that it might be carried at newspaper rates. Is there not a vast difference that, when a paper is removed from the register under the amendment we have carried here, yet it may be carried under this amendment at a higher postal rate ? That is where the difference comes in. I am not arguing in favour of any difference, but on the principle that it is an evil thing to put it into the power of any one or <inline font-style="italic">two</inline> individuals to determine what is or is not sedition. No one knows better than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harney</inline> that it is very nearly time that this combination, to which he has referred so repeatedly, should be done away with altogether. Not only the country to which the honorable and learned senator belongs, but the country also to which I belong, has had many martyrs to the term we are discussing to-night, and yet to-day they are considered to be patriots. I am getting a little light, however. I was getting it when this party reference was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harney.</inline> I know how Senators Harney and Clemons and myself fought for the exclusion of the clause dealing with Tattersall&#39;s sweeps. Is this a back-door attempt to destroy the Bill that is going against our inclinations in that direction? Is this the result of the fine weather and the win the public had on Cup Day at Flemington? I would like to ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sargood</inline> and other honorable senators who were so strenuous in their resistance to Tattersall&#39;s sweeps, and so economical in the direction of saving the postage of Victoria, whether they are going to be parties to destroy the Post and Telegraph Bill simply because it will prolong the evil they objected to before ? Is it for the purpose of defeating the intentions of the Government in that direction that there is such opposition to the Bill now ? If so, although I fought honestly and fairly on the former occasion, I am not going to take part in a fight of this description just now. Something was said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> in connexion with the consideration that should be given to majorities or minorities in the Senate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> never for a moment intended to thrown any reflection on the Constitution when he referred to the memorable fourteen who voted one way or the other. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harney</inline> would like to make it appear that the fourteen who, by the Constitution, got the advantage of the position, should receive more consideration. I do not deny that they should, so far as the Constitution would give it to them, but are the other fourteen not to be considered if their attendance in the Senate is more earnest, and more regular, than that of the fourteen who are so earnest in their advocacy of the Constitution when it suits them. I hope the question will be reasoned fairly, and that party considerations of all kinds will be kept out of the Senate. I hope we shall consider the question from the point of view of having the Post and Telegraph Bill passed as speedily as possible that the people of the Commonwealth may get the advantage of it. While the people of the Commonwealth have power by their laws to deal with those who are seditious or blasphemous or in any way violate the statutes, I do not think the importance attaches to this amendment that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harney</inline> would have us believe. I hope the amendment will be agreed to, and that the previous decision will be reversed. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Major GOULD</inline>(New South Wales). - The honorable senator who has last spoken is going upon the assumption that in connexion with this amendment a party issue is being raised. If anyone is responsible for an attempt of that kind, it is the Vice-President of the Executive Council, who took occasion a little time ago to state that the opposition to the Government proposal was not <inline font-style="italic">bond fide,</inline> and came from men who were strong party men. The honorable and learned senator alluded to me as being a strong party man. I admit that at once, but so is the honorable and learned senator. I deny, however, that the mere fact of a man being a party man is sufficient to induce him to destroy a Bill that will be of great benefit to the Commonwealth, and which every senator must know ought to be passed as early as possible. </para>

Then, we heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> speaking with great vigour in support of the proposition made by the Government. True, he admitted the fact that the Government introduced the Bill containing these words, and excused himself by saying that the Government were not infallible. If the clause had gone through without question or debate, he might have been in a position to say that the word was retained through pure inadvertence, but it was debated at very considerable length, and no one fought more strongly for it than did the representatives of the Government. Certain words in the clause were omitted here, with a view to insert them in another place, showing that they were considered most carefully at that time. In its original form the clause provided that - </para>

                <para>  The Deputy Postmaster-General of each State may refuse to transmit or deliver any publication containing seditious blasphemous indecent or obscene matter. </para>
                <para class="block">At that time the Government saw no necessity to make a strong stand against their own proposal. In the other House a change was made, and the Senate insisted on the retention of the word &#34; seditious.&#34; The Government had an opportunity of pointing out then all these objections ; but they only point them out now because they find that the other House insists on the omission of the word, and because they consider that the Senate is a subservient body, which is prepared to swallow its own words in order to pacify the other House. We have heard honorable senators talk about the necessity of the Senate being a strong House, and adhering to its opinions ; but we are asked gradually to whittle away our expressed opinions on different matters. On one very vital question the Senate backed down in a remarkable manner. In the Senate the representatives of the Government fought for one thing ; but in the other House their colleagues fought against it, and when the Bill was returned to us Ministers here swallowed everything they had previously said. These things show what the policy of the Government is with regard to the Senate. I do feel surprised at honorable senators taking up a position for no other reason than that the other House adopts a certain course. This is not a question in which party politics are involved. No honorable senator will recognise more readily than will the Postmaster-General that honorable senators on all sides did their best to mould the Bill and that they offered no obstruction. It is unreasonable for the representatives of the Government to ask the committee to &#34; jump Jim Crow &#34; again. </para>

                    <para>- I should have liked to hear from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> a more definite statement as to what he intends to do in order to repair the obvious inconsistency which must arise if we keep the word &#34; seditious &#34; in sub-clause (3), after having struck it out of sub-clause (1). If a division were taken to either retain or omit the word, and I found myself in a minority, I should certainly on the next occasion sit with the majority, because I am always prepared to accept loyally the decision of the majority. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> wants to upset the decision we came to on the last division, it would have been much more desirable if he had made that attempt at once, rather than seek to do something which is utterly inconsistent, and trust to a chance mood of the Senate to repair an inconsistency afterwards. Our desire ought to be to see that our legislation is fairly consistent with itself. It is obvious to every one that if we do what is proposed we shall bring on the Senate - I think deservedly - ridicule. We should not legislate in a way which is inconsistent with our self respect, and unworthy of the Senate. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> to reconsider his position. I do not like the method he is adopting. I understand that he is prepared to recommit the clause, but he might fail in his attempt, and the inconsistency would remain. I should rather that the fight, if necessary, were begun <inline font-style="italic">de novo.</inline> My only concern is that we should be consistent in our action. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable and learned senator has stated that the Ministry has seen fit to turn a somersault for political reasons. He undoubtedly made this a party question when he used those words. He meant that the Government had found it necessary in order to hold office to placate certain members in another place by accepting their amendment. If there is any party feeling in the matter at all, I imagine that it comes from those honorable senators who are anxious to see a change of Government. The Government have at their disposal a great many lucrative positions, and no doubt these honorable senators think that if they were in office they could fill those positions with a great deal more credit to the country, and probably profit to their friends. I appeal to impartial senators who are anxious to see the business of the country done, whether,, although they may object to the word, &#34;seditious&#34; being struck out, it is worth while to insist upon its retention on account of the danger which threatens the Bill. </para>

                    <para>- If I had been here when the last division was taken I should have voted with the Government, and practically reversed the vote I gave on a previous occasion, on the ground that I was never very strong in favour of the retention of the word &#34; seditious,&#34; but only thought that it might be advisable to give the Minister power to restrict the circulation of certain publications.. The other House agreed to our amendment in one respect, but it refused to go the whole way. We then asked the House to&#62; reconsider its decision, but it has decided that the word, if retained, would be injurious to the working of the Post-office, and might cause a great deal of friction-&#39; and a great deal of loss to newspaper proprietors and others. For these reasons it has not seen its way to accede to our request. There is no great principle involved; in the retention of the word. </para>

                        <para>- Owing to the broad meaning which might be placed* upon the word by different persons, according to their temper of mind at the time, it was thought advisable at this period, when we boast of freedom of speech, that it should not be retained. I do not think we should gain anything by continuing the struggle any longer. A time may come when we shall have to insist upon certain things in the interest and for the benefit of the States we represent. As this is not particularly a State matter,, and as it is essential in the interest of the Postal department that this Bill should become law, it would be extremely unwise to wreck the measure by insisting upon, the amendment. If we are. determined to be stubborn without any particular cause, another place will be inclined to be stubborn upon other questions ; and I  how can we justify our votes before the people by maintaining a sort of pigheadedness which has no reason to be urged in; favour of it? </para>

                <para class="block">Government upon this matter, I had not thoroughly considered the position in which the Bill stood. We have no standing orders of our own, and in consequence of the complicated and tedious procedure which has to be gone through if there is to be a conference, it will not be wise to reject the .amendment made by the House of Representatives. If there is a conference it will practically be a dumb conference. We shall have to appoint managers, and a committee to draw up reasons, and they will have to come away without being able to discuss the subject. Then another place may also move for a conference, which will also be a dumb conference ; and not until then can a free conference be held. The principle contained in the word &#34;seditious&#34; is an important one, but as a matter of practical results it is a small j&#62;oint, because the Postmaster-General never seems to be inclined to put such powers into operation. Is it worth our while, therefore, to embarrass the Government and run the risk of the loss of the Bill, by insisting upon the retention of the word &#34; seditious &#34; ? I shall feel inclined to vote on the ground of pure expediency, and to help the Government, which I think wo ought to do in a matter of this kind. I must say, however, that I have been greatly disappointed all through the discussion because when honorable senators have been determined, time after time, to retain the terms of legislation which in practice have been found to be desirable, there has been a strong inclination on the part of other honorable senators in the opposite direction. Personally I am absolutely in favour of the retention of the words, &#34;blasphemous, seditious, indecent, and libellous.&#34; So far from thinking that the time has come when we ought to have free speech, free songs, and free everything else of a blasphemous and indecent description, I think that we ought to go in the other direction. I know that newspapers are published which frequently contain matter that is positively seditious and blasphemous. These papers are sent through the post. What is more, there are novels lying on the drawing-room tables of some of our good people in Melbourne - and for the matter of that, in Hobart also - which seem to have been written with the one idea of being indecent, and really are indecent. </para>

I happened to buy <inline font-style="italic">Truth.</inline> I had not looked at it for many minutes, when I saw some doggerel rhymes about Lord Kitchener and the South African war. The proprietor of that journal, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Norton</inline> - a gentleman whom I do not know by sight - had inserted this doggerel under the initials of the Postmaster-General, &#34; J.G.D.&#34; These lines positively called Lord Kitchener a butcher, and stated that he was absolutely gloating over the position of the women and children who were dying of measles in the refugee camps. There is one line which alludes to the fact that this &#34; butcher,&#34; Lord Kitchener, is congratulating himself upon how well he appears to have succeeded1, in practically bringing about, wilfully and deliberately, the death of the people by measles. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable and learned senator had followed the course of the debate in another place he would have known the reason why the Government accepted the amendment there. Fortunately for Australia, there was a large majority of members with more liberal ideas than have hitherto prevailed in the Upper Houses of Australia. I sincerely hope that the motion of the Postmaster-General will be carried, and I again express my thanks to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> for having looked at this matter in a sensible light, although he had previously voted against the Government. </para>

The whole course of the debate ought to have prevented <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> from making a charge like that. It is that remark which has made me look with less regret on the fact that my esteemed free-trade colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Charleston,</inline> is going to support the Government. </para>

                    <para>- Do I understand that the members of the Government in the Senate are now anxious that we should reverse the decision we arrived at an hour or two ago? If so they cannot reckon on any support from me. I speak very plainly, and I am pained to have to speak in this way, because I was quite prepared, and have been during the 30 years I have been in public life, to give every Government honest support. But when the Senate arrives at an honest decision, the Government should adhere to it, and I strongly object to any attempt to get an advantage over a vote deliberately and fairly taken, especially when the Government are themselves the fathers of the very clause and of the very language we are now seeking to maintain. Politically speaking it is most reprehensible that the Government should turn its back upon itself in that way. </para>

We have already had a division, and I have no reason to assume that there would be any chance through the absence of two or three senators or the presence of two or three others to again jump Jim Crow, and reverse the last decision arrived at. I think we may recognise the victory the Government have gained in the last division, and make them a present so far as debate upon this amendment is concerned. We may, however, have another division to show that there are eleven or twelve men who are consistent, and who stick to their principles. </para>

We disagreed with seven important amendments of the other House, but in this one case it will not give way. It was purely from sentimental reasons that I objected to the amendment. I did not like to see the clause in the Bill, but I can see perfectly clearly that it will not do any harm. I understand that the other House insists upon the provision, because it is considered advisable that in- the case of those States which have legislated on the subject there should be no chance for any confusion as to the correct definition of the words, &#34;indecent or obscene matter.&#34; Whatever we may have said in regard to other amendments, no one can contend that there is anything vital in this amendment. </para>

I recognise that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> is assenting to the amendment on the ground that the other House considers it necessary, and in some of the other States I am told it has been held necessary to have an interpretation of what is indecent or obscene from the postal stand-point. </para>

                    <para>- It must be perfectly obvious why I raised the point of order. Under the circumstances of the division which took place to-day, it ought to be the desire of every honorable senator to get a decision about which no doubt can arise. It must be obvious that when snatch divisions have been taken to-night, doubt must arise as to whether the Senate was fairly represented or not. Certain honorable senators left the Chamber at the dinner hour without any knowledge of the matter which had once been voted upon being likely to come up again. If the Government desire to have Any reputation for what is fair and straight they will consent to take this reference to the committee to-morrow afternoon. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> whether he will consent to that course? </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Major GOULD</inline>(New South Wales). - It is all very well from the Government&#39;s point of view to say that they desire, for the purpose of expedition, to get rid of the matter to-night, but, if they do, it will lie open to honorable senators to cast this reflection upon them - that finding twelve to eleven voters, with the exception of pairs, they think that if notice of this proceeding had been given the decision they desire to see reversed would not be altered. Perhaps from the stand-point of the Government these tactics may be perfectly legitimate, but I ask whether it is a fair position to take up in regard to honorable senators? When notice appears on the business paper that certain work is to be taken in hand the Government cannot be expected to postpone its consideration to suit the convenience of honorable senators whose business does not permit them to be present. But when it is proposed to take up practically new work, to re-open a question which has been decided, without honorable senators having had previous notice it is treating them very unfairly. It may act well one day from the Government&#39;s point of view, but on another day it may act to their detriment because it will always be competent for any honorable senator, when the Government have obtained a victory, and their opponents find that certain of their supporters have gone away to quietly jump their claim and go back into committee, and by means of a snatch vote reverse a decision which had been given after due deliberation. I ask whether it would not be much more honest for the Government to say, &#34;We do not want to carry our views by means of a snatch division. We wish to get the good sense of the committee on the question. A decision was given this afternoon which we want you to reverse, therefore we ask you to come here to-morrow and to give your voice on the question.&#34; It is fair and reasonable, even where the division was so close, for the Government not to snatch a vote, but to give honorable senators every opportunity to state what they think is best and to accept the decision of the majority. It is only fair and reasonable that we should not go on with the matter at the present time. The Senate is asked deliberately to go behind its decision, and to say that it made a mistake in the afternoon. The Government know that a majority of honorable senators are not in favour of the course which is being taken, but because the standing order gives them an opportunity of taking a snatch division, they are going to do so. If the Government will agree to take a formal division on the question to-morrow I am satisfied that honorable senators will be content. Will they promise not to take a division until honorable senators have had an opportunity to attend to-morrow ? </para>

But the Government see that possibly tomorrow they will not only lose the opportunity of making the change they wish to make, but that the Senate may feel inclined to change what has been done to-night. That is not the way to get a deliberate expression of opinion. It is a double-edged sword which will be used against the Government. They may rest assured that when the opportunity serves it will be used against them. </para>

                <para>It may be party warfare, but it is distinctly unfair to those honorable senators who are absent, because they did not think there was a possibility of this question coming up for reconsideration to-night. The Government are determined, if possible, to go back upon what the Senate has done. Of course they will say that the opinion of a smaller number is much better than the opinion of a larger number. </para>

This afternoon the committee came to a. conclusion, but now an attempt is being; made to reverse the decision in the same sitting, and without the knowledge of those honorable senators who have given their votes, and have since been occupied with other matters which have caused their absence from the chamber. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> has correctly said that if this course is to be pursued, it will be a two-edged sword, which will undoubtedly be used at some time or other to the disadvantage of the Government. </para>

                        <para>- My honorable and learned friend is perfectly accurate, but this is no joking matter. Some time ago the committee arrived at a deliberate conclusion. At the instance of the other branch of the Legislature we were asked to reconsider our decision. We did so, and resolved that our decision should stand. Now, without notice, the Postmaster-General asks us to reverse that decision which we have twice affirmed. If the Government succeed in obtaining a reversal of the decision under these circumstances, it will be a most unfortunate and undesirable interference with the ordinary course of business as transacted by British Legislatures. If the South Australian Parliament ever acted under such a provision as this I regard it as a most dangerous one, as most undesirable, and as absolutely at variance with the practice of the House of Commons, and of all other Houses of Legislature throughout the wide dominions of Great Britain. </para>

It is not necessary to go into details, because we have already heard some honorable senators say that we ought to be bound by the first division that was taken. I am of the contrary opinion. That division was taken just before the dinner hour, and it is quite probable that some honorable senators came in and voted without having heard the discussion. We may claim that if the division had been taken after a fuller discussion, and when honorable senators knew clearly what issues were involved, the decision would have been different. As this is the only matter left between the two Chambers with regard to the Bill, I think that the Senate might very well give way upon the point. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think it is right to use such an expression, for the reason that on both these matters each House has had its own opinion, and I have no doubt that honorable senators and members of the House of Representatives hold those opinions still. But we recognise that in politics there is such a thing as compromise. Seeing that the Bill cannot pass until both Houses have come to an agreement upon it, we must recognise that in a case like this, where two Houses take up strongly antagonistic positions one or the other must give way. As I pointed out earlier in the afternoon the House of Representatives in connexion with this Bill have met us with great fairness, and have given way in many matters upon which members of that House held strong convictions. They gave way, not because they surrendered their own views in regard to those matters, but because they recognised that there must be a compromise, and that one House or the other must give way. They had seen before a disposition on the part of the Senate to meet them fairly, and they showed a similar disposition to meet the Senate. I am glad that some members of the Senate were present in the House of Representatives when this Bill was before that House, and they will remember that members of the House of Representatives were not asked &#34; to swallow their convictions&#34; or to &#34; jump Jim Crow &#34; - language of that kind was not used - but they were asked to remember that there was another branch of the legislature which was entitled to be considered. They did that fairly, and though amendment after amendment was brought forward upon which members of the House of Representatives had previously expressed strong opinions, they showed themselves willing to give way in order to meet the Senate. That being so it is right and proper that we should show an equal disposition to meet them. </para>

For my part, while adhering to my opinion as to the propriety of the Government consenting to an adjournment until to-morrow, I intend now to say nothing further but to allow a division to be taken forthwith. </para>

                    <para>- I wish to state very emphatically that we are  now asked to do a most extraordinary tiling. There are but 24 senators in the House at present, and they are being asked to reverse a decision that was come to by 28 senators, and they are asked to do so solely because the decision of the 2S senators was not satisfactory to the Government. I have not a great deal of experience of parliamentary work, but I hope I shall have no further experiences of this kind. </para>

                    <para>- I cannot allow the occasion to pass without saying a few valedictory words, because probably this is the last opportunity we shall have of discussing this Bill. The&#39; Postmaster-General has made a few meek and mild-mannered remarks with regard to the desirability of compromise, of smoothing things over with the other House, and of -soothing their feelings or soothing our own. That is not my attitude with regard to this, nor was it the attitude of prominent members of the Government on more than one occasion. I cannot help being reminded of what must be in the recollection of other honorable senators, that in connexion with this Bill we saw one of the most extraordinary exhibitions of the skilful acrobat, that we could ever have expected to see in connexion with any Bill <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> This is only consistent with what we have seen in connexion with this Bill from start to finish. We have seen what I have no hesitation in saying is a most disgraceful exhibition on the part of the Government. </para>

                        <para>- I presume that the ordinary method of obeying the ruling of the Chairman in such a case, is the method I am going to adopt of withdrawing the words. They would have been withdrawn earlier if the honorable and learned senator had allowed me to go on. I am surprised to hear the Vice-President of the Executive Council express himself as not being super-sensitive, because I do not think the Senate needed any such expression from the honorable and learned senator. He may not have been guilty of disgraceful conduct iri connexion with this Bill, but he will not deny that he has given us throughout the conduct of this Bill through the Chamber a marvellous exhibition of somersaults. The honorable and learned senator is one of the most skilful acrobats I have seen. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable senators present heard sufficient of the debate, and if the decision is adjourned until to-morrow we shall have a full House, and there will be a larger majority against the Government proposals. Surely the Government is not going to start the Commonwealth with a reputation for getting the Senate to change its votes every two or three hours ? After the division taken at half-past 6 o&#39;clock I left the Senate with the deliberate intention of not returning, because I was engaged elsewhere. I had no conception that a vote taken at half-post 6 o&#39;clock would be reversed again at half-past 10 o&#39;clock by a smaller number of senators. That is unheard-of, and it is not commendable. The public will not like it. The public like honest votes to be taken, and decisions come to without any snatch victory. It will not redound to the credit of any party, whether Opposition or Government supporters, to maintain their position in that way. I hope that even now the Government will see it to be their high duty to postpone this question till to-morrow. If they can then secure a majority, I shall not ask them to reverse that vote, and I shall even support them in such a case if a snatch vote is attempted to be secured against them. As we have already arrived at an honest decision on the question, it is utterly unconstitutional and unusual to force this question to another division at this late hour. </para>

                    <para>- I wish to know whether I have not understood <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons.</inline> When the Postmaster-General proposed the second deletion of the word &#34; seditious,&#34; Senator Clemons invited an expression of opinion from the Vice-President of the Executive Council as to what the Government proposed to do in order to make the Bill consistent. I think the honorable and learned senator said that if the Government succeeded in getting a majority in connexion with the latter amendments, he would assist them in making the Bill consistent. In that case, I should say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> now proposes to vote with the Government. </para>

                        <para>- By way of personal explanation, I wish to say that I shall certainly adhere to my expressed intention to obtain consistency. The largest division we have had during all the divisions that have taken place upon these amendments was that in which the side on which I sit was represented by fourteen. So far, in all these later divisions, the Government have not been supported by fourteen senators. </para>

                        <para>- With <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons,</inline> I was doubtful as to whether the taking of this Bill, as proposed by the Government on Wednesday next, would not be contingent upon certain progress being made with the Public . Service Bill. I understand now that no matter what progress is made with the Public Service Bill, the Immigration Restriction Bill will be dealt with on Wednesday next. Honorable senators, seeing the position which the Immigration Restriction Bill has occupied on the business paper on several occasions, have theught it was the intention of the Government to go on with that Bill before the Public Service BUI, more especially in view of the fact that it had been represented that it was a measure of very great importance, which they were determined to push on with as speedily as possible. I think that most honorable senators would have been prepared to go on with the Bill to-morrow, if the Government had been ready to proceed. At any rate, I hope that the order of the day is being postponed till Wednesday next with the intention of proceeding with the second reading. </para>
