                    <para>. - 1 am prepared, if it is in accordance with the wishes of the committee, to postpone this clause until after the consideration of the remainder of the Bill, hut I would like first to make a short statement with regard to some difficulty which appeared at the previous sitting. I propose to make an amendment in clause 78 which I think will meet to a very great extent the objections taken by some honorable senators. That clause gives power to the Postmaster-General with regard to the construction and maintenance of any telegraph line. I have not with me the exact words of the amendment; but I propose after the words "by such person" in the first paragraph to insert the words " either for the Telegraph department or for any private person," or words to that effect. So that clause 77 will place telegraph lines, including, of course, telephone lines, under the Telegraph department, making it practically a monopoly ; while clause 78 will provide that the Postmaster-General may exercise that monopoly on behalf of the department or allow private persons to construct or maintain telegraph or telephone lines. </para>

                        <para>- I think it is absolutely necessary that the telegraph lines should be in the hands of the department. I cannot draw back from that at all. We must start from that point, that the telegraph service is to be a State monopoly, and if that is conceded, then we can give the fullest possible range to private persons who desire to have telegraphic or telephonic communication on their private property. That is what has been done in all the States. </para>

                    <para>- I am not surprised to hear that the Postmaster-General has been advised by departmental officers to take up such a stand ; but I am surprised to hear him say that he is of opinion that that should be the rule. Instead of postponing the clause at once it may be as well to discuss it a little so that he may not come down with a hard and fast amendment from which he will not be prepared to budge. We must all, of course, absolutely agree upon his statement that the telegraph and telephone lines should be in the hands of the department so far as they will, be public lines. But clause 77 practically gives the Minister command -over all private lines as well, and all that is proposed, as I understand from the amendment in clause 78, is that he may make arrangements with private parties to construct and maintain private lines. In the past the action of the department has been absolutely adverse to private lines. Surety it cannot be contended for a moment that it should be necessary ' to go to the Postmaster-General to have a telephone line put up in one's own warehouse. Clauses 77 and 78, if passed in their present form, would necessitate any one of us who required a telephone line to be put in his warehouse, or from his office to part of his warehouse, to get it done <inline font-style="italic">hy</inline> the Minister. That appears to me to be perfectly absurd. It is an interference on the part of the department which is not justified on any grounds whatever. Then I extend that to what is of equal importance, and in some respects of greater importance - the construction of telephone lines on stations where the question of fire comes in. I need hardly say that it is not to the interest of the general public that men should be denied an opportunity to cope with fires instantly. That is the reason why, for some years past, a large number of squatters in all  the States have  been gradually extending the telephone system on their runs, and in many cases on their own wire fences, although that is not a success. In doing so, it is necessary for a person to cross over or under a road which goes through his land, and here comes in the difficulty. The department at once say " We will not allow you to cross that road," or they make so many difficulties and demand such an excessive charge that the idea has to be given up absolutely. I am speaking of that which I not only know, but have experienced, and which I have no doubt other honorable senators have experienced. The amendment I propose is that the department shall not interfere in the slightest degree with the construction of private telephones, wherever they may be, and where the land is owned by the same party on both sides of the road it shall give freedom and liberty, perhaps on the payment of a small fee if necessary, to cross that road at a height of not less than eighteen feet, as provided in a subsequent clause. What harm can  possibly  arise from such a concession, and what necessity is there to place such a power as this in the hands of the department? I shall repeat my own experience of departmental action. My son has a station about eighteen miles from Hamilton, in the Western district. Four of the station-holders wished to extend the telephone system from Hamilton to their respective stations. One of them was authorized to make inquiries. He found that the line would be constructed by the department from Hamilton for eighteen miles to fi branch-off place, and from that place each of the four station-holders would take his line. The first man was told that he could get that constructed at a rental of £1 per mile for the eighteen miles and a payment of the cost of its erection on his own property. Then he said, " But there are four of us, and the cost will be divided between the four." The reply was, " No, not at all ; each of the four will have to pay this £1 per mile from Hamilton." That was simply nonsense. For the Postmaster-General to say that the department would not only raise no difficulty, but would assist all it could to develop private lines is not borne out by facts. Practically what I have complained of in Victoria has happened in New South Wales in connexion with a station in which I am interested. In the interests of the public at large it is not desirable that the Postmaster-General should have the control of these private wires. </para>

                        <para>- The department should have control over wires outside the boundaries of the property owners ; but when a wire crosses a block of lond, which may be 20,000 acres in extent, and which is owned by one individual, not the slightest difficulty should be raised in regard to the crossing of roads, many of which are never used at all, whilst others are very seldom used on account of the sparsity of the population. If it be necessary that the Commonwealth should retain in its own hands some rights over those roads, that can be met by the payment of a small fee '. for every road crossed. But that the construction, maintenance, and control of these wires within a private domain or within a warehouse in Sydney or Melbourne or elsewhere should remain in the . hands of the post-office is an exhibition of red-tapism for which I should not have given the Postmaster-General credit. </para>

                    <para>- I entirely agree with the Postmaster-General that the control of telegraphs and telephones must remain with the central Government. The only question is how the Government are going to exercise their authority, and avoid the mischief which has been pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Frederick</inline> Sargood. If they are going to use their authority to prevent the development of territories that are not at present very much developed, and that require the assistance of telephones and telegraphs quite apart from the rest of Australia, the effect will be very prejudicial. I quite concur that the sanction for the construction of telegraphs and telephones must ultimately rest with the Government ; but it would be a great mischief if in South Australia, which requires a great amount of development, in Queensland and West Australia, which also require a great amount of development, as well as in New South Wales, which probably has not yet reached a stage of absolute perfection, the Commonwealth Government interfered with the State doing what is necessary for internal development. Whilst the ultimate veto, if I may so express it, must rest with the Commonwealth Government, it will be well if in this measure we provide that individual owners may construct telephones on their own property. There may have been a road cut through a property for the convenience of others. In that case the property owner should be enabled to construct a telegraph or telephone line over the road. In addition to that, States should be enabled to construct wires which although they could not be expected to pay except in connexion with the development of the country, would in the long run be profitable. The Commonwealth Government might where it thought it necessary have power to veto any particular proposal. Such a veto would be a Ministerial act, subject to the consideration of both Houses of Parliament. I only mention this matter for the consideration of the Postmaster-General. I would ask him not to be too anxious to consider the convenience of the Post and Telegraph department. He should extend the ambit a little, and if this proposal does cause the department inconvenience that should not stand in the way, so long as what is done is for the convenience of the general public of the Commonwealth, which is superior to the convenience of any particular official. </para>

                    <para>- I think my honorable and learned friend has been a little hard on the Government and the Postmaster-General. It is for no reason connected with the convenience of the post-office, or of any official, that this position has been taken up, but because the post-office represents the people of the Commonwealth, and it has been decided that they shall hold this monopoly in their hands for the benefit of the Commonwealth. It is not a question of considering any individual or official. The interests of the Commonwealth alone have to to be considered. </para>

It seems to me that we must trust the Postmaster-General to deal reasonably with persons who require these conveniences. If a road has to be crossed, let each case be dealt with on its own merits. It may be that the road is a mere road on paper, in which case probably no difficulty would arise as to a line crossing it. On the other hand it may be a road under the control of a municipality, in which case care must be taken that no rights are given to a private individual which will interfere with the use of the road for the general purposes pf the telegraphic system. If the Postmaster-General has authority to grant this leave on such conditions as he thinks fit he must be trusted to make reasonable arrangements. In a case where it did not matter whether roads are crossed or not, probably there would be very little restriction; but in a case where the crossing of a road by a wire might be a matter of importance, care would be taken to preserve the public interest. If a power is given which will enable a person owning property to construct a Une on that property if he thinks fit-- </para>

This part of the Bill is to be postponed, and in the meantime an amendment will be drafted, which I hope will satisfy the desire expressed by many honorable senators. As to the point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir John</inline> Downer, the matter is exceedingly important, and I do not think we should be asked to express an opinion without further consideration. I can quite understand there being circumstance:; under which it might be advisable to give power to a State to erect telegraph or telephone lines on certain conditions within the control of the department itself. But on the other hand' one can see that such a power might he abused. Care must therefore be taken to safeguard it.

I made an interjection, during the speech of the Vice-President of the Executive Council, to the effect that in New South Wales owners of property are allowed to exercise the privilege or right of erecting telegraph or telephone lines on their own properties and for their own purposes only. If the clause in question is passed either as it stands in the Bill or with the amendment proposed by the Postmaster-General, the effect will be to immediately enable the postal authorities to come in and erect expensive lines for carrying on work which is being satisfactorily carried on at a minimum cost to them. The Postmaster-General might either himself erect wires, or might compel owners to enter into a contract with him. The clause as it stands says that the Post.master-General may enter into a contract with any other person. </para>

                        <para>- It has not been done: In hundreds of cases they are working on their own fences or on lines which answer their purpose, although such lines might not meet with the approval of the Postal department. They are doing so without any reference to the department. There is a difference in affirming that the management in these matters should rest in the hands of the State and in giving the Government right to interfere where a line crosses a road. I submit that it is quite sufficient for the purposes of public safety in the case of a line on private property that the Postmaster-General should have authority to supervise that portion of it which happens to cross a road. As long as he has ample authority to see that the means for carrying the line across or under the road are sufficient for the purposes of public safety, that is all that is necessary. </para>

                <para class="block">There is an impression abroad that the Public Service Bill deals with this question, but I find that junior messengers are specially exempted from the provisions of that measure. Under clause 28, which deals with the age of new appointees, it is provided that nothing contained in that section shall be taken to prevent the appointment of boys of any age as message boys or junior messengers. Honorable senators must have noticed that in this State, at all events, boys who are considerably less than thirteen years of age are working in the post-office. I think we ought to resolutely set our faces against the employment of child labour in any part of the federal service. Thirteen years should be the minimum age. This amendment will allow the age to be determined by regulation, and the regulation will of course have to come before the House. </para>

                    <para>- If this matter is not dealt with by the Public Service Bill I think it should be. It is clearly a question which1 comes within the scope of that measure, and certainly it should be dealt with by the commissioner or the chief officer, as he may be called. I do not think it would be advisable to put it in this clause. There is a great deal of difficulty surrounding it, because it would be necessary to have a different regulation in each State. It depends to a very great extent on what is the school age in each of the States. If we are going to take young boys into the service as messengers, we should take them as soon as they are fit for the work and as soon as they have passed the school age. I would not be a party to doing anything which would take a boy away from school during the time that he should be there according to the law of the State. I would do all I possibly could, however, to insure that as soon as he was done with his schooling he should be employed. </para>

                    seems desirous of enlarging them very seriously. I would suggest to the honorable senator that, he might very well allow his amendment to stand over and try to deal with it when the Public Service Bill comes before us. It is undesirable in my opinion that we should give the Postmaster-General, whoever he may be, power to decide as to the age at which any person shall be employed in the service.

                    <para>- I entirely agree with the suggestion that this amendment deals with a matter which is part and parcel of the Public Service Bill. I would point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> that the words he has used here go a good deal further than he intends, and may conflict with clause 1 which we have already passed. The amendment refers to the age at which persons shall be employed. I suppose what the honorable senator means is that regulations should be made fixing the minimum age at which persons shall be employed. It would be wise for the honorable senator not to press his motion. He should deal with it when the Public Service Bill is before us, and then I shall be prepared to support him. </para>

                    <para>- It will be found that in clauses 64 and 66 vessels are required to ' deliver and take delivery of mails at the wharf nearest to the post-office. Under this paragraph, however, the Minister has sole power to fix rates for carrying such mails. I would suggest to the Postmaster-General that it would be better to have a schedule of rates for carriage of mail matter, the department taking delivery from and giving delivery to a vessel wherever she may be lying. Under this law the department could deliver mails anywhere. That would be very inconvenient. The suggestion I have made comes from the Chamber of Commerce. </para>

We provide in a previous clause that where the Postmaster-General cannot agree with the railway authorities the matter shall be determined by arbitration. This clause, however, definitely gives the Postmaster-General the power to fix rates and to make the carriers accept any rates he may fix. </para>

                        <para>- I really do not think we want this provision. It must be a matter of private bargain and the rates must differ in every case. The Postmaster-General cannot fix rates arbitrarily as far as they relate to private railways and vessels. If he cannot do it arbitrarily, and if the carriers have the right of arbitration and will not accept the rates we are willing to give, what is the use of this paragraph ? I do not think we want this power. This proposal appears to me to be useless, because unless they are willing to accept the rates the power will never be acted upon. </para>

                        <para>- We have already decided that ships must carry the mails at prescribed rates, and this provision gives the power to fix those rates. With regard to State or private railways, we have passed a clause providing that mails must be carried by private arrangement if possible, as to the amount to be paid, and if not the amount to be paid must be fixed by arbitration. We must have the power in that case by regulation to fix the rates we will offer in the first place. We will have a regulation stating what we are prepared to pay for the carriage of mails by railway, and if the State concerned is not prepared to carry the mails at that rate then the matter is to be referred to arbitration. But I think we should have the power, in the first place, to prescribe a uniform rate for the Commonwealth. </para>

                    Ships may have to carry mails, and we cannot enforce a uniform rate that will be fair to all. Under the circumstances, I think we had better strike out this provision altogether. . In both cases we shall have to make a definite offer to people, which they can accept or reject, as they think fit; but if we fix the rates payable to masters of vessels, the Postmaster-General may deliberately say to those people that they must accept the rates offered. If these rates, fixed as proposed, are to be subject to arbitration subsequently, we ought to say so definitely in the clause, but if they are to be fixed rates, then they will be the only rates which the Postmaster-General will agree to pay.

                    <para>- This is, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> has said, a very arbitrary power. Of course the difficulty is that it is meant to apply to accidental or emergency cases, and it is impossible in such cases to say how the rates to be paid can be fixed by regulation, which is for all time, unless revoked in a formal manner. All contracts are of course expressly excepted. A difficulty is that we have passed clause 67, which obliges any vessel to cany a mail upon payment therefor of such rates as may be prescribed, and in order to meet that clause and make it workable it is necessary to prescribe some rates. </para>

                        <para>- No, only the portion applicable. The Postmaster-General would then be in the position of being able to insist upon mails being carried, of course, paying a fair rate according to the particular circumstances. If, for instance, a vessel was going to some of the islands, it would be impossible by regulation to have fixed rates applicable to a case of that kind, and also applicable to the case of a vessel going, say, to Java. We have no contract for the carriage of mails to Java, or to some of the other islands, and if we laid down one hard-and-fast rule, we would find it impossible to apply it under different circumstances. Another point to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> has drawn attention is that arising under clauses 1 6 and 17. In the matter of the carriage of mails on railways, provision is made for justice being done by a reference to arbitration. A ship carrying mails in a case of emergency would be placed in a far worse position than the mail contractor .or the authorities of a State railway obliged to carry mails under clause 16, who would have an opportunity of having the rates fairly adjusted in the event of a difference with the Postmaster-General. The real difficulty in this matter arises because the provision is applicable to cases of emergency, and although this provision may be adopted, it will be found to be quite unworkable through the impossibility of framing rates applicable to all. cases. . </para>

                        <para>- I am only showing the difference, in my opinion, between the powers conferred on the Postmaster-General by clause 15, and by clause 91. Under clause 15 the Postmaster-General may enter into arrangements with shipping companies, trading vessels between centres of population, frequently and regularly; and in the same way he may make arrangements with railway authorities carrying mails between large centres of population. But the part of clause 91, which we are now discussing, deals with a different set of circumstances. Take, for instance, the case of vessels going from </para>

                <para class="block">Queensland to the islands of the Pacific. How can we lay down any hard-and-fast rule that the Postmaster-General shall pay so-and-so according to any provision to be found under clause 15 with regard to vessels trading from the different ports of Queensland. I think it is necessary that the Postmaster-General should have the power to say that such vessels shall carry . mails. I believe that the quantity of letters, newspapers, packets, and other correspondence likely to be carried, will be so trivial that it is not worth while contending very much upon the hardship likely to be inflicted on owners in being obliged to carry mails. I have had some little experience in this matter, and I know the mails going from the town I have represented for some years, have never been very heavy, and masters or owners of vessels trading from our ports to the Polynesian Islands are not likely to haggle with the Postmaster-General with regard to the price to be paid for the carriage of such mails. The Postmaster-General must have a definite power for the public convenience to say that vessels trading in that way must be compelled to carry mails. </para>

                    <para>- I agree with other senators that this paragraph should be struck out. At the same time, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> is not quite right in saying that clauses 16 and 17 are not applicable. As they stand, they would not be ; but there has been an amendment made in clause 1 7 making it applicable to private railways, and this paragraph therefore does apply in the case of that clause. Assuming that it does apply we are in this position. We have a clause in one part of the Bill providing that both railway and shipping proprietors may carry mails; and while we have also a provision that the Postmaster-General may enter into contracts with them as regards the price, yet we have a clause here which says that a regulation shall be made fixing the rates. If a regulation is made fixing the rates in pursuance of this clause the rates so fixed are to have the force of law. We have therefore one part of the Bill providing arbitrarily, with the force of law, the fixing of the rates, while we have another clause in the same Bill saying that the rates shall be fixed by contract. </para>

                        <para>- It says the regulation shall fix the rates. It is not a regulation for the purpose of determining how the rates shall be fixed, but a regulation fixing the rates. It has been said, and I daresay it is true, that this sub-clause is aimed at a set of circumstances entirely different from those contemplated in the clauses to which I have referred. Those clauses have to do with permanent contracts for the regular carriage of mails, while this clause has to do with isolated cases where no permanent contract could have been or has been entered into. That may have been in the mind of the draftsman, but it. does not alter the difficulty pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford.</inline></para>

                        <para>- In any way it does not remove the difficulty pointed out by me, for this reason, that when a clause says that contracts may be made, it implies, if we are going to have mails carried in any of these exceptional cases, we must have the rate fixed by contract, and if we have a regulation fixing them anterior to the possibility of any contract, then either the contractual section must go or this section must go. So I think that if we are to give effect to the preceding clause we should strike out this sub-clause. I move - </para>

                        <para>- I think it is necessary, because every power should be given. If we said, "by arrangement with the owners, or by arrangement with the parties concerned," it would give the Postmaster-General the power to compel the carriage of mails. He should make such arrangements as he could with them, and really he would be fixing the rates with their consent, and the clauses dealing with arbitration, where it was impossible for him to fix the rates, could be applied in this instance as well as any other. </para>

                    <para>- . <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> has suggested that when we undertake to strike out a portion of a clause we should be prepared to build up. That is perfectly true, no doubt, if building up is necessary. But surely we have defined the position of the Postmaster-General in a previous clause. We have said that when he is dealing with the owners of vessels, or railways, or tramways, he is to enter into contracts for the carriage of mails. The rates that are to be charged are to be the outcome of a mutual agreement, and failing that mutual agreement, arbitration. Therefore, independent of this clause, we have a method of ascertaining the amount to be paid to persons for the carriage of mails. </para>

If this provision is passed, the fixing and the gazetting of the rates give them the force of law, and, therefore, anybody who carries mails has to carry them at those rates. The Minister has given his regulations the force of law, and the moment he forms and gazettes a regulation as to the rate to be charged, it becomes the law just as effectually as if it were now put in this Bill. Then in a previous clause we say that he has to contract with the owners, and, failing a contract, he has to go to arbitration and get to a satisfactory solution. </para>

                        <para>- I think that for the carriage of mails by land or sea the Minister has to enter into a contract, and he proposes, if it is not already in, to add some words' with regard to arbitration. The clause to which I refer was postponed in order to allow of an addition dealing with arbitration in the event of disagreement, the same as applies to a disagreement between the Minister and the railway authority. There are two clauses providing that the method of payment and the rate of payment shall be the outcome of an agreement, and, failing an agreement, of arbitration. And yet here we are going to fix rates which will have the force of law, and which will really have the effect of overloading the provisions of the clause we have passed. We must define our position. Surely either we are going to treat the owners of these railways, including State railways, and the owners of steam-ships in an arbitrary manner, and say "You shall carry for the rates which we say are reasonable," or we must treat them as contracts. Which are we going to do? We have already decided to treat them as contracts, and if we pass this clause giving the Postmaster-General the power to make regulations, we shall absolutely rob the previous clauses of the whole of their effect, and make him the person who is to decide the rates at which this work shall be done. </para>

                    <para>- There is a misapprehension in the minds of some honorable senators with regard to the effect of clause 15. It will not meet the case which these regulations are contemplated to deal with, because it contemplates a contract being entered into, and with the contract there must be a mutual agreement by the two parties. But we take power beyond that to compel the master of any vessel to carry mails. There is a provision in clause 66 that the master of any ship is to carry mails if it becomes necessary for postal purposes. This would simply be in isolated cases where it would not suit the </para>

                <para class="block">Postmaster-General to enter into a regular contract with the owners of ships for the purpose of carrying mails. And having determined that where a casual or an occasional mail is to be carried by the master of a ship there must be some provision made for fixing rates. It should be borne in mind that it is not a contract between the Minister and the master of a ship. It is something which the law says the master of a ship shall do, but, the Postmaster-General, in order to deal fairly and honestly with him is prepared to pay him some reasonable sum for carrying the mails, and therefore the regulation comes in enabling him to fix the rates to be paid. But, supposing for the sake of argument, we do not pass this clause but say that it shall be a matter of contract. He says to the master of the ship - " I want you to carry this mail to the islands " ; the master says - " I want £100 for the service" ; the Minister says - " <inline font-style="italic">£5</inline> is ample remuneration": the master replies - "I shall not carry the mail unless you pay me £100." Where is the Minister then? He says he can make the master carry the mails, but the master can make him pay whatever demand he sees fit to make for the carriage of them. Therefore, we want to bring this particular case within the regulation enabling the Postmaster-General to fix a reasonable rate which will be paid to those who are compelled to carry a mail. If we shall have some absolute power like this, we shall place the Minister in the hands of master of a ship, and, practically, our legislation will be nugatory, if that man sees fit to make it so by demanding an excessive amount to be paid. Are we going then to turn round and say - "We shall allow you to try and make a contract, and if you cannot, you must go to arbitration and settle the whole thing." We do not want to break a butterfly upon a wheel. We want to deal with a thing like this in a reasonable manner. Where it is confined to matters of this character, it is reasonable to leave the ultimate power in the hands of the Minister. If he chooses to abuse the power, there is the Parliament to bring him to book. If it is found that he is consistently acting unjustly and unfairly towards the masters of ships, the Parliament will protect them. Surely it will not allow the masters to be ridden over, rough-shod, but it expects them to do a reasonable thing when it is necessary in the interests of the State that they should be compelled to carry mails. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to supplement the arguments of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> by looking at the matter from another point of view. I have been twitted once or twice during this discussion with trying to act as a despot, and wanting to get additional powers, and so on. Is the Senate prepared to let the Postmaster-General pay anything he thinks fit to the masters of vessels, because if we do not make a provision that the rate to be paid is to be fixed by regulation then it must be fixed by the Minister, and he can pay a master anything he likes ? Is that what the Senate desires ? </para>

I think it is necessary to <inline font-style="italic">he</inline> able to fix a rate by regulation for tramway authorities. I am perfectly prepared to strike out the words "and private railway," for the simple reason that we have amended clause 16 in such a way as to provide that in the case of a private railway we are to enter into a contract with the owners, and if we cannot come to an amicable arrange ment, the matter of remuneration is to be fixed by arbitration.

That would leave the Minister all the power, and it would not fix anything. Clause 67 gives power to prescribe rates, and this provision would enable him to make the necessary regulations. If we omit the words " private railway," it would come to the same thing, because the. matter is open with reference to ships.

                    SYMON (South Australia). - We vest in the Minister compulsory power to enjoin that all casual mails shall be carried, and if some rates are not fixed by regulation it is undoubtedly as he may determine at the time ; otherwise the unfortunate ship-owner will get nothing. I was going to suggest, to make it still clearer and to avoid the difficulty with regard to mails under contract, that we should insert some such words as "for the occasional or casual carriage of mails." It has been suggested that there should be some provision added to clause 15 with regard to arbitrations in connexion with contracts. It is obvious that that would never do. Clause 15 deals with the powers of the Postmaster-General to enter into contracts, and to provide that he could not fix a rate by contract if the other party disagreed without entering into an . arbitration would be a new way of making a bargain. Clause 91 deals with a different matter altogether. It relates to what may be called the emergency carriage of mails - that is, with cases where there is no contract entered into. An amendment such as I have suggested would differentiate quite clearly as to the inapplicability of this to contracts, and show what was meant, namely, that this was a power vested in the Postmaster-General, by means of which he would be able to put a mail on board a ship which was going to an island at an odd or. occasional time, and would enable him to fix a rate of payment per pound of mail matter.

He might insert the words "Fixing the rates payable under sections 66 and 67." Those clauses contemplate extraordinary as distinct from regular contracts. It should be made clear that this power does not apply to those cases where contracts are going to be entered into.

                        <para>- The Postmaster-General has power to compel the carriage of mails in certain cases! Masters of vessels must carry them whether there is a contract or not. It is desirable to have power to fix regulations for the carriage of such mails. If, for instance, a contract is made with a large shipping company for the regular carriage of mails this provision does not. apply ; but where no contract has been made, in the case of what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Josiah</inline> Symon has called an occasional mail, the amount to be paid is fixed by regulation. </para>

Thereby the previous clause would be overridden.

In the United States of America mail contracts are not made, but the Postmaster-General takes advantage of any vessel that is going to any port, and puts the mails on board that vessel, which carries them at a fixed rate. I think the charge is so much per letter. I anticipate that in a few years' time the Postmaster-General of Australia will be in a position to make some such arrangement as that.

I wish to ask the Postmaster-General whether he proposes to omit the third one, which provides for regulations in regard to the maximum rates and fees to be charged for the transmission, delivery, return, insurance, or registration of parcels.

                    <para>- I do not propose to omit the third part of paragraph (c). It is very necessary to have power to fix the maximum weight of parcels. It is not worth while putting such a matter in an Act of Parliament. If we fix those details by statute we can only alter or amend them by statute. I have already. admitted that the matter of postage rates for letters is important, but this paragraph only concerns the transmission of parcels, which is a comparatively unimportant matter as compared with the transmission of letters. </para>

                        <para>- It seems to me that honorable senators, for the sake of altering the verbiage of the Bill, are making changes which will lead to the Postmaster-General finding himself in a nice fix by-and-by. No doubt this provision has been properly considered by the department, and has been drafted by competent legal authorities. Some of the amendments may have a very prejudicial effect. I do not think the Postmaster-General should allow these alterations to be made unless he is fully satisfied that there is no objection to them. </para>

In Queensland lines have been erected by the Government for private individuals who pay for them, and an arrangement has been made that if the general public wish to use those lines a charge may be imposed.

                        <para>- A nominal charge might be made in order to preserve the right of the State, but certainly no charge would be imposed for conversations over a telephone line on private property. This provision relates to a line which has been constructed for a private person, who pays for it, and which is used by the general public. </para>

                    <para>- I think there has been a misunderstanding as to what the term "private telephone" means. It appears to me that we shall not have much difficulty in arriving at a solution of this and the previous question. If the Postmaster-General means that it is necessary for the State to have some supervision over private telephones connected with main trunk lines, that is all right; but if he means that a charge is to be made for a private telephone on the property of the person who uses it, then I think such power should not be given. </para>

                    ZEAL (Victoria). - This provision has been framed as the result of practical experience. Let us consider a case in which it would be necessary. Suppose, for example, a man had a very large estate, and wished to establish telephonic communication between the homestead and the railway station, it might be necessary for such a line to cross three or four public roads, and to pass close to a township. If this clause were eliminated and the Government had no power over private telephones the department might be confronted with opposition from that private telephone line. The owner would be able to collect fees and the department would suffer. Where a man has a telephone on his own property, and it crosses no road whatever, this clause would not apply. It is .simply framed to protect the department against the designs of unscrupulous men. If the committee is not careful in making these alterations, the department will be faced with great difficulties and the Bill will be practically unworkable.

For instance, a tramway company might be allowed to construct a line along its tramway, and the department might see fit, under this Bill, to impose a condition that the public should be allowed to use it on payment of certain charges.

                    <para>- I happen to be connected with several telephone lines, and amongst others with one at Barringgun, on the border of Queensland and on the Warrago. We have gone to great expense in building that line, a distance of 25 miles. Of course we facilitate business going to the office. We do not object to that. We send innumerable telegrams which would not otherwise be sent. We save the shareholders money,and God knows they want it ! I would support the Government in every way by protecting and increasing the revenue, but in the case of a telephone which is entirely a private affair, a line merely from one portion to another portion of the same holding, and having no connexion whatever with the Telegraph department, I should expect that we should not be handicapped by any Government. </para>

There is no traffic whatever upon them, and no possible danger can arise from the existence of that line. Notwithstanding that I am willing that the department shall make provision that where a line crosses roads every protection shall be given. I only wish to say that the Government ought to facilitate that kind of work. These telephones are increasing rapidly and, as they save an immense amount of labour and difficulty of management they ought to be encouraged. The trouble is that the department, if they think fit, can under this clause handicap these people. I am sure that with the present Government and the present Minister there would be no difficulty, but we do not know who may come after them, and it will be just as well to put it out of the power of any factious Minister to interfere with these private telephone lines, when they do not in the least degree retard the development of the Postal department. - , <inline font-weight="bold">Senator HARNEY</inline> (Western Australia). - I move - </para>

As it is the paragraph gives absolute power to make regulations interfering with the use of a private telephone line, which may have absolutely no connexion whatever with State lines. I think, therefore, it would be better to add to the paragraph the qualification of a private telephone line which I have suggested - one over which the Postmaster-General is authorized by this Act to exercise control. </para>

                    <para>- Before we leave this clause, or pass it with the hope of some alteration being made in the future, it would be well for the Postmaster-General and other senators to consider what the position is likely to be in the future. I am very glad for the first time to-day to have seen our good old friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> wake up in connexion with the subject of private lines passing over roads, which has however very little to do with this question. There are in Australia very large tracts of country held for pastoral purposes, and in the future telegraph and telephone lines may be constructed over those freehold or leasehold properties. I want senators always to remember that telegraphic and telephonic communication over this territory, whether freehold or leasehold, is to be entirely under the control of the Postmaster-General, and even where a line does not go outside of a particular estate, it should be erected only by permission of the Postmaster-General. </para>

                        <para>- Then if that is admitted, and they should not have the power to erect those lines without the permission of the. Postmaster-General, what should be the result? We go away back into this country <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer</inline> indicated, and take the case of a telegraph or telephone line erected by private individuals. It should be only by permission from the Postmaster-General, and he should also be in a position to say under what conditions it may be used by the public. Some poor old swagman might come along and want to send a telegram to a mate for the purpose of getting some assistance, and the owner of one of these lines, without some such provision, may refuse altogether to allow the use of the telephone or telegraph line, or may charge such an exorbitant price that it would be impossible for the swagman to use it. I say,. therefore, that in framing a regulation where the sanction of the Postmaster-General is admittedly necessary for the erection of a line, he should be placed in the position to say that the person erecting it must allow the public to make use of the line on payment of a certain charge. So far as the private individual owning the line is concerned, he should not of course have to pay for sending his own messages over the line he has constructed, within his own property. The amendment proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ewing</inline> would so limit the matter that the rate prescribed by this regulation would take effect only where a line was connected with a public line, and I do not think it would be wise to adopt that amendment. I hope that the Postmaster-General, if this is passed and the Bill is recommitted, will submit something that will carry out the intention of the majority of senators who have referred to the matter, and that even upon private lines the interests of the public will be protected by their being permitted the privilege of using them without being charged too much. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think so, but in any case where it is necessary to get the permission of the Postmaster-General for the erection of a line a condition might very well be inserted that the public should have the right of access to ' it. Take, for instance, the case of a mine manager desiring to have telephonic communication between the various parts of a mine, and with no outside connexion whatever,why should he be under the necessity of getting the permission of the Postmaster-General to erect such a line? If he wishes to place himself in connexion with outlying posts on the property he should be able to do so, but where a telephone or telegraph line is in conjunction with a State line, or where, because of supposed relationship with the interests of the public, it is necessary that the approval of the Postmaster-General should be had, I think it would be found that the insertion of the words proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> would meet the case. I suggest that we should insert those words before we postpone the matter. </para>

                <para class="block">Some clauses in the Bill give the Minister the power to enter into contracts, and it is highly desirable to provide that in the regulations there shall be a guiding principle to influence those contracts, in the direction of seeing that they are carried out under proper working conditions for the purpose of getting good material and faithful work from the contractors, and insuring that the workmen shall get properly paid for their work. In several States where contracts for the provision of uniforms for various public departments have been carried out there has been subletting done. Therefore, it is necessary for the sake of insuring that the Postal department shall get good material and faithful work, there shall be some supervision as to the manner in which the contract is carried out. In Western Australia contracts for the provision of uniforms have been sublet. The department has exercised no control over the contracts ; they have been hawked about the town, and sublet from one to another, and the person who has ultimately had to do the work sent to London in one case and Singapore in another, and has had the work done under unfair conditions. </para>

                        <para>- A contract for the provision of uniforms, such as would be necessary under this Bill. Again, take the construction of post-offices. Subletting has been rife in Government contracts of this description. The result of men working at starvation rates of wages is that work is " slummed," and although the Government, that is the people, had paid a high price for the building, still they did not get value for the money. It went to those who had sublet the contract My sub-clause will have the effect of compelling the men who do the work to pay a fair rate of wages, and observe proper working conditions, and under that term we understand the abolition of subletting. As regards the latter part of the sub-clause, there is nothing very revolutionary in the idea of asking the committee to recognise the trade union rate of wages for a district as the standard rate of wages. In all their contracts the London County Council have a provision similar to that in the sub-clause, and they recognise that the standard rate of wages for the district is the trade union rate of wages for that district. I think I can safely ask honorable senators to follow the example of such an august body as the London County Council, who have found it necessary and desirable, in the interests of ratepayers as well as the workers, to insert such a provision in their contracts. </para>

                        <para>- It is the duty of trades unions to enforce this principle. If the Minister has a provision to this effect in a contract, the trade union of the district will take very good care that it is adhered to. If a contract is being carried out in a district, and this provision is not adhered to, the trade union will soon acquaint the Minister with the fact. Let me give an instance which will bring home to honorable senators not only the need for the provision, but the way in which it would operate. We had a large post-office built in Kalgoorlie. There was a recognised trade union rate of wages for the district. The contractor for the building competed with the contractors of Kalgoorlie. They based their price on a certain rate of wages ; he based his price on a lower rate, and of course he got the contract. He immediately went down to Perth, where a lower rate was paid, and contracted with men to go up and work for the Perth rate of wages. He did not get a superior class of workmen. Not only did he get an inferior class, but he also sublet some portions of the . contract. He could not get sufficient men to carry out the work faithfully. The building hung fire for a long time. The department was put to all sorts of inconvenience, and the people were inconvenienced too. An injustice was done to the contractors of Kalgoorlie, and the people of the State had to pay a large price for the building; and owing to the sub-contracting a number of people made a profit out of the State without giving it any value therefor. The trade union made a stir about the matter. They waited on the Public Works department, but the commissioner said to them - "I am helpless; there is no provision in my department to give me power to interfere with the contractor." </para>

                        <para>- No. Under the Act the Minister will enter into contracts for the provision of uniforms for his officers and the supply of telegraphic material, and we are asking that in such contracts there shall be inserted, by regulation, certain clauses providing that fair rates of wages shall be paid and fair working conditions observed. Surely there is nothing sensational or out of the way in such a provision as that. </para>

                        <para>- I contend that it is perfectly applicable. If any honorable senator can cite me any contract, I can prove that this provision will apply to it, and, more than all, it is necessary in the interests of the department, and for the purpose of seeing that public money is wisely and carefully expended, and that the public shall get all they pay for. Under our present system, where subletting is allowed, the public pay for no value received. This applies more particularly to the supply of articles to the department than to the case of buildings. Where there is a contract for the supply of materials how does the contractor make a profit <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> He cannot make it out of wages, but he makes it by supplying inferior materials, in consequence of which the public suffer. If we had a provision like this in force unscrupulous contractors would be debarred from the opportunities of taking advantage of the public that they have had in the past. Hitherto we have not had such a provision ; but now we are inaugurating a new state of affairs we should get a little beyond what has been done in the past in the direction of safeguarding the public interest, and see that those who carry out the public works of the Commonwealth get a fair return for their labour, and are protected from unscrupulous employers and contractors. There is one other thought in connexion with this clause, and that is that it provides the rate of wages to be paid by the department where any work is being carried out. If proper regulations are framed for this purpose it will have a good effect in providing, for instance, that where work has to be carried out in Victoria the wages paid shall be at Melbourne rates. </para>

We have made greater interferences with trade by means of clauses that have been agreed to, than would be made by the proposal I am now making. By passing the amendment the Senate will not be committing itself to the details, which however would have to come before the Senate in the form of regulations. Therefore, for the purpose of insuring the conditions under which contracts shall be carried out for the Commonwealth Government, I ask the Senate to agree to the proposal. </para>

                        <para>- I have not the slightest doubt that the work of erecting post-offices will be carried out by some different department, as is the case in the States. While <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> was speaking, I interjected a question as to how he would deal with a particular class of contracts, such as for the carriage of mails. When we come to consider that matter, this proposal absolutely crumbles away. How can we, in letting a contract for the conveyance of a mail, put in a condition that there shall be a " minimum rate of wages and fair working conditions," and that the wages and conditions shall be " those recognised by the trade union in the locality in which the work is carried out "? The idea only has to be mentioned to be scouted. The committee sees perfectly well that, so far as concerns that class of contracts, the proposal is absolutely impracticable. As to uniforms, the matter will be governed entirely by the factory laws of the States, and with regard to the erection of post-offices, that has nothing to do with my department. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline>
                    Of course, I quite agree that this amendment is in accordance with the protectionist policy of the Government ; but I do not at all agree with the Postmaster-General as to the difficulty of carrying out the idea. I am satisfied that a minimum or trade union rate of wages can very well be provided by means of this Bill, and can be carried out by the Postal department. This can be done even in the case of the carriage of mails and where there is no carriers union in existence. I am proud to say that in Western Australia there is a union amongst the road men on the Murchison gold-fields. I think the movement has extended to the eastern gold-fields. The men have been forced into this position through the fact of Afghan carriers nearly running them off the roads. As to the carriage of mails, where there is no trades union the difficulty can be easily got over by having a schedule of rates and by providing that no rates shall be paid short of, say, 7½ per cent. of the rate fixed in the schedule. Unless something of that kind is done the sweating that has been in existence hitherto will be continued. I know of contracts that have been taken at rates that were not sufficient to pay for the feed of the horses.

                        <para>- Where there is not enough to pay a living rate of wages, or even to pay for the feed of the horses, it is only proper that the State should step in and fix a living rate. We have seen cases where a firm like Cobb and Co., have had a monopoly over certain roads, and been able to run other firms off the road, after which they have raised the prices and made the business pay at their own terms. There are also cases where contracts have been taken from the Government at very low rates, and the shortage has been made up by compelling passengers to pay through the nose. It is not fair that the post-office should get the benefit of having its mails carried at the expense of passengers. Those are difficulties which can be rectified by fixing a schedule rate. The principle is one that a protectionist Government is pledged to so thoroughly that they cannot consistently oppose it. </para>

                    <para>- I am quite sure that we all fully appreciate the sympathy expressed by the Postmaster-General, but I confess that I do not see the difficulties standing in the way of carrying out the principle of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce's</inline> proposal. The Postmaster-General urges that the Federal Government has no machinery of its own for such a purpose. It will be easy for them to provide the machinery required. Take the case of uniforms. To my mind it is an exceedingly simple one. Most honorable senators agree with me that the factory law of Victoria is one of the most beneficial enactments in Australia ; in fact, I think it is the finest piece of social legislation in the world. Assuming that a number of uniforms are required for different officers of the Postal department throughout the Commonwealth, what stands in the way of the Postmaster-General taking the Victorian rate for the manufacture of such uniforms ? If the prices paid for them are reasonable, as I assume that they are, that rate could easily, be adopted. It seems to me to be perfectly practicable and advisable to do so. Indeed I go further, and say that it is perfectly just. </para>

I see no obstacle in the way of carrying out this proposal. I am perfectly sure that it can be done by regulation. I could frame regulations to-morrow to give effect to it. Now we come to the construction of buildings, which has been referred to by the Postmaster-General: The honorable and learned gentleman says that the Postal department will simply approve of the erection of a building in some particular part, and that tire Works department will carry it out. </para>

                        <para>- Very well. We have also to deal with the construction of telegraph lines. The Commonwealth has no machinery relating to telegraphs, but have we no means of framing regulations in regard to them for any part of the Commonwealth <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Are we' not able to say that wherever certain buildings are erected for the department a reasonable and fair wage shall be paid, that the hours of employment shall be fair and reasonable, and that the conditions under which the workmen carry out their duties shall be sufficiently healthy <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> I wish that in all legislation dealing with matters of this kind, we would not, so to speak, meet the devil half way. These hobgoblins that have been raised are nothing at all. The real question is whether we are desirous of seeing these things carried out. If we are, then "where there's a will there's a way." I see no obstacle whatever so far as the manufacture of uniforms is concerned, and certainly none can be raised in connexion with the erection of buildings and the construction of telegraph and telephone lines. The whole matter can be dealt with by regulations. In Victoria they have factory legislation. In Queensland we have taken a step in that direction, and I believe that in South Australia they have provisions which have worked satisfactorily for many years. I am sure that the Commonwealth Government is generally in sympathy with us, but we are overcome sometimes by trifling difficulties. In this matter what we desire can be done. </para>

                        <para>- My experience is that we often go too slow, and sometimes stop short of the distance we ought to reach. We are all agreed that persons doing the work of the Commonwealth should be reasonably paid ; that no sweating should take place, and I would urge the Postmaster-General to set his face against subcontracting in every shape and form. It is an evil, and will continue to be so as long as the system is permitted to exist. I trust the Postmaster-General will provide against it by regulation. The carriage of mails is a more difficult matter to deal with. A person contracting for their delivery in a certain place might simply be a horseman, who would do the work himself. It would not be desirable for the committee to assert that where such a man contracted to carry the mails over a certain distance for £100 a year, the Postmaster-General should say to him - " Friend, I think the price is too little ; you ought to get £200." But where a mail contractor employs another person to assist him in carrying out that work, we ought to insist that a reasonable wage is paid. Let us take Cobb and Co. for example. Why should they not be required to pay a reasonable wage to their coach-drivers ? Provision has been made for a minimum wage in many parts of the world. The London County Council has adopted the system, and a minimum wage is provided for bus-drivers and tram-drivers. Would there be anything unseasonable, therefore, in framing regulations to compel Cobb and Co. and other people to pay a fair wage. What we want to provide is that the rate of wage shall be in accordance with that fixed by the union in the particular locality in which the work is done, if such a union exists. We could provide for a case in which a union did not exist by saying that such a rate should be paid wherepracticable. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce's</inline>
                    intentions in this matter. 1 do not think there is an honorable senator who holds two opinions about the desirability of seeing that a fair and reasonable wage is paid to the people of this country. I am perfectly certain that we shall do all that lies in our power to insure that, whenever contracts are entered into with the Commonwealth, the persons working under those contracts are paid an honest and reasonable wage. It seems to me, however, that by including the provision in this clause we should be arrogating to the Postmaster-General and the trades unions that which is clearly the province of conciliation and arbitration boards.

                        <para>- I think I am just as free to speak on this question as the honorable leader of the labour party. I am just as fully in accord with the principle as he is. It is not necessary for an honorable senator to be a member of the labour party in order to be just as warmly in accord with the principles that are advocated in this amendment, as any member of that party is. We have recognised in most of the States of the Commonwealth the principle of conciliation and arbitration, and I hope that in the very near future we shall have a Commonwealth Act dealing with those disputes which arise outside any particular State. The Arbitration and Conciliation Board in Western Australia, say, might fix a wage at a particular amount which, in the opinion of trades unionists, would not be a fair rate. </para>

                        <para>- There is one in Western Australia. I am heartily in accord with the honorable senator's intentions in putting forward this proposal, and when a Bill in which we can deal with this matter is brought forward I shall be prepared to assist him. The amendment refers to the rate of wages " payable in the locality." In what locality ? Suppose a contract is to be entered into for the carriage of the mails from Perth to Kalgoorlie, or from Perth to Mount Leonora. What rate of wages is to be paid ? The rate of wages is far lower at Perth than at Kalgoorlie. Or, take the case suggested by a senator of a steamer trading between London and Australia. </para>

                    (Western Australia). - I only wish to make a few remarks. I suppose I ought to say, like the Postmaster-General and the last speaker, that I am in entire accord with the sentiments of the mover of the amendment. I am always in accord with a proposal which has for its object the bettering of the labouring classes. At the same time I am very often not in accord with the proposals of those who say they want to benefit the labouring classes, because I have frequently observed that the opinions of certain classes are entirely opposed to what -would be in their true interests. This proposal appears to me to provide that we should make regulations for incorporating the minimum rate of wage and fair working condition into any contract that is entered into in connexion with postal affairs. I can well understand that that would be practicable if, in all the States, we had in existence legislation dealing with the minimum wage and providing for fair working conditions, because then it would be equivalent to saying that any contract entered into by the Postmaster-General must be carried out in accordance with the State legislation on the subject then existing. But supposing we have no factory laws, what then, is the Postmaster-General to do ? Is he, by his regulations, to have cut and dry a Factory Bill that has never been passed in a State ? Take Queensland, where there are. jio factory laws.

                        <para>- Let us take this in relation to the States of New South Wales and Tasmania, where they may not yet have reached that stage of legislative efficiency to have these laws. We will have a regulation saying that in New South Wales or Tasmania the Postmaster-General shall not enter into contracts unless there is a stipulation as to the payment of a minimum rate of wages and fair working conditions in the carrying out of those contracts. How is the Postmaster-General to determine what are fair working conditions, or what is a minimum wage ? And how is he to safeguard both by the detailed provisions necessary to render such a proposal workable under the Act? I say it is perfectly impossible to make this workable in localities where there are no factory laws, or unless you embody or append to these regulations a regular code of regulations which would be similar to a Factory Act. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> must see that his proposal is liable to the initial objection which many of us urged, vainly admit, against the clause 54 the other night, because it is merely asking us in the Postal Bill to do the work that properly belongs to the State. </para>

                        <para>- I am quite aware of that, but by this provision the Government would have power to secure fail conditions and the minimum rate of wages in the building of a post-office, and such conditions should not apply to only one class of work, but to all works carried out in the States. We are here putting into this measure a provision for the application of certain conditions to one class of work that really ought to be applicable to every class of work done in the States. Assuming, which I am not, that I was in favour of the fair minimum wage and fair conditions, as here referred to, my argument is that this proposal is asked to be put into the wrong Bill. It is asked to be put into a Commonwealth measure, whereas it should be dealt with by a State measure in each particular State. That is all I have to say, except that I am sure Senators Pearce and McGregor must feel, from the kindly way I have addressed myself to the subject, that I am heartily in accord with the principle contained in the amendment. </para>

                    <para>- I am also in favour of the principle enunciated in this proposal, but I do. not put the sting in the tail of the sentence by saying that it is impracticable. I think it is not only practicable but absolutely necessary. Surely it is not the wish of the Federal Government to pay their employees less wages than are paid by private individuals in the same locality. </para>

                        <para>- To my mind it is precisely the same thing. If we let a contract for uniforms, for instance, have we not the right to say before we conclude the contract that the people to whom we let the contract shall pay the ruling rate of wages ? It is an extraordinary thing to me if we have not that right. We have precedents for that in many contracts which have been let by Governments before, in which it has been stipulated that the ruling rate of wages shall be paid. This provision may not be necessary in Victoria, where there is a Factories Act in existence, but some other States have not had the courage to initiate a Factories Act, and in order to obtain a trade advantage they may be very reluctant 'to do so. In such a case where a contract is let for uniforms, I do not see why a clause should not be inserted to provide that the trade union rate of wages shall be paid to the persons engaged in making the uniforms. </para>

                        <para>- At the present time we are talking about the rate of wages. If post-offices are built under the supervision, not of the Postmaster-General, but of. the Public Works department, this sub-clause clearly does not refer to them. But if it does refer to them, surely the men on those contracts should be employed under the same conditions as if the Government were erecting the buildings under the supervision of a manager. If they call for tenders for the erection of such a building, surely they can provide in the contract that the ruling, or trades union rate of wage in that locality, shall be paid. In Kalgoorlie we had a great deal of trouble through the contractor bringing up cheaper labour from the coast, where the conditions are much easier than they are on the gold-fields, and using them for building the post-office at a lower rate of wages than was paid in the town. That sort of thing should not be done, because if the Government insist upon carrying out a policy like that, it means that they use their great force and power to endeavour to reduce the rate of wages in a particular locality. I do not think there is a Minister of the Crown, and I hope there is not a Member of Parliament, who would wish the Government to carry out any such system as that. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harney</inline> has said that the Federal Government have no more right to interfere in regard to the rate of wages than they had to interfere in regard to Tattersall. But the men who are employed on Government contracts are their employes, through the contractors. If that is the case, surely the contractors have a right to pay the ruling rate of wages to the men who are engaged in doing their work. Take the instance of a carrier. If there is no trade union of carriers, and there is a trade union rate of wages there, this provision does not apply ; but if there is, surely the men who are carrying the mails are employes of the Government, and if they are, why should they be given a chance of employing labour at a lower rate of wage than is charged in that district ? All sorts of sophistry are used by men who are in accord with the principle ; they say that it is absolutely necessary, but that it is impracticable, and use all kinds of arguments against its adoption. But I hope that in every Government contract there will be a clause to the effect that the ruling rate of wage in that district shall be paid to the men employed on the contract. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think there is any trades union in a case like that ; but if Cobb and Company are tendering for the carriage of mails they should tender under the same conditions as a man who is a fair employer, and thus not put a fair man at a disadvantage, compared with a man who will cut down wages, and consequently get the contract. If there be any contract there is no injustice done. The Postmaster-General says, "would you ask me to accept a tender for £200 if there is a tender for £150 "? Certainly not ; he would accept the lower tender, but the tenderers would have to . comply with the same condition, to pay the full rate of wage. I hope that in this Bill, as in every other where we are going to have contracts or employes, a similar provision will be inserted. </para>

                        <para>- The amendment asks that the trades union rate of wages shall be paid, and if we are to carry out the proposal which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> is to make shortly, that subsidized mail boats shall be manned by white crews, why cannot we also say that the steam-ship companies to carry our mails shall pay a reasonable rate of wages, whatever that may be, as decided by the seamen's unions. The firm of Cobb and Co. has been mentioned, and the question has been asked whether we are to fix the rate of wages of the drivers. When I came to Melbourne I was very much astonished to find a milkmen's union, because that is a most unusual union, and there is no reason to suppose that we should not have a union of Cobb and Go's, drivers, who would decide among themselves what was a fair rate to be paid for their work. </para>

At the present rate of - progress in Queensland we shall have to wait for many years before we ' have any hope of getting a minimum wage law from the present Ministerial party, and in Western Australia they may have to wait for many years before the rule of the six: families passes away. I cannot see where there is any objection to this provision. ' It is wanted not only in connexion with the manufacture of uniforms, and the use of white crews, but also in the construction of telegraph lines and in connexion with, line repairers. The Public Service Bill will contain a schedule of the wages to be paid throughout the public service, and so why cannot the Postmaster-General decide in. connexion with contracts for constructing telegraph lines what rate of wages shall be paid by the contractor? I hope that * honorable senators will not raise too many obstacles by saying - "We express the greatest sympathy with the endeavours of those who desire to benefit these people, but we are npt going to do it here ; let us put it in some Factories Act <inline font-style="italic">in some State,"</inline> because we may have to wait 25 years to get such a law- in some of the States unless they wake up and follow the example of Victoria. </para>

                    (South Australia). - I. am very pleased that an opportunity of this description has arisen to afford time for consideration, and also to give those honorable senators who are so fond of preaching to put into practice a little of that precept which they advocate so much. It has been said by some honorable senators that they have as much sympathy with the working men as- t has the labour party or its leader, or anybody else. I do not deny that. Probably they have as much sympathy as the others. But then, so far as this discussion has gone,, their sympathy is not of a very practicable description. Even the Postmaster-General has a great deal of sympathy. Undoubtedly we believe that he feels that sympathy, but when he stated that he was sympathetic, he immediately began to put out a great many obstacles that were in the way of its. realization.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harney,</inline>
                    too, is in entire sympathy with the proposal. In fact he has more sympathy than any of us here who occupy this corner, and he is- better capable of judging as to what would be really beneficial to the people whom we are here especially to represent. Although we consider that we are as good representatives of all sections of the community as any one here, yet the very name we bear gives us a special claim lathe representation of the working classes..

Supposing he wanted a suit of clothes, and he was in a town where there was no trades union, where the poor unfortunate tailoresses had to work the eyes out of their heads and the fingers off their hands to earn a living, and their employer did not care whether they earned it or not. Supposing he went to one of these business places and said - "I want to contract with you to make me a suit of clothes." The first thing he would do would be to select a nice pattern of good material, and then to tell him that he wanted it well made, and above all things he would say - " If you want to take this job from me I have to get an assurance from you that you are going to pay the unfortunate girls who will make this suit of clothes a living wage." </para>

The girls - knowing that he had made these conditions, had such sympathy with them, and was so fond of carrying out these principles, and was such a fine good-looking gentleman - would soon indicate to him the delinquencies of the employer under whom they were working. The Postmaster-General raises the objection - are we to employ inspectors ? Well, I have worked on a great many Government jobs, both for private contractors and the Government themselves, but I never worked upon a job which the Government did not inspect in order to see whether the work was being carried out properly. Does the Postmaster-General mean to tell the committee that he would let a contract for the manufacture of some thousands of pounds' worth of .uniforms, that they would be dumped into the department, and that no one would ever see whether they were properly made, or whether the material was of good quality ? </para>

                        <para>- What are the Government inspectors doing during the time the things are- being made? I know that inspectors, in connexion with Govern- ' ment contracts, very often can scarcely keep themselves warm with the amount of work they have to do. lc would give the inspectors \ an opportunity of earning their money if they had to make a few more inquiries than they do now. With respect to the building of post-offices, the Postmaster-General says that very likely that work will be handed over to the Public Works-department. But the works must be authorized by the Postmaster-General, and he has the right to enforce any conditions that he likes. It has been said by some of those honorable and learned senators who are so fond of principles, and know so little about how those principles are carried out in the different States, that factory legislation does not exist in some of the States, and that therefore, this provision could not be enforced. Even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harney</inline> did not appear to be aware where factory legislation exists, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ewing</inline> in his reference to the conciliation law did not seem to know what functions of a measure of that description really are. A Conciliation or Arbitration Act can only come into force when there is a" dispute. -But we do not want to have disputes. A\7e want to have it laid down in the conditions of contract that the contractor shall do something which will have the effect of putting all contractors on exactly the same footing. Suppose, for instance, that the department called for tenders for the erection of a post-office, and that that work was under the control of the Postmaster-General. The conditions of contract could easily provide that the rate of wages to be paid should be the union rate in. the locality. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has no idea of putting the amount to be paid into' this Bill. All wo want is to lay down the principle that the Government shall pay the minimum rate of wage paid in the locality, whatever that rate may fee, and that the maximum hours of labour shall be the maximum hours worked in the locality. All these matters are already provided for in some of the States. In South Australia, if a contract is let, conditions are inserted that the minimum rate of wages for the trades affected must be paid, and that the maximum hours of labour must be adhered to. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Play</inline> ford ought to know that in South Australia a Cabinet order was passed long ago, providing that a minimum rate of wage shall be paid to all able-bodied men doing the work of able-bodied men, and that the amount shall be nothing less than 6s. a day. In New South Wales the minimum rate of wage is fixed at 7s. a day. There can be no misunderstanding about a provision of that kind. </para>

                        <para>- In South Australia it applies to all contracts with which the Commissioner of Public Works has anything to <inline font-style="italic">do,</inline> The conditions also provide that no alien labour shall be employed. That brings me to the objection raised with respect to shipping, as to whether we are to compel the Orient line, the P. and O. line, or any other shipping company, to pay the minimum rate of wages fixed in any Australian State. Senators from Western Australia, who appear to know all about shipping, have inquired whether we should have to compel these companies to. pay Australian seamen's rates of wages or English seamen's rates. The rule is that wherever the seamen sign on, the union rate of wages prevailing in that port is to be paid. The phrase " union rate of. wages " has been discussed as though unionists were all robbers. Of course there are a great many people in this world who are not particular what they take out of the public, but those who have to sweat for their living know that the wages received are not fixed entirely by the trades unions themselves. They are fixed by the unions with the consent of the employers union. If the employers union are not prepared to agree to the union rate of wages a difficulty arises, but when the union rate is adopted the assumption is that the employers as a general rule have agreed to it. I should like to ask the Postmaster-General whether he thinks it is wrong? to put into contracts conditions such as I have mentioned ? </para>

                        <para>- Take the case of clothing contracts. The Postmaster-General will have to call for tenders for clothing for a great number of officers of his department. Is it not better for the individuals who have to earn their living in carrying out those contracts that some conditions should be laid down as to whether they are to work eight or fifteen hours a day, and are to get the recognised log prices ? If the Postmaster-General knows anything about labour conditions he must be aware that in almost every city in Australia there is in connexion with the tailoring trade a log of prices according to an agreement made between employers and employes. Would it be a hardship if the Postmaster-General were to insert a condition in his contracts with manufacturers of clothing that the recognised log prices should be paid to those engaged upon the contract? </para>

                        <para>- No ; but the Government could cancel the contract, and could also make it a condition that the employer might be fined £1,000, or any other sum that might be fixed, if he did not observe the labour conditions. There is not the slightest difficulty about enforcing the conditions, and it is really useless to argue the point any further. This amendment which has been moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> - it is suggested to me that it is really the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Frederick</inline> Sargood, but I do not believe that - is only for the purpose of giving the Postmaster-General power to insert the condition asked for in the contracts of his department, and a contractor who does not carry it out should be penalized by being fined or having his contract cancelled. With regard to Cobb and Co., [ know nothing about the business of that firm. In South Australia it is Hill and Co. who carry the mails. That firm have always been very fair to their employes. Hill and Co. have given them fair wages as far as I have ever heard. Does the Postmaster-General mean to bring about a condition of tilings that would make it necessary for Hill and Co., or Cobb and Co., .or any other company to compete with people who would, as soon as they got a contract, be prepared to grind down those who worked for them to the lowest level ? Surely in the interests of the humane employers - I believe they are the majority - who are anxious to carry out a fair and faithful bargain with the Government, and to treat their employes humanely, the Minister should agree to the insertion of a power in the contracts of his department that will enable the employes to be fairly treated. Iri another place a resolution has been carried, with the consent of the Government, that in all Government contracts the principle here contended for shall be recognised. </para>

                        <para>- But the Postal department, as the saying is, will generally go " on its own." We find that that is the case in other States. It will be safer to insert the provision in this Bill. It can do no harm, and will only be in accordance with the resolution passed in another place. Therefore I hope the committee will agree to the amendment, and that instead of merely expressing their sympathy, senators will give practical effect to it by doing something for the good employers who are willing to treat their fellow-creatures fairly, as well as for those individuals for whom so much sympathy is expressed. </para>

                    SARGOOD (Victoria).. -
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline>
                    has credited me with this amendment.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline>
                    doubted very much whether it emanated from me, and I think that the honorable senator's surprise was justified, because when T do propose an amendment I like to propose a practical one. In this instance I do not think the amendment is practicable. Several honorable' senators have stated that their sympathies are in the direction of this proposal. I can say the same. I can also lay claim to the fact that I had charge of the first Factories Act in Victoria during its passage through, the Upper House. I have carefully watched the progress of factory legislation, and have taken a very active interest in every amendment of the original Act in Victoria. I am a thorough believer in legislation of that kind in the interests not merely of the employer but also of the employe, and without factory laws of a wise character I believe the condition- of affairs that has been referred to would have been continued up to the present day. The Victorian Act has done a great deal of good, although it is by no means perfect. But for the fact of that law being in existence here, the very desirable object which the proposer of this amendment has in view could not be carried out even in Victoria. The difficulty will be in applying it under this Bill in other States where they have no factory legislation. I have been a manufacturer for forty years, and I am a manufacturer now, so that I think I may safely say that I know something of the subject under discussion. I- have always made ib a rule to secure the sen-ices of good workmen and to pay them well, and during the whole of my career as a manufacturer I have never had the slightest difficulty with an)' of my employes. I may safely say that, directly and ind directly, I have over 5, 800 employes, so that I may reasonably claim to have had some experience upon these questions. I entirely agree with the strong condemnation of subletting, which was indulged in by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey.</inline>
                    That has been the root of a great deal of the evil which has taken place, and no measure would be too strong to absolutely put an end to it. Another portion of the amendment is really an acceptance of the principle of the minimum wage. That subject has been debated for many years, and very recently the principle has been recognised in the State of Victoria. Speaking as much in the interests of the employe as that of the employer, I must say we do not know yet what the ultimate result of it will be. In my opinion it is a step in the right direction, but undoubtedly one of its results has been to throw out of employment the old and indifferent workers.

                        <para>- Unfortunately the result of the minimum wage in Victoria has been to throw a number of old men out of work. That difficulty is met by a special clause inserted in the Victorian Act by the Legislative Council, I may say, very much against the will of the labour party. The clause provides that special permits shall be given in those cases where men are not able to make themselves worthy of the full rate of pay. It is rather an unsatisfactory position for old men who have been working for many years for their employer, but it is the only way in which it is possible for the minimum wage to be carried out. </para>

                <para>Senator Sir FREDERICK SARGOOD. I do not think I am compelled to go into all these details at the present time. I favour the principle advocated by the mover of the amendment, but I do not think that the amendment is in the right place. It cannot be carried out until there is factory legislation in every State. That, I trust will take place as quickly as possible. Personally I should like to see the Commonwealth intrusted with the power of passing factory legislation, and I would be prepared to render hearty assistance in that direction. Reference has been made to the manufacture of uniforms. That is a very small matter. The number of uniforms required every year, would be comparatively trifling, and they would be manufactured in many places in each State. To appoint an inspector to watch their manufacture under each of these contracts would involve a very large amount of extra cost. I may inform <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> that it is not the practice to inspect clothing during the course of manufacture.  The clothing is delivered, and then it is ascertained by examination whether it is up to the standard, or not. In no instance that I know of. is clothing inspected during the process of manufacture. An inspector therefore would have little or nothing to do.- I need hardly go into the question of enforcement as I do not see how it could be enforced until we get factory legislation. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MILLEN</inline>
                    (New South Wales). - I should have much preferred to see this motion brought forward apart from the Postal Bill, but as it has been tabled, and as my sympathies with it will cany me a little further than the sympathies of other honorable senators appear to have carried them, I am anxious to make a suggestion the acceptance of which would enable me to vote for it. I have listened very carefully to the objections that have been raised, and I must admit that many of them are the result of fear or imagination. I have heard similar objections raised with regard to nearly every reform dealing with social and industrial legislation. Nevertheless, I think I can see one or two objections to the adoption of the amendment in its entirety. It makes two distinct proposals. The first is that in all contracts under the Postal department provision shall be made for the payment of a fair rate of wage and for fair working conditions. I agree absolutely with that. I see no objection to requiring the Postal department to insure that being done, and I see little difficulty in maintaining that position. When it goes on to stipulate, however, how we are to ascertain these conditions, I think it creates a difficulty. I do not wish to see the Postmaster-General made a. party to a strike,- for instance, and yet if we adopt the amendment in its present form we might under these regulations force him to take sides in an industrial dispute. There is no necessity for that. Let me illustrate what I. mean. Supposing trouble occurred with the railway employes, and they, through their union, demanded a higher rate of wages- than they were receiving. The mails have to be carried ; they could not be stopped pending the adjustment of this trouble. What, then, would be the position of the Postmaster-General ? He insists, under this Bill, that the mail's shall be carried, but, in the event of a dispute, the railway authorities might perhaps be forced to say that they must stop the running of their trains rather than concede the demands of the men. In such an event, what would the Postmaster-General have to do ? Should he say " You are to pay the rate of wages which the union demands, and not the rate previously given" ? Yet such a difficulty would possibly occur not only in regard to railways, but in relation to the carriage of mails by other means. I would, therefore, ask the proposer of the amendment to omit -the last lines, altering the word "minimum" to " reasonable," and making the paragraph read - '
                </para>
                <para>For the purpose of providing for the payment of a reasonable rate of wages and fair working conditions in all contracts under this Act. </para>
                <para>That is not only an affirmation of the broad principle that in the carrying out of the department's work we wish to treat fairly those who are discharging that work, but it brings the machinery into play by which the regulations can be enforced. It certainly would throw upon the Postmaster-General occasionally the difficult task of determining whether the wages were fair or not, but in 99 cases out of 100 he would adopt the union rate. It would also relieve hun from the obligation of taking sides if such trouble as that to which I have referred did occur. If the suggestion I have made is adopted, or something in that direction, I shall be prepared to give the motion my vote, as I now give.it my cordial support. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator GLASSEY</inline>
                    (Queensland). - I wish to add a word or two in regard to the question of the inspection of uniforms in course of manufacture, to which reference has been made.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir. Frederick</inline>
                    Sargood, who has had large experience in these matters, says there is no such thing as inspection of clothing in the process of manufacture. That we may take as a fact. Assuming, however, that the post-office insists upon inspection, does it follow that it will be necessary to have an inspector travelling from place to place ? I do not think so. I think the difficulty can be overcome very easily. Supposing that a contract for the manufacture qf uniforms for the postal authorities of Victoria is let, could not the Postmaster-General arrange for some person who is particularly well up in this kind of work to superintend the manufacture of the uniforms at a moderate fee ? Where is the difficulty ? The income tax in the old country is collected by local people, who are thoroughly conversant with the various persons and matters in their respective localities. In Queensland, which is an enormous territory with a sparse population, the contracts for these uniforms are usually let in Brisbane. The clothing is manufactured according to measurement and sent to postal employes all over the State. I was in the Postal department at Brisbane for a little while, and know something about the matter. I am acquainted with a number of contractors in Brisbane who have made uniforms for the Railway department, the Postal department, and for the police, and I can say that there would be no difficulty in obtaining a thoroughly competent person in any of the large centres to see that the uniforms are properly made. Their services could be obtained for a very small fee, so that so far as the appointment of travelling inspectors is concerned there need be no anxiety over it at all, and it simply wants a little arrangement. In the way I suggest we may easily overcome any difficulty in the way of inspection. If we have a desire to put these very humane provisions into force we will find that the difficulties raised will vanish into thin air when we come to the practical working of the question.

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger</inline>
                    in another place, which' embodied the principle. It has, therefore, been a surprise to me to meet with opposition from the Government. If we cannot put the principle into operation in connexion with this department of the Government, I do not know in what department we can put it into operation. Here we have a Postal Act in which the Postmaster-General has power to contract with certain parties for the supply of material, and all we are asking is that in the supply of  that material the Government shall require contractors to carry out the spirit of the resolution they have already agreed to in another place. We want the Government to be consistent. They have said in another place that they are prepared to stipulate that a fair rate of wages shall be paid, and we are now asking them in this Bill, under which contracts may be made, to carry out the spirit of that resolution. As to the practicability of this proposal, that the Government, in framing regulations under this Bill, will so frame them . as to insure their practicable working. We do not by this motion, frame regulations, but I do not see why regulations cannot be framed which will make it practicable. I do not see anything to be gained by the adoption of the alteration suggested by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline>
                    If we alter the expression " minimum " to " reasonable " we must call, in some one to determine what is " reasonable." As to saying trade unions laid down the rate of wages in certain districts, as is frequently said, the fact is that the trades unions or employers and employes together fix the wages. It is an agreement between employers and employes, and if it is suggested that a strike may arise in the meantime, that will not concern the Postmaster-General, as all he will have to do will be to see that the conditions of his contract are carried out.

                        <para>- They would be able to do so by agreement with their employers, but the Postmaster-General would not be placed in the position of deciding between the employer and the employe. All that he would have to do would be to see that the contract was carried out according to the conditions. As to the appointment of inspectors to see that this proposal is carried out, in dealing with that matter, I do not want to say that senators have shown a want of common sense, but they have shown a want of knowledge of the way in which these contracts are carried., out. If they had worked upon such contracts, as I have done, they would know that those who are at work upon them would be the inspectors to see the conditions carried out. </para>

                        <para>- It would not matter what the class of work was. If it was a clothing contract the tailors or tailoresses union would see that if the contract was being violated the matter would be brought before the Trades Council, and steps taken to have the provisions of the contract complied with. We do not ask that an army of inspectors should be appointed ; but I point out, at the same time, that in the case of buildings we do appoint inspectors to look after the work and see that we get good material from the time the foundation is laid, and I do not see why we should not be just as willing, if necessary, to appoint inspectors in connexion with other kinds of work. As regards the question of arbitration, it seems to me that this proposal would be perfectly compatible with the Arbitration Act. As regards the question of locality and the payment of the rate of wages ruling in the locality in the case of the carriage of mails between Australia and the United Kingdom, the contract, I suppose, would be made in the United .Kingdom, and in that case it would recognise the rate of wages paid in the United Kingdom as the rate of wages to be stipulated. I trust that the fact of this motion having emanated from this corner of the House will not procure for it any opposition on that ground alone. </para>

I have to say here now, as was said in the other House, that the Government, having given their assent to that provision, intend loyally to stand by it, and that in every case in which it is practicable to carry out the principle it will be carried out. I take for instance, as an illustration, a contract entered into on behalf of the Government for the building of. a post-office. As the Postmaster-General has pointed out, that will not come within the control of the Postmaster-General but rather of the Government in its Public Works department. In any contract of that sort, whether it be for a post-office or for tiny other building, " the Government will, as far as practicable, carry out this resolution and this policy which has been referred to by the honorable senator. Our objection to the carrying of the amendment which has been moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> is not that we object to the beneficial operation of the principles laid down, but that we say it is impracticable to carry it out as the honorable senator proposes. If the honorable senator could show us any way by which the principle affirmed and approved of by the Prime Minister could be embodied in this Bill it would be done with our assent, but in this case we say it is quite impracticable. </para>

There are innumerable difficulties in the way. What we impress upon honorable senators at the present time is, that where we are dealing with specific contracts the Government have bound themselves already to deal with them on the principles I have mentioned ; but I say it is impossible to frame this Bill in such a way that those principles can be made applicable practically to the varying conditions of the different States and the necessarily varying conditions of the different contracts. I say that it is quite impracticable ; and while we must refuse to accept this amendment, I state as clearly as it can be stated, that the Government are not in any way departing from the principle affirmed by the Prime Minister, and which they will carry out on every occasion in regard to these contracts. </para>

                    <para>- As a matter of principle I do not like to give a silent vote, although I feel that I can add very little to what has. been said in this interesting debate. We will all give honorable senators due credit for the opinions which they have expressed, and we will believe that they are genuine in their desire to see the principle of this amendment carried into effect, but nevertheless I feel disappointed that so many honorable senators have professed' to find - insuperable difficulties in the way of its acceptance Whatever difficulties there are, I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> might say that they shall be got over. I can only reiterate what has been said. I can only support the point which has been so ably put forth by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> and supported by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> and say that whatever difficulties there are in the way are not insurmountable, but are merely imaginary. I am quite satisfied that if the Postmaster-General were genuine and sincere in his desire to see this principle carried into effect, he would find a way out of the difficulty. I would very much like to see a larger attendance before the division is taken, because I feel that although the amendment may not be. considered a very large one, still the principle underlying it is <inline font-style="italic">a.</inline> big one, and seeing that it has been accepted by the Government, and by an overwhelming majority in another place, it is not too much to expect that it should be given effect to here. 1 am decidedly in favour of the amendment, and I would very much like to see more honorable senators support it than 1 am afraid will do. </para>

                    <para>- I have no doubt that this amendment is proposed by honorable senators with the full idea that it will be a desirable thing in the interests of the people whom they represent. At the same time there is underlying the amendment a principle which I think requires very careful consideration before the committee pledges itself to accept a doctrine of this character. Unquestionably it is the duty of the Government at all times to pay a fail- and reasonable wage to any men who may bc in their employment. So far as I can judge, that is the intention Of the present Administration, and 1 have no doubt that any future Administration will be actuated in exactly the same way. But when honorable senators look at the amendment they will, find that it is practically taking a certain amount of power out of the hands of the Government, and enabling another body to dictate to them what the rate of wages ought to be for services that are rendered to the Commonwealth. </para>

If the Government do not see fit to pay a fair and reasonable rate of wages, I am perfectly prepared to join with other senators to insist upon such a thing being done. But I do object to any outside body - an irresponsible body so far as the people of the country are concerned - dictating to the Government of the Commonwealth, or to any Government, what rate of wages shall be paid. </para>

                <para class="block">I dare say we could agree to that suggestion. I should think it would be extraordinary if any honorable senator would be prepared to say that it would not be a reasonable thins; to give a reasonable rate of wage, and to require that there shall be fair working conditions on all contracts. We could all agree to that ; but when we allow an outside body to state what are the terms which the Government shall pay their employes we are distinctly going beyond our rights. How would it work ? The Government have to employ a large number of persons under this Bill, ls there a similar kind of employment provided by trades unions for people? I am quite sure it will be found that there will be conditions and employment given by the Government which will not bc of the same character as would be given to persons who were embraced in trades unions, and we should be landing the Government in a sea of difficulties at once, even if they accepted the condition, in order that they might make perfectly sure what was the trade union rate of wages. </para>

I will take a case where the Government give some employment for the purpose of building a post-office, and I do not think that is barking up the wrong tree. In that case the Government have no right to be dictated to by any special body in the community, whether they belong to a trade union or to any other association. It is the principle of the amendment entirely that I object to. I do not object to men forming a trade union, and saying that they will not work under a certain rate of wages. </para>

But, supposing a union were to assume to dictate an unreasonable rate of wage, would it be reasonable to say that the Government are bound to make their contractor give that rate ?

                        <para>- A great many things may be done. The honorable senator knows very well, and other senators here know, that when unions attempt to get an unreasonable rate of wages, employers will not pay them, but will resist and will not pay a single- penny more than they can help. No union rate of wages can be recognised as a standard rate which has not been acceded to by the employers. Consequently, when the honorable and learned senator is so learnedly talking about trades unionists, he must recognise that the employers' union is a trades union, and that a rate of wages that has been adopted and recognised by the trade union composed of workmen, and the trade union composed of employers-- </para>

                        <para>- We would have no such tiling, because the employers would be paying the rate and the workmen would be receiving it before it could be a recognised rate. I am sure that the honorable find learned senator has sense enough to see that before it is a recognised rate it must be paid by the employers and must be received by the employes. I would ask the Postmaster-General how he is going to carry out the conditions of the contract - how is he going to impose conditions- - -unless he recognises something ? Does he intend to go to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Major Gould</inline> and ask him what is ti reasonable rate of wages, or does he intend to go to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir John</inline> Downer and ask him what are reasonable conditions ? Is lie going to anybody else but those who are immediately concerned - that is, the employers who are going to carry out the contracts, and the workmen who are going to work for them ? Those are the people that recognise the rate of wages. We know very well that there are a great many persons - it does not matter how they may advocate the elevation of any class of society - whose opinion is that the rate of wages that ought to be paid should be as low as possible, in case the workmen may get too big for their boots, as the- saying is. We want to be told here, by those who object to this proposal, what is the method to be adopted to find out what are reasonable wages and reasonable conditions if we are not going to go to the trades unions. I hope that honorable senators will agree to the amendment. Of course, if they vote against it, they are carrying out the dictates of their consciences, but they did not give expression to them before the electors. </para>

                    <para>- I am very pleased, to hear so many honorable senators give in their adhesion to the principles contained in the amendment. At the same time I regret exceedingly that so many of them have expressed their inability to vote for it. It seems to me - if I may so put it - that a great many of the arguments which have been adduced by those who are opposed to the amendment are based upon a misconception of its purport and effect. It would appear that many honorable senators think that the mover of the amendment is desirous of incorporating in the Bill something which is hard and rigid, and which the Postmaster-General, in administering the Act, may find it difficult to give practical effect to in certain circumstances and in certain cases. But, after all, if we look at the clause, we find that it reads - </para>

                <quote>
                    <para>The Governor-General may make regulations for the following purposes, or any of them. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">It does not necessarily follow that under the powers vested in the Governor-General by the various paragraphs, he will exercise his discretion in that particular way, and will lay down any very rigid rules under any of these particular sub-headings. I think every honorable senator agrees with the principle of this amendment. There is no better way of including that principle in the Bill than by adding it to a clause of this character, which intrusts the Governor-General in Council with a power which he may or may not at his discretion exercise by regulation. The amendment affords an elasticity and adaptability which would enable the Postmaster-General to embody the principle in contracts wherever the necessary conditions enabled him to do so with effect. For that reason I am prepared to support the amendment. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> has addressed himself very ably to the amendment in some respects, but I think he has overlooked the fact that the proposal is really aimed at having a minimum rate of wage paid by contractors who have in their employ a number of individuals, and that it is not aimed at providing a minimum wage for those who are directly employed by the Postal department - such as letter carriers. </para>

                    has attempted to prove the necessity for this amendment, but has really proved more than I presume he anticipated. If" his words are of any effect at all, he would provide that the conditions of labour, and the rates of wages recognised by trades unions in the various localities in which works are to be carried out, shall be recognised both by the contractors' unions, if there be such unions, and by the workmen's unions. That means that those conditions and wages must be agreed upon both by the contractors and unions of workmen.

                        <para>- It may ; but it cuts more against the amendment than in favour of it. If anything unfair is done in connexion with a contract it can be brought forward in this Senate. There are plenty of senators who are willing to bring forward any case of injustice; and have it remedied as speedily as possible. Until it is proved that there is an absolute necessity for such a provision as this, I do not see why we should insert it in the Bill at all. Therefore I am prepared to vote for rejecting the amendment altogether ; or if the supporters of it are prepared to say simply that there shall be provision made for the payment of a reasonable rate of wage, and for the imposition of reasonable conditions of labour, I shall not object to a provision of that character. </para>

                    <para>- I think there is a serious difficulty in connexion with this subject. The committee has already passed a clause compelling the Railways Commissioners of each State to carry mails. The Railways Commissioners will be contractors with the Commonwealth Government. If that b» the case, were we to pass the amendment now before the committee in its present form, the Commonwealth Government would not only have the right to require the use of the railways for the carriage of mails, but also the right to fix the rates of wages to be paid on the railways. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think so. There is no reference to regulations in this amendment. This is a distinct proposal that it shall be competent for the Postmaster-General to require certain rates of wages to be paid by contractors. I do not care who fixes them. It seems to me that we impose a double interference. First of all we say that the railways shall carry the mails and now we are asked to say that the Commonwealth Government shall fix the rates of wages to be paid to those who cany the mails upon the railways. A train may be carrying only half-a-dozen bags of mails, but this provision will compel the Commonwealth Government to fix wages for every one engaged upon that train. That is a serious difficulty. If the committee is determined to pass such an amendment I would venture to make a suggestion that would meet some difficulties that have been raised. I would suggest the introduction of the word "generally" before, the word "recognised," and would then omit the words " by trades unions." The clause would then read - </para>

                        <para>- At the same time, I do not think there is any necessity for the passing of this amendment, on the' ground that the Government have practically pledged themselves to carry out, if not the letter of it, certainly the essence of it. The Government have promised that in their contracts for public works they will do practically what this amendment asks them to do, except in regard to one or two particulars. The Government are connected with the post-office. It is all. very well for some senators to say that the post-office is in a different position to the public works branch. Nothing of the sort ! The post office is part of the Government, and any contracts carried out for the Postal department will have to be carried out in conformity with the rules and regulations made by the Government in respect to works in other departments. There will not, and cannot be, any difference. Therefore I think the senators who have moved in this matter may very well withdraw the amendment. There is no necessity for it, since, the Government having made a promise, the committee may feel perfectly sure that it will be carried out. The chances are that, unless it is found to work injuriously, no future Government will attempt to repeal the regulation. In South Australia we practically carry out the terms of this amendment, although we have no regulation or law bearing upon the matter. It is not to be found in any Act of Parliament what standard of wages shall be paid. But in practice we carry out the proposal. We have a minimum rate of wage in connexion with our Government contracts, and no man is allowed to receive less than 6s. a day if he is a common labourer. But if, through incapacity, ill-health, or infirmity, a man is not able to do the work of an able-bodied man, the contractor is allowed to pay him a lower rate of wages. That is perfectly proper, because men who cannot do a fair day's work should not be thrown upon the world to starve, but should be allowed to take such a wage as they can earn. The Government of South Australia have always recognised that principle. Any contractor, whether he be engaged upon railway works, telegraph works, or any works whatever in South Australia, has to pay a minimum rate of wages to all able-bodied men in his employment, but we make an honorable and. fair exception in the case of weaker men. who are not able to do an able-bodied man's work. </para>

                        <para>- It is a minimum wage as far as able-bodied men are concerned. It is not fair to lay down the hard and fast rule that every man shall be paid a certain wage. All men are not constituted alike, either physically or mentally, nor can you place all men in the same category. Therefore our Government have recognised, with the full consent of the trades unions of South Australia and of the working men's representatives in Parliament, that under certain circumstances less than the minimum may be paid where men are not capable of fairly earning the minimum wage. I do not think we should pass the amendment - in its present form, at any rate. I would strike out two things at least.. In the first place I would strike out. all reference to a minimum wage. Let the Government put that in their regulations if they like. In the second place I would strike out the reference to trades unions. It is a great mistake to say that the trades union rate shall be the rate paid. It might be that the trades union rate was not a fair rate in a certain neighbourhood. If those two provisions are struck out the amendment will read as follows - </para>

                        <para>- If the object of those who support the amendment be not to get fair conditions for the labourer, and to prevent unfair conditions being imposed, but to impose some special minimum wage fixed by trades unions, that would be grossly unfair. I do not think there is any one in South Australia, except <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Charles</inline> Cameron Kingston, who has been more favorable to the working men than I have. I introduced the eight hours' principle in connexion with Government works, and I have assisted to improve the conditions of my fellows in every way I could. But I am not going by Act of Parliament to recognise trades unions in the way proposed by this amendment. The members of trades unions are, after all, a minority, although they are a most intelligent minority. They are the aristocracy of labour. If I were a working man I should belong to a trades union. But at the same time they are irresponsible bodies, and we should not recognise them in an Act of Parliament. Unless the amendment be altered in the way I have suggested, I shall certainly be unable to vote for it. </para>

                    <para>- A number of honorable senators have pointed out that the proposal before the committee is impracticable; but I doubt even yet if the committee understands how thoroughly impracticable it is. There is no department of the Government so widely extended as the post-office. Our inland post-offices are in many cases hundreds of miles from any important centre. 1 suppose that out of ten contracts in connexion with post-offices which might be let by the Government, eight or nine at least would be for work in districts where there are positively no such things as trades unions, and where it would not be possible to carry out the terms of the amendment. The same remark applies to the construction of telegraph-lines, to contracts for the conveyance of mail matter along the inland mail routes, and also to the conveyance of letters by foreign and coastal vessels. There is altogether an absence of all power by which it would be possible to work the amendment. If the committee would grasp the position put by the Postmaster-General as to the absolute impossibility of carrying out the amendment, the discussion would be ended at once and the question resolved in the negative. </para>

                    <para>- There was some sense in the proposal as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> submitted it before, but in adopting the insidious suggestion of my good-humoured and emphatic friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> he has emasculated all the sense out of it. It is an absurdity now. There is a universal feeling that in some way or other, in some shape or other, at some time or other, it would be desirable to fix a minimum rate of wages. We have in this emasculated amendment first of all a provision that regulations may be made for the purpose of providing for the payment of a rate of wages ; that is the first tiling <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> suggested we -should do, and in that way, but he did not tell us what it would mean. There is to be the payment of a rate of wages and fair working conditions in all contracts. Then we had a definition b)' <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford,</inline> and perhaps he knows now where we are. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> proposed at first that the rate of wages should be that suggested by a body at any rate competent to interpret what the rate of . wages should be. -I am not saying whether that should have been so or not, . but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> did right in choosing a tribunal to determine what a fair rate of wages and fair working conditions are. In the present amendment he strikes that out, and we are left at large ; we ai e left to a kind of Tattersalls ' sweep to determine what the rate of wages shall be. Then we have the expression - </para>

                        <para>- SYMON. - Yes, but it does not say so. We will be able to deal with that matter when the amendment proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> comes on, because it will involve the question of signing on. We are now talking of this amendment with the spirit of which so much sympathy has been expressed, and the difficulty is to say who under a contract is to determine the rate of wages. Where the work is carried out oversea between England and Australia, who is to determine what the " recognised " rate of wages shall be? It seems to me that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> would have done better if he had not accepted the latter part of the advice given him by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford,</inline> and it would have been better if he had accepted the first part of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playfords</inline> advice, and had withdrawn the amendment altogether. Really this is a principle which, if it is to be applied at all, should be applied all over the Commonwealth, and it should be applied uniformly, and not to one specific part of the Government services. It should be applied to all. Government services, and to all contracts under Government. That could be better effected in a general Bill like the Public Service Bill, in which we could lay down the rules definitely and clearly. I am sure that my honorable ' friends on the left could effect their desire better in that way than by introducing such a proposition as this into an Act of Parliament dealing with only one department of the public service. The regulations suggested would be impracticable, and more impracticable under the present amendment than under the previous one. It was definite before, though open to the objection raised as to the rate of wages and the conditions being determined by the trades unions. Still, having eliminated that we leave the whole thing at large, to do what would' probably be beneficial for the profession to which I belong, unfortunately promote litigation, or render it impracticable to frame any regulations which would have a beneficial effect upon contracts entered into under this Bill. </para>

                        <para>- There was a great deal of sympathy expressed, and then, in order to meet the views of the committee, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> altered his amendment. ' I have been a trades unionist for over 31- years, and I have always fought against what is- known as the minimum rate of wages, because I saw great difficulty concerning it. It would lead to a great deal of misery and to the non-employment, of those who were unable to earn the minimum rate. At the same time I always felt that if I had contracts to let personally, I would submit conditions similar to those embodied in this proposition by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> I have always been prepared to pay a rate of wages sufficient to enable those engaged in the work to live honestly and respectably. That is all that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> asks for. Here we are as a federal body proposing to enter into contracts for the execution of certain works, and it is our duty to see that the people should live under good conditions and have the means of being happy. We are all agreed upon that, but then comes the next question of what are fair conditions. How are we to establish a fair rate of wages, because it is by the wages that a man earns that he is able to purchase the goods which enable him to live under fair conditions ? It was suggested at first that the wages should be the minimum rate of wages. It was then argued, and I think very well argued, by certain honorable senators, that if we inserted that in the clause we would be practically asking the labour unions to legislate for the country. I saw that objection, and it was owing to that I kept my seat so long ; but now that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has met us in this respect, and has struck out the reference to the trade unions, I think honorable senators should support the amendment, because it only asks us to admit the very point on which I believe we are all agreed, that people working for the Government should work under fair conditions. We know that the value of wages will depend upon what they can buy in the locality in which they are earned, and so, it is suggested that the wages paid must be the recognised rate in the locality in which the contract is carried out. </para>

                    (Queensland). - I must really go back to the imaginary difficulties again. Much has been said about the difficulty in letting a contract for the carriage of mails oversea from one end of the world to another. That point was raised by

                    Symon, who wished to know what rate could be fixed in such  a  case. Surely there is not much difficulty about that. If the' Postmaster-General enters into a contract with the P. and O. Company, the question to consider is, where the men working for that company sign articles.

If the Postmaster-General enters into a contract with the shipping companies, whose men sign articles in Melbourne, the rate of wages will be those paid in this locality, and it will not follow that because the men on the ship carrying the mails go to other parts of the world they will have a different rate of wages when they are in those other parts of the world. What is there to hinder the Postmaster-General from saying, when letting a contract, that such and such wages shall be paid to the men engaged in carrying out the contract. </para>

                        <para>- lt is well known that there are persons owning coaches and contracting for the carriage of mails in that locality, and the usual rates paid for that work in that locality are known. Whatever they are, the condition of the contract should provide for the payment of those rates. All these are imaginary troubles which will never arise, and the great question after all is : are we desirous of doing what is proposed <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> If we are, there is no locality in the whole of Australia where there is not some recognised rate of wages which is well known, even if it be only a portion of the country where people are clearing the scrub. I may be pardoned for saying that honorable senators are raising obstacles which exist only in their own imagination. I do not myself believe in this- vague statement as to a " recognised" rate. In order that all contractors may have an opportunity of tendering, I want the Postmaster-General to lay down in his conditions of contract that the contractor shall pay so and so for the different kinds of work that he performs. There should be no vagueness about it, nor do I see that there will be the slightest difficulty in framing regulations to meet the suggestion proposed. </para>

I consider that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> would have done better had he stuck to his original amendment, because it gave a basis, as well as a recognised rule, which the Postmaster-General would have to follow out ; but the amendment, as it is now, to my mind, is meaningless, and certainly, under the circumstances, I would strongly urge <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> to withdraw it, and, at <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> further stage, in consultation with others perhaps, move an amendment which would meet the difficulties which have been pointed out. With respect to a minimum rate of wages, not only in this Bill, but in every Bill which deals with any class of labour in connexion with the Commonwealth, I should endeavour to have a minimum rate of wage fixed in this respect. We want to affirm a principle which we think the Government should follow in every case, that is, that they shall pay a minimum rate, give fair hours, and impose fair conditions to all classes of labour. I have been much astonished at the attitude which the representative of the </para>

                        <para>- We may be satisfied with that, but here we have the opportunity in regard to this particular department of inserting a minimum wage provision, and, although I am satisfied to a certain extent with what the Government have stated in another place, I want in this place to do my duty, and try, so far as I can, to give effect to the principle in this Bill. A good many difficulties have been raised. Honorable senators have asked how are we to find out the rate of wages which the Postmaster-General, or other Minister of the Crown, must pay for any particular class of labour % Such difficulties have not occurred elsewhere. In Victoria in all contracts that are let under the Government, the minimum wage principle is put in, and certainly if it can be done in regard to this State, it can be done in regard to Commonwealth contracts. I think there will be no difficulty whatever for the Postmaster-General to fix a minimum rate of wages which can be put in all Government contracts. </para>

                        <para>- I listened very attentively to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford,</inline> whose mind seemed to be very considerably exercised in regard to those men who are not able-bodied, or who are weak. That argument is always trotted out on an occasion like this. The other side always professes to have a great deal of consideration for a man who is not able-bodied and a man who is weak, but from my experience those who employ labour are not philanthropists, and, as a rule, do not take weak men or men who are not able to do a fair day's work. I do not think there is any difficulty in that direction at all. The trades unionists, or those who are connected with labour bodies, do not desire to see men-of that class excluded. It seems to j me, from the way in which t. 3 argument has been put, that honorable senators are arguing for a maximum, and not a minimum. I would like to see the original amendment embodied in the Bill. I am exceedingly sorry that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has agreed to withdraw that which, I believe, was the substance of his amendment. </para>

                    <para>- In silence I have listened with very great patience, and, I must say, forbearance, to certain honorable senators while they urged their views, and T intend to have my say before the division is taken. It appears to me as if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> had set himself an almost impossible task. He found himself, I dare say, in the position which we have often heard of as being between a certain gentleman, who shall be nameless, and the deep blue sea. He permitted himself to be influenced by' the blandishments of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford,</inline> and he now finds himself in a much worse position than he was in before. Honorable senators professed that they did not see how it was possible for them to support the original amendment, and now they discover that the present one is even much worse. I do not know what kind of an amendment would meet their view*. My own belief is, that notwithstanding all the professions of sympathy which  we have heard from all sides of the Chamber,, their.  feeling  is that we ought to get for the Commonwealth the best service we possibly can for the least money. It appears to me that that is the feeling which underlies all their speeches. </para>

A great many difficulties have been raised, lt appears to me that those difficulties are principally due to the fact that we have too many gentlemen of the long robe here. These honorable and learned senators are very useful when we have a fine constitutional point to discuss, and then they cannot agree, though that is in the game. When it comes to a question relating to the industrial life of Australia then they simply know nothing about it, and are of no practical assistance in our deliberations. </para>

If he had worked with a pick and shovel, or had ever been a carpenter, shearer, or agricultural labourer; if he had ever worked with his hands, he would have known perfectly well that there is nothing easier for a workman to discover than what is the recognised rate of wages in a particular locality. The most ignorant workman in Australia can give that information, and when he does not know he can very soon find out. </para>

                        <para>- We know that in other portions of the State, from £1 15s. to £1, is the ruling rate of wages. I am quite certain that there is a ruling rate of wages for coach-drivers, although I do not know what it is. I am quite certain that it is very well known to the men who are engaged in the industry of coach driving. lt appears to me that the impracticability of the proposition is a creation of the imagination. lt is a mere phantom, which is continually floating before honorable senators, and obscures their otherwise clear vision. Take the State of Victoria. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barrett</inline> has said that there is no difficulty about the ruling rate of wages in any industry here, and I am certain that the representatives of New South Wales can say the same thing about their State. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> and others can speak for the State of Queensland, and with regard to Western Australia <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> says there is no difficulty. He is a workman who knows something of the industrial life of that State, and that is the reason why he is able to stand up here and say that there cannot be the slightest difficulty in arriving at what is a reasonable rate of wages in any locality at any given time. We heard a great deal a few days ago about the dignity of the Commonwealth, when some honorable senators in this corner were anxious to reduce what they considered to be the excessively high salaries. We were told that the dignity of the Commonwealth required that its officials should be well paid. I would ask honorable senators to consider the dignity of the Commonwealth when we are treating with men who are not officials, and who are not well paid. Some honorable senators may think that there have been no cases of sweating in the employment of the post-office in any of the States. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> referred to one particular branch of the post-office industry. ' I know a couple of men who put in several months in getting telegraph poles, and . they did not average <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> per week, although they worked very hard. <inline font-style="italic">That</inline> was not a fair wage for men to receive who were doing that work ; it was not a living wage,. </para>

                        <para>- In central Queensland the ruling or recognised rate of wages would be about £2 2s. or £2 '5s. a week. The department advertised for tenders and accepted the lowest tender. At that time employment was very scarce in the central division : the various tenderers competed with each other to such a degree that the price was low, and in this way the post - office derived an advantage from the condition of the labour market at the time. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; the same thing applies in a great many other departments of the post-office. We have heard something of carrying mails. I know districts where the people in the locality compete so severely with each other that they cut the thing down to the very bone, and get boys to carry the mails sometimes for their food, and with a few shillings extra, and always fo* a very low wage. That probably holds good almost- through the entire service. The only men so far as I can discover in the post-office who are well paid are those who are on the permanent staff, and come directly under the vision of Members of Parliament. The great army of auxiliaries - the men who do the hewing of wood and the drawing of water for the post-office, and, indeed, it might almost say for every other department - are the men who are neglected, ill-paid, . and Sweated. We want to do something for these men. The man who gets the telegraph poles for the post-office is just as much entitled to a decent living wage as is the Clerk of Parliaments. I think it is the duty of honorable senators to see, so far as they can, that he gets it. We are all agreed - and this is the curious part of the thing - as to the desirability of ever)' man being paid a fair rate of wages and working under fair conditions, but they say the proposal is impracticable. While it is said that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce's</inline> proposal is impracticable, the Postmaster-General gives his word of honour and pledges the Government that they will do everything in their power to see that every employee of the Commonwealth is paid on this scale, and is secured fair working conditions. If a proposal of this character is impracticable, how is it practicable for the Minister to do what he says ; how will he go about it ? If this proposal were embodied in an Act of Parliament it would be a fair warning to every man who took a contract under the Commonwealth that he would have to pay reasonable wages to every person in his employment. </para>

                        <para>- This would be an instruction to the Government to put it in the contract. Embodied in an Act of Parliament, the amendment would compel contractors who tendered for post-office work to base their tenders upon the knowledge that they would have to pay the ruling rate of wages in the locality. I have known a number of contractors who competed for post-office work on the assumption that they would be able to get labour at a much lower price than the ordinary rate prevailing in the locality, and would be able to take advantage of some temporary want of employment on the part of the labouring classes or of tradesmen connected with certain industries. Therefore, I think it desirable to say that every man employed directly or indirectly by the Commonwealth shall be paid such an amount as he ought to receive. If the feeling against sweating, which we hear expressed throughout Australia, is really a sincere one, coming from the heart and not from the lips merely, this amendment will be welcomed, and the Commonwealth Government will thus set a good example in regard to paying every man. in its employment, from the highest to the lowest, a fair and reasonable wage. That being the case what objection can there be to the amendment ? </para>

I have a remedy for his objection with regard to a minimum wage. I would fix a maximum beyond which no man in the community could go. If that were done the minimum could take care of itself. I would fix, say, £5,000 a year as the limit beyond which no man could go. </para>

                        <para>- Even Members of Parliament have a kind of trades union. We should resent any interference with what we considered to be our privileges. Some people think we are continually trying to extend them. Therefore, to that extent, we may be said to have something in the nature of a trades union. I do not understand why the words " trades union " should be like the proverbial red rag to a bull to some honorable members. Trades unions cannot fix wages at a higher rate than the market value in the particular locality. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> has explained, the wage fixed by a trades union is the result of a compromise between the employers and the employes in every case. If it is not the result of a formal compromise, it is the result of an informal one. No trades union can fix or enforce a rate of its own. Wages are commonly arranged as between the buyer of labour and the seller of it. Therefore, as far as I can see, there need be no' difficulty about accepting the rates fixed by trade unions in any locality. I should like to hear something more substantial than mere professions of sympathy for working men. I suppose honorable senators have all heard of the Yankee who was going along a street, when, he came across a woman, who had been knocked down by a cab and injured. All the bystanders were sympathizing with her, but he jumped into the centre of the crowd and said - " I sympathize a dollar!" Are the sympathies of senators strong enough to impel them to vote for this amendment <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> If not, I can only come to the conclusion that their sympathy is not likely to advance the cause of the more lowly-paid workers of the Commonwealth very much. </para>

                        <para>- I would not like that the Senate should be hurried into stultifying itself. I have no objection to the clause if Parliament happens to be sitting, because we will then have a chance of approving or disapproving of whatever regulations are brought before us ; but if Parliament is not in session the Government may make any regulations they please, and they will continue until Parliament has an opportunity of reviewing them. As this clause does not provide for fixing of fees, I do not press my amendment. </para>

                        <para>- It seems to me that there is a great deal more in the point taken by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harney</inline> than some senators seem to imagine. Under the Constitution Act it is provided expressly and distinctly that the President shall have a deliberative vote and no casting vote, and that when the votes are equal the matter shall be resolved in the negative. It is perfectly true that we have got. certain standing orders of South. Australia under which it is proposed to give the Chairman a casting vote in the case of an equality of votes, but the question we have really to consider is not the mere reading of that standing order, because that standing order has no effect at all in the face of the Constitution Act. The whole principle of the Constitution Act is that it. is intended that every senator shall have a deliberative vote and not a casting vote, and if a senator does not exercise his deliberative vote, he should not exercise a casting vote, because it would be in contravention of the spirit and express declaration of the Constitution Act. It is impossible for us by any standing orders to say that when the Senate resolved itself into committee any form of voting shall be allowed in committee other than that prescribed by law for voting in the Senate itself. If that be the case, it is perfectly clear that the Chairman had not the power of giving a casting vote. </para>

                        <para>- As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harney</inline> says, it was the only thing he could do under those standing orders, but I say the Constitution must be paramount over any standing orders we may pass, and under the Constitution Act the Chairman had the power only to give his deliberative vote. We do not know at the present moment what really are the opinions of the Chairman of Committees on the merits of the question. If he had said in the first instance "I am going to vote with the ' ayes,' " that would have been a deliberative vote, but he did not do so. </para>

                            is like the fellow who did not want arbitration because it went against him. I have been pointing out that it is perfectly clear that no standing orders can go behind what is embodied in the Constitution, so as to. enable the Senate, simply because it happens to be sitting in committee, to have a different rule with respect to voting to that adopted when the President is in the chair. The Chairman had a deliberative vote and chose to exercise a casting vote. We must assume that he did not desire to give his deliberative vote because his own expression was that he intended to give his casting vote, and he could have given no other by the standing orders. If the Chairman has a right to give a casting vote, he could give it as he thinks fit, but it is simply a casting vote and not a deliberative vote. I say we cannot get away from that position, and it is impossible now to cure it by saying that the Chairman intended it to be a deliberative vote.

                        <para>- It is not merely a question as to whether this particular amendment shall be carried or not. There is a much greater question underlying the whole thing - the question as to what is to be the rule in the future. Now that the opportunity arises the matter should be decided once and for all, so that we may know what position we are in. This is a matter of grave importance, and we should have it decided now, even if it is necessary to get the President to give his ruling upon it, that we may know how to conduct the business of the Senate in the future. I hope honorable senators will argue the point of order apart altogether from any feeling as to whether the amendment should have been carried or not. It is a very much more important question than that, and it is one that should be determined once and for all. </para>

The standing orders say that when objection is taken to the ruling of the Chairman of Committees it must be taken at once, and stated in writing. I have also done that. The standing order then provides that the' Chairman shall leave the chamber, and the House resume, and the matter is then to be laid before the President. </para>

I take objection to the present proceedings, as irregular. Under Standing Order 152 under which we are working, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harney</inline> should have immediately objected to your decision, he should have stated his objection in writing, the Senate should then have resumed, and the matter should have been laid before the President. The point 1 raise is that as that was not done the proceedings are irregular, and I am desirous now of seeing the President in the chair, to ascertain from him, as he knows the procedure under these standing orders of South Australia so well, whether we are conducting our business as it should be conducted. :, </para>

                        <para>- Clearly the vote of the Chairman was contrary to the Constitution Act. The question now is whether sufficient time elapsed before <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harney</inline> raised his point of order, to put it beyond his power to call attention to it at all - whether sufficient time has elapsed to make regular what was irregular and clearly contrary to the Constitution Act. It is contrary to the Constitution Act that the  Chairman  of Committees should give a casting vote, but whether his action in doing so was condoned by what took place subsequently to the vote I am not in a position to say. The South Australian standing orders can certainly not control the Constitution Act. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. The intention is not to give him two votes, but that he shall not be deprived of his deliberative vote, lt matters little to me whether he records it early Or late, it is a deliberative vote. After all, what is the point? -It is whether the Chairman should have recorded his vote with the tellers or whether he should have given his vote after they had handed in their, papers. Really it does seem to me that this is the purest splitting of straws. If the Chairman had recorded one more vote than was his right then we might have something to quarrel about. But seeing that it is only a matter of whether he should have recorded his vote a few moments before he did, or whether he was right in doing it as he did, it seems to me altogether beneath our consideration. Honorable senators may say it is a question of principle. It is not a question of principle. </para>

The reason why he is able to sit in the chair, under the standing order, remain and not record a vote, is that he is deprived of his deliberative vote. Here he has got a vote. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. The South Australian standing orders take away his vote, otherwise, if he remained in the chamber he would have to record his vote. Here he is in the chamber with the Constitution giving him a vote whether he is in the chair or whether he is not, and he has to cast it on one side or the other. Whether he should have done so a few moments before he did seems, to my mind, beneath the consideration of the committee. </para>

                <para class="block">I take it that the meaning of that standing order is this : Had we no standing orders, the mere fact of the Chairman being in the chair would not have deprived him of his deliberative vote. But we have adopted the South Australian standing orders, and the effect of those standing orders is that when the Chairman is in the chair he has only the character of vote that arises out of the performance of his functions in the chair, namely, a casting vote. Accordingly, when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> gave his vote On this occasion he must have given it as a casting vote ; otherwise he must have disobeyed the standing orders. He could not have given it as a deliberative vote. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> had stated that he gave his vote as a deliberative vote the only question, as I take it, for you to decide, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,'</inline> is whether he lost his deliberative vote by sitting in the chair. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> had stated in the chair that he gave a deliberative vote, the first and only question for you to decide would be - did he lose his deliberative vote by sitting in the chair? But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> has assumed that he lost his deliberative vote. He has made the declaration that the voting was equal. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> having made that declaration, we must come back to the Constitution. The voting being declared to be equal the question should have been passed in the negative. How are we to know when the votes are equal ? By the declaration of the Chairman and by nothing else. We must take the votes to have been equal ; and the question is, the vote having been equal, was it open to any one under our Constitution to determine the question by a casting vote and not pass it in the negative ? There are two very important' points that arise. The first is - does the Chairman of Committees lose his deliberative vote by virtue of the standing orders ? If he does not lose his deliberative vote, is he bound like every other senator <inline font-style="italic">by</inline> his own declaration that the votes are equal? If he is bound' by his own  declaration  that the votes are equal, can he determine the question in any other manner than that set forth in the Constitution Act, namely, that the question passed in the negative ? </para>

I take it that the principle which will guide you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> in determining the question is ( this - it is clearly intended by the Constitution of this Senate, in which the States are represented, that every State in every division shall be represented by its full number of members if they are present, and that no State shall be deprived of its representation by reason of one of its representatives being in the chair. I take it that that is the  principle which is embodied in section 23 of the Constitution. I take it also that in deciding this matter, you will look at what took place substantially. What took place was this : - The  Chairman  sitting in the chair declared that the votes were equal. He then gave his vote. It must be quite clear to all senators who have had Parliamentary experience that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best's</inline> vote was a deliberative vote. </para>

                    <para>- The parliamentary rule is that when a Chairman gives a casting vote, it is to be given so that the matter under discussion may be again discussed. I therefore contend that the Chairman gave a deliberative vote, because he gave his vote with the ayes. But whether he did that or not he gave a vote which carried the question in the affirmative. To my mind that shows that he gave a deliberative vote. Then comes the question in regard to the standing orders. I submit that those standing orders are applicable only in so far as they do not conflict with the Constitution, and that it would be inconsistent with the Constitution to put the Chairman in such a position that he would be deprived of his vote, and that consequently the State he represents would be deprived of a vote. There is no portion of the. standing orders . or of the Constitution which decides at what time that vote is to be given. I submit that although the Chairman waited until the votes were found to be equal, he was in time to give his vote, and therefore that his vote was properly given. For these reasons, I submit that there is nothing in this question of order, and that the vote of the Chairman was properly given. </para>

The contention seems absurd. If I had been voting on the ayes side of the chamber, and had said when the teller came to me that I was giving a casting vote, could it be contended that I could thus have overridden the Constitution, If I was in the Chamber I must have voted.

                <para class="block">That is merely an amplification of a rule that has already been referred to- - that the Speaker having only a casting vote, the question shall be decided in the same manner in committee as in the House itself. There is no question about that. Apart from that the standing orders would prevent the Chairman of Committees from giving his casting vote. The point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> is that Senator Best was actually acting within his rights when he gave his vote with the ayes, and that the vote he gave was a. deliberative vote. I submit that the vote cannot be regarded as a deliberative vote. Lists were prepared by the tellers, and those lists show that fourteen senators voted ' on either side. Whether the  Chairman  voted or not is beside the question. The division lists are not challenged in any way. They are accepted as accurate. After the result of the division was declared, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> said - "The votes being equal, I shall give my casting vote with the ayes." I submit that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> was unable to give that. vote with the ayes, and consequently was unable to give a deliberative vote after the division list had been closed by the tellers and the Chairman had declared the result of the division. </para>

                <para class="block">Does that apply to every committee appointed by the Senate ? If it applies to a committee of the whole, it will also apply to a select committee ;° "because a committee of the whole is in no different position to a select- committee. It is a committee appointed by the Senate. I have grave doubts as to whether that section means that "questions arising in the Senate" shall include " questions arising " in every committee appointed by the Senate. It is contended - or it seems to me to arise from a contention which has been made - that the Chairman of Committees can have no vote at all, because if he did not give a casting vote he could not give a deliberative vote. If our standing order is contradictory of our Constitution, then undoubtedly the Chairman could not have a casting vote but must have a deliberative vote. But he could not exercise his deliberative vote without over-riding the standing orders, because they clearly give the Chairman a casting vote. Of course that brings us back to the same question - are the standing orders in this respect contradictory of the Constitution <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> If that be the case they have no effect. I do not think it makes very much difference whether the  Chairman  said, he voted by giving a casting vote, or a deliberative vote. He gave a vote ; and if under this new procedure any of our standing orders have not been properly fitted into our Constitution, and a mistake such as this is made, I do not think any further notice should be taken of it. My ruling is that the  Chairman  was quite justified in the vote he gave. </para>

                    <para>- It was originally intended to put into this clause the power to make regulations fixing rates of postage, and letters, and other postal matter, and the amendment to which the honorable senator has referred was framed with a view to amending this particular clause in order that the regulation giving that power should be laid on the table of the House, and should not become law until it had been so many days on the table, and then only 'if it had not been disapproved by either House. We have dealt with that now in clause 19 entirely, and having taken the power to fix rates out of this clause 91, the subjects that remain as subjects for regulations are, comparatively speaking, unimportant. . They are of importance, but they may be safely left to the Government, subject to this provision, that the regulations shall be laid on the table of the House. I cannot approve of the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Charleston,</inline> for the reason that it will be necessary in some cases to get these regulations made when Parliament is not sitting. If his amendment were adopted, it would mean that we could not make a regulation or alteration of a regulation with regard to any of these matters during a recess, and no matter how urgent the necessity might be, we should have to wait five or six months or even longer until Parliament met, before we could deal with it. If honorable senators look at it fairly, I feel sure that they will see that the matters remaining to be dealt with by regulation under this clause, although certainly important, are not matters upon which Parliament should be called on to pronounce. </para>

                        <para>- I understand very well, if other senators do not, what the intention of the honorable senator was. The Postmaster-General may now make regulations under which contracts are to be carried out, and surely that is a very important matter, and it is very desirable that Parliament should itself see any such regulation before it has the force of law. I suggest to the committee the desirability of hesitating, because, Western Australian senators will be able to agree with me that, a provision of this kind, which looked quite innocent in the Western Australian Mining Act, brought about a very serious condition of" affairs. If we give the Government power to frame a regulation as to the method of carrying out contracts, it is surely desirable that Parliament should approve of such a regulation before the Minister exercises it with the force of law. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce'</inline> s amendment had not been put into this clause, 1 would fall in with the view expressed by other senators, that the debatable matter had been cut out of the clause. However, that amendment having been made it opens up a very important matter, and it should lie in the hands of Parliament to approve of the regulations dealing with it. </para>

                <para>Such a gallant fight, when no One was going to hurt them, should show a little more consideration for the committee now. All this really means is that the Postmaster-General is to have power to make a regulation under which he will provide for the conditions to be observed in a contract. Is every contract to be made under such a regulation to be put before Parliament ? If the Postmaster-General enters into a contract for the supply of 100 telegraph posts, and puts the condition provided for by the regulation into the contract, is he going to wait for the telegraph posts until Parliament has met and. approved of the matter ? The thing is too ridiculous. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ewing</inline> will allow us to proceed with the rest of the Bill it will be better for us. </para>

Though put rather strongly by the last speaker, this will only deal with the question of rates to be paid to people under contract with the Government, and I take it that it might fairly be left in the hands of the Postmaster-General to frame the necessary regulation. He can act upon it unless Parliament exercises its right to dissent from whatever may be done when the regulation is subsequently laid before us. Parliament will have an opportunity later to deal with "the matter if it is found that anything unfair is prescribed under the regulation adopted. I think it would be much better under the circumstances to leave the clause as it stands. </para>

                    <para>- First of all, with regard to the limit, I wish to say that I do not like the idea of fines at all. I do not like having the power or having to exercise the power; but I point out that this provision as. it stands, allowing the Governor-General to fix a scale of fines, which may, perhaps, be higher than the limit suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Frederick</inline> Sargood, may really be a merciful provision in many cases. There may be cases, for instance, in which a man may be guilty of some neglect of duty or fault for which it is absolutely necessary to inflict some substantial penalty. He may be punished by being reduced in position, and that may involve a considerable monetary loss. A man may be reduced in position so that he may lose <inline font-style="italic">£10</inline> a year in salary, and it is easily seen that it is much more merciful to fine him £10 than to reduce him to a position in which he would suffer such a loss. The difficulty is that if we limit the fine to <inline font-style="italic">£5</inline> that amount may be manifestly inadequate as a punishment for some offences, and allowing a higher scale of fines may really prove to be a merciful provision. A case has recently come under my notice in the State of Victoria where it is necessary to inflict a very severe penalty. If the regulation provided only for a fine of <inline font-style="italic">£5,</inline> that would be entirely inadequate.. As such cases do arise, it would be better to have the power to inflict an adequate fine. </para>

                    SARGOOD (Victoria). - The Postmaster-General apparently does not see the difficulty that, if this clause is passed, it will apply to a special class of public servants. The Public Service Bill, fixes the fines in the case of officers of all other departments. I take it that the public service should be treated in this matter as a whole, and no one department should be singled out for special treatment.

                    <para>- I do not think there is any necessity for postponing the clause. I can speak with some little experience, because I happened to be an employe in the postal service of Queensland for some little time. While every effort is being made by postal servants - for instance, by letter carriers, of whom I happened to be one - yet several faults are committed, certain mistakes are made, and errors occur, for which employes are entitled to be punished, and are punished. As the result of my experience and observation in the department for many years, I think this is a safe and wise provision to leave in the hands of the Postmaster-General. I have never known any cruel act to be done by officials, but on many occasions, had there been such a provision in force, unquestionably the person involved would have suffered considerably more if he had been tried in other ways. Therefore, I would suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Frederick</inline> Sargood not to press this point, but to leave the clause us it is. I think it is a perfectly safe one, and I am quite sure that it. will be exercised in the Commonwealth, as it has been exercised in Queensland for many years, with every consideration, and certainly with humanity sometimes. </para>
