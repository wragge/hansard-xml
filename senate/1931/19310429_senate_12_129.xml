            <para>- In answer to the honorable senator&#39;s question, which has been submitted without notice, I have to - say that, so far as I know at present, without consulting authorities, which I should like to have consulted, each chamber acts independently. I have no official knowledge of the exclusion of any pressman from the precincts, not of Parliament, but of the House of Representatives, nor have I been consulted in the matter. I do not know the circumstances, nor what has given rise to the action taken by the  Speaker.  I have . merely seen a short statement in the press which conveyed very little information as to where the offence occurred, or as to how Parliament became implicated. So far as I am concerned, there is no embargo in force which would prevent any member of the press from entering the precincts of the Senate. </para>

            <para>- I am now in a position to inform the honorable senator that an investigation has been made into the matter. The records available indicate that the origin, of the printed diagram in question dates back to 1908, when the then Prime Minister approved of the issue of instructions regarding the Australian flag on lines suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilson</inline> Dobbs, of Toorak, Melbourne. The papers on the subject contain a copy of a letter to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilson</inline> Dobbs, dated the 12th June, 1908, signed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Atlee</inline> Hunt, Secretary, Department of External Affairs, to that effect. In order that the diagram may be revised, where necessary, to conform exactly to the approved design, it has been found necessary to communicate with the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, London, with a view to detailed . measurements being obtained. In the meantime, the printed information concerning the flag, for which there has been little demand, will be withheld from issue. </para>

        <para class="block">As this is largely a technical measure, I shall confine my brief statement to the actual facts. While honorable senators will, I feel sure, deplore the circumstances which have compelled the introduction of this measure, I am confident that they will approve the principle that our assets shall always be made available for the payment of our obligations. The position is as follows: - At the end of this financial year the Commonwealth has to meet commitments in London amounting to &#163;5,000,000. The Governmenthas been advised that it cannot get accommodation for this amount. Accordingly, payment has to be made in gold. The alternative, to default, is unthinkable. The proposed new section 7e authorizes the Commonwealth Bank to make available the necessary gold from the gold reserve held.&#39; by tha t institution. It is true that there will be a serious depletion of the gold reserve on which our currency is based. I do not propose to discuss that aspect &#39;of the matter. To my mind, such a discussion would !be futile. It were otherwise if we had not this &#39;compelling obligation which we have only one means of meeting. </para>
        <para>I turn now to the clauses which are consequential on the one to which <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> have just referred. Clause &#39;6 fixes a limit of &#163;60,000,000 as a maximum note issue. That is, in round figures, the amount for which notes could be issued on. our present gold &#39;holding. With a diminution of &#163;5,000,000 in our present gold reserve it would, under the existing provisions of the act, be necessary to reduce the existing note issue of &#163;46,000,000 to &#163;40,000,000. If, in the future, we were compelled to send abroad another &#163;5,000,000 worth of gold, the note issue would have to be curtailed by another &#163;20,000,000. Therefore, it is necessary to amend the act in this respect or suffer a disastrous deflation. The other clause to which I desire to refer is clause 4, which, in effect, prohibits stipulations in contracts that the obligations payable under the contracts shall be calculated with reference to the rate of exchange ruling at the time of payment. Provisions of this nature have received considerable attention of late as witness the recent articles in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Law Journal</inline> of the 15th February, 15th March, and 15th April, setting out suitable forms and precedents. I direct attention to those articles in order that honorable senators may have an opportunity of studying them &#39;before the debate on this bill is resumed. Such clauses in contracts are really a device to defeat the provision of the act that Australian notes shall be legal tender, and would, if sufficiently wide spread be- a menace to our currency. Apart from the fact that the clause is necessary to protect the currency, it is, in my opinion, generally beneficial. The debtor is always in an adverse position in arranging accommodation, and he should have reasonable protection. Provision can be made to meet definite obligations, but a state of affairs in which all debts were indefinite in amount and unascertainable prior to the date of payment, would tend towards astate of chaos in commercial life. The remaining clauses provide for amendments consequential upon the alterations already outlined. In conclusion, I refer honorable senators to the second interim report of the Gold Delegation of the League of Nations. They will find it stated there that shipments of . gold from one country to another are not desirable - that. short term accommodation is preferable - but that in the last resource, when accommodation is not obtainable, gold from the. gold reserve of the central bank must be sent abroad, and that the purpose of the gold is not for use as -internal currency but for theadjustment of external obligations. </para>
        <para>I commend the measure to the earnest consideration of honorable senators who, I know, realize the serious state of this country&#39;s finances. I feel confident that no honorable senator desires to embarrass the Government to such an extent as to cause it to make default. In the interval that will elapse before the resumption of the debate on this measure, I trust that honorable senators will consider its effect on the finances and the honour of this country. I confidently leave the measure in their hands. </para>

            <para>-  I rise to a point of order. Is it competent under our Standing Orders for a conference to take place excepting during a suspension of the sittings of the Senate ? The Standing Orders provide that the business of the Senate must be suspended during the time that a conference is sitting. I take it that that connotes that the Senate must be in session while the conference is taking place. The position is somewhat anomalous. I do not wish to embarrass the Government; but we ought to be in order in the procedure we adopt. </para>

          <para>- It is unusual for a conference - and I have seen many - to sit when the Senate has adjourned, but I do not think that there is anything in the Standing Orders to forbid it, or even to imply, that a conference may not take place when the Senate has adjourned. The difference between a suspension of a sitting of the Senate and an adjournment of the Senate is so slight that, in interpreting the Standing Orders as I think they ought to be interpreted, namely, that the underlying principle is that they shall express common sense, there cannot be any objection to the course proposed. I admit that the course outlined by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> is the one usually followed, the reason being that conferences generally occur towards the end of the session, and are frequently accompanied by late sittings. In cases of that kind, when time is the essence of the contract, the invariable practice is for both Houses to suspend their sittings while the conference proceeds. Following the conference, a report is made, generally somewhat hurriedly, to each House, and an agreement or a disagreement arrived at. There will be no difficulty in conforming even with the letter of the Standing Order, let alone the spirit of it, if the motion is adopted in as much as the Senatemay meet at 8 o&#39;clock and then suspend its sittings until the report of the conference is to hand. I do not think that the motion is out of order. </para>

I suggest that in the event of the Senate concluding its business before 8 o&#39;clock to-night, I shall then leave the chair until 8 o&#39;clock, at which hour the Senate may then formally meet, and the conference managers depart. It will, however, be necessary for honorable senators to be prepared to re-assemble when the managers are in a position to report to the Senate. There is no need to question further the correctness or otherwise of the procedure, because it will be quite regular if the suggestion I have made is carried out. </para>

        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir GEORGE</inline>PEARCE (Western Australia) &#91;3.34&#93;. - I am glad to have the opportunity to say a few words on this important subject, which affects not only the sugar industry but also the consumers of sugar throughout Australia. I do not intend to deal in detail with the two reports of the commission, but I wish first of all to direct attention to the peculiar character of the commission itself. I think it was almost unique in its composition in that with, I think, one or possibly two exceptions, every member cf the commission was personally interested in one aspect or another of the industry. From that viewpoint it certainly could not be said that it was an impartial inquiry into the sugar industry. From this commission have emerged two reports. I have read both, hut cannot say that I have derived very much comfort from either. It seems to me that from the viewpoint of the consumer it is a matter of choosing whether to be boiled or fried. Consumers can derive very little comfort from either report. What strikes me particularly is that neither of the reports seems to have got to the kernel of the position; neither appears to have got down to that centre of the problem which has vexed every Parliament that has dealt with the sugar industry. I shall show presently what I mean by that assertion. </para>
      <para>The sugar embargo has a history concerning which, I suppose, I know as much as do most honorable senators. First of all, it has to be remembered that it was a war measure. It was originally imposed during the war and for war purposes. It may seem rather a fanciful idea that an embargo on importations of sugar was imposed for war purposes, but when one considers the ramifications of modern warfare, the extent to which it affects the whole structure of society, and that extraordinary steps have to be taken in uniting a nation&#39;s war activities, one realizes that the action then taken was justified. Many curious embargoes were imposed at that time and some of them, when viewed to-day appear to have been almost ridiculous. It may be interesting to honorable senators to recall that during the war period an embargo was placed on the use of kerosene tins. Future historians will wonder whether this was because we had the Chinese idea of carrying on war by kicking up a terrible row and wanted to use kerosene tins for that purpose. The real reason was that kerosene tins were found to he the most useful containers for food supplies to he sent overseas. At that time, the Government therefore, commandeered all the kerosene tins in the country and prevented their export in order to use them for packing oatmeal, tallow and various other commodities for shipment overseas. It has also to be remembered that as a result of the sugar embargo during the war years Australian consumers obtained the cheapest sugar in the world. Of all the countries engaged in the war Australia alone was able to obtain sugar at an extremely low price. When the price of that commodity in European countries and in the United States of America soared to a very high figure, sugar, as a result of the embargo and the conditions imposed, was sold in Australia at prewar prices. </para>
      <para>I now come to the position following the termination of the war. This is one of the war embargoes - I believe it is the only one now in operation - which fettered the liberty of the subject and interfered with the life of the people. Every other such embargo has been repealed; this alone remains operative. Why has it continued? I venture to suggest that there is a political and possibly an economic reason. The sugar agreement has been renewed on, two or three occasions since the war. As I was a member of a Government which renewed the sugar embargo, I must, as a member of the Cabinet, which took that action take my share of the responsibility. I am not going to endeavour to offer an excuse for my participation in the action then taken. Honorable senators are aware of the principles under which Cabinets carry on their work. Every member of a Cabinet is personally responsible for every action . taken by Cabinet irrespective of his individual opinion. In the disturbed state in which Australia found itself after the termination of the war several war measures were re-enacted for a time to assist economic rehabilitation. So much for the political side of the question. </para>
      <para>Let us now consider the matter from the economic aspect. The sugar industry of Queensland has come to be associated with the White Australia policy. Here is an industry that is carried on by white men under tropical conditions. One result of that undoubtedly has been to enable a population of white people to be maintained in an area where but for the existence of the industry, such a population probably would not have settled. It is doubtful whether there is any other industry that would be able to maintain itself there under existing conditions. That has been the economic reason for the meting out of especial treatment to the sugar industry. </para>
      <para class="block">It is interesting to remember that it was this question which, in the early years of federation, caused perhaps the greatest amount of fighting in both </para>
      <para class="block">Houses of the Commonwealth Parliament, resulting in splits in the ranks of all political parties, and causing practically a re-alignment of members of the two Houses. I remember the time when the bill for the repatriation of the South Sea Island natives, who had been brought to Queensland to work in the sugar industry, was introduced in the first Commonwealth Parliament, together with a bill to impose a duty on imported sugar, and to pay a bounty on that which was produced in Australia, so as to enable the industry to pass from the stage at which it was carried on largely by cheap, coloured labour, to the stage at which it was to be carried on by white labour. Those two measures caused perhaps more perturbation among political parties than any other measure introduced in those early years, and very nearly caused the defeat of the Government which sponsored them; but they found a place on our statute-book. </para>
      <para>The essential point which I consider has been ignored in both the majority and minority reports of the sugar commission is that there has been an entire change in our economic circumstances. The commission has investigated and reported upon this industry as though our circumstances to-day were identical with those that existed three years ago. No allowance has been made in either report for the complete change that has taken place. </para>
      <para>What is the economic position to-day compared with what it was three years ago? There has been a tremendous fall in Australia&#39;s national income. One factor that differentiates the sugar industry from any of our other industries, and certainly from all of our primary industries, is that, in a sense, it is a parasitic industry because it lives entirely upon the wealth that it derives from other industries in Australia. </para>
      <para>It can be argued, and to an extent successfully, that it may be profitable to pay a certain price to maintain an industry for the purposes of national defence. It could be argued, I believe successfully, that it would be in the interests of Australia to pay a certain price to maintain this garrison of white people in the northern part of Australia. </para>
      <para class="block">But the question that -we have to consider is, what price are we to pay? Are we being called, upon to pay too much? Granting that it is essential or advisable from the point of view of defence and of keeping inviolable our White Australia policy, surely we must have regard to the extent of the income from which the payment is to be made. Three years ago, when the national income of Australia was &#163;120,000,000 more than it is to-day, we were prepared to pay a certain price for the: maintenance of this industry. Surely it is obvious to the meanest intellect that when your income has fallen by &#163;120,000,000, you cannot afford to pay the price that was paid when your income was that much greater. If that argument is sound, this inquiry ought to have been directed towards ascertaining the reduction that should be made in the industry, having regard to the fall that has taken place in our national income, and the advisability of retaining the industry for defence purposes, and the maintenance of our White Australia policy. It is begging the question merely to take the <inline font-style="italic">status quo</inline> and to proceed to ascertain the minimum price at which sugar can be sold retail on the assumption that the grower is to receive so much, the refiner so much, the manufacturer so much, and the retailer and wholesaler so much. The real question is, what price can Australia afford to pay? Having arrived at such a price, all other factors in the industry must be made to conform to it. Had that been done, it appears to me that the inquiry would have. been worth while. The whole of the community, as a result of the fall that has taken place in our national income, has willy-nilly had to accept a general reduction of profits, wages and salaries. What inalienable right has this industry to say &#34; Although the consumers upon whom we live have had to accept a reduction, our income must remain the same? They have had to come down from the level of 1929 to that of 1931; but we, the sugar producers of Australia, are to be maintained at the 1929 level for another five years &#34; ? </para>

          <para>- There is no natural justice in such an attitude. Therefore, I say that the inquiry should have been directed towards ascertaining the amount of reduction that everybody engaged in this industry must accept so as to be brought down to the level of all other sections of the community. I&#39; agree that it is unthinkable that action could or should be taken which at one stroke or even over a series of years would have the effect of wiping out this industry. I am not <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> favour of such a policy, and would not support it; but I am in favour of this industry having to share with every other section of the community the hard times through which we are passing. The position of those who are engaged in every branch of this industry must and should be brought within reasonable comparison of those who are engaged in other industries on which it lives. Consequently, I am not in favour of a continuance of the embargo. I say that the time has passed when that procedure should be adopted in regard to this industry, and that in common with all other industries any protection afforded to it should be on a tariff  basis.  What reason is there for its not being placed on a tariff basis? I grant that there are reasonable grounds for argument with respect to the amount of tariff protection that should be given. But I cannot see any reason why the protection must necessarily be on the basis of an absolute shutting out of all competition under the operation of an embargo. This industry would be far healthier if its operations were conducted on the basis of a protective duty instead of on the basis of an embargo. I believe that the embargo, by its very nature, is bringing about the danger of over production. This industry is one of those which, by reason of their peculiarities, cannot compete in the world&#39;s markets unless they receive subsidies in the home market. Because of the embargo and the high wage standard fixed for1 every person engaged in the sugar industry, more and more have been attracted to it until at last artificial means of restricting production, the acreage under cultivation and the number employed in the industry have had to be applied. This has been brought about by the removal of all possibility of competition. The duty would necessarily need to be high, but only of such a character as to give the sugar industry a market conditional upon the application to it of the standard of living applying in such other primary industries as farming, grazing and dairying. If that were done, it would mean a reduction of from 15 per cent, to 25 per cent, in the production costs standard of the sugar industry. I have had an opportunity to make inquiries into the standard of living enjoyed by persons engaged in dairying and maize-growing on the Atherton Tableland. Compare the wages the maize-growers and dairymen on that tableland can afford to pay with those which are earned in the coastal area of Cairns, 30 or 40 miles away. It is all a matter of altitude. On the tableland the standard is a hard one; no luxuries are enjoyed. </para>

      </interjection>
      <para>It is argued by those who are anxious to continue the embargo that no protective duty would be workable because of the violent fluctuations in the world&#39;s price of sugar; but that difficulty could be overcome by following the example of other countries and fixing the duty on a sliding scale according to the rise or fall of world&#39;s prices. I am prepared to accept such a duty provided the sugar industry comes down to the standard to which other primary industries in Australia have had to come down. </para>
      <para>Another serious objection I take to this proposal is that the agreement is to be perpetuated for a further term of five years. I am against the ratification of the agreement at all in the terms  suggested,  but if it is to be renewed it should not be renewed for a longer term than three years. The system of embargoes which operates under our customs tariff is perhaps the worst example we have of the failure of Parliament to control the legislation of the country. If a duty is imposed, Parliament retains some control, and in cases in which the Minister for Trade and Customs may act by regulation, Parliament retains some control; but in the case of embargoes, Parliament has parted with its control absolutely. No embargo comes before us for ratification, and this particular embargo only happens to be before us because it is associated with an agreement. I understand that the High Court has laid it down that the Government cannot enter into an agreement on behalf of the Commonwealth unless it is ratified by Parliament. </para>

          <para>- That was done by Parliament, and approved by the people at a referendum. There is a very sound reason why a threeyears term should be substituted for the five-years term provided for in this sugar  agreement. If the period is fixed at five years, the next Parliament will have no voice in the matter. What right have we to deprive the people of the right to vary the sugar policy? We might just as well arrogate to ourselves the right to fix the tariff for a certain period, and prevent the new Parliament which is to be elected within the next twelve mouths from having any say in the matter. The only opportunity this Parliament has to register its opinion on the sugar policy is in connexion with this embargo. It enables us to say that all future embargoes must be submitted to Parliament for ratification. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> has suggested that the Customs Act should be amended to provide that all embargoes must be laid on the table in the same way as regulations are, to give either House an opportunity to disallow them. I do not know exactly how it can be achieved, but it seems to me that Parliament, in its own interests, and in the interests of the electors should register some opinion to prevent this particular agreement from being made for five years. It should be limited to three years so. that after the next election, after the people have had an opportunity to express an opinion, the next Parliament will be able to have some voice in the matter of the sugar policy of this country. </para>

      <para>I am not going into the ramifications of the reports submitted by the committee. It seems to me that they have missed the kernel of the question. It seems to me also that opportunity should be taken, at this stage, to bring the industry into line with others, and take away any suggestion that it is a privileged industry. Those who are engaged in it should be compelled to conform to the conditions of all other industries in the community on whom they depend for their existence. I am prepared to support any motion to register my opinion on the two points - that the time has arrived when this embargo should cease, and the sugar industry should be dealt with by means of a protective tariff on lines applied to every other industry; and that if the embargo is to remain it should not remain for a greater period than three years. </para>

I had read the reply to which I am now referred, but because I regarded it as absolutely evasive, I submitted the simple question to-day asking whether there was, or was not, any correspondence on the point between the Government and the Commonwealth Bank. The reply given by the Prime Minister was to a question asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Latham,</inline> the Leader of the Opposition in another place, on the same lines as mine.

        <para class="block">Like myself, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Latham</inline> wished to know whether or not there was any such correspondence, and the reply to which I am to-day referred was given in answer to that simple and direct question. Surely, on a subject of such great importance to the wheat-farmers of Australia, it is not too much to ask that the people should be told whether there was correspondence on the matter, or whether the whole transaction was arranged by word of mouth. That is all that I wish to know. At any rate, the reply given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scullin,</inline> to which I have been referred, was as follows :  - </para>

          <para>Representations were made personally by me to the  Chairman  of the Commonwealth Bank Board, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Gibson, in Melbourne.

The details were to be drawn up later in a formal agreement between the central authority of the Wheat Board and the Commonwealth Bank. </para>

I should like him also to tell us what reason the Government has for evading so simple a question. From the manner in which the issue has been continually evaded, both in the past and now, it seems to me that the Government must have something to conceal. I am justified in assuming that there was correspondence which, I suggest, would prove that the Commonwealth Bank had made no definite promise.

            <para>- Of course it would have been, because the amount involved was about &#163;20,000,000. The conditions would have to be approved by the banks, and also by the six State Governments of Australia, because the Wheat Marketing Bill provided that the wheat-growing States should be called upon to bear one-half of any loss that might be incurred by reason of the guarantee. I take it, therefore, that before accepting any such obligation, the State Governments would have to be advised more fully than was possible at the conference. My point is that the Commonwealth Bank would not, without some understanding with the other banks, undertake the responsibility of financing the pool, and the State Governments concerned would have to be quite satisfied as to the details of the proposal before their . guarantee could be given or accepted. The bill required heavy payments from Western Australia, which has a big wheat production per head of population, but practically no payment from the rich State of Queensland, which has been so much favoured in other ways by Commonwealth legislation. &#34;We are justified in believing that certain conditions were attached to any promise that might have been given by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Gibson, because later, when the Government passed a bill, under . which farmers were to be paid 3s. a bushel for their wheat, the act was not put into operation, the Commonwealth Bank not being prepared to finance the scheme. . In all the circumstances, I am convinced that the evasive replies given in this chamber arc simply part of a gigantic bluff which the Labour party has been endeavouring to put over the wheat-farmers of Australia, with regard to the Government&#39;s unfulfilled promises to pay them a guaranteed price. </para>
