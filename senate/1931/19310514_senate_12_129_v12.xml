          <para class="block">I am pleased that my colleague from Western Australia has submitted his amendment in a form which affirms the important principle of the supremacy of Parliament over the executive. We should get back to basic principles in government. We must insist on the unquestioned control of the executive by Parliament, so as to prevent the continuance of the present autocratic methods of this Government, which refuses to consult Parliament concerning matters of the gravest moment to the people of Australia. The Government in this, as in other matters, is showing clearly that it wishes to govern in absolute defiance of the Parliament. Only two days ago the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin),</inline> in another place said that it would go on making regulations under the Transport Workers' Act in defiance of the Senate. </para>

              <para>- No one can doubt that the real intention of the Government is to defy this branch of the legislature. That attitude is unworthy of the Prime Minister, and the leader of any democratic party. The manipulation of regulations behind the back of Parliament in this and other matters, represents a form of political control which should not be countenanced.

              <para>- I contend that, in the discussion on this subject I am entitled to touch upon a certain part of the Government's policy, which came before the High Court quite recently in respect of which the attitude of the Senate was upheld. It is significant that, although the renewal of the sugar embargo was announced as part of the Government's policy, the Ministry nevertheless in December last appointed a committee to inquire into the whole subject. Since there had been a prior announcement of the Government's policy to renew the sugar agreement, the appointment of the commission was a needless waste of time and money, particularly in view of the fact that the constitution of the commission clearly indicated the lines which its ' recommendations would follow. Nevertheless, I believe that even the people engaged in the sugar industry expected the commission to pay some regard to the altered economic circumstances of the Commonwealth, and that to that end it would suggest a reduction of at least Id. per lb. in the price of the commodity to the Australian consumers. </para>

          </continue><para>On the 2nd July, 1930, I asked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly,</inline> who was then the Leader of the Government in the Senate, if it was a fact that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company had made a disclosed profit of £910,S29 during the year ended 31st March, 1930? To that the honorable gentleman replied in the affirmative. Then I asked if it was a fact that the wholesale price of sugar in Australia had been fixed at £37 6s. 3d. per ton, and the retail price at 4$d. per lb. in the State capitals. Again the reply was in the affirmative. Thereupon I asked was it a fact that Australian sugar was exported, and sold at from £9 to £11 a ton in Great Britain and New Zealand ? To that question the honorable senator replied that Australia did not export sugar to New Zealand, and that, on account of the abnormally low world prices, our exports to Great Britain had been giving a net return of from £9 to-  £11 per ton. I then asked about the embargo, and was informed that it would expire on the 31st August, 1931* Then I asked the Minister if, in view of the necessity to reduce the cost of living in the Commonwealth, Parliament would be consulted before the embargo was renewed which enabled the Colonial Sugar Refining Company to make a profit of nearly £1,000,000 per annum at the expense of the Australian householder. To this <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> replied  that part of the Government's policy, on which it was elected, provided for the renewal of the sugar embargo. From this reply honorable senators will see that, as far back as July last, the Government intended to renew the embargo. But the appointment of the committee was made as a result of protests from all parts of Australia. </para><interjection>

I have studied both reports very carefully. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly,</inline> in a further reply to my question, said that previous Ministries had not submitted the terms of renewals of the sugar agreement to Parliament, but that the Government would give every consideration to the reasonable interests of Australian householders, and all others concerned. The measure of reasonable consideration may be judged  from the fact that the present wholesale price in Australia is £37 6s. Sd. per ton, and the agreement has been renewed for a period of five years. Previous governments fixed the term at three years, but this Government has extended the term to five years. </para>

          </list><para class="block">It will thus be seen that the Department, upon further inquiry, could not in any way substantiate the statement it had previously made, that nearly half of the profits of the company were derived outside Australia. I venture to affirm that the reason for the altered form in which the balance-sheet was presented was that, owing to the low prices prevailing for sugar outside of Australia, the operations of the company in other places were probably being carried on at a loss, and that the whole of the profits disclosed were made in Australia. At all events, we have as much justification for assuming that that was the case as for accepting the Minister's statement, seeing that upon further inquiry the department abandoned that statement and admitted that it had no information or knowledge on the subject. It is open to the company to publish a clearer balance-sheet. </para><para>Six months after the declaration of the Government that it intended to renew the sugar embargo, and that it did not propose to consult Parliament in the matter, because a previous government had been guilty of the offence of withholding the agreement from Parliament, it appointed a committee to inquire into the sugar industry. The Tariff Board is a tribunal that has been set up by Parliament to make inquiries of this nature, and it might reasonably have been expected that the Government would delegate this duty to it. But, instead of appointing such an unbiased tribunal, the Government appointed eight gentlemen, the majority of whom are fairly deeply interested in the sugar industry. They were: The Honorable John Gunn, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. F.</inline> C. Curlewis, of the Australian Sugar Producers Association; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. C.</inline> G. Fallon, a representative of the employees in the sugar industry; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. 0.</inline> J. Matthews, a representative of Australian manufacturers in connexion with whose products sugar is a raw material; <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Morgan, Mr. W.</inline> J. Short,  chairman  of the Queensland Cane-growers Council; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Townsend,</inline> an officer of the Trade and Customs Department, whose ministerial head had announced that the embargo would be renewed, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Young,</inline> who was said to be a representative of Australian fruit-growers, but whose interest in fruit-growing is largely concerned with the canned fruits industry. At the time, exception was quite properly and reasonably taken by Tasmanian and other fruit-growing districts, which rely on fruit for export and jam-making, to the appointment as the representative of Australian fruit-growers of a person who was mainly a representative of the fruit canners. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Young</inline> is a citizen of excellent repute; but it is not surprising that ' he should have paid chief regard to the interests of the fruit-canners. So much was  that the case that he joined with those whose interests are connected with the sugar industry, on the condition that the industry which he represented obtained a fair share of the plunder which was to be extracted from the pockets of the people by the renewal of the agreement and the embargo. The majority report of the committee contains the following remarkable recommendation : - </para><quote>
            <para>That the provision in the present agreement for the special price payable by manufacturers engaged in processing of all fruit products for home consumption, and the provision for the rebate on the sugar content of fruit products exported, be eliminated, and, in lieu thereof, a clause be inserted providing that a sum of £315.000 per annum be made available by the sugar industry for the assistance of the fruit industry, as set out in par. 298 of this report. This provision to be subject to review, as in the case of the rest of the sugar agreement, at the end of the three-year period mentioned in recommendation 2 hereof. </para>
          </quote><para class="block">It appears that in the existing agreement concessions in regard to the price of sugar have been given to the fruitcanning and other kindred industries to the value of £205,000 a year. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Young</inline> supported the majority in saying that the embargo and the present high price for sugar should continue, provided a sum of £315,000 a year was paid for the relief of the industry which he directly represented. In other words, having secured an additional £110,000 a year and the whole amount of £315,000 in hard cash instead of in rebates, he agreed to support the embargo. Apparently, he did not care how much the householders or those engaged in the manufacture of confectionery and home-made jam or any other kindred industries suffered in consequence of the high price of sugar so long as the interests he chiefly represented - the canning industry - could get its share, and having got it, was prepared to assist in plundering the whole community.

While table sugar is sold at £37 6s. 8d. a ton, the average Australian price last year, after allowing for the concession on sugar used by fruit canners, was £36 lis. lOd. a ton as against the world's parity which for the same year has been estimated a* £11 ls. On an Australian consumption of 300,000 tons yearly Australian consumers of sugar pay £25 a ton more than the price at which it could be imported, which represents £7,500,000 above world's parity. The committee states that the additional cost is £5,500,000. </para>

Honorable senators will see that in 1912-13, when there was a duty of only £6 a ton on sugar, 27,380 white persons and 1,383 coloured persons, a total of 28,763, were employed in the industry. To-day it employs only 29,999 persons. Notwithstanding the embargo, there has been practically no increase in the number of the white employees in the industry. Since 1906-7 there has been a decline of nearly 12,000 in the number of white employees. </para><para>In his able defence of the sugar monopoly yesterday, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford</inline> said that those who wished to get a knowledge of the sugar industry should visit Queensland. About three years ago I paid a very brief visit to the sugar-growing districts of North Queensland. Wherever I went I heard complaints from all classes of the community against the restrictions imposed on the industry, mainly by the State Government. It was then the cane-cutting season. I met a number of men who were cutting cane under contract, and paid by the ton. They said that they were not permitted to work in the hours that they desired. They complained particularly t&amp;at they were not permitted to start work at 5 o'clock when, owing to climatic con- ditions, they could obtain the best results from their efforts. They complained that they were too strictly regulated by the Government. We also met a number of farmers who wished to grow sugar cane but were not permitted to do so. There is a body which grants permits to settlers to grow sugar cane on a specified number of acres. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford</inline> said yesterday that land suitable for sugar-growing was obtainable in Queensland at low prices. It is not so much the nature of the land as the obtaining of the permit to grow sugar cane that is of value. In the northern districts of Queensland there is some of the best sugar-growing country in the world. The cane grown there has a high sugar content, and it matures in one year. But before a man can engage in the business of cane-growing he must obtain a permit to do so; otherwise the mills will not take the cane from him, excepting in rare instances when there is a failure of the crop. I was shown some magnificent country near Babinda which was obtainable at reasonable prices. That was because a permit could not be obtained to grow sugar cane on it. Adjacent land which had been granted a permit was valued at £100 an acre. The. Munro estate, near Cairns, was valued at £100 per acre because it had permits for large areas of cane. New settlers wishing to take up land for sugar cane cultivation are frequently informed that they had better go in for dairying. </para><interjection>

We pay £4,000,000 annually to subsidize the production of sugar which might be imported for £6,000,000. It is clear that sugar might be imported by the Government and sold for the same price as at present, so that prices would not bo changed from' the present level; but the Government would have £4,000,000 in hand to subsidize other production to take the place of the £10,000,000 of sugar production. </para>

It is no defence for Ministers to say that a similarly objectionable course was taken by some other government years ago. </para><para>I should like to contrast the positions of the sugar producers with that of other primary producers of Australia, particularly those engaged in growing wheat - the people who are doing the greatest possible service to the country in the direction of providing employment for returns which are at present less than the cost of production. The present Governmentwill not tax flour at £7 4s. a ton in order to provide for a bounty of 6d. a bushel to the wheat-grower; it will not tax the people's bread, to give effect to the 3s. guarantee approved by this Parliament as assistance to the wheat-growers ; but it is quite prepared to tax sugar and double its price, and to tax tea and clothing to the heaviest extent. From 1905 to 1914, the average price of.'  wheat  in Melbourne was 3s. 10ld. a bushel, and at the same time the average price of sugar was ?21 12s. 8d. per ton. It thus took 111 bushels of wheat to buy a ton of sugar during that period. From 1925 to 1929, the average price of wheat in Melbourne was 5s. 6-Jd. a bushel, and the average price of sugar was ?38 18s. 4d. a ton. It thus took 140 bushels of wheat to buy a ton of sugar during that period. In March of this year the price of wheat was 2s. 4d. a bushel, and the price of sugar in Melbourne was ?38 17s. lOd. a ton. It then took 333 bushels of wheat to buy one ton of sugar. In "Western Australia, however, the man who buys sugar in small quantities has to pay 11 per cent, more than the Melbourne price. It thus takes 374 bushels of wheat now to buy a ton  of sugar there, compared with 111 bushels between 1905 and 1914. </para><para>The embargo on sugar has been obtained by the political pull of Queensland on successive Commonwealth Governments, and without any direct vote of Parliament or legislative  sanction. Furthermore, it has been continued in direct opposition to the recommendation of a tribunal appointed by Parliament to guide it in matters relating to the tariff.

With this the board entirely agrees, but it must point out when that inquiry was made the industry was being maintained by white labour against outside competition, and yet the commission, with one exception, recommended a duty of ?0 10s. per ton.

It pointed out that the existing duty on sugar was £6 a ton in the case of sugar the produce of sugar cane and £10 a ton on sugar n.e.i., and then recommended that the import duties on cane sugar be fixed at1d. a lb., and on beet sugar at l1/2d. a lb.

This professor, in his summary, says - </para><quote>
            <para>It is for the interests of the masses of the people that sugar should be admitted free of duty, or, if subject to duty, that the rate should be low. The Government, however, needs revenue and, because of the enormous public debt, the need at the present time is pressing. To obtain revenue the people must be taxed. If it be assumed that the tariff is to serve in the future as in the past the double purpose of protection and revenue, sugar admirably adapts itself to this double purpose. Its revenue-yielding capacity is very great; for many years about one-fourth of the entire customs receipts have been derived from sugar; while the burden which the sugar duty, in its protective capacity, imposes upon the people, though great in the aggregate, is widely diffused and comparatively light upon any individual consumer. </para>

I estimate 25s. per head per annum as the taxpayers' contribution to the sugar industry. It must also be remembered that the whole of this amount goes into the pockets of the sugar producers. The Treasury gets nothing. The United States of America is regarded as one of the most highly protected countries in the world. It obtains, in round figures, according to this work, no less than one quarter of its entire customs receipts from sugar, the duty on which is less than Id. per lb. </para><para>The burden of the present embargo and the agreement is one which the people of Australia should not be expected to carry. If, however, it is to be continued, the very least the Senate can do is to insist that this heavy taxation shall be imposed only with the approval of Parliament. Everything should be done in the open. Both branches of the legislature should be consulted. All members of another place and of this chamber should be prepared to take their full share of responsibility in connexion with such matters. No executive should be allowed to place this burden upon the people of Australia. The action of this Government in renewing the agreement for a further period of five years is, in my opinion, nothing short of monstrous. Parliament has been entirely ignored. It appears that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company is to be permitted to continue to exploit the people to the extent of nearly £1,000,000 a year. Consumers in this country will be compelled to pay for their sugar, double the price charged to consumers in New Zealand. I have much pleasure in supporting the amendment, particularly on the ground that the object is to ensure to Parliament complete control over the taxation of the people. </para></speech><speech>

            <para>. - Although the discussion on the motion and the amendment will probably be futile, it is, I think, desirable that I should place before the Senate the views of my own State concerning the sugar agreement and the embargo. Yesterday, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford</inline> stated the case for the sugar interests. I remind him that other interests are involved. It is regrettable that, up to the present, little consideration has been given to the interests of the domestic consumers. The majority and minority reports of the committee are just what one would have expected from the committee, having regard to its personnel. It consisted of members representing conflicting interests. It. was, therefore, obvious that we should be presented with majority and minority reports reflecting the views of the conflicting interests concerned. Naturally, the majority* report of the representatives of the sugar industry favours a continuance of the existing arrangements, and the existing price. The minority report, submitted by representatives of the consumers, and including the Director of Development, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gunn,</inline> while agreeing, in the main, with the recommendations contained in the majority report, urges a reduction in price to the Australian consumer. Because of the personnel of the committee, the investigation carried out by it was almost farcical, and, I may add, very costly. To have been of any value, the committee should have consisted of, say, three independent disinterested persons. We might then have obtained something of value. Neither report contains very much that is new. Although the price of meat, bread, and clothing, rents and practically everything else in the Commonwealth has been trending downwards for some time, the price of sugar, it appears, is to be sacrosanct. The price of sugar must be static; - subject to no fluctuations. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Since the .Government has renewed the agreement for a further period of five years, apparently the sugar industry will wax fatter than ever at the' expense of the rest of the community. Representatives of the sugar interests raise their hands in horror at every suggested criticism of the benefits which they have received from this and previous governments. One hardly has the temerity to voice any objection to what has been done to encourage the sugar-growers in Queensland. But I remind the Senate that there are always two points of view to every question. Personally, I have the highest regard for Queensland and its people. For four and a half years I was associated with a Queensland battalion during the war, and I have had the privilege since then to visit Queensland and obtain first-hand information of the sugar industry from Mackay to Cairns. </para>
          <para>In the discussion of this agreement and the embargo, I am endeavouring to bring to bear a mind entirely free from bias - to study the question from every angle. The renewal of the agreement means that the high cost of sugar is to be maintained. The sugar interests are well dug in. Honorable senators will recall the extraordinarily clever and very costly propaganda with which they were inundated during the last twelve months. The nature of that propaganda suggested that the sugar industry was not a struggling one; but that, on the contrary, those interested in it have a rich prize which, up to the present, they have defended with extraordinary skill. Some of the propaganda was well thought out and most artistic. It certainly was most effective. </para>

It is laid down, however, that the assistance shall be given by the clumsy method of subsidizing jammaking and fruit-processing through a committee to be set up. </para>
          <para>The firm of Henry Jones and Company Limited, Tasmania, is, I suppose, one of the best known jam manufacturing firms in the British Empire. It practically pioneered the export overseas of fresh, pulped, and manufactured fruit, and the State owes it a debt of considerable magnitude. The name of Henry Jones should be revered in Tasmania. I wrote to that firm asking for its opinion of this suggestion in the majority report of the committee, that the sugar industry should annually make available the sum of £315,000 for the subsidizing of jammaking and fruit-processing. The reply that I have received reads as follows: - </para>
          <para class="block">Sugar Board. </para>
          <para class="block">Dear <inline font-weight="bold">Sir,</inline></para>
          <para>The report of the majority of members of the Sugar Inquiry Committee recommends that an independent committee should be formed consisting of representatives of the Commonwealth Government, the Sugar Board, the growing and manufacturing sections of the fruit industry, and that a very great power be put into the hands of this committee. On the face of the recommendation there is nothing to suggest that anything of a revolutionary character is proposed. To those of us, however, who have endured the severe competition during the past five years of canneries and jam factories run at a loss annually (this, of course, has only been possible through the guaranteeing of the concerns' overdraft with their respective banks by the State Governments in question)  ana  who have had to endeavour to keep our factories solvent and pay taxes, which the co-operative concerns in question do not do, to us I repeat there is something oven sinister in this suggestion "that the committee may require the manufacturer to pay such prices to the growers for their fruit as the committee declares to be reasonable ". </para>
          <para>There can be no question that if the " manufacturers " in question were all operating under similar conditions with the same burdens to bear, then such an arrangement need not cause much alarm, excepting for one particular aspect which I shall deal with later. </para>
          <para>Generally, however, there is a widespread difference between the position of growers and manufacturers in the respective States and  their  particular burdens. </para>
          <para>Let us take this case to illustrate the possibilities of the developments. Suppose the committee fixes the price of apricots at £11 per ton for every factory in Australia. We in Tasmania would then pay £11 per ton, pay the same for our sugar, a little more for our wages, the same for our tinplate, our freight to the Australian markets is very much higher than say the Goulburn Valley packers, but, of course, we would not be able to obtain a higher price than the other fellow and we have no government to support our losses  (Ardmona's  loss was £5 per ton in 1929 and £6 per ton in 1930 on fruit purchased). Is that a sound position for us to be placed in, more especially when it should be remembered  that  we can produce fruit cheaper than most mainland growers but would not be allowed to avail ourselves of this natural advantage to overcome our disadvantages, i.e., distance of markets and the necessity to pay our way and contribute to the taxes of the Commonwealth of Australia, and in all States as well, individually, in which we do business. We pay income tax on our sales in every State in which we do business (I am not referring to sales tax) and, of course, on the whole of our business we pay taxation to the Tasmanian Government and the Australian Commonwealth Government. </para>
          <para>It is well understood that the grower is the man who is to get the benefit of this lower price for sugar supplied to the manufacturer for the processing of fruit products, and he can get this benefit, of course, in either one of two ways, i.e., increased price for his fruit (which encourages further production of fruit), or greater distribution at a lower price of jam and canned fruit which works surely though slowly in the direction of a balanced situation in the production and consumption of jam and canning fruits in the Commonwealth. It is not so well realized, apparently, that he has had this benefit for some years past. Had the price of sugar to the fruit processor been £6 5s. Id. per ton higher and no export rebate been available against the contents of sugar in canned fruits and jam, then undoubtedly manufacturers could not nave continued to receive and process the growers' fruit and pay him the prices that he has received for his fruit without sustaining such losses as would very soon have precluded the manufacturer from continuing to receive and buy fruit from the grower, unless, of course, the fruit was all to be processed by cooperative companies receiving as distinct from the proprietary manufacturers, as has been the case, still further support of a substantial character in the shape of bounties on export and other government financial assistance. </para>
          <para>In support of this contention as to the unprofitableness of the operations of processors of canned fruit and jam, particularly jam, I attach a circular letter issued by the agent of the principal Goulburn Valley factory dated 18th March, 1931. This letter "is enlightening as to the real position of the government-aided factories making jam and canned fruits, and I have underscored the salient portions, some of which have a deep significance. </para>
          <para>Referring to the special aspect of the manufacturers' comparative positions in the price of fruit, take strawberries. These are grown in Victoria, Tasmania, and Queensland in the main. The committee would be called upon to fix a price for strawberries satisfactory to the growers. A different variety of strawberry is grown in each of these States, in fact several varieties are grown in Victoria and Tasmania, but practically one type only in Queensland; and some of these varieties are much cheaper to grow than others. In Tasmania, all strawberries are cheaper to grow than any strawberry in Queensland, for example. Again, the cost of delivery to the factory varies according to the type of container in which the goods are delivered, and also the value of output to the factory for jam-making purposes varies by as much as 25 per cent. in accordance with the condition of the fruit and the type of container in which it reaches the factory. </para>
          <para>Whilst a high price for strawberries might appear advantageous to many Tasmanian strawberry growers, if it meant that they finally lost the sale of strawberry jam to Victorian or Queensland strawberry growers, or, on the other hand, lost their market through having a too high comparative price for strawberries as against the price for apricots, plums, &amp;c, then the grower's last state would be worse than his first. This could easily occur through any attempt at artificial regulation of prices to be paid by the manufacturer to the growers. </para>
          <para>The natural advantage that the mainland States have as regards the sale of their own products (at their doors so to speak) should be quite sufficient protection for them without mainland interests seeking to further handicap Tasmania by forcing up the costs of the Tasmanian article. This is what the Sugar Committee's recommendations could speedily result in. </para>
          <para>We (H. Jones and Company Proprietary Limited) handle twenty varieties of fruit in Tasmania for canning and jam making, and if this suggested committee is to fix the price we are to be expected to pay the grower for same from time to time, I consider that such a serious dislocation could take place in the fruit industry in this State that it would almost disappear, unless, of course, the London market for pulps should re-awaken and the London and foreign buyers be willing to pay the price per pound for the fruit (plus charges) fixed by this committee. </para>
          <para>We have purchased 1,200 tons of raspberries from growers this year (under pressure from the Tasmanian Government to take all possible in) and we hope sooner or later to ship about 600 tons of this to London as pulp. But if we do not accomplish this, then this fruit must perforce be used up locally. How though are we to differentiate between what we buy designedly for local use and that which we are compelled finally to use locally owing to lack of the export trade we anticipated or hoped for. </para>
          <para>If the sugar industry really desires to help the fruit industry of Tasmania the simple plan is the best, i.e., increase the amount of £6 5s.1d. per ton of sugar used by Tasmania's share of the extra £110,000 based upon the actual sugar used by processors and jam manufacturers in Tasmania and continue the supply of sugar for export purposes on the present basis. This would enable manufacturing on the present scale (consistent, of course, with the market demand) to continue. Under the committee's proposals with the uncertainty what the cost of sugar to the manufacturer would be, or what favoured competition the Tasmanian manufacturer might have to face, one with any knowledge of the trade cannot see how manufacturing could possibly continue. </para>
          <para>There can be no just or fair application of the reduction in price to sugar users unless it is based on the actual percentage of sugar used in the processing of the whole of the fruit, whether for canning or for jam. Yet this committee would apparently have the power to favour canned fruit or jam, according to the uncontrolled determination of its members, though all soft fruit growers are suffering from the self-same problem of overproduction and assuredly are entitled to the same consideration. </para>
          <para>In objecting to this further interference with this business, I should like to add that whilst, no doubt, the intention of the committee might be to give us some medicine that would do us good, we are very loth to place ourselves in any one's tender care, having regard to the fact that entirely owing to outside influences and interference in trade and unfair competition on the part of people whom I believe would carry the greatest influence in the deliberation of this committee, we in Tasmania have already dropped from 10,000 tons of soft fruit in 1927 to 5,000 tons in 1931. No wonder we are apprehensive of the efforts of any one to control us still further. </para>
          <para>In an editorial article in the Hobart <inline font-style="italic">Mercury,</inline> of Wednesday, 15th inst., in which the inquiry by the Sugar Committee is characterized as " a mere farce . . . ", the following outspoken statement is made: - </para>
          <para>It is unfair discrimination of this kind that breeds so much disgust in Tasmania with federal administration . . . " and this statement, while really alluding to the question of depots in capital cities, is particularly fitting also to the unfair position in which the Tasmanian fruit industry is likely - indeed certain - to be placed, if these proposals in the majority report of the Sugar Committee are brought into effect. </para>
          <para>It will not be denied that we people in Tasmania - our own company especially - have always endeavoured to study and express our views on the Australian sugar question with due regard to what was fair to the Queensland sugar producers as well as to the fruit-growers and processors in our own State - and if on these grounds alone we claim that our interests should not be sacrificed for the benefit of competitive fruit-growers and processors in the mainland States, who already have totally unfair advantages over the Tasmanians who pioneered the business and yet our trade has been ruthlessly interfered with and lessened, regardless of the cost and loss of revenue to the mainland States responsible. </para>

            <para>In conclusion we would suggest that the fairest method of distributing this £315,000 for the benefit of the fruit industry, failing acceptance of the simple plan of reducing the price to manufacturers, is to maintain the present system without alteration, and as regards the extra money, make this available direct to the fruit-growers. The Sugar Board could distribute this to the growers themselves against certificates issued to the growers by the processors of the fruit. There would be no need to set up a special committee, and the sugar industry would have the satisfaction of knowing that the fruit that actually carried their sugar into consumption as jam or canned fruit, was bonused by them on a per pound basis without favour to any particular fruit or type of product, and in proportion to the actual quantity of sugar which it carried into consumption. </para>

It is interesting to turn back to 1912. In pre-war days it was stressed that we must support the Queensland sugar industry as part and parcel of our White Australia policy. We have been told that if Northern Australia is not effectively settled the door will be wide open to an invader, and that by encouraging the sugar industry we are assisting to protect ourselves and build up an industry which will be our shield and defender.

Is it the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, the merchants, the cane-growers, or the canecutters? Although I have heard, in this chamber and outside, some enthusiastic advocates of the sugar industry extol its advantages to Australia, I have never been able to find out who derives all the benefit from the protection it receives. It is rather interesting to glance now and again at the "Wild Cat Column " in a certain weekly publication or at analyses of the balance-sheets of certain companies published in other newspapers in order to see exactly what they are doing. As a result of these investigations I am inclined to think that this great Colonial Sugar Refining Company gets a good bit of " sugar " but of sugar. A reference to <inline font-style="italic">Ryde's Business Journal</inline> shows that the original capital of theColonial Sugar Refining Company was £150,000 and the nominal capital £7,000,000, of which £5,850,000 has been issued and fully paid in shares of £20 each. In addition to the excellent dividend record, £11,225,000 has been distributed to members by way of bonus shares issues or cash return of capital. For the last four years the company's net profits have averaged over £900,000 a year, and it has paid dividends averaging 121/2 per cent. The total reserves up to 30th September last year were £1,450,590. The company has also a replacement and depreciation fund of £2,421,158, and a suspense account which has figured around £3,000,000 for the last few years. It is not disclosed if there is anything else: It will be seen that the company is not doing too badly out of sugar. </para><interjection>

Is it because the Colonial Sugar Refining Company objects to the expenditure of the necessary money? That monopoly has been so well-fed that it has become lethargic; it is so arrogant that it thinks that it can rule Australia. I submit that it is the duty of the Commonwealth Government to compel the Colonial Sugar Refining Company to carry out the terms of the first agreement and establish a depot in Hobart, the capital city of Tasmania, in order that that State may be placed on the same footing as the other States. </para><para>We have to go back a long way to get to the genesis of the recent inquiry into the sugar monopoly. Tasmania has good reason to complain of the composition of the committee that was appointed. In face of the desire of an overwhelming majority of the fruit-growers - I do notmean processors or canners of fruit - that a certain gentleman should be appointed to represent their interests on the committee, the Government appointed another person. A deputation waited on the Prime Minister in that connexion, and also to urge the necessity for establishing a depot at Hobart, but without obtaining any satisfaction. Knowing the views of the gentleman who was appointed, I was not surprised that he signed the majority report.  His  interests were not those of the fruit-growers. Small though it may be, Tasmania produces a very considerable proportion of the soft fruits grown in Australia. In reply to the propositions placed before the Prime Minister, the following reply, dated the 2nd May, 1931, was sent to each member of the deputation : - </para><para>With reference to your personal representations at the deputation that waited on me recently in regard to several aspects of the sugar position in Tasmania, I now desire to furnish you with the following information: - </para><para>With regard to the proposal that a sugar depot ' be established at Hobart, I desire to point out that a system was inaugurated about two years ago by the Queensland Sugar Board whereby business people in Hobart may obtain extra supplies of sugar from the agents of the Queensland Sugar Board under a bank guarantee - such extra sugar not requiring to be paid for until actually used. This system was introduced in order to prevent, as far as possible, any shortage of supplies of sugar as had previously occurred owing to transport or other difficulties. I have been informed that witnesses appearing recently before the Sugar Inquiry Committee at Hobart admitted that no shortage of sugar had occurred during the past two years. Furthermore, the Sugar Inquiry Committee found that quite a number of business people in Hobart were not aware that it was possible for them to obtain extra supplies of sugar under the arrangements indicated above. </para><para>In the circumstances, I am of opinion that it would bo unreasonable to compel the Queensland Sugar Board to incur the considerable expense of establishing a sugar depot, whilst there is no evidence that the present system for supplying extra sugar under a bank guarantee is not working satisfactorily. However, the Government recognizes the necessity for doing everything possible to ensure sufficient supplies of sugar at Hobart at all times, and it is, therefore, including a special clause in the new sugar agreement under which the Commonwealth Government may compel the Queensland Sugar Board to establish a sugar depot in Hobart, if at any time the Commonwealth Government finds that Hobart purchasers, although making adequate use of the guarantee system, are suffering from u shortage of sugar. </para><para>With reference to the second question raised at the deputation in regard to the statement that retail grocers in Hobart were required to pay approximately fi per ton more for sugar than grocers in mainland capital cities, this matter was brought under notice in the report of the Sugar Inquiry  Committee  which recommended that an amount of 4s. 9d. per ton be allowed in the new sugar agreement to wholesale merchants in Hobart to cover certain wharfage and cartage charges - provided that same is passed on by the wholesale merchants to the retail grocers. This recommendation has been adopted by the Government in connexion with the new sugar agreement. A preliminary inquiry regarding the excess charges imposed upon retail grocers in Hobart shows that they are partly due to wholesale merchants not abiding by the conditions governing cash sales of sugar under the sugar agreement. It appears that wholesale merchants are - levying certain charges in excess of their prescribed discount of 2 per cent., but that the total excess charges, on a properlycomparable basis, are not as much as the £1 per ton claimed. Suitable representations arc being made to the Queensland Sugar Board in the matter, with a view to rectifying the position, and I shall advise you of the result of the action now being taken as early as possible. </para><para>A request was also made at the deputation that refined sugar should be supplied to ports on the north-west coast of Tasmania at the same price as obtains for refined sugar delivered at Hobart and Launceston. I desire to point out that the policy of uniform selling prices for refined sugar only applies to the capital cities of the Commonwealth with the exception that Launceston has been regarded as being tantamount to a capital city for this purpose, due to the fact that that city obtains its supplies from the Melbourne refinery, whereas Hobart is supplied from the refinery at Sydney. </para><para>After carefully considering all the circumstances, I cannot agree that the principle of uniform selling prices should be extended to towns on the north-west coast of Tasmania, as such an extension would involve very many similar extensions to towns and cities in the other States of the Commonwealth and would tend to a re-adjustment of all the selling prices of sugar. </para><para class="block">I forwarded a copy of that letter to the people concerned in Hobart, and asked them for their views. In reply, I received from the Grocers Association of Tasmania, the following letter, dated the 8th May: - </para>

        <para>Copy of letter from Prime Minister to ha.nd in reference to representations made by deputation of Tasmanian members in regard to several aspects of the sugar position in Tasmania. </para>
        <para>The system inaugurated by the Queensland Sugar Board was brought about three years or more ago, when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Seabrook</inline> ( late M.H.R. ) , brought up the matter for a depot. </para>
        <para>The arrangement was made with Messrs. H. Jones and Company, and representations were then made by the Chamber of Commerce and the same privilege was granted to merchants or other manufacturers, Jones and Company, is the only one who has taken advantage of the system, and that is because there was no depot and it was necessary then, as now, that they should have supplies of sugar on hand, otherwise their business would suffer considerably and hundreds of jam workers would be out of employment should a strike occur or any other difficulty of obtaining supplies. </para>
        <para>Why should a manufacturer or merchant be made to provide stocks of sugar, under the guarantee system, when it is absolutely the duty of the monopoly to provide those facilities. It is very evident to me the Commonwealth Government also the monopoly arc of the opinion that manufacturers and merchants are in business for the good of their health, and should be nothing more than benefactors for the sugar monopoly. The point I desire to stress is: Tasmania is an island, our shipping service at the best of times is rotten (a Commonwealth responsibility), we used to have strikes summer after summer - our fruit season (and bear in mind, a vital industry to Tasmania), irregular running of steamers, wet weather prevailing at time of ship loading in Sydney, has also caused shortages. The Commonwealth Government then wants manufacturers and merchants to provide a store to hold a fair quantity, make it vermin proof, cart-in cart-out, provide a bank guarantee (which is doubtful if they could get one if they wanted one), all extra expense for thorn, to provide against shortages, but nothing extra in the way of remuneration, for the capital outlay, and on the miserable profit they are making now. We had shortages the other week-end, the boat not running to time. </para>
        <para>The Tasmanian fruit industry is being stifled through the excessive price of sugar, and the value of sugar Tasmania uses exceeds over £500,000a year and the organizations and people I represent are emphatic that Hobart should and must have a depot, and the price to be the same as in other capital cities. Tasmania, without exaggeration, is seething with indignation over the sugar business, and I can assure you, if my humble efforts count for anything, it will seethe more, if Tasmania does not get a fair deal. Other manufacturers and merchants I also emphasize will not take advantage of the guarantee system, which is rottenly unfair, even to expect them. A perusal of the shorthand notes taken at the Hobart sitting of the inquiry will divulge that there was one only person (not several) who did not know of the guarantee system. I was there at the inquiry and know for sure, but it is typical of the majority report (hands off the sugar monopoly ) . </para>
        <para>The clause the Commonwealth Government intends to insert, in reference to should a shortage occur, and if Hobart purchasers are taking advantage of the guarantee system, may get a depot. </para>
        <para>The clause is absolutely useless, as they will not take advantage of that system and I don't blame them and for the reasons stated before, merchants, according to the Prime Minister's letter, have not abided by the conditions governing cash sales of sugar under the sugar agreement. The evidence I gave before the commission proved that, and until pressure was applied, they would not recognize it. </para>
        <para>The present time is then opportune for Tasmania and Tasmanians to fight for a fair deal in this matter, and I know Tasmanian federal members can be relied upon to do their share in protecting our most vital primary industry, fruit industry, and to help protect that, Hobart must have a depot and the price is to be the same as in other capital cities. </para>

        <para class="block">I shall not labour the question, but I feel that the Senate is entitled to hear views other than those which have been expressed by honorable senators from Queensland. For months we have had one side of the sugar question placed before us, in the press, and by means of circulars and letters. There have been propaganda <inline font-style="italic">ad nauseam</inline> in favour of a continuance of the embargo. I do not blame the sugar interests of Queensland for indulging in elaborate and well thought-out propaganda. In so doing they are acting within their rights. They know that they have gained an advantage, and they are entitled to fight for its retention. I want honorable senators to realize that there are two sides to this question, as there are to all questions. Yet because I dare to express the opinion of the people of the State from which I come, my remarks are regarded by some honorable senators as heresy; I am told that I have no business to say such things. I reply that, " fair play is bonnie play.". I think that I have said sufficient to show that the sugar embargo presses very heavily on certain interests in Tasmania. </para>

            <para>- I am. The honorable senator's trouble is that he cannot see beyond the horizon of his own State. Queensland is not Australia, but it does not matter a tinker's curse to the honorable senator and other Queenslanders what the people in the other States have to pay so long as they get their fat dividends, or rake-off. I have nothing further to say about the majority and minority reports; they are just what any one with intelligence would expect in the circumstances. The recommendations in either the majority or the minority report are not very helpful and will get us nowhere. The whole tenor of them is, "Do not upset the <inline font-style="italic">status quo.</inline> This industry is sacrosanct. It must not be touched." One could speak <inline font-style="italic">ad lib</inline> about the over-production of sugar. We shall have a surplus of 240,000 tons to be sold for £7 10s. or £8 a ton, while the people in Australia are paying over £38 a ton. It is madness. No wonder Australia is in a chaotic financial condition when such a policy is pursued year after year. It is ridiculous to expect the people of Australia to pay four or five times more foi' their sugar than the price which can be obtained overseas for our surplus product. Production must be cut down, and the sooner an impartial and disinterested tribunal investigates the whole condition, the better it will be for this country. But we shall get nowhere by setting up committees of the nature of that which has  just  reported on the industry, if before Chey commence they are suspect, by reason of the fact that they are interested in some phase or other of the sugar business. I have nothing more to say on this subject. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MCLACHLAN</inline>(South Australia [5.8]. - Of all the subjects I hear discussed in this august chamber from time to time, nono seems to ripple the surface of the otherwise smooth waters of the Senate so much as does this much-vexed question of the sugar embargo. It appears to me that in order to understand where the trouble lies we have to do more than make a mere examination of it from the view-point of sugar. Even my placid friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford,</inline> is moved to indignation when we attempt to deal with this question in any other way than, that which he thinks right, and the calm and dispassionate soldier senator who has just resumed his seat waxes indignant from another point of view. I can understand the mental attitude and outlook of both honorable senators, but we who come from southern and western States are inclined to join forces in this matter with the distinguished senator from Tasmania. We have to look at this question as we find it. We find in it an established principle which Ave all applauded at the time it was first applied; but the application of that principle to the cultivation of sugar may have been done under a misapprehension from one or two points of view. It has certainly enabled a huge monopoly to be formed at the expense of the Australian people. It is a legislative monopoly which could only have led to the dire consequences this country is experiencing to-day. </para>
          <para>It is interesting to examine the view-point put up by Professor  Brigdean  He touches upon the fundamental folly that has pervaded our fiscal and economic system in Australia. The sugar industry appears to me to be a sweet darling of the Federal Parliament. It always has been. It embraces in its ranks companies de luxe, growers de luxe, and workmen living de luxe, because, compared with the current wages in Queensland, the wages paid in the sugar industry are altogether out of proportion. While everything else in the community has had to be pared down, wages, returns and everything else, no attempt has been made to bring this particular industry down to the same level and apply to it the same conditions which have to be endured by the rest of Australia. On page 79 of the report of the sugar committee, Professor Brigden is quoted as having said, " It is an indisputable fact that sugar has cost Australia far too much." Professor Brigden, whose economics have been so much extolled by some honorable senators, went on to say - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>To my mind the sugar industry is only one of the examples of an unfortunate drift on the part of a  too-optimistic  protectionist policy. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">There is no doubt that our protectionist policy has been applied in its highest possible form to this particular industry. It is, in fact, the new protection policy. The result is that Australia groans under a burden of what may be £5,500,000 in excessive payments, but possibly the greater amount mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> B. Johnston to-day. Whatever the cost may be, we have to look a little beyond the sugar industry itself; we have to examine our fiscal creed. Before we have passed through this period of depression now upon us we shall have to revise that creed, in the light of the conditions prevailing in this country, and in the light of the purchasing power of the community, its depleted wages and earnings. We shall not be able to keep the sugar industry any longer in that Elysium it has hitherto enjoyed in Australia in prosperous times. </para>
          <para>One cannot blame the Government for persisting in what was its declared policy at the time it went to the country. If any one is to be blamed, it is the people who returned Labour with a majority. In Tasmania the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> boldly announced that he was in favour of the sugar embargo, and that the -agreement would be continued if his party was returned to power. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Frost</inline> was seeking election for Franklin, a fruit-growing district, he advocated the sugar embargo, and said that he would support the Scullin Government upon it. In another place <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scullin</inline> said that his Government stood by the sugar embargo. We cannot, therefore, find fault with the Government for having given effect to its pledged policy. But .1 find fault with the Government on another score. Immediately public attention was drawn to the fact that the existing agreement would need to be renewed during the current year, it must have recognized that there was a strong force of public opinion, particularly in the southern and western States, in fact in all the States except two, against the continuance of the embargo without giving Parliament an opportunity to pronounce upon it. I, therefore, blame the Government, not for giving effect to its policy, but for not giving Parliament an opportunity to discuss the matter, having regard to the fact that the whole of Australia was considerably moved upon the question. Australia was just beginning to realize that it was about to embark upon an era of lower price levels, that the cost of living must come down, that everything was in the melting pot, and that presently we should not be in a position to stand the tremendous impost inflicted on the community by the sugar agreement. </para>
          <para class="block">There is no suggestion, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford</inline> thinks there is, that we are breaking faith with anybody or seeking the extermination of the sugar industry. </para>
          <para class="block">The point is that the people engaged in the industry should have had the sense to bow their heads to the gale; they must have known that the winds of adversity were blowing over the country and, instead of adopting the sugar committee's report, the Government would have acted more wisely if it had adopted, or even modified, the minority report which was subscribed .to by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> Gunn. If any one was likely to be disinterested in the sugar question, he was. He had no axe to grind; he was trying to look at the matter from the Australian, viewpoint, and he and two colleagues on the committee recommended some reduction in the cost of sugar. </para>
          <para>Suggestions have been made that the report of the committee is exactly what it was expected to be. It seems to me, at any rate, that there was absolutely no need for the report. After all the expenditure, travail and time involved no new light has been shed on the sugar question ; not one word has been added to our knowledge of the subject. Certainly, here and there through the reports there are extracts from various sources, but no new light has been shed on the position. The principle applied to the sugar industry is probably wrong, but we, as a Parliament, stand committed to it, and the people of Australia will most likely have to continue paying for a mistake of the past. But what I feel is that the report ,of the sugar committee is all so much political kite-flying. It is simply a cushion on which to ease down the policy the Government enunciated, but which it found did not exactly please a number of its supporters in some of the States. The committee was appointed with the full intention of permitting the Government to give effect to the position as it stood in the past. The Government was, no doubt, disappointed at being presented with a majority and a minority report, but it said, " We shall stand by our policy." But the Government is to blame for the continuance of this arrangement. The figures quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> indicate that the sugar industry is conducted efficiently. We, therefore, should direct our criticism to the viciousprinciple in which Parliament has acquiesced for many years. For my part I am totally opposed to embargoes in any shape or form. The principle is objectionable. Its application to any industry encourages the creation of monopolies inimical to the best interests of the community. </para>

            <para>- That is so. But I remind the honorable senator that cabinet responsibility and individual responsibility are entirely different matters. I consider the imposition of an embargo as a vicious form of protection. Although I realize fully the difficulties which the Government might have experienced in administration, I think it would have been better if, instead of placing an embargo on imports, it had imposed a duty for the protection of the sugar industry. From all that one can gather from reports about the position in other countries, the sugar industry throughout the world is in the melting pot. I have read a number of speeches delivered by interested parties in London concerning this matter, and I know that there is a movement to ensure some form of inter-Empire control. But we must do what we consider best and in our own way for the industry in Australia, and I am not going to be a party to any proposal that may ruin it. I fully realize, of course, that those associated with it are getting a great deal more out of it than can be said of people engaged in other commercial activities. The companies, the growers, employers and employees, are all in alliance. We had unmistakable evidence of this recently when there was a discussion in Canberra concerning the future of the industry. The Government of Queensland, the Australian Workers Union, of which the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Barnes)</inline> knows something; the growers and every one else connected with it, spoke as with one voice in its defence. They cast aside all their political or other differences in order to present a united front for the renewal of the agreement and the reimposition of the embargo on imports, all at the expense of the Australian taxpayer. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>It is the duty of the Government to stand between the consumers, for whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson</inline> made an eloquent appeal just now, and the exploitation - I do not use the word offensively - of people by the sugar industry of Queensland and northern New South Wales. It would have been well if, in the agreement which has just been renewed, provision had been made for a reduction in the price to be charged to the Australian consumers. Those connected with the sugar industry must acknowledge that the price levels for all other commodities have been reduced in recent months, and that it would have been only reasonable to provide for a corresponding reduction in sugar prices., Honorable senators should have an opportunity for a full dress debate on the general principle involved in this issue. Although I believe that the amendment might well be carried, I realize the futility of this debate, because the Government is committed to the agreement and will sign it. All that we can do is to voice our protest against the manner in which it has been made; but any objection which we may have to it should apply to all other proposals of the like nature. This debate, it is true, may be a starting point. Possibly, we are embarking upon a wider field of discussion than even the Minister contemplated when he suggested that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> should withdraw the amendment for the time being so as to afford an opportunity for the submission of a substantive motion dealing with the general principle involved. </para>
          <para>The agreement and the embargo impose on the taxpayers a burden ranging from £5,500,000, as indicated by the commission, to £7,000,000, as suggested by other outside authorities. Be the figure what it may, the taxation is excessive and we might very well complain that Parliament was not consulted before the Government decided to renew the agreement and re-impose the embargo. Under this arrangement the sugar industry is a taxing machine. Whether the amount which it levies is 15s. or £1 per head, is beside the point. What I and other honorable senators complain about is that the Government should have committed itself before giving Parliament an opportunity to express an opinion on the subject. It is no answer to say that this Administration merely followed the procedure of previous governments. Our economic circumstances were entirely different when previous administrations entered into these arrangements. In our present circumstances no government should have inflicted this further burden upon the people without consulting Parliament. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson</inline>made reference to the fact that the Commonwealth Sugar Refining Company had not established a depot at Hobart. While the honorable senator was speaking I was reminded of a paragraph in Professor Shann's evidence given before the select committee on' central banking not so long ago. It may, I suggest, have some bearing on the point. This is what Professor Shann said - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I may mention that, looking down the Swan River from my study window I noticed recently that a new smoke stack had appeared above Rocky Bay. This is the chimney of a refinery erected by the Commonwealth Sugar (Incorporated) Refinery Company. In its report of this year I read that this refinery cost twice as much to build as the total cost of the two refineries established on the same scale at Brisbane in 1891 and at Adelaide in 1895 or 1896. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The honorable senator may find, in that statement, the answer of the Commonwealth Sugar Refinery Company to the complaint that it has not erected a refinery at Hobart. The reason fa* this is not far to seek. We must lay the blame on embargoes of this character, and the consequent high wage costs in industry. As we all know, the cost of living goes up with every award that is made in the Arbitration Court, but we shall have to re-orientate our views with regard to such matters before we have finished with the present depression. The amendment submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> will serve to bring under the notice of the Government the views of the Senate with regard to embargoes or other arrangements made by it. </para>
          <para>It is clear that, before long, we shall have to put our economic house in order. This amendment may be the starting point - a step in the right direction. Yesterday, when the honorable senator submitted his amendment, I thought that perhaps it went a bit too far, because it deals with the duty which the Government may impose on sugar as well as the embargo and the prohibition of importations. While it may be a little wide in its terms, it does enable us to express our views concerning this class of protection. Speaking for my own State, we feel strongly that we should have been given an opportunity to discuss, not the extermination, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford</inline> would put it, of the sugar industry, but the quantum of benefit that should be extended to it before the agreement becomes effective. But it is now too late. All we can do is to enter a protest against the action of the Government. Ministers were well aware that the people were viewing with some concern the probability of an extension of the agreement. Accordingly, they deferred a definite announcement from month to month until the committee of inquiry had presented this document, which contributes nothing to the knowledge which, I believe, all honorable senators had concerning the industry. My criticism of the entire business is, I would emphasize, directed only to the general principle. It is reasurring  to know that the sugar industry is efficiently managed and progressive. But we cannot have one section of the community living de luxe, so to speak, while other sections find it difficult to make ends meet. That, unfortunately, is what is happening in Australia, and that is one reason why objection is raised to this levy on the taxpayers for the benefit of one particular industry. </para>

Our small dairy farmers are not in the same category as the sugar-growers and their employees, as is disclosed by the reports of the commission which we are now discussing. Very few dairy farmers have been earning anything like the basic wage that is paid to employees in the sugar industry of Queensland and Northern New South Wales. </para>

              <para>- A considerable expenditure of effort is now required to carry on that industry. When the Paterson butter scheme came into operation all went merrily and well with our dairy farmers. But what is the position to-day? It is quite a common sight to see, in the windows of grocers' shops in the suburbs of Melbourne and Sydney, announcements advertising the sale of margarine and dripping. These are portents for ill. They indicate that the condition of the dairy industry is not quite so satisfactory as we should like to think it was. How much longer can we continue in this way to ignore the old economic law? I realize, of course, that I am digressing somewhat from the subject under discussion, so I shall not pursue that line of argument further. All I need add is that no comparison can be drawn between the sugar industry of Queensland, living, as it were, in the lap of luxury, and the unfortunate small dairy farmers who are eking out an existence in the southern States. Before I resume my seat, I invite <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> to eliminate from his amendment the word " duty ", because I realize that we cannot very well ask the Government to act in contravention of its statutory authority. With this reservation, I give my support to the amendment which is moved as the only means available to us to express our opinion upon a matter that is <inline font-style="italic">un fait accompli.</inline></para>

            <para>.- With a good deal of the speech delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> I can heartily agree. It is now generally recognized in Australia that economic laws must be obeyed more readily in the future than they have been in the past. But it is an altogether different proposition to be asked to vote for the amendment that has been moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch.</inline> I do not think the honorable senator will claim to be the only member of the Senate who desires to see the industries of this country conducted on sound economic lines.  His  amendment picks out for special treatment the Queensland sugar industry. </para>

              <para>- Nevertheless the honorable senator has always argued against government assistance to other industries. It has been argued that, because the sugar industry occupies the fortunate position of being relieved from the competition of sugar grown in black labour countries, it is able to pay higher rates of wages than are paid in some other industries. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> and other honorable senators have said that while wages have come down in many industries, the sugar industry has not suffered in that respect. I point out that not very long ago the Arbitration Court agreed to a reduction of the wages paid in the gold-mining industry, which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> always so capably champions, to the extent of something like 10 per cent. The employers in that industry, however, did not avail themselves of that concession, but kept wages at the existing level, on account of the bounty that is paid by the Commonwealth Government on the production of gold in Australia - a payment that has been severely criticized by many students of economics as well as by members of this and another place. </para>

              <para>- I cannot assign any cause for the fact that, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> has pointed out, there is always a ripple <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> the usually placid waters of the Senate whenever the sugar industry comes up for discussion in this chamber. That industry is now, and it has been, in a reasonably flourishing state. But as a Queenslander I do not tear my hair and rave when I find an industry in another State carrying on in a flourishing condition. Times out of number, since I first entered the Senate, I have voted to assist industries whose operations are conducted entirely outside my own State. I have supported proposals designed to assist farmers in the Mallee, and fruit growers in Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia. When Tasmania has come along with its annual plea for monetary assistance, I have always shown myself charitably disposed towards it. When Western Australia has knocked on the door of the Commonwealth Parliament and made its annual appeal for assistance. I have never hardened my heart against it, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> does when assistance is sought for the Queensland sugar industry. I consider that I am justified in asking <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> and other honorable senators to display the same broad national outlook. When additional protection was asked for the dairying industry, I and my colleagues did not inquire whether it would help Victoria or New South Wales to a greater extent than Queensland. We considered that the matter was one which affected an Australian industry that gives employment to our people and brings to  this country a tremendous amount of revenue from overseas. </para>

          <para>I assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> that every man who grows sugar in Australia is not what may be termed a rich sugar baron. Thousands of small sugar-growers are merely scratching along, and earning just sufficient to keep themselves and their families in reasonable comfort. There appears to be a general opinion that a person who engages in the growing of sugar cane in northern Queensland, or on the northern rivers of New South "Wales, has only to obtain a few acres of land suitable for the production of cane, plant his crop, and in a comparatively short time he becomes a millionaire. If any honorable senator holds such a fantastic idea he should visit northern Queensland to see the way in which the industry is conducted and the conditions under which the men work. Some years ago, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newlands</inline> and other members of the Federal Parliament paid an extended visit to northern Queensland to obtain first-hand knowledge of the conditions under which the industry is conducted, and have since realized the immense benefit it is to Australia. </para>
          <para>Criticism has been levelled against the wages paid to those engaged in the industry. I do not wish to see those employed in the industry receive an unfair advantage over those engaged in other industries, but I submit there are very few men in the southern States who would work in the northern parts of Queensland, particularly at canecutting, at rates lower than those at present ruling. The sugar industry has now become stabilized, as I should like to see many other industries in Australia, and the disadvantages which some experience by having to pay  ¼d.  or £d. a lb. more for sugar are more than compensated for by the benefit which the industry is to the Commonwealth. </para>

              <para>- The people engaged in the industry and the representatives of Queensland in this chamber would be agreeable to a protective policy provided the duty was imposed to adequately protect the sugar industry, as is done in the case of other primary and secondary industries. In view of the fluctuation in prices which have resulted in overproduction, the retention of the embargo is essential. If the point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> is the bone of contention, I would be prepared to advise those controlling the sugar industry in Australia to accept a duty sufficient to adequately protect Australian sugar against the products of cheaplabour countries, in lieu of an embargo, but the fluctuations in the price of sugar are so great that it would be necessary to continually vary the duty, and the embargo is simpler and more satisfactory. That is only fair and is in keeping with the attitude adopted by the Senate in affording protection to other industries. What is the difference between imposing a. prohibitive duty on, say, butter, and a total embargo on importations of foreign sugar? In the case of butter the duty is made so high that it becomes an embargo. As mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford,</inline> the portion of Australia in which the sugar industry is thriving is vulnerable, and if sugar-growing and refining were discontinued I do not know what other industries could be established in its place. The land in northern Queensland on which sugar is now produced is rich, there is a heavy rainfall, the percentage of moisture in the soil is high and, consequently, it is peculiarly suitable for sugar-growing. The industry is carried on most efficiently, millions of pounds having been spent in wages, in the erection of modern mills and refineries, and in the purchase of plant, most of which is manufactured in Australia. Moreover, many thousands of pounds are spent by the residents of northern Queensland in purchasing the products of industries in the southern States. Northern Queensland provides an extraordinarily good market for the products of other industries. It ill becomes honorable senators such as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson</inline> to refer in sneering terms to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. I hold no brief for that company, I do not possess a single share in it, and probably will never have sufficient money to buy any. It is incorrect to say that the huge premium at which the shares of the company are sold are due to profiteering on the part of that company. In addition to its Australian interests, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company has also vast interests in Fiji and New Zealand. The fact that the refining of sugar is Australia is practically limited to one company - another refinery is operating in Bundaberg - does not suggest that consumers of sugar in Australia are being robbed. There are no more modern sugar refineries in the world than exist in Australia. I should like, sir, to compare the operations of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company with the HenryFord motor works in America. </para>

          <para>SenatorFOLL. - I merely wished to institute a comparison between the refining operations of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company under one control - in that respect it differs from other forms of primary production in Australia - and the operations of theFord motor works in America. Owing to a system of mass production Ford motor cars can be produced and sold at a rate cheaper than any other make of car. In the same way the Colonial Sugar Refining Company has brought refining up to such a state of efficiency that its work is not excelled in any other country. Instead of honorable senators treating this industry in a more or less hostile manner, they should endeavour to bring other industries up to a similar state of efficiency. </para>

              <para>- At present the bounty paid on the production of gold is provided by taxpayers all over Australia. The sugar industry is of vital importance not only to Queensland, but to the whole of Australia. It became stabilized, and in every sense efficient, in consequence of the embargo placed upon the importation of foreign sugar by the Bruce-Page Government. It gives employment to thousands of Australian workmen, is a means of livelihood for thousands of small farmers, and the portion of Queensland in which the industry is established provides an extraordinarily good market for the protected products of industries operating in the southern States. Queensland has always been willing to assist primary and secondary industries in the southern States, and all that the representatives of Queensland now ask is that similar consideration should be extended to this most important industry in the north. I trust that the majority of honorable senators will support the continuance of the embargo in order to afford the great sugar industry of Queensland that protection which it deserves. </para>

            <para>.- Apart from the financial and economic position of Australia I suppose that there is no question that is agitating the minds of the Australian people more to-day than the question of sugar production, and the price which consumers have to pay for that commodity. Throughout Australia, and particularly in Tasmania, the question is a live one. Every housewife is keenly interested in the price of sugar, which is used in every household. Australians are large consumers of sugar. Any honorable senator may well be pardoned for saying that no subject that comes before the Senate is of greater importance to the whole of the people of Australia than is the price of sugar. In reading the majority and the minority reports of the committee which was appointed to investigate the sugar industry, one finds widely different views expressed regarding some aspects of the question while on other aspects there is agreement. </para>

              <para>- Honorable senators who have spoken have not drawn special attention to the over-production of sugar in Australia. The report shows that 31 per cent. of the total Australian output of sugar in  1927 was exported. The following year, 35 per cent, of the sugar grown in Australia was sent abroad. In 1929, the sugar exported represented 30 per cent, of the year's production. .Fortyone per cent, of the sugar produced in Australia in 1930 had to be sent overseas in order to find a market, and it is estimated that this year 45 per cent, of the output of the sugar mills will have to be disposed of outside Australia. In the light of those figures, it. is difficult to understand why those engaged in the sugar industry in Australia did not long ago attempt to put their house in order. </para>

              <para>- I realize that. The figures which I have quoted support the honorable senator's contention. I know the sugar districts of Queensland. As far back as 1903, 1 visited that State in order to gain first-hand knowledge of the sugar industry. I have taken a keen interest in the industry ever since, because I realize its value to Australia. I have no desire to see it crushed out of existence; but I do want it to be carried on in such a way that it will not place too heavy a burden on the people of Australia. 1 want the industry to be a benefit, not a burden, to Australia. </para>

              <para>- I am not dealing with that aspect of the question at present; I am dealing with the overproduction of sugar. If a person engaged in any other industry continued year after year to produce in such quantities that a lara;e proportion of his total output had to be sold at a price considerably lower than the cost of production, he would immediately set about putting his house in order. Those engaged in the production of sugar should do the same. I believe that the sugar industry can be carried on successfully in Australia if an attempt is made, over a period of years, to reduce the area under cultivation, until eventually Australia will produce only sufficient for her own requirements. </para>

      </quote>
      <para class="block">This matter has been on the business-paper for a considerable time. It was originally raised on the motion moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator R.</inline> D. Elliott for the appointment of a select committee. After the committee had been appointed, had deliberated, and had submitted a report, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator R.</inline> D. Elliott went on a visit to England, and I somewhat reluctantly assumed the office of acting  chairman  of the committee. In that capacity, I am now moving the adoption of the second report of the committee; but I shall leave it to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator R.</inline> D. Elliott to deal with the subject more fully. The first report contained recommendations for the appointment of three standing committees, but an amendment was moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly,</inline> who was then Vice-President of the Executive Council, providing that the matter should be referred back to the committee with the idea of dispensing with two of the committees. In this report, effect has been given to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly's</inline> suggestion, and the report contemplates the appointment of a standing committee of the Senate, to be called " The Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances." It is unnecessary for me to say very much in order to commend this recommendation to the Senate, but  there is one point to which I should like to draw attention, chiefly for the purpose of illustrating the extraordinary danger there is in our habit of eleventh-hour legislation. We pass bills through Parliament with practically no consideration, and almost in a moment, in what is usually termed the end of the session rush. Of course, many ofus who have been in this Parliament for some years do not know what it is to end a session. It is a happy experience to which we look forward. We hope that we may be spared long enough to see one. But the fact that there is no end of the session does not seem to obviate what some of us have been accustomed to in State Parliaments, and that is the end of the session rush. The only difference between having no end of the session and ending one is that, in the latter case, there is only one end of the session rush, whereas in the former, under the system of having periods of a session and no end to a session, there is an end of the session rush at the end of every period. The danger of passing hasty and ill considered legislation is, therefore, multiplied. On the 8th August, probably in the night-time between the 7th and8th August, the Senate passed through all its stages, with practically no debate from its first reading down to its third reading, a bill to amend the Acts Interpretation Act, and I venture to say that there are not many honorable senators who know what we did on that occasion. What we did was to agree to alter the law which required that the Government, after making a regulation, should place a copy of it on the table of both Houses of Parliament within 30 days of the making of the regulation, or, if Parliament was not sitting, within 30 days of the meeting of Parliament, and to replace it by a provision which enables the Government to place the regulation on the table of each House within fifteen sitting days of the meeting of that House. </para>

          <para>- I am making no suggestion. I shall tell the honorable senator what happened. Under the provision as altered, the Government need not lay a regulation before the Senate until the lapse of fifteen sitting days after the regulation has been made. Even if we are working full steam and continuously, which very seldom happens, that may mean at least six weeks, but, in some circumstances, it may means two or three months. I venture to say that honorable senators on this side, at any rate, did not realize what we were doing; otherwise we should not have agreed to the alteration.

        <para>There is some doubt as to the meaning of the expression, " If the Parliament is not then sitting," and, consequently, as to the period provided within which regulations may be tabled. It frequently happens that, although Parliament is sitting on the date when regulations are made, it is adjourned shortly after that date, and it is not possible to comply with the section. Clause 3 provides that, in future, all regulations are to be tabled within fifteen sitting days from the date on which they are made. </para>

      <para class="block">That point was never again referred to in the course of the debate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> made some reference to the consolidation of the two acts, and that completed the second-reading debate. In committee, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> spoke of the date on which the proclamation should be issued, and also asked whether the fifteen days referred to each individual chamber. I am not suggesting any ulterior motive on the part of Ministers, but I venture to suggest that the amendment was made with the idea of simplifying the procedure and facilitating the tabling of regulations as quickly as possible. </para>

          <para>-I believe that it was drafted by a previous administration ; I am not concerned about that point, but I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that all governments invariably take the view that the less restraint Parliament exercises upon them, the better it is for them. That sentiment, I am sure, is not endorsed by this Senate. But the fact remains that, without the slightest conception of how this alteration was to be used, the Senate did detract considerably from its power in regard to regulations. It thought that the bill meant getting over a legal technicality and would facilitate the placing of regulations before Parliament at the earliest possible moment. "We find now that it is actually being used to delay the time within which regulations may be submitted. Happily, our error or inadvertence has been corrected by the High Court. That tribunal has, in fact, determined that the power of Parliament is supreme, and that once a regulation has been gazetted there is no need for this chamber to await the convenience of the Government to lay it on the table. Once a regulation is gazetted it is within the power of the .Senate to disallow it. The High Court has thus rescued us from the consequences of our inadvertence, and restored <inline font-style="italic">us</inline> to a better position than we occupied previously. I trust that honorable senators will take the earliest possible opportunity to read in full the whole of the judgment of the High Court on the Transport Waterside Workers Regulation, because it strikes at the very root of the power of Parliament, and the delegated power of the Government, making it clear that Parliament parts only with such legislative powers as it specifically delegates to the Government. </para>

      <para>In view of the interpretation of the High Court, it seems to me that it is more important than it was previously that we should have in this chamber a recognized statutory body charged with the duty of inquiring into and considering regulations directly they are gazetted. Otherwise, goodness knows how long it may be before we know whether they are in operation or not or what is the effect of their operation. About a month ago, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Arthur</inline> Robinson, a very distinguished lawyer, who has given a good deal of his time and ability in the service of the country, and who is a man of very wide political experience, read a paper before the Law Institute of Victoria in the course of which he made a remark which is extremely pertinent to the matter we are now considering.

          <para>. - In seconding the motion I wish to thank <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> for the interest which he took in the work of the committee and the ripe judgment which he brought to bear upon its deliberations. I was, fortunately or unfortunately, called to the other side of the world at about this time last year, shortly after the evidence had been taken and the first report decidedupon. Because of the disinterested position which he occupies in this chamber <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> was pressed to become a member of the select committee and to act as  chairman  during my absence. The honorable gentleman presided over the meetings at which this second report was decided upon, and it was he who submitted the first report to this chamber. Since my return I have studied the debate which took place on that occasion, and I have given careful consideration to the suggestions made by the then Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Daly),</inline> supported by the right honorable the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce).</inline> As a result of the action then taken the committee gave further consideration to the subject and the report now before the Senate is the considered opinion of its members. I trust that the Senate will to-night accept it without hesitation. It is not my intention to adopt the suggestion made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch,</inline> that I should give a lengthy dissertation concerning the value of work which can be done by the suggested standing committee of the Senate. As justification for the proposal the honorable gentleman directed attention to the large number of regulations which are laid on the table of the Senate from time to time. The following apparently innocent section under which these regulations are made, reads: - </para>
        </talk.start>
        <quote>
          <para>The Governor-General may make regulations not inconsistent with this act prescribing all matters which, by this act. are required or permitted to be prescribed or which are necessary or convenient to be prescribed for the carrying out or giving effect to this act. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">That provision in all acts under which regulations may be made, is largely responsible for the frequent tabling of such regulations. If we needed further evidence of the value of such a committee as is contemplated, we have only to consider to-day's business sheet for the Senate. It includes the discussion of a motion for the printing of a paper relating to the sugar industry and dealing with the Government's policy. Those who have listened to the debate to-day must realize the need there is for more effective parliamentary control over executive action. Further down in the business sheet there appears reference to the pacific settlement of international disputes. I wonder how many honorable senators have sufficient knowledge to express an expert opinion upon this subject. During the last two years we have had many instances of the urgent need for organized committee work. I feel that all honorable senators will agree that the inquiry by the select committee has established beyond all doubt the urgent need for the appointment of Senate standing committees, which will give thorough and intelligent study to the many problems that come before this chamber. There is conclusive evidence on every hand that in all organized activities of men, the more compact the responsibility the better the work done. As a rule the only testimony or argument admitted is that which comes from persons known to be particularly concerned or believed to be particularly qualified to inform or advise. The work of these proposed committees should he done behind closed doors. In this way honorable senators would enter upon the most interesting, important and useful part of their work - the part of which the public knows nothing. Behind closed doors nobody talks to the gallery or to press representatives. Buncombe is not worth while. Sincerity is the only thing that counts. Behind closed doors men drop their masks. They argue to, and not through, each other. The absence of publicity in committee work increases the chance for concession or compromise of thought so necessary in the framing of legislation. It is in the conference room that careful, calm consideration can be brought to bear upon a subject, and men can work harmoniously in spite of party differences. It is there that the qualities and experience of the individual can be applied to matters under discussion. </para>
        <para class="block">It is there that opportunity is provided for vision, judgment and experience to be applied and, later, brought before the Senate for open discussion and action. The subject has been well discussed in the Senate, and I feel that there is little that I need add. I commend this, the second report of the select committee, to the consideration of honorable senators, in the hope that it will be adopted. </para>

          <para>. - I now find myself in the position of being able to support the motion for the adoption of the report. When last this matter was under discussion we differed, I think, only as to whether the activities of the proposed standing committees should include the consideration of external affairs. "Now that the select committee has recommended the appointment of committees that will consider only such matters as reports, ordinances and regulations, I see no objection to the motion. I would, however, like to correct an impression that might be created in the minds of honorable senators by the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch.</inline> Apparently, the honorable senator was under the impression that, prior to the amendment of the Acts Interpretation Act, if a regulation was not tabled within a period of  30  days from the date of its making, it ceased to operate. </para>

            <para>- Even if regulations were not tabled within  30  days they would still have legal force. It was to get over this difficulty that the bill to amend the Acts Interpretation Act was passed. As Leader of the Senate, I conferred with the right honorable the Leader of the Opposition, and, in another place, the Attorney-General consulted the then Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham).</inline> Both Houses were assured that there was no desire on the part of the Government to shirk its duty, and that the measure should be passed. In some respects the Commonwealth Constitution is unique. I know of no constitution which gives to the parliament greater control over the executive than' is vested in this Parliament. I entirely disagree with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Arthur</inline> Robinson, whose views were quoted just now by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch.</inline> Bearing in mind the intricacies of our Constitution, the laws passed by this Parliament are remarkable for their clarity. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> that we should have a standing, committee of the Senate to study regulations that are laid on the table from time to time. It is better to make it some men's job instead of allowing it to be no man's job. The proposed committee could give careful study to the many questions that would come before it and give valuable advice to the Senate. On more than one occasion we have had evidence of the need for such a committee. Under the Northern Australia Act; for example, certain regulations were made affecting the interests of quite a number of people. The party that I have the honour to represent has nothing to hide, nor does it seek to gain any advantage by the making of regulations. All that it desires is to operate to the fullest extent the powers that are vested in it under the Constitution. Every regulation that it has made has been tabled. But for the premature action of the Opposition, it would have tabled the regulations dealing with waterside workers. Therefore, I see no reason why any objection should be raised to this proposal ; and I hope that the motion will be carried. </para>

            <para>- If that be so, an objection that I was going to urge has been met. I hope that that provision will be availed of in the future. During this session, and in previous sessions, we have had some striking examples of theuseful purpose that would be served by such a committee. The Bankruptcy Bill was the first that came under my notice. "We flogged that measure for a lengthy period, the discussion being confined to two or three honorable senators who had some knowledge of the subject. The rest of the Senate took no interest in it whatever, with the result that we now have an act that is repugnant to the commercial community of Australia. I hope that an opportunity will be afforded for a review of that legislation, and that a select committee will be appointed of honorable senators who possess an intimate knowledge of the subject, with a view to amendments being made that will improve it, Then there is the bill dealing with life insurance, which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> piloted through the Senate last year. That measure bristled with technicalities, with which only a few honorable senators were acquainted. A very useful purpose would be served by referring such a bill to a select committee of the Senate. Last, but by no means least, is the Central Reserve Bank Bill, which might have been dealt with more expeditiously had a small committee inquired into it and brought in its recommendations promptly. Certainly a select committee was appointed to investigate that proposal, and presented a very valuable report. </para>

          <para>. - The Government has no objection to the passage of this motion, and I have intimated that fact to the honorable senator who is responsible for its introduction to the Senate. The Government accepts the report of the select committee, and believes that it was actuated by the desire to make it possible for regulations to be dealt with in a manner different from what has been the practice hitherto. A Government might find itself in a very precarious position unless it had the power to make regulations when Parliament was not sitting to deal with a situation that necessitated immediate action. Presumably that was the reason for the conferring of this power on the executive. The  Committee  has simplified the procedure, and as a result of their labours this Parliament will probably be enabled to work with greater wisdom than has been possible in the past. </para>

          <para>. - The appointment of a standing committee on regulations and ordinances appeals to me as a splendid idea. Many regulations and ordinances are presented to this Parliament every week, particularly in relation to the territories of the Commonwealth. I hope that the proposed committee will examine every regulation most carefully, and let us  know  exactly what it means.

        <para>Attention has been drawn to Standing Order No. 194; the phrasing of that Standing Order is such as to suggest that the appointment of a select committee is an act of hostility to the Government or to the bill concerned. There are three ways in which a motion for the second reading of a bill may be amended: By leaving out of the motion the word "now", and inserting in lieu thereof the words " this day six months " - which is a rejection of the measure; by moving the previous question, which also is a rejection of the measure; and, by referring it to a select committee, which makes the appointment of the select committee an act of hostility towards the Government and the bill. That ought to be removed. The bill ought to  go  to a select committee that has an open mind on the matter. </para>
        <para>As the Leader  of  the Senate has suggested, there  is  no intention  to  limit the regulation-making power  of  the Government, particularly when Parliament  is  not in session. The only limitation that should be imposed is that which was suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Rich in his judgment the other day, when he pointed out that legislation is the function of Parliament; that the making of a regulation is legislation; and that since legislation can be passed only by both Houses of Parliament, so the making of a regulation by the Government should be confined to the doing of something that will be approved by both Houses of the Parliament. </para>

            <para>. - The Government does not consider that it is advisable to lease Cockatoo Island Dockyard, and is unable to agree to the adoption of that course. The reasons for such a decision should be obvious. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>A previous government called tenders for the leasing of the dockyard, not only in Australia, but also abroad, but no tenders were forthcoming. That attempt was made in prosperous times, when one would think that if there were a possibility of making greater use of the dockyard, there would be a chance of leasing it. The failure to do so proves that there is not much likelihood of anticipations in that direction being realized at the present time. The negotiations eventually  reached the stage of the acceptance of the terms by Nicholls Brothers, Limited, of Sydney, provided that a proposed company could be formed with sufficient working capital to carry on operations. Apparently the last administration was satisfied from its investigations that the lease could be gone on with; but another factor entered in, and it was not consummated. From 1924 to 1928 the dockyard was carried on at a profit. That indicates that the loss which is at present being incurred in maintaining Cockatoo Island Dockyard is not the result of government enterprise. For four years, when conditions were fairly prosperous, the dockyard showed a profit. </para>

              <para>- The huge plant installed at Cockatoo Island has been used for various governmental purposes and naturally the overhead expenses have been heavy. In consequence of the decision of the High Court in the Bunnerong case the Government has been unable to use the dockyard to its full capacity since by that decision it is prevented from entering into competition with private enterprise. During the present depression the construction of public works, which ordinarily would have been undertaken by the Government, has practically ceased, and consequently work at the dockyard has been seriously curtailed. As honorable senators are aware, the dockyard was acquired for use as a naval workshop and has been used almost exclusively for the construction and maintenance of naval equipment. According to the decision of the High Court, in the case mentioned, Cockatoo Island is prevented under the Constitution from engaging in other than governmental work, and therefore cannot undertake private or semi-government contracts. In these circumstances, the Government cannot utilize its extensive and well-equipped plant, which cost a very large sum of money, on such works, and consequently the maintenance of the plant imposes a very heavy burden upon the taxpayers. It is hoped that the people of Australia will agree to an amendment of the Constitution so that it will be possible for the dockyard, not only to function as an aid to defence in time of war, but also in times of peace to carry out work for other than governmental authorities. </para>

              <para>- The plant is capable of doing all classes of engineering work. We can turn out there anything from a needle to a battleship. It is true that the shipbuilding undertaken at Cockatoo Island has in most cases been more costly than if it had been done overseas, but that is due to the fact that continuous work is available in the ship-yards in Great Britain, and the wages paid, and the conditions of employment there are not on the same high standard as are those in Australia. There are many directions in which the plant could be utilized, and it is regrettable thai it should now be practically idle. When negotiations were previously proceeding to lease the dockyard, the question of tenure was raised. It was suggested that the rent of the dockyard would eventually reach £50,000 a year, but there was very little likelihood of any company entering into an agreement under which such a high rental would be payable unless there was some security of tenure. It is most unlikely that a government would lease any portion of an establishment used for the manufacture and maintenance of war equipment, unless it could again assume control of the dockyard in case of war at very short notice. </para>

              <para>- I know that, but the owners of such establishments would have to be compensated. In this case it  is problematical whether compensation would be paid. I rose more particularly to impress upon honorable senators the need for an amendment of the Constitution to enable the Cockatoo Island Dockyard to be used during periods of peace on other than governmental work. The Government is not opposed to the motion ; I personally prefer it to the amendment. If the motion were carried the only difficulty would be to provide the necessary money to give effect to it. The present financial stringency has made it impossible for the Government to undertake necessary public works, and that is why there are thousands of hungry and poorly clad men walking the roads of the country to-day. Unfortunately, many of these men and their families are on the verge of starvation. At present the Government cannot provide the money to give effect to the motion, and in the absence of increased constitutional powers cannot engage in private work. </para>

              <para>- That is the point. We may be able to reach a decision on the motion ; but if it is desired to keep the prestige of the Senate upon the high plane that senators wish it to be kept, the amendment needs a good deal of recasting. I propose to show the Senate the ridiculous position in which it will be placed if the amendment is adopted. It was evidently drafted in a hurry, handed in in its present form, and accepted.

The proposal embodied in the amendment is that the dockyard shall be leased immediately to a company for certain purposes, included among them being the provision of funds to build a number of vessels. Moreover the Opposition, which believes only in the most limited form of regulation of private enterprise, is prepared to impose on private enterprise a condition that the designs for the proposed vessels shall be drawn up and laid before Parliament before the close of the present session. </para>

              <para>- I am now speaking to the amendment which has been moved. If the Opposition believes that effect should be given to the principle embodied in the amendment, I appeal to it, for the sake of the dignity of the Senate, to recast the amendment. We on this side of the chamber do not wish to be held responsible in any way for a resolution couched in the language of the amendment. I admit that the motion could be further amended if this amendment is agreed to. If the Opposition feels that the contest should be between the principle enunciated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline> and that which apparently is in the mind of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> I suggest that the amendment be re-cast so that the two proposals can be discussed on a proper basis. I venture the opinion that not one member of the Opposition is prepared to allow a resolution to go forth from the upper chamber of the Federal Parliament in the form that this motion will take if the amendment is agreed to. The amendment proposes that the dockyard should be leased to a company which will, among other things, construct three vessels for the service with Tasmania, and provide the funds for their construction, and that in the preparation of the foregoing, the designs shall be submitted to Parliament before the close of the present session. I suggest that the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> should re-cast his amendment so that a decision can be arrived at between the relative merits of his proposal and that of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn.</inline></para>

              <para>- It is strange to hear a' supporter of the Government urging it to carry out its election promises. The Government should welcome any attempt made by Parliament to relieve it of the responsibility of maintaining the Cockatoo Island Dockyard. The Minister said that it was hampered by the Constitution in making full use of the dockyard equipment, inasmuch as the High Court had ruled that the dockyard could not undertake private work. For that reason, the Government should accept the amendment. If it is agreed to, and a lessee is found for the dockyard, provision ought to be made for any necessary repairs to naval vessels to be effected there. </para>

              <para>- That is so. The passing of such an amendment would enable us to know where we stood. It would be impossible to find a company which would be prepared to lease the works and also find the money to build three vessels. The difficulty which has arisen in connexion with. Cockatoo Island Dockyard is not confined to that place. Ministers who have had control of the Defence Department know that the small arms factory at Lithgow and the ammunition factory at Maribyrnong are handicapped for the same reason. They have tremendous plants, but there is not sufficient money available to keep either the plants or the employees at work, and the Government is losing considerably on the capital lying idle at the present moment. I do not suppose it would be possible to secure from a lessee sufficient to pay a reasonable rate of interest on the enormous capital expenditure at Lithgow and Cockatoo Island ; but we might be able to make up some of the leeway. I do not think that the lessee could take objection to a lease on the ground that the works would be required by the Government in time of war, as was suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes.</inline> In war time all private enterprises are liable to be commandeered by the Government and carried on in the public interest, compensation, of course, being paid where there is any disturbance to the actual work in progress at the time. I rose to suggest an alteration to the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> but I understand that it is not possible for me to. move any amendment while that of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce's</inline> is before the Senate. </para>
