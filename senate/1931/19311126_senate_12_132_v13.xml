                    <para>My dear Prime Minister, In acknowledging receipt of your letter of the 20th November, 1931, I have to say that, in view of the present constitutional position of the Governor -General of a dominion, as determined by the Imperial Conference of 1926, confirmed by that of 1930, 1 am of opinion, after careful consideration, that it is my duty in existing circumstances to accept the advice tendered by you and accordingly to grant the dissolution asked for. 1 note that parliamentary provision has already been made for carrying on the necessary public services. </para>
                    <para>Forthe principles upon which I act I make reference to various works by Professor Berriedale Keith, in which passages occur relating to the duty of a Governor-General in such a case as the  present.  In his <inline font-style="italic">Responsible Government in theDominions</inline> (1928),at pages 147and 148, there is a passage beginning - <inline font-weight="bold">"Mr. King</inline> then very properly advised Lord Byng . . . ", and ending with  the  words " political realities ". In  his  work, <inline font-style="italic">The Sovereignty of the British Dominions</inline> (August, 1929), I refer to pages 244-246, and especially to the passage on page 245 beginning "There is, in fact, no dominion tradition comparable . . . ", and ending "conform to British practice ". Lastly in, I believe, his latest word, <inline font-style="italic">Dominion Autonomy in Practice</inline> (September, 1929), there is a passage at page 5 where, after quoting the resolution of  the  Imperial Conference of 1926, the learned author says - " The essential result of this pronouncement, which is inapplicable to  the  States  or  provinces, is to require the Governor-General to assimilate  his official  notion  to that  of  the  King  in the  United Kingdom. It  does not  mean that he is deprived of all authority  to  refuse to act on ministerial advice, for,  if  for instance after one unsuccessful dissolution Ministers asked  him  to grunt another, he would clearly he bound to refuse  thus to  violate  the  Constitution. But  it  means that he should, save in extreme crises, accept  the  advice  of  Ministers, as readily  us did the  King in 1924, when he dissolved Parliament at the request  of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ramsay</inline> MacDonald without trying to find an alternative government". </para>
                    <para>Even apart from  the  practice recognized by  the  Imperial Conference of 1920, there are considerations in  the  known circumstances which tend to support  the  acceptance of the advice tendered to me. "They are such as the strength and relation of various parties in  the  House  of  Representatives, and  the  probability  in any  case  of  an early election being necessary . </para>

                        <para>. -by <inline font-style="italic">leave</inline> - I place on the table of the Senate for the information of honorable senators a copy of the bill to give effect to the Statute of Westminster, which is now before the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Honorable senators will note that the bill does not contain the second part of paragraph 2 of clause 4 of the resolution passed by both Houses of this Parliament in July last. These words were added to the resolution when it was before Parliament as a further assurance against any possible interference by the Commonwealth Parliament with matters solely within the authority of the States. As a still further assurance, this Parliament last month passed a further resolution, the terms of which are contained in clause 9 (2) of the bill. The Government in the United Kingdom informed the Commonwealth Government that the omission of the words to which I have referred was based upon the view that the omitted provision was fully covered by the later resolution, which was intended to be in substitution for it. In reply, the Commonwealth Government informed the Government in the United Kingdom that that was not its intention, but that in its view there was a distinction between the two provisions. Whilst both refer to legislation by the Parliament at Westminster in respect of matters within the exclusive powers of the States, the omitted words provide that the statute does not authorize a request by the Commonwealth for such legislation without the concurrence of the States, and the supplementary resolution means that a request by a State for such legislation docs not require the concurrence of the Commonwealth, where such concurrence is not required by the existing constitutional practice. The Government in the United Kingdoms proposed that the clause be omitted for the present, and that the question of its later insertion be considered after the consultation with the States, which has been promised before the statute is brought into operation in Australia. As the Government in the United Kingdom is advised that the omission of the clause meanwhile cannot affect the rights of the States, the Commonwealth Government has acquiesced in this proposal. </para>

                            <para>- We are about to approach the electors, and I should like the Senate, which has persistently declared that this Government has had no mandate from the people relating to this particular branch of its industrial policy, to give it an opportunity to obtain a mandate. I am also opposing the motion because I wish to show the waterside workers of this country who are their friends in this chamber. I regret that the Government has been, driven from office at a time when it was fighting to ensure decent conditions for all waterside workers during the approaching Christmas season. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hoare</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Halloran</inline> know the conditions that obtain at Port Adelaide. They know that, thanks to this Government, a measure of justice has been meted out to a considerable number of deserving men at that port, irrespective of what might have happened at other ports. But the vagaries of politics have intervened, and, the Government having been defeated, we are about to appeal to the country. In the meantime, the waterside workers are to be thrown to the wolves. </para>

                            <para>- I have heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> on the floor of this chamber praise the Government for measures introduced by it, and say that it was the first Government that had had the courage to bring down those measures. I refer to the Wheat Act, and to the Government's action in regard to wool. No matter what section of the public the Government has to deal with, justice will be meted out. The waterside workers have suffered a temporary reverse, for we know that these regulations will be disallowed, and the waterside workers will be driven back to the level from which this Government lifted them. But it is only a temporary reverse, and their star of hope is the return of the present Government to office. If we are returned with a majority, we shall continue to regulate the conditions on the waterfront as we have done in the past, until such time as we are again turned out of office. </para>

If the Scullin-Theodore Government had stuck to this issue in a true working-class spirit, it would not have been forced to vacate the treasury bench, and the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> -would have had no opportunity to move the disallowance of the regulations. But, in the last eighteen months, we have had the spectacle of a cowardly, vacillating government. We members of the Lang or Beasley group, or of the Labour party of New South Wales - call it what you will - refuse to allow <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly,</inline> in the dying moments of this Parliament, to get a statement into <inline font-style="italic">Ilansard</inline> which lie and his supporters may use with advantage when appealing to the people. The suggestion was that the members of  any group  had thrown the waterside workers to the wolves. </para>

                        <para>. - Honorable senators on both sides of the chamber will readily agree with my statement that the passing and disallowance of these regulations, and the repetition of that procedure, has not been what one might term an eminently satisfactory way of dealing with the conditions on the waterfront. In fact, we tend to heap ridicule on parliamentary institutions if we cannot act in a more definite manner regarding such an important matter. The only, method by which we can have the regulations in operation for a time is by frequently passing them, and the only way in which the Opposition can thwart us, and give effect to the will of the majority of honorable senators, is by disallowing them. A game of battledore and shuttlecock has been proceeding throughout this lengthy session, and neither side can flatter itself on having discovered a satisfactory solution of this problem. While the position remains as at present, I shall vote against any disallowance of these regulations, as I have consistently done. The statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> undoubtedly conveys the implication that the members of my group, who had some hand in bringing about the present crisis, are guilty of throwing the waterside workers to the wolves. The honorable gentleman did not state that directly, but, undoubtedly, his statement contained that implication. </para>

                            <para>- If the disallowance of these regulations prevents their reenactment, I believe that, finally, the result will be much more satisfactory than has been the position under the method adopted hitherto. A real Labour Government would have made it impossible for a hostile Senate to thwart it. The present Government has not displayed that courage and consistency which one would expect, considering the position it has occupied. We are confident that the vast bulk of the waterside workers, and of all other workers will be well satisfied with the part that we have played in the present crisis. </para>

                        <para>. - I recognize that it is not of much use to appeal to honorable senators to reject this motion-. But I remind those who to-day profess to be the friends of the waterside workers and of other trade unionists, that they will not be able to shelve their responsibility for the position in which the waterside workers will be left. Despite <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn's</inline> disavowal, the fact remains that the principal object of the group to which he belongs has been to bring down the Government; and in bringing down the Government the genuine waterside workers also have been brought down. </para>

                            <para>- We differ from that view. It is our belief that work on the waterfront has always rightfully belonged to the members of the Waterside Workers Federation, whose organization has been built up on the waterfront and who have given good service to this country. Because trouble occurs - as it always has occurred and always will occur - and in a time of .depression and unemployment there are to be found men who will accept whatever work is offering, at any wage, that is no justification for the breaking clown of this organization, which for years has fought to obtain decent conditions for its members. </para>

                        <para>.- Any one who will take the trouble to read the policy speech of the present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> at the last general elections will find that that right honorable gentleman then made the definite promise to cheering crowds of waterside workers that, if his party were returned to power, it would immediately repeal the Transport Workers' Act. That promise was echoed by every Labour candidate at that else tion. The present Government has been in power for two years, yet it has never made any attempt, in either this or another place, to repeal that act. It, and it alone, can rightly be charged with cowardice by the waterside workers, because it has not been game to stand up to the pledge that it made to them. The Government has not repealed the act and the responsibility for not attempting to repeal it rests on its leader. </para>

                        said that in times of industrial strife men. will come forward ;md do any old work for any old wage that is offering. I ask the honorable senator if the volunteers on the waterfront have worked for what are known as "scab" wages? These men whom honorable senators on this side of the chamber have been trying to protect for the last two years, obeyed an award of the court when members of the Waterside Workers Federation refused to do so. Men who are prepared to obey the law of the land sire entitled to the protection of Parliament, and that is all that honorable senators on this side have been trying to give to these men. At any rate, there was no justification for the sneering remark of
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dooley</inline>
                        that the volunteers have endeavoured to break down the industrial conditions of Australia. They obeyed an award of the court; they worked under award conditions; they fulfilled the "letter of the law when another section of the community deliberately broke it.

                        <para>. -  I can tell <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> that the Government is obeying the wish of the waterside workers in refraining from attempting to repeal the Transport Workers Act. I do not know why honorable senators opposite are displaying such a vindictive spirit towards the members of the Waterside Workers Federation, particularly when these men recently declined to accede to the wishes of the Seamens Union, and go on strike. No one can dispute the fact that they are doing their work efficiently, and that peace has reigned on the waterfront for quite a long period. It is true, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> has said, that the loyalists did not work for lower wages than were paid to the members of the Waterside Workers Federation, but if the opportunity offered theY would do so. That opportunity is not offered because the shipowners would be liable to penalties if they paid lower rates of wage than are set out  in the  award of the Arbitration Court. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline> says that he wants to help the waterside workers, yet he helps  the  Nationalist party to defeat a government which is giving preference to the members of the Waterside Workers Federation.

In the  meantime, however, honorable senators" opposite should recognize the peaceful attitude adopted by the members of  the  union. At least they should give some consideration to the fact that the unionists remained at their work when the seamen asked them, to go out on strike. I  am  assured that the shipowners arc getting more efficient work from the unionists than from the loyalists. That is only to be expected because the unionists are practical men; the others are not. At any rate, no vessel handled by unionists has had to be unloaded and restevedored I am assured that if the shipowners had their way, they would employ none  but  unionists, because of their greater efficiency in the work of loading and unloading vessels. </para>

                        <inline font-style="italic">tha</inline>
                        lines adopted on previous occasions have been followed to-day, with one or two slight diversions. On this occasion, honorable senators on the ministerial benches have indulged in some rather uncomplimentary remarks towards one another. They have been expressing about one another opinions which formerly, in unison, they expressed about -honorable senators on this side of the chamber. It would seem that the more they fall out' among themselves, the bettor chance we have of escaping the criticism which has always been our common lot. If ever we were inclined to say anything harsh or unfriendly about honorable senators on the ministerial side, we could not do better than repeat what they have been saying about one another, but, of course, we would never dream of going that far.

                    <para>We are within measurable distance of that festive season when the spirit of goodwill and amity should prevail among men, but there seems to be no inclination on the"' part of ministerial senators to give up the old vendetta, and go the least hair's breadth out of their way to give a chance to the other" fellow to live. The object of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> is to ensure a share of the work on the waterfront to all who may apply, without reserving any portion of it to a favoured few. Honorable senators on the government benches, times out of number, have said that' the words "liberty, equality, fraternity" are emblazoned on their banner. If this regulation is not disallowed, where does liberty, equality, or fraternity come in? The loyalists certainly have liberty to starve. These mcn, whom we are anxious to assist by providing them with a few days' work, would not receive a meal if this Government had its way. This action is taken by a party that is supposed to believe in liberty, equality and fraternity. It is about time the Government dropped this humbug, this mere pretence of virtue. These regulations, which it, is now proposed to disallow, would never have been brought before this chamber had the members of the Waterside Workers Federation observed the awards of the Arbitration Court, which are  an  integral part of the law of this country. </para>
                    <para class="block">This Government, of all governments, should tell the waterside workers that it is their duty, as sane and worthy citizens, to obey the law. Instead of doing that, it throws a mantle of protection around that section of the community which, instead of observing the law, has flagrantly disobeyed it. Having arrived at this peculiar state of affairs in a free democracy, it is difficult to realize what the average citizen thinks. Arbitration, which is the policy of this country, has always been strongly advocated by members of the Labour party who are now assisting those who have flagrantly disregarded it. If these men continue to break the law, the time will surely come when there will be no respect for law of any kind. I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bae</inline> that should such an unfortunate state of affairs exist in a free democracy, the weaker element in our midst will suffer more than any other section of society. The law is calculated to secure and protect the rights of the minority - the weaker section as against the large and influential section which, in most cases, is able to protect itself. If a stage is ever reached when the lav/  is  openly flouted, the weaker section will be crushed. Even at this late hour, I ask honorable senators supporting the Government to realize the position which actually exists. How many men are affected by these regulations? There are about 10,000, as compared with another 900,000 who are directly and indirectly affected. For the sake of this miserable remnant of trade unionism, Australia's essential services have been seriously impaired. Why should the valuable time of this chamber be wasted in serving those who have flagrantly disregarded the law? History shows us that the man who brings the law into contempt, is the best friend of the tyrant. History has a habit of repeating itself, and I warn honorable senators opposite that the laws on the statute-book of this country must be observed. If this practice is to be continued, the Government will be taking the first effective step towards bringing the law into contempt, and in doing so, will be crushing the weaker section of the community which  it  should endeavour to protect. I support  the motion. </para>

                        <para>. -  It seems rather undignified for the Senate to repeatedly disallow regulations which the Government has issued. It has been said that the Government is within its  right3  in issuing regulations, and that the Senate is acting legally in disallowing them. I trust that finality will some day be reached in this matter. The action of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> in moving to disallow these regulations, appears to be based on a promise given to those whom he terms loyalists - men who, when industrial trouble occurred, undertook work declined by those who regarded the conditions under which it was offering as objectionable. A promise was made by a certain political section to stand by those who undertook the work which should legitimately be done by the members of the Waterside Workers Federation; but when that political party appealed to the electors, its policy was not endorsed, and another Government came into power. In those circumstances, it seems that those who favour the disallowance of these regulations were relieved of their undertaking to the loyalists, the country having by an overwhelming majority decided against support being given to those whom honorable senators opposite are anxious to assist. This Government has decided to stand behind the recognized trade unions of this country. These so-called loyalists are not members of genuine trade union organizations. </para>

                            <para>- I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> who termed them law-breakers, what would have happened to the people of Ireland had they always obeyed the law. Would they have had Home Rule to-day? No one would seriously suggest that the laws which we have assisted to pass should be broken; but, when a crisis occurs men commit acts which in their calmer moments they would not attempt. Recently action has been taken in this Senate which I never though would be attempted by a Labour government; but its action was justified on the score of the existence of a national crisis. Certain industrialists on the waterfront acted in the way they did, because they were confronted with a set of conditions which they regarded as unjust; while human, nature is as it is, men will always fight against an injustice. The disallowance of these regulations will not help those whom honorable senators opposite are anxious to assist. Owing- to the general depression, shipping activities on the Australian coast are at a low ebb, particularly at Port Adelaide, where there is less work on the waterfront than there has ever been in the history of that port. When the trouble first occurred, the places of men whose only work had been on the waterfront were immediately taken hy young men from all parts of the country, who came in motor cars and on motor bicycles to do what they considered was their duty to their country. Although they thought they - were doing right, I think that their action was wrong. </para>

                            <para>- They were doing wrong in depriving others- of their rights. It is easy for an honorable senator, who sits on a cushioned bench in this chamber, to abuse and condemn the action of waterside workers, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> did, but that honorable senator should - realize that laws will be broken sometimes even by those who make them. As this may be the last opportunity I may have of speaking in the Senate, I appeal to honorable senators opposite to realize that the fes-' tive season is approaching, and that it is their responsibility, as well as ours, to extend goodwill toward all men. Unfortunately, owing to the conditions which exist, there is insufficient work on the waterfront for all those who are seeking it. As there are ten nien for every job that is offering, as is the case in the coalmining industry, we contend that preference should be given to those whose only work has been on the wharfs. If these regulations are disallowed, the Government may issue others, because it seems that the only way in which to restore peace on the waterfront is by giving preference to members of the Waterside Workers Federation. Some honorable senators have suggested that it is the duty of this Government to repeal the Transport Workers' Act, and I hope that it will eventually be repealed, because such an act should not remain on the statute-book of this country. The objective of this Government has been to restore peace on the waterfront, and to act justly towards those whose duty it is to work on the wharfs, instead of giving preference to those who, in order to secure employment, have to  be  licensed and registered as if they were dogs. I shall vote against the disallowance of these regulations, because I believe that, apart from the legal aspect, the Government is acting in  a  humanitarian way and rendering the greatest sei' vice to the greatest number. </para>

                        <para>. - I intend to support 'this motion, which, if carried, will give the loyalists on the waterfront an opportunity to earn an honest crust for themselves, their wives, and children, who for a long time have been persecuted by this Government and by the members of Waterside Workers Federation. This Government, which pretends to believe in arbitration, is openly supporting those who have flagrantly defied an award of the Arbitration Court. The members of that federation have engineered strike after strike, and, in holding up the essential services of this Country. have seriously interfered with the  despatch  of perishable produce. During the war period they even declined  to  handle comforts intended for our soldiers- who were fighting overseas. Notwithstanding their actions, this Government  i3  anxious to give them preference, and entirely to disregard those who  came  to the assistance of the country in its hour of  need.  The  men  whom honorable senators on this side  arc  anxious  to  protect  are  members of  the  Permanent and Casual Wharf Labourers Union, an organization registered in  the  Arbitration Court. The members  of that  organization do  not  believe in working for  less  than  the  recognized wage, or longer than  the  standard  hours.  They have done  far  more to uphold  the  traditions of unionism than those shirkers whom  the  Government is anxious to protect. The unionists  for  whom we  are  endeavouring to secure  a  share  of the work on  the waterfront so that their wives and children may enjoy some of the decencies of life, have all along obeyed the awards of the Arbitration Court, and have done their work efficiently. There has been  a  marked change in the conditions ever since the passing of the Transport Workers Act by the Bruce-Page Government. Ships have been worked continuously, and I am glad to say that pilfering of cargo, which had become  a  grave scandal, has been almost entirely eliminated. The Waterside Workers Federation, aided and abetted by this Government, had by force of brutal numbers, time after time, intimidated and persecuted members of the Permanent and Casual Waterside Workers Union. These workers had even been pursued to their homes and, in some instances, their wives and children had been terrorized. On one occasion a number of waterside workers set upon a volunteer and endeavoured to throw him under a railway train. </para>

Ever since it came into power this Government has shown  a  marked preference for members of the Waterside Workers Federation who, prior to the passing of the Transport Workers Act, defied the Arbitration Court and attempted to hold up the transport services of this country. I support the motion with enthusiasm, because I believe in arbitration and in the preservation of law and order. </para>

                <para class="block">There is no need to debate this measure. Honorable senators are aware that it is consequential upon certain action which was taken in another place yesterday. The Government is asking for the validation of its tariff proposals for a period of three months, and I may add that it  is  approaching the forthcoming election with that spirit of optimism which has marked its administration. It is not considered necessary to ask for the validation of the tariff for a longer period than three months, because we believe that, after the appeal to the people, we  will  have sufficient members in this chamber to enable us to make speedier progress in the consideration of our tariff proposals than has been possible  in  the last few weeks. </para>

                        <para>. -  I desire to protest against the futility of Parliament endeavouring to exercise any control over tariff schedules that are brought down from time to time. I have been a member of the Senate for two and a half years now, and during the whole of that time I have been waiting for the opportunity to vote for a reduction of successive tariffs. This is the second occasion upon which the Senate, since my election to it, has been asked to ratify, <inline font-style="italic">en bloc,</inline> oppressive and burdensome tariff schedules. In the present circumstances no other course is open to us, but I protest strongly against the fact that successive governments have, from time  to  time, imposed heavy taxation through the customs without giving the elected representatives of the people an opportunity to express an opinion upon the various items. During every parliamentary session many legislative proposals, dealing with matters of minor importance, and which have not affected the economic life of the country, have been discussed at great length in this chamber, but we have not been permitted to deal with tariff legislation which, as we know, so seriously affects the cost of living and production costs.  Always  on  the  eve of an election Parliament is asked  to  swallow the entire tariff schedule without any consideration whatever. </para>

That disposes of the point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston.</inline> This Government has been exceptionally anxious to have its tariff proposals placed before the Parliament. "When they reached this chamber, they were blocked on two occasions by motions for the adjournment of the Senate. Therefore,no honorable senator can complain that there has been any delay, due to government action, in discussing the tariff. Regarding the attack made on the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr.Forde), I invite <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson</inline> to seek the opinions of the manufacturers of this country, who have worked under the present tariff. </para>

                        <para>. - I take this opportunity of reminding you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> that there are only two trains a week from Western Australia to Canberra. On the last, and I believe on the previous, occasion when the Senate was called together after a recess, the day of meeting did not fit in with that time-table. There is a direct daily train service from every other mainland capital city to Canberra, and a regular steamer service from Tasmania. There is no reason that I can assign for the Senate's being called together on a day that involves honorable senators from Western Australia arriving in Canberra three days before the date fixed, if they are not to be one day late. We are just as much entitled as are honorable senators from other States to be placed in the position of being able to arrive on the day when the Senate meets. It is the more necessary that that should be so, since repeatedly we have found that the Government has had no business ready for the Senate to transact, and it has been necessary for us to adjourn our sittings for a week or a fortnight. I realize, of course, that when we next meet a new Government will be in charge of the affairs of this country. I trust that you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> will see that the inconvenience to which I have alluded is avoided. </para>

I fix whatever day and hour are requested by the Government. In every case, notice of at least fourteen days is given. Nearly all Western Australian members have a home in one of the eastern  States,  to which they generally proceed before coming on to Canberra. I shall, however, bear in mind the request of the honorable senator, and shall see that as convenient a time as possible is fixed for the next meeting of the Senate,ButI also remind him that our sessional orders recognize three sitting days - Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday; and it is generally on one of those days that the Senate meets. Honorable senators would have a decided objection to resuming on a Friday, because they would be brought here for only one day's work. </para>

                    <para>One  of  the great achievements  in the history of Australia has  been the successful  loan  conversion, which will save the Government  of  Australia £6,500,000 by reduced interest,  and  will save the other borrowers fully another £6,000,000. A new spirit  of  confidence pervades the land. Our primary products  are  bringing higher prices, particularly wheat  and  wool, and " it is my opinion," <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Moloney</inline> said, " that we have at  last turned the corner."

                </talk.start>
                <para>I consider that the action that I and others have taken has been in the best interests of this country and ultimately of the Labour movement of this country in particular. I deeply regret anything that may prevent the members of the Waterside Workers Federation from getting fair and decent treatment, and I have consistently backed up the Government in its fragmentary efforts to bring about that result; but my belief is that by the action that I, along with others, have recently taken, we shall ultimately achieve a very much better condition of affairs with regard to employment generally. On. both sides honorable senators must realize that so long as there is any dispute or quarrel between two sections of the working class to get employment, there must be something very wrong with society. To-day we have one party getting a crust only by turning the other party out; there is such a deficiency of employment for the people able and willing to work that there is a continuous dispute or feud - it may even be termed a vendetta - between men in employment and men out of employment in an effort to get what work is offering. It is obvious that a state of society which sentences people to such intolerable conditions in the midst of plenty is absolutely wrong. I reiterate my belief that no permanent relief can be achieved until we utterly destroy the capitalistic system. While that system exists these struggles must continue. The workers must struggle for better conditions or against any worsening of conditions. A constant struggle is the only way in which they can keep themselves in training, as it were, to prevent their gradual subjection to a state of economic servitude. Consequently, in any measures they take, whether it means breaking the law or not, if they lead to a bettering of their conditions I shall stand behind them. So far as the Arbitration Act is concerned, the only thing that has rendered its administration -in the least degree decent is that, from time to time, persons have been game enough to flout awards of the Arbitration Court that have been flagrantly and notoriously unjust. When we talk so much, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> does, of the sanctified nature of law and order and of observing the law under all circumstances, I recollect that as a child I was taught to venerate as some of the greatest heroes in British history, those who had made progress possible by breaking the law. </para>

                        <para>- I do not say that all progress has been made by the breaking of laws, and I do not detract from what benevolent people have done by introducing legislation to ameliorate bad conditions; but in many instances, only by deliberately breaking the law have we taken a step forward and higher in the progress of human society. This veneration for law is, in my opinion, an absolute absurdity. In fact, it is worse than that. It is a pernicious superstition. </para>

According to their lights Ministers have conducted the business of the chamber very well indeed. I have the kindliest of thoughts and feelings for the officers of the Senate and for the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff, whose courtesy and help we have always appreciated.

                    <para>. -  As a comparatively new senator and politician, and also as a comparatively new Minister, I desire to join with other honorable senators in expressing the heartiest wishes for the best of all good things to all honorable senators during the coming festive season. I appreciate to the full the good work which has been done by the staff engaged in this chamber. I trust that the political fight in which we. are about to engage, and I believe that it augurs well for the party of which I am a member, whatever may be the result we shall still ho friends. I have a good deal of sympathy with the view expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae&gt;</inline> of whom I am personally very fond. I regard him as a sincere man, and although I disagree with the methods by which he would bring about a change, I realize that his utterances have at all times a ring of sincerity. I have always maintained that Labour can win out by abiding by the law. Even if a law be considered to be unjust, pressure may be brought upon the Government to amend it. I believe that in Australia we have the ' necessary constitutional machinery to give effect to the wishes of a majority of the people. I am afraid that it will be  impossible for Australia to progress unless we are prepared to abide by the law whether it be of our own making, or that which has been placed on the statute-book by our political opponents. In Australia the people have the opportunity to express their wishes through the ballot-box, and in that way are able to return a government of the type they require. All that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> desires can be accomplished without struggle, disruption or revolution. Regardless of the Government which may be in power, I trust that this country will again reach a state of prosperity, and without spilling the blood of the Australian people. </para>

                    <para>. -  On behalf of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> and myself, I desire to extend to you, sir, to the officers of the Senate, including the members of the reporting staff, our appreciation of the manner in which the work of this chamber has been carried out. Although I have at times come into conflict with you, sir, and may do so again in the future, I have done so only because there has been some difference of opinion between us with respect to the proper interpretation of the Standing Orders. When you have proved that I have been in the wrong, I have always been willing to apologize; but I think that there have been occasions when your ruling should have been tempered with mercy. It is not the wish of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> nor of myself to do anything detrimental to any citizen of this country; but the political fight in which we are about to engage is to be fought to a finish. We have no apology to make for the course which we have adopted. Neither do 1 wish to apologize in any way for the action which I took in opening the attack on the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Theodore)</inline> or to withdraw a single word which I have uttered against him. The charges , which I made are already recorded in the reports of the official proceedings of this chamber. Having attended caucus meeting, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> and I, as representatives of New South Wales, which is the key State politically, realized that many of the  cherished principles of Labour, which constitute the fighting plank of the Labour party's platform, had been violated. That, however, is a matter which can be more appropriately discussed during the approaching campaign 1 have always found the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Barnes)</inline> and the two Assistant Ministers, prompt iu supplying information required by our constituents iu Kew South Wales, and in giving that assistance which we sometimes required. In reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dooley,</inline> may I say that we hare endeavoured always to fight the cause of the waterside workers, and they know that we would not take any action that would jeopardize their interests. They know where we stand and wc can readily answer any charge that may be made against us by our opponents. I wish you, sir, the members of the staff, honorable senators generally, and the press, the compliments of the season. </para>

May I also he allowed to express thanks on behalf of those in this chamber who are always silent - I refer to the clerks at the table, and to the members of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff. In doing so, I should like to place on record my high appreciation of the work they have done for our comfort, convenience, benefit and better being. I also thank , honorable senators for the consideration which they have extended to me. Speaking in my corporeal capacity, and without that ghost-like attribute which the Leader of the Senate ascribed to me, when he said that I sometimes rule with an iron hand, may I suggest that the iron was often extremely malleable when turned in his direction. I trust that honorable senators will have a particularly pleasant Christmas, and I repeat the hope which I expressed a little while ago, that, in the coming fight, now that the gage has been thrown down, the old wish of the herald, "May God defend the right ", will be fulfilled. </para>
