I, therefore, decided to ascertain when he would arrive in Canberra. In order that there may be no secret about the matter, I may explain that I instructed my private secretary to ask the manager of the local branch of the Commonwealth Bank if he knew when <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Gibson would arrive, and where he would be staying. My private secretary was informed that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Gibson would be arriving from Goulburn or Sydney by motor car. The manager of Canberra branch of the Commonwealth Bank was not sure where <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Gibson would be staying, but informed my private secretary that as soon as he knew he would advise him. I had prepared a list of the questions that I proposed to put to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert,</inline> and I personally wrote him a letter to await his arrival in Canberra.

            <para>- I rise to a point of order. Is the honorable senator in order in quoting from a newspaper statements which, under the Standing Orders, the honorable senator himself would not be permitted to make?

That is a reflection on this chamber. </para>

That, together with an improvement of world prices for our exportable products, will give a great stimulus to Australian manufactures.

It was stated, however, that funds were not available to pay the travelling expenses, &amp;c., of a representative of the domestic consumers, and it was urged that the Government meet this liability. As it was thought most desirable that the domestic consumers should have representation on the committee, payment of transport and out-of-pocket expenses was approved in this case. After the committee had been sitting for some time the Australian Canning Fruit-growers Association intimated that further funds were not available to continue the payment of the expenses of their representation <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. W. Young),</inline> and asked that, in order to prevent his withdrawal at that stage, the Government should bear his transport and out-of-pocket expenses. This proposal was approved, and £104 has been paid to him as expenses. This amount was inadvertently omitted from the reply given to the honorable senator on the 30th April. No remuneration for services (other than the ordinary salaries of the departmental officials) has been paid by the Government to any member of the committee . Any payments made to members of the committee have been to cover out-of-pocket expenses. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir GEORGE</inline>PEARCE (Western Australia) [3.36]. - The Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Barnes)</inline> a few moments ago charged me with discourtesy because I did not supply to him a list of the questions which I proposed to ask <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Gibson,  Chairman  of the Commonwealth Bank Board, who was summoned to the bar of the Senate yesterday. I wish now to assure the honorable gentleman that no discourtesy on my part was intended. I did not think he would expect me to furnish him with a list. I may add that, if my omission to do so could be construed as an act of discourtesy, he also must plead guilty to the same charge, because he did not supply me with a list of the questions which he proposed to ask. </para>

            <para>. - I direct attention to the nature of the replies furnished to me yesterday in answer to questions which I put to the Leader of the Senate with reference to the total amount of revenue collected by the Government in primage duties on jute goods, phosphoric rock, sulphur and fertilizers. The replies stated that the estimated amount of primage duty received for bags and sacks totalled £88,104, and the amount paid on rock phosphates, sulphur and fertilizers was £25,367. I wish to emphasize that these excessive charges on our primary industries have been imposed, so far, without the approval of Parliament. This Government has acted as though it were the sole dictator in the Commonwealth. Without reference to Parliament, it has imposed whatever taxation it has considered necessary. Since November, 1929, the fateful time when it took office, we have had list after list of tariff schedules, all imposing excessive burdens on our primary industries, and only now are members of another place being given the opportunity to consider them. The original primage duty on all imports was 21/2 per cent. Later, again without the approval of Parliament, it was increased to 4 per cent., and up to date this Government has exacted a total of no less than £113,471 from our wool and wheat industries at a time when they can least afford to pay the extra taxation. Because of the low prices ruling overseas for our exportable products, our primary industries are passing through a period of depression without parallel during the last 25 years. The Government chooses this time to impose new tariff charges which are nothing short of barefaced robbery. This additional burden has been imposed on the wheat industry at a time when it has been promised, but has not received, assistance from the Government. That assistance was approved by both Houses of the Commonwealth Parliament; yet the Government has done nothing to give effect to that decision. Many other sections of the community are being assisted by this Parliament. Previously, when an act was passed granting assistance to an industry, that industry received the benefit of it. The wheat industry stands alone in having failed to reap the advantage of an act passed by both Houses. The act approved of the payment of 3s. a bushel f.o.b. for the last wheat crop, Not a farthing of that amount has been received by the wheat-growers from the Government. On the contrary, this huge burden is added to the costs of their jute goods, and to the fertilizer that is absolutely necessary to the conduct of their operations in most parts of Australia, particularly where the soil is not sufficiently fertile to produce wheat at a profit without fertilization. </para>

          <para class="block">The second question that I asked was - </para>
          <para class="block">Are the exporters of wheat and wool entitled to a refund of the primage duties paid on cornsacks and wool bales? If not, why not? </para>
          <para class="block">The answer that I was given was, " No ". Why is it that every other person who imports goods into Australia, and then exports them, is given a drawback of the amount of duty paid? The sum of £88,104  has been collected in primage duty, very largely on cornsacks and woolpacks that have subsequently been exported.Why is there not a drawback of the amount of duty paid on those goods when they are exported? Refunds of duty are paid on many other commodities when they are exported. We learn from the newspapers that in Adelaide the master of a Norwegian vessel purchased out of bond a motor car for the sum of  5s.  That car was brought into Australia, but no duty was paid upon it, since the purchaser shipped it away again. Yet duty is charged on cornsacks, which are necessary for the carrying on of our great wheat industry, and the woolpacks that are needed by those who are engaged in the pastoral industry. These sacks and packs are simply filled with grain and wool, and immediately exported; yet the Government refuses to refund the amount paid in primage duty when they entered Australia. If any section of the community is given a drawback of duty when the article upon which it has been paid is exported, the primary producers ought to have that consideration extended to them, particularly at a time like the present. I hope that the Government will agree to the whole of these primage duties being refunded immediately the jute goods are exported. </para>

            <para>. -  Replying to the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> I assure the right honorable gentleman that, although I considered it a discourtesy to me that he did not supply me with a list of the quesions that he proposed to ask <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Gibson yesterday, I took the view that that discourtesy was quite unintentional. I was not similarly discourteous to the right honorable gentleman, because I did not notify <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Gibson in advance of the questions that I proposed to ask him, and, in fact, did not prepare a list of them before his appearance at the bar of the Senate. </para>

          <para>It is somewhat queer that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> should be continually complaining - I might almost say, wailing - about the disabilities under which the farmers of his State are suffering. My mind goes back to the situation that developed in this chamber a few months ago when the Government, in its anxiety to help the farmers not onlyof Western Australia, but also of every other State, placed before this Senate certain proposals which it desired to have made law. In contradistinction to the honorable senator's travail at the present time, on the important occasion when his vote would have counted for something, and would have enabled assistance to be given to the farmers of his and other States, where was he? It would have been necessary to place a bullockbell on him to keep track of his movements. It ill becomes the honorable senator to endeavour to impose on the farmers of his State by making it appear that he is doing his best to help them, when at that crucial period he failed to to do what lay in his power on their behalf. </para>
