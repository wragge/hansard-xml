                        <para>That the Senate condemns the action of the Government in taking advantage of the fact that Parliament was not sitting, to promulgate regulations under the Transport Workers Act, having for their object the victimization of loyal workers in the waterside industry. The Senate, having previously disallowed Regulations having a similar effect, regards the action of the Government as a deliberate flouting of the decision of the Senate; and requests the Government to at once lay the amending Regulations upon the table of each House of the Parliament in order that Parliament may have an opportunity of expressing its will in regard to them. </para>

                    <para class="block">The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. West</inline> was well known to every member of the Federal Parliament. During his long association with this legislature his sterling character and geniality endeared him to all with whom he came in contact. Every member of both Houses had the highest regard for his many estimable qualities, and, indeed, a great love for him. He would do no one an ill turn, on the contrary he was prepared to submit himself to many inconveniences if by doing so he could help his fellows. </para>

                        death is a distinct loss to the community; but we must console ourselves with the thought that death is the lot of all, and that our late colleague and friend lived to a fairly ripe old age. He entered the Federal Parliament in 1910, and was a member continuously until his death on the 5th February last, representing the constituency of East Sydney for the whole of that period. From 1920 to 1925 he was a member of the Joint Committee on Public Accounts, and for many years before he entered Parliament was an active and prominent worker in the Labour movement.
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. West</inline>
                        was conscientious and enthusiastic in the discharge of his public duties, and even in his failing years insisted upon taking a full share of the  work which devolves on all members during the sittings of Parliament, when he might have reasonably spared himself. I couldcontinue at considerable length in a eulogy of our late colleague, but his splendid record speaks for itself and makes further comment by me unnecessary. I am sure that the motion expresses the feelings of every honorable senator.

                        West in the Labour party of those days. When the conscription issue alienated certain members from that party, the late

                        proved himself to be above the uncharitableness of party bitterness. He was big enough to differ with one on party principles without allowing such differences to disturb his personal friendships.  His  nature was too kindly and generous to permit him to bear rancor. It was because of that commendable trait in his character that " old John West," as he was generally called, was loved by members on both sides of the chamber.

                        was very well known in political circles. Although I had nothing like the personal knowledge of him that I had of the late
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline>
                        West, I am confident that a similar eulogium may be applied to his services to the nation.

                    <para>The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bowden</inline> was first elected to the Commonwealth Parliament in 1906, as member for Nepean. He was defeated at the elections of 1910, and elected again in 1919, as member for Parramatta. He was  chairman  of the select committee on electoral law and procedure, and was also' a member of the Royal Commission on the Constitution. He held office as a Minister of the Crown, in the capacity of Minister for Defence, from February, 1923, to January, 1925, and was finally defeated at the general elections in 1929.  His  political life was a long one, and during it he rendered great service to the country. Notwithstanding his one or two defeats at elections, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bowden</inline> was always popular enough to be reinstated in the Federal Parliament, proving that he had the qualities of a fighter, and sufficient merit to impress upon the electors that occasionally they are wrong. </para>

                        in the Administration in which he held office as Minister for Defence, and we all recognized the conscientious manner in which he carried out his duties. He, too, was a man of sterling character and lovable disposition, and made friends on both sides of the House.  His  death is a loss to the. country. In expressing regret at his passing, and sympathy with his wife and family, I know that I am voicing the general opinion of honorable senators of the Opposition.  His  was a model home life, and his relatives must miss him sorely.

                <para class="block">Throughout the world the news of the recent calamitous happening in the Hawkes Bay district of New Zealand was received with deep regret. The earthquake was a tragic termination to the lives of many and must have been a fearful experience for those who survived it. News of happenings of this nature travels fast, and soon after the disaster wireless waves conveyed the sad intelligence to the rest of the. world. Throughout Australia, indeed, as in all other countries, it caused a feeling of profound sorrow. This week we have read in our newspapers of a similar tragedy in another part of the world, where also fearful havoc has been done to human life and property.

The New Zealand earthquake was one of those occasions which prove that blood is thicker than water, and that there is something real in the ties of kinship. The thrill of sympathy that passed throughout Australia when news of the tragedy was received was undoubtedly genuine and heartfelt. I feel sure that the people of New Zealand will appreciate the deep sympathy we offer them in the great trouble that has befallen them.

                    GEORGE PEARCE  (Western Australia) [3.29]. - I desire to avail myself of this opportunity to congratulate
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline>
                    on having been appointed the Leader of the Government in this chamber, and to say to him that, apart from the usual political fighting that takes place in every Parliament, he will receive from the Opposition the consideration that its members would expect to receive were our positions reversed - a consideration that we on this side endeavoured to give to his predecessor in office,
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly.</inline>
                </para>
                <para>I desire also to welcome <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dooley</inline> as a Minister, and to congratulate him on having so early in life assumed ministerial office. While I cannot wish him success in the way of a long term of office, I trust that he will find his duties congenial. I assure him that he will receive fair play from honorable senators on this side of the chamber. </para>
                <para>I cannot refrain from making a few general remarks on the ministerial changes that have taken place. I expected that the Senate would have been informed who is to act as Government Whip in this chamber. Are we still to regard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline> as Government Whip, seeing that so far there has been no announcement of his resignation? Obviously the Leader of the Opposition should know who is to be the Government Whip in the Senate. From what I have read in the newspapers - I do not say that the reports are correct - it would appear that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline> will indeed be Government Whip, although not in the usual parliamentary acceptation of the term. If press reports be correct, a little band, which includes the honorable senator and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae,</inline> proposes to give the Government a whip of a character which they will not altogether appreciate. I think we should be enlightened by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> as to whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline> is to act as a government " whip " in the sense I have just indicated, or to retain the position as one who is appointed to look after the Government's interests. If all we read is correct, I can hardly believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline> will act quite in that way. It seems to me that his view of what is in the interests of the Government is quite different from the viewpoint of the Government itself. I do not like to advise the Government in these matters, but I assume that they, and their supporters who read the newspapers, have learned of the decision of certain party organizations in New South Wales, and are wise enough to take precautions accordingly. The consideration I have raised is important and should not pass without comment, particularly when we see <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly,</inline> until recently the Leader of the Government in the Senate, now occupying a seat on the back benches. One would naturally have expected from the Minister some explanation of what happened to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly.</inline></para>

I have not heard any expressions of dissatisfaction concerning the ability displayed by

                    when leading the Government in this chamber. He apparently carried out his duties well. In fact, he received encomiums from honorable senators on this side of the chamber for the capacity he displayed in that office. But without any explanation he was suddenly decapitated ; his place taken by

                    PEARCE.Yes. The Senate is completely in the dark in regard to these sudden changes. We want to know why the ex-Leader of the Government in the Senate, who carried out the duties of that office with such distinction and ability, has been suddenly removed from it. I do not make any complaint with respect to the change over to
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes.</inline>
                    He has the respect of all of us. We all like him and will help him to the best of our ability. Nor am I opposed to the promotion of

                    to ministerial rank; but these lightning like changes coming as they did from a sky politically blue, although economically black, has left honorable senators on this side literally gasping with astonishment. Would it not be well to disclose these interesting secrets of the party room to the world at large?

                    PEARCE.They manage it very badly. I trust that before we adjourn the Leader of the Government will enlighten us on these matters and let us know why these lightning like changes have taken place. I am particularly anxious to know what is the position of
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline>
                    and

                    They sit on the Government benches looking as innocent as sucking doves, yet we are led to believe that they have some plan by which, if they are successful, they will in a few months be able to supplant the Ministry which they are supposed to be supporting. We have been led to believe that they are in favour of the so-called Lang plan, and, if that is successful, we shall see
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline>
                    or
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline>
                    leading the Senate and Senators Barnes and Dooley relegated to the back benches. These are matters of interest and importance to the community. We have been informed of changes in the Ministry, but no reason for them has been offered. We understand that Senators Dunn and Rae are plotting for another change. If they believe in democracy why do not they confide in the people through their representatives? Why not let the people know? Are they afraid? Surely they have not lost their trust in the democracy of which they speak so frequently.

As members of the Australian Labour party, SenatorRae and I are prepared to support that plan - whether it be the Lang or the Scullin plan - which, in our judgment, will best serve the people of Australia. We are proud of the fact that we took an active part in the by-election for East Sydney, and in the appeal then made to the people of Australia through the electors in that division. </para>

                        <para>.  - I appreciate very highly the kind remarks concerning myself whichfell from the lips of the Leader of the Opposition. I am glad to know that I stand so well in the estimation of honorable senators opposite. I assure them that I shall follow the example of my predecessor <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Daly),</inline> and will discharge the duties of my office to the best of my ability. I shall treat members of the Opposition with the fullest measure of courtesy and respect to which they are entitled. The right honorable the Leader of the Opposition appeared to assume that it was necessary for me to say something about the position of the Government Whip. As far as the official knowledge of this chamber goes, the position is not vacant; consequently, there is  110  need for an announcement on the subject. With regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly,</inline> no one regrets what took place more than I do, and if it is any comfort to the honorable gentleman I can say that what happened was not the fault of his colleagues in this chamber. Although the Leader of the Opposition made a number of facetious observations concerning recent changes in the Government, and other matters, I really do not think that he did so with the intention of throwing the apple of discord into the gallant little party which I am leading in this chamber. But if that really was his intention, let me say that they are too old in the political game to rise to that bait. I hope that we shall jog along comfortably and that by the time we have finished with our friends opposite we shall have a number of their political heads. I say this in all kindness of heart. </para>
