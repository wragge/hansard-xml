They provide that the  President  shall examine such witnesses, and that honorable ' senators may direct questions to them, through the  President.  That is what I propose shall be done this afternoon. I may add that, as is the procedure when a witness is giving evidence before a select committee of the Senate, each honorable senator who is examining will be required to ask his questions without interruption until his list has been exhausted. Then, except by leave of the Senate, his examination will be regarded as finished. </para>

        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline>Gibson. I should say, in the first instance, that the Bank of England, as such, has no direct financial engagements with any of the governments of Australia to-day, that is to say, the governments of Australia have no financial obligations to the Bank of England. The position as between the Bank of England and the Commonwealth Bank is one of inter-relation between two central banks. In all matters affecting finance as between the central banks of the world to-day, these banks are always prepared to assist, by information, by negotiation, or by helping in negotiations, to carry through affairs as between the nations. On the other hand the principle of the Bank of England is that, as a bank, it does not^ advance money to governments. Its particular function in regard to the banking of governments is confined practically to that of the British Government. So as further to explain the position, let me say that I am perfectly certain that the Bank of England would at any time do anything that lay in its power, and that came within its proper functions as a bank, to help Australia, either by influencing in its favour the market in London, or in any other way in which the directors felt that it would be justified in acting. </para>

        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline>Gibson. The Government has never communicated officially with the Bank Board in regard to the bill to amend the Commonwealth act; that is to say, the bill has never been sent to us for our advice, nor have we ever sent any official communication to the Government on the subject. I want to be perfectly fair and not to create any wrong impression in the minds of honorable senators; therefore, I should like to say at this' stage that, in my capacity as  Chairman  of the Board of Directors of the Commonwealth Bank, I, with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Riddle,</inline> the Governor of the Bank, have discussed with the Prime Minister and the Treasurer the difficulties that exist in London, and the steps that might be taken to meet them. Both I and the Governor of the Bank pointed out that, so far as the bank was concerned, we were unable, on account, of the existing position in regard to gold, to make any further, shipments of gold to London, if we were to maintain the reserve required by act of Parliament. It was suggested that we might ship gold to London, and that, it might be held there pending future developments, our action to be ratified by Parliament. The view that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Riddle</inline> and I took was that we should act strictly within the act of Parliament governing the matter, and that if anything should be done with that gold other than was prescribed by act of Parliament - which we in our wisdom were effectively carrying out - it should be a matter for the decision, not of the board, but of the Parliament itself. </para>

        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline>Gibson. The question put by the right honorable senator is not in accord with the facts. The bills referred to as falling due on the 30th June are not due to the Westminster Bank, but to the London bill market. These bills represent the sum of ?5,000,000, and they were discounted on the London bill market at . the end of last year. They are due for repayment in London on the 30th June next. The amount of ?5,000,000 owing to the Westminster Bank is another sum altogether. That was due on overdrafts granted to various State Governments, and has nothing to do with the ?5,000,000 due on the 30th June. The latter consists of bills on the London 1 market which must be either taken up or renewed. </para>

        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline>Gibson. The last renewal of bills effected in London was on the 31st December last. These bills, I should explain to honorable senators, had fallen due, and the money was required to replace them. At that time, the market was not very favorable, and the Commonwealth Bank took them off the market and immediately went on the market for another ?5,000,000. These were renewed with some difficulty at a discount of 5 per cent. These are the bills that are due on the 30th June. </para>

Inquiries made in London latterly have indicated that Australian bills in London would be very difficult to discount and would have to be discounted - if discountable - at a comparatively high rate of interest. So 'as to explain the position, I would point oat that ?5,000,000 worth of treasury-bills fell due on the 30th March last. We then found the market so unfavorable that we did not attempt to have them rediscounted; and the Commonwealth Bank found the ?5,000,000 to pay them off. These bills, therefore, have not been renewed, and the ?5,000,000 referred to became an increased debt on the part of the- Governments of Australia owing to the Commonwealth Bank. From our internal knowledge we are aware that the bills which are now current, and become due on the 30th June, have been rediscounted on the London market at a rate very much in excess of the original rate paid by the Governments of Australia, namely, 5 per cent. The result, so far as the Commonwealth Bank is concerned, is that the directors feel that any attempt to put bills on the market now in the face of the present position would, from a banking and financial point of view, be prohibitive. It would be very difficult to get the London market to take the bills, and even if we were to get them taken up the price that we should have to pay would, in my opinion, be one that the Governments of Australia ought not to pay. </para>

        </interjection>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline>Gibson. According to the act of Parliament, the Australian ?1 note is a promise to pay to the holder so many grains of gold. The issue of notes in Australia is partially a fiduciary issue, and partially an issue backed by gold.- The act provides that the Bank Board must maintain a reserve of 25 per cent, of physical gold against every note that the bank issues. Pre-supposing that the whole of the gold held by the Commonwealth Bank was taken out of the custody of the bank the effect of the bill would be that the note issue would be entirely unsupported by anything else than faith in the country; that is to say, there would be no physical gold backing the note issue. The question asked is very difficult for any man to answer because, in the first place, the value of the Australian note would then be based upon the confidence of the people in the ability of the country to redeem those notes in some form or other. The gold reserve, besides having a definite value, has, in my opinion, and in' the opinion of my colleagues, a psychological value inasmuch as the feeling that there is a gold reserve behind the note issue - that there is something tangible behind the promise to pay - creates confidence in the minds of those who handle the notes. So far as our internal transactions are concerned, it would be possible to conduct business based solely on confidence. Confidence, however, is a very subtle thing, and it is easily destroyed. We have had evidence lately of what can happen through want of confidence, even when. the resources of a State were supposed to back public confidence. Honorable senators, then, can imagine for themselves what might be the consequences of a purely fiduciary issue. They will realize from what I have said that it is utterly impossible to give a direct answer to the question that has been asked. Personally, I am afraid that the effect would be decidedly adverse to the confidence reposed in our note issue. </para>

I point out that this bill is a proposal to take from the Commonwealth Bank the control of the gold reserve, in order to enable the Government to send that gold reserve overseas to meet Australia's short-term indebtedness there. Surely it is in order for me to ask the witness whether a warning was issued to the Government by the bank, which is the custodian of the gold reserve, as to the dangerous position that would arise, and, if so, when that warning was given. As the Senate has to make up its mind whether to accept or reject this bill, it ought to have this information. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline>Gibson. ; I find myself in a somewhat difficult situation. The Bank Board, and myself as its  chairman,  might be involved in a position in which I definitely say we should not be put. I should like to say to this honorable assembly, if I may be permitted to do so, that the Bank Board has endeavoured to discharge its obligations without fear or favour of any government, and without regard to any political party. I would, therefore, ask honorable senators, no matter to what party they may belong, if they will be good enough - because I am in a difficult position - to refrain from asking me anything that would in any way suggest that either I or my board have failed in our duty either to the country or to the Parliaments of Australia. In reply to the question submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> I should like to point out chat, for a very extended period, communications of an official nature have passed between the Bank Board and the government for the time being  concerning the growing, difficulty which the financial position of. Australia would eventually lead to. Naturally, honorable senators understand that, as between the bank and the government of the day, there must be many conversations which we, as bankers, must take to be of a confidential nature. I think it can be said that on no occasion has the Bank Board, either through the press or in any other way, disclosed communications between the government of the day and the Commonwealth Bank. Tor these reasons, I find myself in a somewhat difficult position in referring to the great number of communications which have officially passed between the bank, the Government, or the Loan Council, from the 1st July, 1929, when the previous Government was in office, to the present time. I have no desire to embarrass any government; but there is a communication to which I feel quite at liberty to refer, and that is a letter which, as  chairman  of the Bank Board, I sent to the honorable the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Theodore),</inline> in his capacity of Treasurer of the Commonwealth and as  chairman  of the Loan Council. That letter was read in another place, as was also the Treasurer's reply to it. I think that I should read the full text of that letter to the members of the Senate. It was addressed to the Honorable E. G. Theodore on the 6th March, 1931, and is as follows: - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Referring to the discussion which the Governor and I had with the Prime Minister and yourself on the 24th February, when the position in regard to London obligations of the Government was referred to, and 1 pointed out the inability of the bank to assist the Government in respect of these obligations in view of certain 'eventualities referred to hereafter, this matter has been the subject of discussion by the Bank Board at the meeting which has just closed, and it is desired that 1 place on record the position as discussed with you. You are aware that the board shipped to London some six months ago £5,000,000 worth of gold for the purpose of holding there a reserve against contingencies which might arise in respect of govern* ment needs. Owing to unfavorable market conditions preventing the Government from acquiring temporary loans on the London market, as you are aware, this reserve was used to meet a position which arose in connexion with treasury-bills amounting to £5,000,000, which fell due on the 31st December Inst. Subsequently the bank was able to negotiate treasury-bills for the same amount on the London market, and thereby replaced the bank funds which had r-eu used temporarily. Again a similar position arose in connexion with the bills due on the 2nd March of the same amount, and the bank reserve was again used to meet the situation and pay off these bills. At present the probability of disposing of treasury-bills to replace this fund is distinctly unfavorable, and the hoard is quite unable to forecast if. arid when, it might be possible to discount bills on the London market. It follows, therefore, that the bank is no longer in possession of funds in London which might be required either to meet the claims of the Westminster Bank Limited, df £5,000,000 which is due for settlement at the end of the month, or the further sum of £5,000,000 to meet the treasury bills falling due on the 30th June and which might not be again renewed. As pointed out to you at the interview referred to, the gold reserve now held by the bank is not more than sufficient to maintain the statutory reserve required under the Commonwealth Bank Act. and allow for a bare margin for fluctuations of note issue. The board therefore deems it its duty to point out the position to your Government, so that it may give consideration to the question, and take such steps as it deems necessary to meet the position. My board desires me to say that it is possible that a position may arise in London in the near future which the bank would be powerless to meet. </para>

" The Treasurer suggests that the board gives its approval to an amendment of the law to enable the gold to be disposed of ". </para>
          <para>Whilst there is a certain ambiguity surrounding the exact- meaning of this message, the board has assumed in the light of all the circumstances that the Treasurer proposes to bring in legislation which would authorize the Bank Board to dispose of the gold reserve for the purpose of meeting obligations falling due overseas, and that the Treasurer desires that the board gives its approval of such legislation. </para>
          <para>The board is unable to see its way to subscribe to this suggestion, and I am requested to advise you that a letter of this date addressed to you, dealing with the London situation, is to be taken as answering your telephonic message.

          <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline>Gibson. ; Again I find myself in a somewhat difficult position. I do not know whether conversations between myself and the Prime Minister should be disclosed by me. I should like to say, without any reflection on the Prime Minister, that in another place he has referred to conversations which are alleged to have taken place between himself and me. The propriety of disclosing any such conversations is a matter for the Prime Minister himself to decide. A statement as to conversations is not evidence. If, for example, the Prime Minister said that Robert Gibson had said so and so, that would not be evidence. Similarly, if Robert Gibson said that the Prime Minister had said so and so, that, also, would not be evidence. My inclination is to try to hold myself in the most correct position possible. I do not wish to be drawn into any controversy with the Prime Minister as to what he or I said or did not say. I consider that the official document from the board, which I have read, discloses the position as between the Bank Board and the Government. Therefore, I would ask honorable senators who, I assume, have no desire to place me in a difficult position, to refrain from asking me questions of the nature of the one just put to me. </para>

        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline>Gibson. ; There are only two systems of which I know - either a gold reserve or a purely fiduciary system. A fiduciary currency system limits the trustees of it to the amount of the fiduciary issue they can put out. The Leader of the Opposition asked me a question which had some bearing on this matter., and I explained as far as it was in my power to explain the views which the board holds concerning an unsupported system. Personally I am utterly against such a system, and have no recommendation to make to the Senate or to any honorable senator. All the central banks of important countries which are engaged in international trade of any magnitude have issues based upon a system which has some points of comparison with the Australian system. They are either on a purely gold basis or are on a partially gold and partially fiduciary basis, which is the present Australian system. Since Australia has large external .obligations and is doing a big volume of overseas business involving transactions international in their character, the Governments of Australia would be well advised to maintain a monetary system which is still accepted by the leading nations of the world. I consider that a serious departure from it must, in the end, militate against the interests of Australia. I have studied, and have instructed the staff of the Commonwealth Bank to look up, the records relating to central reserve banking systems of other countries, and I know of no reserve bank in the world which has its issue on an entirely fiduciary basis. That is as much as I can say in reply to the question. </para>

I sent with the list a covering letter to meet <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Gibson upon his arrival in Canberra to-day, in which I informed him that I proposed to ask him these questions when he was called to the bar of the Senate. I also stated that if, in his opinion, any of the questions ought not, in the public interest, to be asked, and if he would indicate such questions, I would withdraw them. </para>

        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline>Gibson. ; If I were to address the Senate on the question of inflation, I am afraid that it would become tired of hearing what I had to say about it. In reply to the honorable senator I should like to say, however, that inflation as such is not necessarily governed in any way by the evidence of the issue of notes. A note issue is rather the thermometer which indicates the temperature of the amount of inflation. The process of inflation does not begin in the issue of notes; it begins by banks making available credit which is not based upon any tangible or real asset that can be converted into terms of money. The mere action of sending Home ?5,000,000 worth of gold to meet these London bills would inflate to a very minor extent. If we had ?10,000,000 worth of gold left, and did not reduce the note issue, the amount of physical backing in the form of gold to the notes which were already out would be reduced, and to tha extent the issue would be an inflation of paper as against actual assets. The difference is supposed to be supported by national credit. You could go on pawning - if I may use such an objectionable word - your national credit to such an extent that it would be destroyed, and the credit which had been issued would be purely inflated credit, and would become valueless. The danger of inflation lies in the gradual depreciation of the ability of credit to buy. To give a simple illustration : if you have a very large production of wheat in the world and the demand for wheat is very much less than the supply, the natural effect is that the price of wheat falls, and wheat becomes less valuable per bushel. If you issue credit, which is not based on sound principles . and sound assets, the value of that credit soon begins to fall; and as it falls it will buy less in the form of commodities, with the result that you get what is called the rising of the price level. The rising of the price level is created by one of two things: A shortage of the articles which are to be sold, or a lesser buying power of the currency that purchases them. I do not know that I can make the position clearer. It is a very difficult question to answer, but I think that I have said as much as I can say about it in a few brief words. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline>Gibson. ; The question asked by the honorable senator probably has a much wider scope than he intended. It would be very difficult to answer unless I gave some explanation to this honorable Senate of the manner in which exchange operates. There are several factors which govern exchanges between nations. One of them, and a very common one, is the ordinary law of supply and demand. If, for instance, some one in Australia wishes to buy credit in London, the price he has to pay for it is governed by the credit available in London which has been created by the export of goods from Australia. It,, therefore, must follow that if your exports are very low in value, and if the amount of London credit available is very limited, and the demand for it is very great, competition immediately develops for the purchase of that credit; just as the nations compete against one another for their wheat requirements when there is a shortage of that commodity. This causes prices to rise. The result is that the exchanges between Australia and London may be affected purely on the basis of those balances. That can be corrected - and it has been corrected in Australia - by the ability of Australia to borrow money overseas. By borrowing overseas we increase the supply of money available in 'London, and the effect is to reduce the exchange rate. For example, supposing that the credit of Australia was sufficiently good to-day to enable it to go to London and borrow <inline font-style="italic">?75,000,000,</inline> the exchange rate between London and Australia would certainly be at par; indeed, it is possible that it might be slightly in favour of Australia. By sending away our gold, we are reducing our ability to meet our overseas obligations. We cannot ship the same gold twice, and it must follow, inevitably, that as we dispose of any real asset that we have here for the purpose of sending it overseas to meet our obligations, the attrition of asset arising out of that transaction, presupposing that it cannot be replaced, must eventually lead to an increase in the exchange rate. </para>

        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline>Gibson. ; The question refers to an alleged unconditional promise to pay 4s. a bushel for wheat. What have I to do with what has been alleged? I do not know what has been alleged, and how can I answer a question based on an allegation? If I were to attempt to answer the question, I should be involved in a discussion on the subject of a guarantee of 4s. a bushel for wheat. The question also refers to " the purchase of exportable commodities," and mentions " a sum of about ?20,000,000." I desire to be as clear as I can. If we have exportable commodities to the value of ?20,000,000, and they remain in Australia, then there is no money available in London arising out of those commodities. Only by the export of those commodities overseas can we create a credit in London in respect of them. The bill, as I understand it, is designed for the purpose of meeting overseas obligations. Presupposing, therefore, that the bank was both agreeable and able to provide ?20,000,000 here to buy exportable commodities, the London position would not be affected in the slightest degree. The bank would have to become an exporter, send the commodities overseas, and sell them there, before it could create credits in London. The ordinary process is not that a bank buys these things; they are bought by people overseas, and the bank attends to the financial transactions whereby money is received in London for the commodities exported, and is remitted to Australia or used in London to pay some one else, at the direction of the owner of the goods. Therefore, the provision of ?20,000,000 here for the purpose of buying wheat in Australia would not, so far. as I can see, alter the position in London in the slightest degree. I do not know whether I have clearly understood the honorable senator's question, or have made myself clear in my answer. I desire to answer all questions intelligently, and I hope that I have done so in this instance. </para>

            <para>- The question that I wish to have answered is that if the Commonwealth Bank a few months ago promised to find over ?20,000,000 to pay Australian farmers 4s. a bushel for wheat at sidings, why that sum cannot be used for the present emergency by the means of transfers to the Old Country? </para>

        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline>Gibson.  ; I think that my previous answer covered the position; a practical transaction would have to take place before credits could be created in London. Although it might benefit the farmers of Australia, as farmers, if the Commonwealth Bank provided ?20,000,000 to buy wheat at 4s. a bushel which could only be sold for 2s., it would not affect the position of the nation, as between Australia and the Old Country, in the slightest degree. In that connexion, I am glad that the honorable senator referred to an " alleged unconditional promise." I am not aware of it myself . So far as I am aware, no unconditional promise or arrangement was ever suggested by the Commonwealth Bank in regard to finding ?20,000,000. </para>

Incidentally, it is quite well known to the Government that in these conferences the advice of. the Bank of England is often invited, and is given to our management in London, and through it to the- Commonwealth Bank Board, and the financial advisers of Australia with respect to the general condition of the money market in London, a-nd so forth. That is an everyday transaction. The Government of the day is always aware of these communications.

It. is confidential as between banks, because it is the kind of information which it. is necessary for central banks of the world to possess. I may have mentioned to the Treasurer - although I cannot recollect whether I did so or not - that we are under a great obligation to the Governor of the Bank of England for very valuable and confidential' information which we are continually receiving here. That may. have been the reference although I do not know that it is. so.

            <para>- I am quite satisfied with the answer that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> has given. The question I asked was, " Has the Bank Board departed from the opinion expressed in its letter to the Treasurer late in 1929, that it would be highly detrimental to Australia to depart, even temporarily, from the gold standard " ? The witness has answered that it would be. I now desire to ask <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> if he regards the funding of our existing floating obligations abroad as a matter of urgency? </para>

Perhaps when we had shipped our last piece of gold to our overseas creditors and had said to them. : " That is all we have ", they might, out of pity, but not as a matter of sound business, view our position in a more favorable light. However, if it Jb to be a cold-blooded financial trans action, I cannot see that the sending of the gold overseas is going to improve our position in the matter of funding our overseas debt. Considered from the coldblooded view-point of the borrower and lender, it might decidedly hamper our position by making our credit less valuable than it is to-day. </para>

If it were thought that our resources were so strained that we had been forced to send away the last of our gold, one would naturally think, if business is to be conducted on ordinary lines, that our credit would, to a certain extent, be further depreciated. This would necessarily make it more difficult for us to re-fund the debts which are falling due in the future. </para>

        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Sir ROBERT</inline>Gibson. Earlier this afternoon I informed the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> that the unfunded debts of Australian Governments in London to-day total ?38,075,000, of which ?5,000,000 is due to the Westminster Bank, ?5,000,000 is due on bills on the open market, and the balance to Australian institutions. The Westminster Bank has agreed to accept bills, due in September. The payment of this- ?5,000,000 is therefore postponed until September, and the only outstanding item which falls due in London between now and September to other than the Commonwealth Bank and the other Australian banks is the ?5,000,000 in respect of bills which fall due on the 30th June. If ?5,000,000 in gold was made available to redeem those bills, that debt would be wiped out. Before September com.es along something else may happen. The period may be extended by the Westminster Bank; I cannot say. The second ?5,000,000 may not be required. The question is to what use would the third ?5,000,000 be applied? Would it be used to repay the Australian banks; because it would not relieve the London position so far as external debtors, who are not the Australian banks, are concerned. It would, for the time being, relieve the Commonwealth Government of the necessity to find ?5,000,000 of accruing interest which is at present found under the pooling system, and which the Commonwealth Government buys from month to month under that scheme. The banks have pooled the whole of their London funds, and every month, through the Commonwealth Bank, they sell to the Commonwealth Bank on behalf of the Commonwealth Government an amount equal to the accruing interest for the month. That is how interest is paid month by month. Since that system has come into operation, interest in London has always been met. The shipment of the whole '?15,000,000 from Australia would meet the bills due to the Westminster Bank in September; it would also meet the bills due on the open market on the 30th June, and it would enable the Australian banks to be repaid ?5,000,000 of their London money. But I do not think that it would help the Australian banks to send that gold to London. Alternatively, the third ?5,000,000 might be used by the Government foi' the purpose of postponing purchases from the banking pool for the payment of interest due in London. </para>

If, however, it must be said, at the meeting to which I referred on that date, both the Prime Minister and the Treasurer pressed upon me the desirability of the Bank Board shipping more gold to London. The answer made by myself and the Governor of the bank, who was present, was that, having regard to the obligations placed upon the board under the act, the bank could not ship the gold to London; also that if the Government decided that it had to be sent away to meet the nation's obligations, it was not the duty of the Bank Board to ship it.

          <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline>Gibson. ; That question places me in a very difficult position. If I answer it, it may be thought that I am suggesting or putting forth a policy for the Government. I am not here to do that. I gathered from what you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> said at the outset, that I am not here to answer questions dealing with government finance generally, but to answer questions relevant to the . bill. The Government or Parliament must surely, in the last resort, accept full responsibility for arranging these matters. The bank is only the medium through which these things may be done. </para>

            <para>- Bearing in mind that we have in. Australia a gold reserve of a certain amount, and bearing in mind also that in London we shall have to meet certain commitments on the 30th. of June next - commitments which we cannot meet from the sales of our wool or wheat, what is your advice, as a banker, to the Senate ? Would you send the gold abroad, or if not, what steps would you take to prevent the nation from defaulting? </para>

If by sending our gold away we depreciated our currency, and we paid our internal obligations in a depreciated currency, would it not be construed as some measure of default to those who have loaned money to us here?

You have, I think, widened the views of honorable senators on both sides of the Senate in relation to questions connected with this bill, and through this bill with finance generally. We know, too, what a particularly stressing time you are having, and we cannot but admire the devotion to duty that you- have displayed by having undertaken two severe journeys and an afternoon's ordeal, the physical strain of which is as great as any long journey by motor car could be.
