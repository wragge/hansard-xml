                    <para>. - When I was interrupted last night I was indicating the attitude which I intend to adopt towards the tariff schedule. The Government is proposing alterations of the law, and the onus rests upon it, as in the case of every projected change of the law, to show cause. The conditions that obtain to-day are known to all of us, but no one can forecast, reliably, what will be the state of affairs when the law is changed. I hope, therefore, that the Minister in charge of the bill will regard it as his duty to inform the Senate why, in the opinion of the Government, each proposed alteration is necessary. </para>

                        <para>- I . wish to stress the point which I fear, may be' lost sight of, that in any action which we may take in connexion with this schedule, we shall not be changing the law, because the only Taw in existence is the law of the 1928 tariff. The mere fact that, by what has been termed the straining of its executive powers, the Government has been collecting duties under the new tariff schedule, does not prove that the present tariff schedule has legal existence. Those who assume that it is legally in operation merely because it was brought down by resolution in another place, ignore the constitutional authority of this chamber. It is well, therefore, to remember that until a tariff schedule has been agreed to by the Senate, it has not, and cannot have, the force of law. This should be remembered, particularly by those who assume that, if we took the drastic step which we could take, and rejected the schedule altogether, we should be establishing freetrade; in effect, we should merely have left standing the highest tariff of which the world has any record. The only controversy between us, therefore, is whether we shall allow the world's highest tariff to stand or whether we shall raise it a little higher. This is why I contend that the onus is on the Minister to give reasons why we should change the tariff. </para>

                <para>The aim of this Parliament should be to reduce costs of production as much as possible, so that we may establish and maintain an important export trade in our secondary products. On this point the Tariff Board, in its annual report for the year ended the 30th June,1931, stated - </para>

                <para class="block">I call special attention to its reference to "oppressive duties," because it indicates that, in the opinion of the board, some duties, at all events, are oppressive- would assist, not only the primary industries, but also those secondary industries which are seeking an export market. </para>
                <para class="block">The present Government appears to take the view that we require high duties against high wages paid in industries in America, against low-wage industries in European countries, and against medium wages paid in Great Britain. This appears to exhaust the categories, and from the facts I deduce that those who advocate these extremely high duties, assume that Australians are not competent to hold their own against the people of other countries. This is doing less than justice to the </para>
                <para class="block">Australian people. A few years ago our young men were called to arms on the other side of the world. They were required to adopt a profession to which they had not been trained. They asked for no concessions-; they expected no privileges; they claimed no handicaps, although they were aware that they were about to meet, face to face, in the dread arbitrament of war, men who had been trained in that school from their earliest youth. But what happened? Almost from the day they landed on foreign shores until the day when they left, their boast might have been the boast of Achilles, "You will know the difference now that I am here ". I remember, in the last days of the war, reading how, when the enemy were being driven out of towns and positions which they had held so recently, the cry, " The Australians are here !" brought women and children from their hiding places, secure in the knowledge that they were protected by protectors who were a match for any foe. Is not that the Anzac spirit? And must we now confess that what we could do in the field of war we cannot do in the field of peace? Must we admit that, in industry, we are unable to hold our own in competition with the people of other countries? I fear that, by a complicated system of legislation, we are building up an inferiority complex in our own people to the disadvantage of <inline font-style="italic">tha</inline> Australian nation. </para>
                <para>I am aware of the argument that the present high tariff is necessary if we are to become a self-contained nation. That, -as I have already said, is an ignoble ideal, and is not capable of realization. If it were capable of realization, it is too late in the day now for us to attempt it, because every year we have overseas obligations . amounting to between £30,000,000 and £35,000,000, which we have to meet in gold. And the amount is increasing because of the redemption of maturing loans at higher rates of interest. </para>
                <para>The one gleam of sunshine that we get out of the fact that we are passing through an unexampled depression, is the knowledge that the people of this country now realize how much we depend for our prosperity as a nation upon the profitable sale overseas of our primary products. Towards- the end of last year a petition bearing the signatures of a number of representatives of our primary industries was presented to the House of Representatives - I am not certain if it was presented also to this chamber - pointing out that, of the total Australian exports for the ten years ending 1927-28, amounting to £1,316,719,000, primary products represented £1,260,254,000, or 95.71 per cent., while manufactured goods amounted to £56,465,000, and represented only 4.29 per cent. It showed further, that of the total of primary production, 46.5 per cent, was exported, whereas only 4.6 per cent, of manufactured products was sent overseas. When I said yesterday thai I feared this tariff would mean disaster to Australia, I had in my mind those figures, because, as I have shown, we have to maintain that position, and should seek to improve it, but we cannot do this if we impose further handicaps upon our primary producers. Paragraph 15 of the petition stated - </para>

                    <para>If the primary industries of this country fail, as fail they must unless they are afforded substantial relief, then Australia fails with them, for they ave Australia, aud represent mure than 95 per cent, of the exports of the country. </para>

                <para>Since there may be some doubt as to my attitude to the tariff, I wish to make it clear that I take my stand upon the report of the Tariff Board. This is what the board has to say concerning the general effect of tariffs - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>The board holds that the community in general is best served by the imposition of a duty sufficient to enable an efficient manufacturer, to develop his business and to secure the trade. This method tends to promote efficiency and economic production, and is much less disruptive in its operations than are prohibitive duties. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">When I say that I take my stand upon that statement of the board's view, I mean that our whole fiscal and economic policy should be directed to an improvement of the means to be adopted to meet our tremendous interest bill on overseas obligations. Leading world economists are becoming perturbed at the marked tendency in all countries to pass restrictive legislation, which, as we have discovered to our cost, is unduly hampering international commerce. I cannot now, in the limited time left to me, quote the opinions of those authorities, but I may have an opportunity to do so before this debate is closed.  For  the moment, I shall  content myself by asserting that the trend of opinion among .he greatest economists in the world is that there must be some loosening of the restrictions which have been applied in all countries. </para>
                <para>It is said that Great Britain has given a mandate for the change over to protection. Great Britain has done no such thing. What the people of the Mother Country did was to give an open mandate to the present Government. It is true that, as the result of the recent appeal to the electors, we may see the introduction of a mild form of protection in Great Britain, but' I feel confident that it will be found to be expressed in the view put by the London <inline font-style="italic">Times,</inline> on the morning of the election, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Baldwin</inline> had made it abundantly clear that - </para>

                </quote>
                <para class="block">When we have a tariff embodying all these negative virtues, I will most readily subscribe to it. In the meantime I ask my honorable friends who hold the contrary view on tariff questions, to remember that greatness is not always material greatness, and that Australia cannot afford to ignore or, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> put it last night, slight the opinions of other countries. As the right honorable the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> said on one occasion, Australia attained to nationhood at Gallipoli. Braving attained to nationhood, we must take our place in the family of nations. Even the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> appears now to recognize that it is not such a. bad thing to deal with other countries. Yet if one may judge by his more recent utterances, he believes it to be a good thing to deal with them by government treaties, but not by private treaties. </para>
                <para>I conclude by congratulating the Government and my learned friend, the Minister in charge of the tariff <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Daly)</inline> and a certain newspaper, which may be said to be an intelligent anticipator of events, upon the intelligence which it displayed in anticipating an event which has not yet taken place in this Senate, but which, no doubt, will (take place in due time. </para>

                    <para>.- I congratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brennan</inline> upon the excellent speech he has just delivered. Having been a member of this chamber for many years, I recall all the advantages which it was claimed would flow from the original tariff schedule, and from the many subsequent revisions of it. As a consistent supporter of a protective policy, I now have to confess to a great deal of disillusionment. I have no hesitation in saying that the tariff has not solved our industrial, commercial, or unemployment problems. Unfortunately, unemployment is rife in all countries, and I am afraid that, if relief is not soon given, there will be trouble, leading possibly to revolution. Tariffs have been tried in practically every European country, and have been more or less failures. They have not assisted in any way to solve the problem of unemployment, which to-day is greater than it lias ever been before, and appears to be unsolvable It ia said that throughout Europe to-day, notwithstanding tariff restrictions, the unemployed number from  25,000,000  to  30,000,000  people. No matter how ardent protectionists we may be, we must face these facts. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>In every tariff debate the country which is held up as an example of what can be accomplished by means of a tariff is the United States of America. Next to Australia, that country has the highest tariff wall iii the world. Throughout its existence, it has had the advantage of a large population to consume what it has produced, a plentiful supply of, labour, and efficient machinery and organization to enable it to export. Yet at the present time from  10,000,000  to  12,000,000  of its people are unemployed. On the other hand, Great Britain has always adhered to a freetrade policy, and until recently has been able to hold her own with every protectionist country. To-day, every country is shutting out the goods of all others, and striving to become self-contained. Great Britain's present plight is due not to inefficiency, or failure to supply the world with its requirements, but to the fact that she has been shut out from the markets of other countries by the tariff walls that have been erected by  them, and it seems likely that she will have to adopt some form of protection in order to prevent the dumping within her borders of goods that are produced in cheap labour- countries. In Australia there is a strong feeling in favour of giving to Great Britain whatever preferences we can grant without injuring our own industries. </para>
                <para>This morning the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> published in the press a statement, the tone of which, in one respect, does not greatly astonish me. It is unfortunate, however, that he appears to be more anxious to make trade treaties with foreign countries than with Great Britain. I have no objection to offer to such treaties, realizing as I do that they will have to be made if our industries are to expand. But Great Britain is our best customer, and should receive our first consideration. Our very safety is dependent upon her. That is a fact which is frequently overlooked by many of our people. She has also supplied us with the money that has been used in our development. The Minister is probably anxious to visit Ottawa, and is disquieted at the prospect that his desire is likely to be thwarted. It would  evidently afford him considerable pleasure to air at the proposed conference the wonderful knowledge that he possesses of the commercial activities of Australia. I believe that he will miss the 'bus, because, before the conference is held there is likely to be in power in this country a government that will more truly represent the opinions of the people of Australia. It must also be borne in mind that it is the intention of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas.</inline> the Secretary of State for the Dominions, to pay a visit to each of the dominions with a view to developing Empire trade. The question of Empire trade is a very complicated one, and if it is to be properly handled by the British Government, it is essential that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas</inline> should come into personal contact with the people, and learn the feelings and the conditions in the dominions. Our commercial and industrial safety may drive us into adopting a view different from that which we now hold about Empire trade. The present is an appropriate time for us to have a visit from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline></para>
                <para class="block">Thomas; and, if the trade conference is held subsequently, useful results will probably accrue from it. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Forde</inline> can be better employed in. Australia than iu expressing before an Imperial Conference the narrow view that he holds on tariff matters. He does not appear to realize the injury that is being caused to Australia by the attitude that he is adopting. </para>
                <para>In the past, Great Britain has depended on the East to provide her with a market for many of her products, which she has been able to supply at a price that has suited those with whom she has traded. That market is now being lost by her. Instead of the East looking to the West to supply its requirements, it is producing them itself. Japan, whose industrial life has extended over a period of only about 50 years, to-day is seeking a place in every market in the world. Once the East becomes properly organized, and realizes the possibilities arising out of the extensive use of machinery, it will become a danger to western nations. That, is a fact which we must bear in mind in building up our own industries. We may sneer at the low rates of pay and the long hours of labour in Japan, but we cannot deny her efficiency. She is now able to supply India with cotton goods at 8 cheaper rate than that at which India can produce them herself. Every one who has kept himself in touch with international affairs knows that Japan is overcrowded, and that she must find an outlet for those whom she cannot absorb in her own industries. The present trouble in Manchuria has arisen out of the fact that she has been looking for territory for the absorption of her surplus population and  production </para>
                <para>If the tariff walls that have been built around each nation continue to be raised, what will be the outcome? Eventually no country will be able to find a market beyond its own boundaries, and this will create an international menace. The developments within recent years have been regarded so seriously that a committee of experts was appointed by the League of Nations to make a thorough investigation .into the subject. That committee, so far as I have been able to gather, reported adversely about, the high tariff walls that have been erected, because of their danger to inter- national peace. Much of the international trouble in the past has been caused by the bad feeling and jealousy aroused by trade competition. A study of the last war, and of others that preceded it, will show that they had their genesis in trade rivalry. For many years the United States of America has been insistent upon having naval parity with Great . Britain. Why? No one imagines that the United States of America is in danger of invasion by Great Britain. The reason is that the United States of America seeks to predominate as- a commercial nation ; it wants a great navy so that it may police the high seas and protect its shipping in times of war. Obviously, the tariff walls that are being raised by different countries, the dumping that goes on periodically, and the endeavour by each country to become self-contained, must bring trouble. The weakest, will go to the wall. Because of Australia's remoteness from the centres of civilization, we believe that in making this country self-contained we are following a laudable course. But are we going the right way about things? Judging from my own experience, over a good number of years, we are not. We are ruining Australia, instead of building it up into the nation that it ought to be. Our population is too scanty to be able to pay the price necessary to make us self-contained. </para>
                <para>The Government has told us that this extremely high tariff is proposed in an endeavour to balance our trade, and to reduce the high rate of exchange. There is something to be said for that. On the other hand, we cannot forget that it is two years since the schedule was formulated. It has only just reached the Senate! The delay is unprecedented, and could have been brought about only by a government composed of extreme tariffists, and possessing such a great majority in another place. During those two years, industries have been built up in Australia in anticipation of the tariff being accepted by the Senate. If rates are reduced by the Senate, hardship will be suffered by industries into which considerable capital and energy have been placed. Unfortunately, the efforts of the Government have been misdirected. Already these new industries are over-producing, and many are working only half time. Those ills are the result of the tardiness of the Government in presenting this schedule to the Senate. </para>
                <para>Members, of the Government, and particularly the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde),</inline> have gone around the country claiming that this tariff has created a tremendous amount of employment. They have repeated that statement so frequently that they now believe it. Unfortunately, their claim is not backed up by facts, as was proved by the figures that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brennan</inline> quoted yesterday. I shall further disprove the claim of the Government by referring to statistics taken from the official quarterly bulletin of the Government. The following table shows the number of factories in Australia before and since the introduction of the schedule :  - </para>

                <para class="block">Because of the existence of this tariff, there were 216 fewer factories in operation during the last twelve months than in 1928-29.

                <para>SenatorREID. - This tariff was specifically introduced to assist our secondary industries, which, have not been built up as was expected, with the result that the burden of the tariff has fallen on the rest of the community, and particularly upon the workers. With the opinion that our secondary industries are  very  necessary, I supported every previous tariff, but the result has been disappointing. </para>
                <para>It' has been mentioned by several of our strong protectionists that .this tariff will find work for our young people. 1 am particularly anxious for that. Australia spends millions of pounds annually in providing for its youth an education that is unsurpassed anywhere else in the world. Given the inclination and the ability, any of 'Our children may obtain a free education, from the state school to the university. What is the result of all that expenditure? There are thousands of young people out of employment. While it is heart-breaking for our mature citizens to be thrown out of work, it is tragic for the youth who has equipped himself with a splendid education, and goes forth into the world of business full of ambition and enthusiasm, to find that there is no  place  for him. Our secondary industries do not provide employment for these young persons, whose position has been made worse by the hampering restrictions placed on apprenticeship by trade unions. Those are facts which we have to face. This tariff has certainly hot been so beneficial as the Government claimed it would be when it was first introduced. We have to remember that however necessary secondary industries may be to assist our primary producers, we cannot build up Australia merely by the establishment of secondary industries. The interior of this vast continent is sparsely  inhabited  and is used mostly for the raising of sheep, cattle and other stock and, therefore, our primary industries are of paramount importance. At present Australia is not manufacturing any article that can be exported at a profit. We have given an enormous protection to the iron and steel industry. Our steel works are efficient, and, in fact, they have become over efficient, and now that the boom has gone machinery is standing idle. Most, people prefer the imported article, and will not purchase the Australian article unless compelled to do so. We cannot grow as a nation without an export trade. We must have export markets. The competition for markets under the tariff walls erected by various countries has become extraordinarily keen, and it is useless for us to attempt to establish secondary industries unless we can sell the manufactured article abroad, and tit a profit. We have assisted the secondary industries by imposing prohibitions and embargoes. We cannot continue to do that, particularly as our primary industries are suffering hardship thereby. The only primary industries that are not receiving assistance by way of bounty are the sheep and cattle-growing industries. The last report of the Tariff Board gives a glaring example of the effect of the bolstering up of secondary industries, without proper inquiry having been made. One paragraph reads - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>In- several wises dealt with by the board in the period covered by this report, there was evidence that the manufacturers who mad* requests for increased duties, or supported proposals for  such  duties could, by reducing the selling prices of their products, have secured u  consider  ably greater output in competition with imported goods. There was also evidence that thu manufacturers concerned, although earning profits which justified such action, had made no attempt to reduce their prices. Instances came under notice where requests had been made for increased duty, o; support had been given to increases embodied in tariff proposals, by manufacturers earning abnormal profits. One manufacturer in an industry supplying goods to the value of fi 00.000 per annum was' making 100 per cent, per annum on the capital employed in <inline font-style="italic">hit</inline> business. Another company with an  output  of £50,000 per annum had paid dividends ranging from 22 i per cent, to 121 per cent, over the four years  preceding  the inquiry. In another industry a company having an annual turnover of over £1,000,000 made, over a. period of seven years, profits ranging from 37 per cent, to 134 per cent, per annum on tha capital employed. </para>
                    <para>The board docs not suggest that these profits are being made at the present time, but the fact that they were made under a protective tariff when trade conditions were normal indicated a grave probability of the misuse of any additional protection. Neither does the board suggest that, as a general rule, manufacturers seeking additional protection were such as to influence the board in recommending against any general increases in the duties applied for. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">That is clear evidence that abuses have crept in under the tariff. In imposing many of the prohibitions and embargoes the Government has entirely ignored the recommendations of the Tariff Board, and with other honorable senators, I wish to enter my protest against that action. It is difficult to discuss many items of the tariff, because of the lack of information. Wild statements have been made by some honorable senators, and even by some of the members of the Government themselves. In respect of numerous items the Government ignored the recommendations of the board, and, without any inquiry at all, doubled the duties. Under the tariff of 1928, most of our workmen were employed and our industries working at a profit. The duties thou operating have been increased; in many instances, doubled. Despite that additional protection, thousands of men have become unemployed, aud the price of the locally-manufactured article has been increased. That is not the way to satisfy the public. The tariff has to some* extent shut out goods which cannot be manufactured in Australia, and that has seriously interfered with our primary industries. Within the last month the prices of wool and wheat have increased. Every one rejoices at that. The producers generally have been given new heart and a fresh outlook. But although prices have increased, they have not reached the point at which it pays to produce. It does not pay to produce wool at ls. per lb. The following statement of the  President  of the Chamber of Commerce, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hawkes,</inline> as reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald,</inline> shows the effect that the tariff protection given to our secondary industries is having upon primary production : - " It is upon the primary industries that this country depends to meet its obligations overseas," said <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hawkes.</inline> " The primary producers, owing to the cost of living, have costs of production so exorbitantly raised that few can produce at a profit, especially since the disastrous fall in the prices of wool and wheat. "A statement of increased costs since 1010, taken from the books of one of the oldest wheat-growers in the Riverina, discloses that this farmer operates 1,000 acres as a wheat, farm, with sheep as an auxiliary. Freight on wheat shows an increase per ton of from lis. 2d. to 18s. Id., and agent's commission and handling charges per ton ls. to ls. 6d This totals 2Jd. per bushel. On such a farm, averaging 18 bushels per acre (approximately 320 acres would be crop each year and 320 acres fallow), the quantity available for sale would be 4,650 bushels, and at 2ld. per bushel the increased cost would be £53 5s. 7d. Oil this property one man would be permanently employed all the time. In 1910 his wages were 35s. per week and keep. In 1930, 55s. per week and keep. This is an additional cost of £52 per annum. Add to this additional cost of harvesting labour, £10, and increased cost of keep, £26, and it makes a total of £83. Thelanded cost of manure in 1910. was £4 18s. 3d. per ton; in 1930 it is £5 10s. (id. per ton. Theincrease in cost on this farm is £22. Chaffcutting is done by contract, and the increase in costs amounts to £18. Insurance (fire and hail) rates have increased from £3 10s. to' £6 10s. per f i 00, a total increase of £21 for the farm. New items in cost are: Workmen's compensation, £4 103.; child endowment, £4 10s. - a total of £9. "Freight on a sheep van in 1910 was £7 ls. 8d.; in 1930 it is £13 4s. 2d., an increase of £0 2s. 6d  This represents an extra cost of ls. 3d. per head of 300 sheep to be sold, a total increase of £18 15s. Shearing cost has doubled, and the extra cost for 300 sheep to-day is £12 10s. The increased freight on wool is £3 6s. 6d. Shire and P.P. Board rates have increased £22. There has been an increase of 2 per cent, in interest charges on mortgage of £3,000, which is equal to £00. Added costs due to freight increases on all requirements, and increased costs of duplicates, <inline font-style="italic">&amp;.C.,</inline> have also to be taken into consideration. " In all, total operating costs have been increased by approximately £500, or 10s. per acre. In addition, there is the upkeep of the farmer and his family. Further, a comparison oi accounts for all farming implements, machinery, &amp;c, shows fully 100 per cent, increase in cost, after allowing for all  increased  work the implements may do. " These definite  figures  are worthy of serious consideration by all who have at heart the maintenance of our first line of financial defence ". </para>

                <para>To illustrate still further the difficulties which face those engaged in industrial undertakings, I direct attention to a sentence in. the report of the Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited dated the 29th October, 1931, which was made available to honorable senators a few days ago. This reference is of particular interest, because it relates to a partly socialized industry which was established with the object of keeping the price of petrol down to a reasonable figure. The Government, as honorable senators know, holds the majority of the shares in the company. The sentence to which I refer states that, with the exception of paying primage on crude oil, the company pays the same customs and excise duties as other companies, and that during the year ended the 30th June, 1931, these amounted to £346,605 4s. 6d. ! Seeing that this company is taxed so heavily, I cannot see how it can be expected to keep the price of petrol down. But all industrial enterprises are being heavily taxed to-day, and this makes it extremely hard for them to maintain their operations on a profitable basis. I have already made some references to the subject of British trade preferences for Australia ; but I desire to revert to it again. There can be no difference of opinion about the high C03J; of  production  in Australia making it difficult for us to export even our primary products at a price within the purchasing power of the main body of consumers in Great Britain. Before we can expect to establish satisfactory reciprocal trade we must make at least some of our products available to Britain at a price which she can afford to pay. We all know that the old British Labour Party stood firmly for freetrade. Any one who knows the conditions in England realizes that it could hardly do otherwise. Some members of the party are now beginning to realize that a tariff may be a help to Britain in preventing the dumping of goods; but, from an Empire point of view, we have to face the fact that unless we can market our primary products at prices which the British people can afford to pay, there can be no great future for us in British preferential trade. The British Labour party has always held to the idea of a free breakfast table. "With wages as they are in Great Britain, this seems to me to be essential. The people there must have cheap food. Not only must we cut down the cost of producing our primary products in order to make possible the profitable marketing of them in Great  Britain  but we must also buy goods from </para>
                  
                <para class="block">Britain. We all know very well that the doors of most of the dominions have been shut for the time being against British migrants, because of the existing financial difficulties; but it seems to me that we must adopt a policy which will make it practicable not only for the people of Great Britain to buy our goods, but for us to buy the goods manufactured there. The British Isles are today overcrowded with population in a way that the people of Australia who have not been there can hardly understand. The conditions are such that in the purchasing of foods a farthing means as much to some of those people as 6d. means to our people. With a half -penny or a farthing, a considerable amount of food may be purchased in Great Britain While I strongly favour the granting of preferences to Great Britain, I have always recognized that there arc difficulties in the way of making a mutually satisfactory arrangement. I know from relations of mine in Great Britain that it is beyond the means of the average middle class citizen of the Old Country to buy many Australian products. </para>
                <para>The high cost of production in Australia is very largely due to our industrial conditions, and our industrial conditions are affected by our custom? duties. Honorable senators know very well that most' of the time we spend in this chamber is occupied in the discussion of industrial problems or problems related thereto, of which the tariff is one. A good deal of the strength of the communist movement in Australia to-day has arisen from industrial causes. Unemployment has caused many otherwise estimable citizens to turn their attention to communism as a possible means of remedying the evils of our present social system. It is only to be expected that a man who sees the savings of year? disappearing, and his wife and family almost starving, will become desperate. Nothing is more humiliating to a man than to be left with the ability but without the means of providing his dependants with food and shelter. At the bottom, it was industrial troubles that precipitated the recent British election. The people there had been fooled, and when the opportunity came they simply swept away those who had fooled them. </para>

                <para>When the tariff was first introduced, the members of the Labour party were not  tariffists,  but new protectionists. Their idea was that the workers should share in the benefit derived through the protection -given to local industries, and that sweating and other industrial evils should be abolished. The people of Australia endorsed the policy of the new protection ; but no sooner had the tariff been applied than the employees approached the Arbitration Court for an increase in their wages. Then the employers went before the Tariff Board, and claimed that, unless protection were" increased, they would be unable to carry on their industries, and Australia would be flooded with foreign goods. They showed that the costs of production had risen, and, therefore, the Tariff Board increased the duties. Within six months, the men again approached the Arbitration Court, and obtained a further increase in their wages. The result, eventually, was unemployment. The two parties to industry agreed to pass on the increased co3t of production to the public, who, naturally, were then unable to purchase so many goods as before. The real purchasing power of wages was falling all the time, owing to factors that were operating in a vicious circle. Australia's 'industrial progress was  retarded  and the outcome of the tariff waa the stifling of the very industries that it was designed to help. The great majority of employers have no desire to reduce wages; but it is futile to pay high wages if the community suffers in consequence of the policy that has been pursued. </para>

No member of the Ministry is able to give reliable information on the effect of these duties on various industries. Even the present Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> has had 'no business experience. Yet Australia's industrial welfare is in our hands in dealing with this tariff. We may make general deductions, but definite information regarding the probable effect of increased duties is absent. I am not at all sure that Parliament is the most suitable body to determine tariff matters, and I feel that we shall be voting on these duties more or less in the dark. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thompson,</inline> I think, is responsible for the suggestion that it wOuld be advisable to hand this matter over to a special commission. "We should lay down the policy to be pursued, and authorizing such a body to administer the tariff, so that the duties might be adjusted in such a way that the nation would receive the maximum benefits from them. This body should be free from all interference. The' members of the Senate represent separate States, and, naturally, are inclined to support the requests for particular duties that come from their own States. Votes are often given in favour of proposals in which the members from the States concerned do not ardently believe. This disability would be removed if the duties were fixed by an outside independent body, whose function it would be to carry out the policy laid down, irrespective of the interests of particular States. In dealing with the schedule, I shall use my own judgment, and vote against items to which I am  totally opposed. I trust that the tariff will soon be revised in such a way that it will be of benefit to Australia as a whole, in regard to both its primary and secondary industries. </para>

                    <para>. - This is a most important measure, and affects the economic and industrial life of Australia more than any other bill that has been before the Senate for a considerable time. I regret, therefore, that the Leader of the Government in this chamber <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Barnes)</inline> suggested yesterday that the debate on, the customs tariff is occupying too much time. Every detail of the schedule should receive the earnest consideration and close analysis of honorable senators. That some measure of protection for our industries is necessary is generally recognized. Like all new countries, Australia first gave its attention to primary and extractive industries. But as the products of these industries are subject to fluctuations of price, demand and output - the former on account of drought or other local conditions - the. development of secondary industries is necessary to give a broader base to the economic structure, and alleviate the effects of low prices1, reduced demand, or decreased primary production. That is one of the reasons why secondary industries are entitled to a certain amount of tariff encouragement. Protective duties are justified also to enable industries to meet the competition of other countries which on account of less onerous industrial conditions are able to produce more cheaply. Again, protection is justifiable when it assures to an established industry a bigger share of the home market, thus enabling the  adoption of improved methods and mass production, and selling at a, price equal to or less than that of the imported article. A customs tariff is a sound means of taxing imported luxuries, increasing the demand for local products without placing an undue impost on the every-day necessaries of life and industry. It also has its uses as a means of raising revenue. For these various reasons, the protective policy, wisely applied, can be of great benefit to any country. "We should, however, always bear in mind one consideration, which is succinctly expressed in the last annual report of the Tariff Board - </para>

                    <para>One of the most pressing problems of the day is- that caused by the very serious extent to which unemployment exists in Australia. The board has kept this matter consistently to. the fore during the whole year and has recommended increased duties wherever it hae considered a net increase of employment will result. Obviously, many of the requests for increased duties which the board has recommended against would, if granted, stimulate employment in the industry directly concerned, but by  reason  of the detrimental effect on other industries, in the opinion of the board, would actually diminish employment. </para>

                <para class="block">During this debate, supporters of this schedule have stated that but for the imposition of almost prohibitive duties and embargoes, Australia would have become insolvent. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dooley</inline> stated on Wednesday that these abnormally high duties were necessary to prevent the country from defaulting. That is a serious position for any country to be in. Let us analyse the facts, and ascertain the reason for the present state of affairs. During- the last few years the prices of all our export products, chiefly wheat and. wool, have fallen to a record low figure, causing an insufficiency of' fund's in London to meet- interest commitments and to pay for our imports; In addition to this, there is the large unfunded London debt of £38,000,000, for which no provision has been made. The London exchange rate of 30 per cent, would have been sufficient to rectify our adverse trade balance without the imposition of prohibitive duties and embargoes. But there is a greater force retarding the rehabilitation of the Commonwealth, for which the present Government is responsible, which has threatened the solvency of the nation. That is the lack of confidence in Australia's effort to meet her obligations and the altered conditions under which we live. On this subject the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald,</inline> of yesterday's date, made the following comments: - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>While the floating debt of £38,000,000 remains  unredeemed  or unfunded, the demand for Australian funds in London must continue, and thus tend to maintain the exchange rate. Satisfaction of doubts about Australia's  capacity  to meet thu demand depends upon a healthy export trade, and the stimulus today to our exporters is the yield from the  high  rate of exchange, lt is possible to perceive more clearly now than formerly how the recovery of Australia's credit overseas was definitely retarded by the past reluctance Of tin; Scullin Government to face up to its responsibilities, first recognized at the Melbourne conference of fourteen months aso, n,nd </para>
                    <para>Hut definitely faced and accepted until nearly twelve months had passed. The Prime Minister might have funded that floating debt in London a year ago but for the surrender, first by his Cabinet and then by himself, to the ignorant clamour of his party. The necessary economies had to bc made, but the delay in making them vastly deepened the depression. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">That, I think, aptly sums up the cause of our present unhealthy economic condition. A higher tariff and the prohibition of the importation of certain commodities have not by any means been responsible for the strengthening of confidence overseas in Australia's ability to meet its obligations. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dooley</inline> referred to the improved position of Commonwealth stocks on the London market, and, I think without adequate reason, claimed credit for this to the present Government. I remind him that the restoration of confidence followed on the heels of the recent appeal to the electors in Great Britain, and I venture also to suggest that the attitude of the Senate towards this Government's financial and industrial proposals has been, to a large extent, responsible for the improvement in our position in the London market. </para>
                <para>At the outset, I mentioned that a limited measure of protection was necessary for new industries. The tobacco industry may be cited as a case in point. Under the stimulus of moderate protection, tobacco-growing has made substantial progress during the last twelve months, particularly at Mareeba, in North Queensland. Our annual importation of tobacco totals about 26,000,000 lb., a quantity of which could be produced in Australia, and if the industry be given reasonable protection I feel sure that, in the course of a few years, Australian production will meet the local demand. </para>

In my opinion, the excise has not been administered in the best interests of the industry, but I shall deal with that aspect of the matter when we are discussing the tariff items in committee. , </para>

                <para>Advocates of high protection argue that it benefits primary producers by providing for them a wider and better home market. Work is the basic factor in the, successful development of every industry and form of production. Operatives, in secondary industries producing commodities that are required in every-day life exchange their output for that of the primary producer who supplies the raw materials for so many of our secondary industries. The essential factor in the building up of a well-balanced social order is the provision of an equitable medium of exchange. Our export industries provide the means for the payment of overseas services, the importation of necessary goods, interest, &amp;c, and under existing conditions the primary producers in those industries are obliged to work from one and a half to two hours a day longer in order that workers in protected industries may enjoy higher rates of wages and shorter hours of labour. Thus workers in our secondary industries benefit in two ways. In the first place, capital borrowed abroad is generally used on city improvements Or public works such as water conservation schemes and similar undertakings. It may be argued that water conservation projects benefit our primary producers. That will be admitted, but we should not forget that the high rates of wages duo to the inequality in the exchange of goods as between the primary and secondary forms of production have unduly increased the cost of such works. The interest on the capital that the country has borrowed, and its redemption, have to be met by the exports of the primary producer, and, in addition, he is burdened with the higher cost in which all undertakings are involved by reason of the higher costs of materials and labour made necessary by an unbalanced protection policy. That a country should produce the greater part of what it requires is very sound doctrine, provided that there is no departure from the fundamental principles laid down in the paragraph that I have read from the report of the Tariff Board; that is, noninterference with the costs of other industries, and the ensuring of a reasonable amount of competition. It is commonly supposed that a home market is created by high protection. Actually, however, that market exists whether there is high or low protection, because neither the population nor the amount which it consumes is altered by a tariff. The effect of a high tariff is merely to divert capital from one industry to another. It may be that that capital is diverted from a very sound proposition to an industry that is dependent for its existence purely on the protection that it receives. What happens in such a case is that the industry which was able to keep going without protection ceases to exist, and the employees supported by it are attracted to the highly-protected industries which, because of protection, can pay better rates of wages. This is borne out by the remarks of Professor Copland, published in the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline> of the 27th August, 1931. The professor there says - </para>

                        <para>- That is one industry which supports my contention that the high protection afforded to some industries lessens the value of others, and lessens their ability to provide employment. Had the coal-mining industry been left alone, the number of men that it formerly employed would have remained unaltered or have increased, and we should have been on a far better basis than we -are to-day. The honorable senator knows that the coal export trade of New South Wales, which at one time was flourishing, has now, even with government assistance, dwindled practically to nothing. There are many industries which, admittedly, are entirely dependent upon the high protection that they receive; they are not economically' sound, and could not stand if the basis of their existence were an export trade. Professor Copland spoke truly when he said that the efficiency of an industry depends finally on its capacity to export to the markets of the world. </para>

                <para>It is frequently stated that the farmer derives an advantage from the tariff by reason of the fact that an additional market is created by it, in Australia. 1 differ from that view. The primary producer has to export his product to the Other side of the world. The dairying industry, for example, exports something like 55 per cent,, of its output; consequently, there is no need for the dairyman to look exclusively to the home market. It is argued that he receives locally a considerable addition to world's market price. If he were allowed to purchase on the overseas markets at a price equivalent to that which he receives for his product, he would be in pocket; but, as he has to buy in a highly protected market in Australia he should be allowed something as a set-off against the extra cost of the commodities that he requires. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brennan</inline> and SenatorReid- stressed the fact that this tariff had decreased employment. With those statements I entirely agree. I admit that there has been an increase of employment, in certain highly protected industries. The Minister for Customs has repeatedly declared that there has been an increase in employment in certain secondary industries in both New South Wales and Victoria. However, that is the exception rather than the rule. In the waterside industry particularly, the tariff policy of this Government has resulted in much additional unemployment. Comparing the ratio of unemployment of to-day with that of pre-war years, Professor Copland stated - </para>

For 1922 to 1929, the average was 10 per cent., with a rising tendency, compared with6 per cent, before the war. It would seem to indicate, therefore, that the tariff was a means of enlarging the volume of employment at ruling rate of costs had reached and, indeed, exceeded the limitations of its usefulness. </para>

                <para class="block">That concisely sums up the position. Up to a certain limit a protective tariff if an asset, but beyond that limit it become? a liability. The safety limit has now been passed. In an interjection to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid, Senator O'Halloran</inline> declared that the percentage of unemployment was not so great in our secondary as in our primary industries. That bears out what I am saying. Purely because of the protection afforded them, the super protected industries have been able to employ additional men. That that has been at the expense of the other industries is conclusively proved by statistics. </para>

Personally. I cannot see how that could be brought about. To be consistent, supporters of the idea should advocate that the States, too, should be self-contained. The very basis of federation was unrestricted trade between States. It is only by an adherence to that policy that our States have progressed. Had they been self-contained units, their advancement would have been negligible. If we admit that, we must, take the broader view and acknowledge that Australia could not exist as a self-contained nation. </para>

                    declared that the newly-elected British Government would have to take steps similar to that adopted by this Government, and introduce a highly protective tariff. I do not agree with the honorable senator. I believe that the new MacDonald Government has no intention of rushing into high protective duties and embargoes such as were sponsored by this Government during the past two years. If it does, it will find itself in even greater difficulties than those which now confront us. Although Great Britain has a great number of free items on, its tariff list, it is by no means a freetrade country. I believe that its" customs revenue last year amounted to £150,000,000. This tariff has been imposed without any thought being given by the Government to its dire effect upon primary production. A properly-regulated tariff would be of decided advantage to this country at the present time. I trust that the British Government will not only adopt an adequate tariff policy, but will also take steps to bring about tariff reciprocity throughout the Empire. We on this side are not opposed to protection. We would welcome a properly-regulated tariff, due regard being paid to its effect upon Australian industries generally. The following remarks by Professor Copland aptly put the position :  -

                    <para>If the tariff spreads rapidly it imposes heavy burdens upon existing industries, and its costs will be greater than its benefits. Thus the committee that reviewed the tariff in 1029 was forced to the conclusion that any increase in the tariff would depress both the export industries and the standard of living. The committee's view was quite definite: "Our surplus resources available to subsidize industry are limited and will not stand any greater strain than imposed by the present tariff." </para>

This tariff is vastly different from the protection  of  industries tariff which the British Parliament is now proposing. </para>

                <para>I wish now to refer to two aspects of the incidence of the tariff on primary industries. The first is the greatly increased cost of living. . The figures quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brennan</inline> yesterday show that there has been a general rise year by year since 1908 in the cost of living, corresponding with a general increase in tariff rates, and 'that that has been reflected in the higher wages, the increased cost of services, and the shorter working hours operating in this country. Let me give one example of the additional burden thrown upon the primary producers because of the incidence of this tariff. In 1915 the rail freight on a ton of wool from Longreach, in western Queensland, to Brisbane was <inline font-style="italic">£611s.</inline> 8d. In 1928 it was £12 7s. 7d., or an increase of about 95 per cent. In 1931 the cost was reduced to £10 17s.11d., and since the first of this month it has been reduced to £101s.11d. The credit for that reduction must be given to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Moore,</inline> the Premier of Queensland. Freights to-day are considerably higher than . they were in 1915. This extra cost is due largely to the greatly increased cost of material and services connected with the operation of railways. The whole incidence of the tariff has been to increase the burden of the primary producer, although the price of wool to-day is practically the same as it was in 1915. The other aspect of the incidence of the tariff is the greatly increased cost of the manufacturing requirements of the producers, which is a great deal more than they can afford, considering the low prices ruling for their products. </para>

                <para>The price of primary products is now back to where it was years ago, when all production costs were much lower than they are now. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glasgow,</inline> a few days ago, in giving some instances of the differences between cost now and in 1913, mentioned that it now cost £2 per bale to shear and market a bale of wool. The honorable senator made a very moderate estimate. Many wool-growers would be happy if they could get their wool to market at that cost. Such a pastoralist as that to whom the honorable senator referred must work a property near the railway. I have received some authentic figures supplied by an accountant which show the cost of marketing wool produced in the Win ton district. The average weight per bale of wool in this instance was 350 lb., and the average number of fleeces per bale was 50. Shearing and woolpacks cost £2 7s. 8d. per bale; road freight for 130 miles by horse teams cost 16s. 3d. per bale; and rail freight and selling charges accounted for £2 0s. 6d. per bale, making £5 4s. 5d. in all. The gross proceeds from the sale of that clip in August last averaged £10 10s. per bale! This price was well above the average. It will be seen therefore that practically 50 per cent of the proceeds were absorbed in shearing, packing, and freight charges. This meant that the pastoralist had to carry on his operations for practically the whole year, pay rent and wages, meet interest charges, and allow for depreciation out of only 50 per cent, of the gross proceeds of his product. Compare this with the following costs for 1913, when wool was a little dearer than it is to-day :  - </para>

The use of horse transport is dependent upon the seasons. If seasons are bad, the carriers cannot afford to hand feed their horses.

In Canada the maximum duty is 373 per cent., constructional material is admitted free, as also all capital requirements for plant, whilst all reproductive imports as requisites for industry are admitted  free or at the lower tariff rates. In Australia the management of any industry  has  to seriously consider the tariff penalty to be paid to the Government for trying to increase the national wealth. </para>

It must be remembered that if the conditions are such that our primary producers cannot market their products overseas at a profit there will be no national income to support the manufacturers.

                </quote>
                <para>I desire to say most emphatically that no such threat as alleged was made, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> appears to have based hi, question upon a newspaper heading which was at complete variance with the subject-matter which followed it. The Minister made it clear that trade treaties would not be negotiated by the Commonwealth with foreign countries until  the adjourned Economic Conference had been held. He also stated that the representations which had been made by foreign countries could not be ignored indefinitely, and he gave it as his opinion that the adjourned Economic Conference, which was to have been held in August of this year, should be called together at the earliest possible date. Surely the right honorable the Leader of the Opposition cannot take umbrage at this suggestion, and if he is at all fair in the matter, he will admit that there was no justification for the manner in which he presented his question. During the course of the tariff debate he has advocated that wo should negotiate with foreign countries with which we have favorable trade balances, and the sooner the adjourned Economic Conference is held the sooner we shall be able to come to a decision on the representations which have been submitted to us by certain foreign countries. </para>
                <para>In conclusion, I desire to inform honorable senators that this Government is most friendly in its attitude to interEmpire trade, and is most anxious to furnish further tangible proof of its sincerity in the matter. In this connexion, the Empire Marketing Board has already applied the principle that preference should be given, in the first place, te the products of Great Britain, and, after that, to dominion products.  No  objection can be taken if we apply the same principle, giving preference to our own products first, and thereafter to British and dominion products. </para>

                        said that he thought the time was ripe for an early dominion economic conference and in his opinion it should be held at the earliest possible date. The dominion* had already made up their minds and evidently the electors of Great Britain had given a mandate that such a course of action should be taken. All the data is now available iIi the Trade and Customs Department. The conference, which was to have been held at Ottawa in August last, and which was postponed, should be held not later than January.

                        <para>- I am afraid that that consideration is at the back of his statement. The making of reciprocal trade agreements with the dominions will necessitate the imposition by the Mother Country of duties on goods which to-day are admitted free. Obviously, the British Government cannot enter into such agreements without full consideration and examination. The object of the tour of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas,</inline> the Secretary of State for the Dominions, is to put the Mother Country's point of view to them ; to let the present Australian Government, for instance, understand some of the difficulties in the path of trade reciprocity, and invite it to say what it is prepared to do in return for an improved position in the British market. The conference to be held, subsequently will merely record the decisions reached by imperial and dominion Ministers in consultation. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Forde</inline> stated that the Trade and Customs Department has all the information in it's possession. Has it information as to how far the British Government is prepared to go? Does it know on what goods Australia will ask for preference, and what the attitude of the British Government towards such requests will be? </para>

                        <para>- Australia's experience of a tariff schedule which has- been hurriedly thrown together should be a warning to the United Kingdom to hasten slowly.

I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Forde</inline> is full of energy, and is a young man in a hurry; but I suggest that a minatory tone should not be adopted in negotiations of this character. </para>

Even my comparatively simple friend would not be so destitute of shrewdness as to do anything of that kind in a direct way. We have sufficient evidence to warrant us in bringing this matter forward, and I do not think that any one will dispute that, provided our assumptions are correct, it is a matter of very grave importance that the public revenue should not be in any way manipulated by a member of the Cabinet, to increase his own political prestige or power in a particular district. That is the substance of the allegations which we make. We have some evidence which cannot be very well disclosed at this stage, but 1 would ask those honorable senators who, perhaps, have had more experience than I have had, if it is not a fact that one may have evidence which can only be brought before a committee where those concerned would have immunity, and where there would bc no danger of injuring any person by a premature disclosure of information. I can say no more, but I think I have said sufficient to indicate the nature of the allegations. </para>

                        <para>- The amalgamation referred to was not made because the State Savings Bank was in a dangerous financial position, nor is it true to say that the run on the bank was attributable to that cause. The Western Australian Savings Bank was one of two financial institutions - the other was the West Australian Bank - founded by the people of Western Australia. Both have now passed from local control, the former by amalgamation with the Commonwealth Bank and the latter by absorption by the Bank of New South Wales. The amalgamation of the Western Australian Savings Bank was not due to any uneasiness on the part of depositors. They were entirely satisfied with its control. It is true that, for a time, there was an excess of withdrawals over deposits, due largely to the financial depression which was accentuated in Western Australia by the results of this Government's policy. </para>

That fact, however, was never mentioned in any section of the press, and no one except the authorities was aware of it. The public of Western Australia was entirely satisfied to leave its savings under State control. The disparity was so great that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir James</inline> Mitchell considered it necessary to enter into the agreement without even consulting his colleagues, who were on the other side of the continent, because he did not want a whisper of it to get abroad.  His  action, which I, as a Western Australian, very much regret, was forced upon him, his Government, and this suffering State, by the entirely unwarranted intrusion of the Commonwealth Bank into the domain of the State for the . purpose of competing for the savings of the people, thus putting the taxpayers to the huge expense involved in running the two institutions side by side. Such a step was never contemplated by the framers of the Federal Constitution. </para>

                <para>But the point that I rose particularly to make, and that which I again impress upon honorable senators, is that there was no public anxiety in Western Australia regarding the position of the State institution until the news was published that the agreement had been made. A little of the snrne sort of panic that preceded the closing of the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales then manifested itself, but it was quickly allayed. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir James</inline> Mitchell's action compares very favorably with that taken by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> in similar circumstances. When he saw that the withdrawals were exceeding the deposits he went to work quickly and quietly, and by entering into an agreement with the Commonwealth Bank, succeeded in saving the position. He did not, wait, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> so foolishly did, until months had elapsed, and then run to the Commonwealth Bank for assistance after he had repeatedly repudiated his obligations not only to that institution but to the Commonwealth Government. There had never been a run on the Savings Bank of Western Australia in its history un til the announcement was made that it was to be absorbed by the Commonwealth Bank. It . was only then that Ministers found it, necessary to deliver speeches in the precincts of the bank reassuring the depositors, as <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Gibson did a day or two later, that their deposits were just as well safeguarded under Commonwealth control as they had always believed them to be previously. </para>

                    iri common with thousands of people in New South Wales, have been utterly misled by the entirely false statement that' has been made more than once by the commissioners of the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales, to the effect that the Commonwealth Bank acted towards the State Savings Bank of Western Australia in a manner in which it refused to act towards the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales. When the right to issue notes passed out of the hands of lue States, and the State savings banks were called upon to compete with the Commonwealth Savings Bank, no foresight on the part of the authorities of the State savings banks could prevent the making of such demands upon their resources as they could not meet. The authorities of the State Savings Bank of Western Australia saw that the time was coming when it would be difficult for that institution to meet the demands made upon it. They approached the Commonwealth Bank, and effected an amalgamation before any trouble arose, or there was occasion for the slightest public uneasiness.
