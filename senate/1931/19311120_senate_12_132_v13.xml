                <para class="block">Although the committee was evenly divided yesterday regarding the imposition of a special duty on whisky bottled out of bond, the Minister in charge of the bill did not say why the extra impost was fixed at 5s. Ap-  patently that amount was arbitrarily decided by the Minister for Trade and Customs; it certainly -was not recommended by the Tariff Board. The effect of my amendment is to reduce the charge to 2s. 6d. I point out the inconsistency of the Government in regard to bottling in bond. "Whisky is used largely as a beverage, but brandy has a definite medicinal value, and is used in cases of sudden illness, and in every hospital. Yet the Government does not endeavour to compel the bottling of brandy in bond ; apparently it is not necessary to protect the sick in the way in which the Government considers it necessary to protect the whisky consumers. However, bottling in bond does not give any guarantee of the age or purity of whisky. An immature fiery whisky, if bottled in bond, is not subject to any penal duty, but mature, high quality whisky, if taken out of bond in the wood, is subject to an extra impost of 5s. a gallon. If the Government had been really desirous of protecting the interests of the consumers it would not have made bottling in bond the standard at all. It would have provided that whisky which had been matured for five years would be admitted at a lower duty than immature spirit. It has been admitted that, under the present arrangement, a good deal of whisky which receives the benefit of this rebate of 5s. a gallon, is afterwards poured back into casks for sale. I believe, therefore, that the charge of half-a-crown a gallon would be more than sufficient. </para>

                        <para>.- If honorable senators agree to this request they will stultify themselves, in view of the decision already arrived at. The Senate has accepted the principle that some concession should be granted to those importers who set up their own bond, and do their own bottling under customs supervision, but a concession of 2s. 6d. a gallon is worth nothing at all. </para>

                        <para>. - The purpose of the Government, I take it, is to get as much revenue as possible from the liquor trade. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston's</inline> proposal, if accepted, would reduce the amount of revenue which the Government obtains. Every honorable senator must decide for himself whether he is justified in supporting such a proposal. I believe that the liquor trade should be called upon to pay as much to the Government in the way of revenue as can be obtained, consistent with allowing the business to remain solvent. The Government has at its disposal expert and competent officers, who have advised it as to the most suitable rate of duty to impose, and the Government is justified in accepting the recommendations of its officers. The Government is responsible for raising revenue, and may be trusted to act in such a way as to get as much revenue as possible. </para>

                    <para>As I have pointed out before, this rebate of 5s. a gallon encourages the bottling of whisky in bond under customs supervision, thus ensuring that the consumer gets a better article. In the more, distant parts of the country inspection of liquor cannot be carried out so frequently nor so thoroughly as in the city, and for the benefit of the outback consumer we should encourage the bottling of whisky under proper supervision. We know that in places' far removed from the centres of population it is quite common for one man to say to another, " Come on down to So-and-So's, where we can get a better drink". I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> whether that is not so. At the place in which better drink is sold, the liquor in the bottles is true to label. We should do our part to ensure that the liquor sold to the public is up to standard. We have here an opportunity to effect a much needed reform, but some honorable senators, with conservative minds, tend to hang back. They are in a rut, and will not move until prodded out of it. The health conference to which reference has been made was convened primarily for the purpose of conserving the health of the people. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> himself convened the conference, and presided over it. That conference affirmed the advisability of having whisky bottled under proper supervision. Those of us who wish to prevent poison being sold to the public are endeavouring to give effect to the findings of the health conference. </para>
                    <para>The <inline font-weight="bold">CHAIRMAN (Senator Plain).May</inline> I point out to the honorable senator that the principle which he is discussing has already been fully debated. The committee is now concerned only with the amount of the duty. </para>

I could point out that 30 pence is half of 60 pence, that 60 pence is twice 30 pence, and that twice the half of 60 pence is 60 pence, and that four times the quarter of 30 pence is 30 pence, and so on, but that would not satisfy the people. It would not help those in the bush who want to get pure drink. </para>

                            <para>- A good argument cannot be pressed home too often. The proposal is to reduce the extra duty on spirits not bottled in bond from 5s. to 2s. 6d. per gallon. We might as well remove the duty altogether as do that, for in either case the people in the back country, in whose interests I am acting, would be left without any protection whatever. </para>

                        <para>. - It would be better if there were no differentiation at all between spirit bottled in bond and that which is not bottled in bond. The reasons which I gave on another occasion hold good also in this instance. The additional imposition on spirits not bottled in bond strikes at the very people whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> wishes to protect. Those traders who are prepared to import -whisky in competition with the combine, which practically controls the whisky trade of Australia, should be encouraged to do so. The honorable senator referred to the Health Congress. It is true that the health authorities have, from time to time, made recommendations, but the governments of Australia have realized that they could not give effect to them because of constitutional difficulties, lt is idle for honorable senators to try to salve their consciences in respect of the vote that they have given by saying that they voted to maintain the purity of the spirits. </para>

                            <para>- It could do nothing because section 113 of the Constitution prevents the Commonwealth from interfering once the bottle has been taken from the bonded store. All that the Commonwealth can do is to levy an additional charge on spirit bottled out of bond, in order to encourage traders to bottle their whisky in bond. Those-of us who are opposed, to the higher duty altogether believe that "half a loaf is better than no bread ". </para>

                            <para>- Were the position otherwise, and a New South Wales industry affected, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> would not hesitate to vote to protect it. One South Australian producer of whisky in bulk, who is supplying whisky to New South Wales and Victoria, will practically have to close his premises if the Government's proposal is accepted. " What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander ". The proposal of the Government means that the South Australian industry to which I have referred will be put to the expense of an extra 5s. per gallon in respect of its whisky. South Australia will be hard hit by this proposal, since a number of hotelkeepers in large centres, such as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gambier</inline> and Port Pirie, bottle their own spirits. Notwithstanding that, by its vote last night the Senate showed that it was not in favour of the abolition of this additional duty, I feel that it should consider the claims of those people who are endeavouring to build up a clean trade, particularly when it can do so little to ensure the purity of the spirit offered to the public. </para>

                            <para>-  I have not said  so.  There is, however, nothing to justify the honorable senator's remarks about the poor quality of the spirits which certain traders have been importing in bulk. The honorable senator said that in some houses' good spirit was obtainable, and he suggested that in other places the position was different. I repeat that the spirits brought in by the people to whom I have referred are equal to any other imported spirit. At Parliament House, Adelaide, bulk whisky, which is imported by a publican who lives 300 miles from Adelaide, has been obtainable for a number of years, and is of such quality that it has been able to hold its own against the whisky imported by the combine. At one time it was one  of   the most popular whiskies in South. Australia. Why should the man who imports it be penalized? </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator's proposal will not prevent methylated spirits from being offered to the public. My proposal is not a reversal of the principle which has been accepted by the Senate. It simply means that, while the Senate approves the principle of bottling in bond, it is prepared to make the additional duty on spirit not bottled in bond 2s. 6d. a gallon, instead of 5s., thereby giving those people who prefer to bottle whisky out of bond a chance to continue the trade which they have established, with beneficial results to Australia, particularly South Australia. </para>

                            <para>- It would be interesting to know the name of the responsible officer who recommended the imposition of an additional duty of 5s. a gallon on whisky bottled out of bond. If a report has been received, why are not copies of it available to honorable senators? Surely that they be supplied is a reasonable request? In the absence of any reliable information, it is impossible for me to say whether a duty of this nature should be imposed, and whether the rate should be 5s. or 10s. Why has the amount been fixed at 5s. ? Why this secrecy? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> apparently, knows that a report of some kind has been submitted by some responsible authority. </para>

                        <para>.Yes. I do not know why we should be asked to support this differential duty in the absence of any report from the Tariff Board. If a request has been received only from the whisky combine, we should be so informed. Those engaged in the bulk business should have had the right to put their case. It appears that the whisky combine has been permitted to write its own ticket.

                        <para>The imposition of this duty will further entrench a monopoly, without reasons being given for such preferential treatment. I ask the Assistant Minister whether those opposed to bottling in bond have had an opportunity to submit their case. Apparently, we have to make up our minds in this matter in the absence of information which should be available. If that information is not forthcoming, we are entitled to make the rate as low as possible, and I, therefore, intend to support the request moved by

                        B. Johnston. I am not prepared to support the Government if evidence has been received from one side only. Apparently, some honorable senators will demand reports from the Tariff Board on some items but not on others. Every interest should have an opportunity to submit its case. Why should we not have a report on this item when reports are demanded with respect to foodstuffs, machinery, and textiles? It is the responsibility of the Assistant Minister to supply the committee with the information sought.

I thought at that time, that the committee was discussing, not only the principle, but also the amount of duty. During the discussion, I informed the committee that, acting among other things upon a report submitted by a conference of health authorities of the various States convened by the previous Administration, the Government decided to give the States the maximum amount of assistance in order to ensure the purity of liquor supplied to the public and to afford the maximum amount of protection to those, engaged in the bottling industry who had made representations to the Government. In the matter of purity, neither the manufacturers, nor the hotelkeepers could give the Government any assistance. The hotelkeepers could not speak on behalf of those engaged in the bottling industry. </para>

According to the departmental officers, a duty of 2s. 6d. in lieu of the present 5s. will be of little effect. I trust that the committee will reject the request. </para>

                        <para>. - When discussing this subject the other evening I explained that the distillers in Victoria who have spent large sums of money on their plants are in favour of  a  duty of 5s. on whisky bottled out of bond. These distillers include those conducting one of the largest distilleries in the world. They are producing an excellent gin at a reasonable price, equal, I understand, to that distilled in any part of the world; and it is expected that their whisky, when matured, will also be high class. Importing and distributing firms, with nearly a hundred years of splendid reputation, are in favour of whisky being bottled in bond under customs supervision, as also are the members of the Licensed Victuallers Association in Victoria. </para>

                            <para>- No; but it had something to say about bottling in bond. Since the representatives at that conference were advised by an officer of the Crown Law Department specially provided for that purpose, it seems strange that Senators McLachlan and Colebatch should now say that the conference mentioned knew nothing about the law relating to this subject. The first resolution affirmed that every State should be at liberty to determine for itself whether preservatives should be allowed. </para>

                        <para>. - The discussion of the question whether the difference between the rate of duty on whisky bottled under customs supervision and that on whisky not so bottled, shall be 5s., or 2s. 6d. per gallon, is another illustration of the utter futility of delay in the consideration of the tariff. The schedule relating to these duties on whisky was laid on the table in another place so long ago that nearly every one concerned has forgotten who recommended the differentiation. The same criticism may be directed to a great number .of other items in the schedule. The situation reminds me of a moving picture in which was shown a very old Indian mounted on an utterly decrepit pony, the explanatory caption reading: " This Indian is so old that he remembers the time when butchers gave away livers ". We might say something similar of these duties. Regarding the difference of opinion that is evident, there is an apposite proverb, " Who shall decide when doctors disagree?" In this case, the answer is obvious - the Tariff Board. As the principle appears to have been settled, for the time being at all events, the Government should ask the Tariff Board what, in its opinion, would be a fair differentiation between the respective duties. Whether the difference of 5s. was evolved out of the inner consciousness of the Minister for Customs or not, one cannot say, but even he cannot possess a better fortified opinion on the subject than any other member of the committee; we are all at liberty to express an opinion on the matter. No reason has been advanced why 5s. should be fixed as a proper extra charge on whisky not bottled under customs supervision. Naturally, those who, like myself, do not agree with the principle that has been adopted, consider that the difference in rate should be as little as possible. For that reason, I shall vote for the amendment. It would be far better if the Minister on this, and other matters, had a great deal more authority for his proposals than he appears to have. </para>

                        <para>.- I believe in the principle of bottling under customs supervision ; but a margin in the duty of- 2s. 6d. a gallon is not sufficient. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill</inline> that this subject should be referred to the Tariff Board, and, if the Government will allow this to bc done, I shall accept the recommendation of the board whatever it may be, even if, to do so, conflicts with votes which I have given previously upon these items. </para>

                        <para>. - Since the opinion of the committee is equally divided, we might very well agree to compromise, and vote for the lower rate of 2s. 6d. per gallon. But, while I am prepared to do this, I think it is highly undesirable to have any distinction between the duties on bulk and bottled whisky. I agree, also, that this is a matter which should be referred to the Tariff Board, and suggest that the committee adopt <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston's</inline> re- quested amendment, on the understanding that the board be instructed to inquire into the subject. Bulk whisky should not be penalized, because it is better than bottled whisky. This morning I put on the notice-paper a question relating to the reduction in strength, and I feel sure that the answers to be supplied will convince honorable senators that whisky bottled under supervision is not always good quality spirit. If we allowed bulk whisky to be dealt with under the old conditions, and permitted the importing  houses, which bottled very good whisky out of bond in the past, to continue the practice, there would be much more satisfaction in the trade generally. I should like now to refer briefly to the report of the health conference which sat in Melbourne in 1927. </para>

                        <para>. - Yesterday I gave a silent vote against any reduction of similar duties, and I intend to vote against this request. In view of the financial position of the Commonwealth, we cannot afford to sacrifice any further revenue. Australia is practically a bankrupt country.' Only recently it was unable to meet its obligations in connexion with its internal indebtedness. We are told by the Minister in charge of the bill that the proposed reduction of duties on spirits will amount to some £100,000, even while the existing condition of rationing is maintained. I know that not even the rationed amount of spirit has been imported, as those in the trade cleared huge quantities of spirits from bond just before these duties came into operation. Consequently, our importations have been negligible, and our customs revenue has suffered accordingly. I am aware that the schedule has been in operation for two years, but ever since those huge withdrawals were made from bond the effect on our customs and excise revenue has been most noticeable. We cannot afford to lose such a large sum of . money, and, in the circumstances, I intend to vote against this request. </para>

The reverend  signiors  on the front Opposition bench have raised the cry, "monopoly." I see clearly that there is no monopoly in this instance. Even if there were, this is the kind of traffic that should pay the maximum penalty. The elders on the front Opposition bench stampeded the timorous, and caused them to vote for a request to reduce similar duties on another item. I appeal to honorable senators, who are makers of their opinions, not to be led away on this occasion by those who are the unconscious aiders and abettors of the  moonshining  industry in Australia. </para>

I believe that by raising these duties too high, we shall deprive ourselves of revenue, and necessitate the imposition of taxation on those very deserving industries which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> is so anxious to save. The honorable senator' loudly proclaims that revenue is the cry. A few moments ago it was health, and a little later, a member of the Government stated that the provision of work was the cry. Whichever seems to be the most powerful argument for the moment is used, whether consistent or not with that previously employed. I shall vote, not to relieve the wine and spirit industry of this taxation, but in the hope that by the means proposed we shall get more out of the industry than would otherwise be the case. </para>

I rule that the amendment is not in order. </para>

                        <para>.  - The schedule is not likely to be disposed of within the next two weeks, and these items could, either by substantive motion independent of this bill, or pursuant to an undertaking by the Government, be referred to the Tariff Board for investigation and report while the remainder of the schedule is being dealt with. Such a reference could not be moved at the recommittal stage, be cause, as the Leader of the Opposition has pointed out, it would be out of order then just as it is now. An undertaking by the Government to refer these items to the Tariff Board could be given without causing any qualms of conscience or loss . of dignity, but the Senate may, by independent substantive motion, ask that these and other items be referred to the Tariff Board ; if they are so referred and reported upon, one of the principal complaints against the schedule will disappear. </para>

                        <para>. -  Apart from the technical objection to the motion on the ground of unconstitutionality, I judge from the speeches of honorable senators at the second-reading stage that this committee will probably desire the House of Representatives to refer several other items to the Tariff Board. That being so, the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill</inline> is worthy of adoption ; the request to refer this item to the Tariff Board might be deferred for the time being. The board has much more important work in hand. It is inquiring into certain other items in the schedule, and we hope that its reports will be available before those items are reached. If a general request is made subsequently for the reference of all items to the Tariff Board, the Government can offer no objection. </para>

                        <para>- There is a clear-cut proposal for the reduction of 5s. per gallon in the. British preferential tariff. The effect will be a reduction of revenue. Although on a former occasion I voted with
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan,</inline>
                        I did so under a misapprehension. Since this matter will come up for review by both Houses of Parliament, I still adhere to the view, which appears to bc accepted by all parties in the Senate, that our object should be to get as much revenue as possible from this source. In my opinion, a lowering of the rate of duly will result in decreased revenue, whereas
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline>
                        maintains that, by reducing the duty, the consumption of brandy will be increased, resulting in additional revenue. Unless the Government's proposal is adopted, it will be in a position to throw the blame on the Senate in the event, of the revenue falling short of expectations. The responsibility should rest with the Government. If the Minister could "-tell us what amount of revenue is involved, the position would be clearer, and we should know better how to vote. I agree that it is desirable that whisky and brandy should be treated in the same way. Both the Government and the Opposition are agreed as to the desirability of obtaining as much revenue as possible from this source; but they are not agreed as to the method to be adopted. As a member of the Opposition, I want to throw the responsibility on the Government, not on the Opposition.

The Government is in a better position with respect to brandy than it is in the matter of whisky, since Australian brandy, which has reached a very high standard, is consumed iu relatively much larger quantities than Australian whisky. The maximum loss likely to result from a reduction in these duties would he approximately £1,400. </para>

                        <para>. - Obviously, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> is under a slight misapprehension as to the operation of these duties. When the debate took place in another place, and it was decided to reduce the duties by 5s. a gallon, the amended rates became operative immediately. The proposal now is that the rates for both classes of brandy, that is, brandy bottled in and brandy out of bond, shall be reduced by 5s. per gallon. If this rate had operated from the 13th May, both classes of traders would benefit equally. But that is not proposed. The rate of 45s. per gallon will be levied in respect of all brandy bottled under supervision and not cleared prior to the final decision by the House of Representatives. </para>

                        <para>.  - I think that the Senate should have some explanation from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> of his request. These duties are designed only to prevent unmatured spirits coming into Australia, and were imposed after careful investigation by the Minister and those responsible for policing the act. We should assist the States, so far as we can, in the administration of their pure foods legislation. Nobody will suggest that it is in the interests of consumers that these duties should be reduced to enable unmatured spirits to be marketed. The heavier rate of duty ensures that the spirit will remain in bond until it reaches a satisfactory state of maturity. </para>

                        <para>. - This is one of the luxury items upon which the Government does not want the Australians  to spend their limited resources overseas. Figures regarding the manufacture of perfumed spirits in Australia are not available, but the extent of the industry is indicated by the fact that in 1927-28 excise duty was paid on 36,173 gallons, and in 1929-30 on 42,871 gallons. The spirit is used for the manufacture of scents, toilet preparations, and essences. Even if the request that has been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> were accepted, it would not materially assist the consumer, as it would mean a loss of revenue to the Government of only about £500 per annum.We have successfully encouraged the manufacture of perfumed spirits in Australia. </para>

Australia has 300,000 people unemployed, and I am in favour of protecting every industry, however small, which will provide work for our people.

                <para>Can you be of some assistance to me in placing the following matter before the Tariff Board or Parliament? Here are the facts: - </para>
                <para>Some four months ago I ordered from England a small consignment of art metal frames (nothing made in Australia like them ) . They arrived at Fremantle four weeks ago, and I am prevented from taking delivery of them by the customs demanding duty, sales tax, and primage amounting to 300 per cent. Price of goods, £57 12s. 7d.; duty, sales and primage asked for, £149 3s.11d. Previously, on similar goods, I have paid 40 per cent. duty. On this occasion 1 was willing to pay 65 per cent. duty, which, with sales tax 6 per cent. and primage 10 per cent., brought landing charges up to 130 per cent., about £74. But, no; Tariff Department are not satisfied with anything fair. However, unless they change their attitude and adopt a more reasonable one, I shall be forced to return the goods, much as I wanted them for Christmas business. In addition, one has exchange, insurance, <inline font-style="italic">&amp;c</inline> bringing the total cost to nearly 400 per cent. Please do your best to have this injustice brought before the board. If the goods go back, I lose, and the Government lose heavily, too. . . . One reads a good deal about Empire trade and preferential tariff. In my case, 300 per cent. is called preferential to British goods. </para>
            </quote>
            <para class="block">It may be that these charges have been imposed in accordance with the provisions of the tariff, but I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Customs whether he will have the matter looked into. If the goods are not made in Australia, it does not seem reasonable that the duty should be so heavy. </para>

                    <para>.   -  I wish to bring under the notice of the Government certain complaints which I have received regarding the collection of sales tax in Tasmania. On the mainland, imported goods are delivered to importers at all the capital cities at the same price, but on those delivered to Tasmania transhipping charges have to be paid, in addition to the ordinary freight. The sales tax is assessed on the final cost of the goods, including freight, insurance and all other charges, so that the Tasmanian importers have to pay more by way of sales tax than their competitors on the mainland. This places them at a serious disadvantage. I do not know what remedy can be applied, but I do not think that it was the. intention of Parliament to discriminate unfairly against any section of the Commonwealth. </para>

The report was to be made to the South Australian Government, so that the Commonwealth Government is not really concerned in the matter. I understand, however, that copies of the report have been made available by the Minister for Mines in South Australia to certain members of the Commonwealth Parliament, and others may be obtained from the same source. </para>
