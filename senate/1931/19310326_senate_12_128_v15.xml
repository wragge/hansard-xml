                            <para>- So far as the Standing Orders relate to this case I think the procedure is entirely in order. The legal aspect of the matter is one to be adjudicated upon, not by me, but by the Crown Law authorities, who no doubt will be consulted. My ruling is that the Standing Orders so far have been complied with. </para>

As I have already reminded honorable senators, it is not for me to adjudicate upon points of law. The contention of the honorable senator who has raised this point, may be effective in a court of law, but I simply have to satisfy myself by the only means at my disposal - those means being the identification of this document by the  Clerk  of the Senate, and by the Leader of the Opposition - that it is the document which was laid on the table, and is now sought to be disallowed. In those circumstances, I do not think there can be any question as to the right of the Leader of the Opposition to move his motion. </para>

                                        <para>will deal first with the second question. Section 10 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901-1930 imposes a duty upon Ministers to lay a regulation before each House within the specified time; and also gives Ministers an absolute discretion as to the particular time, within the specified time, that duty shall be performed. </para>

                        <para>In my opinion the words " laid before such House ", in the concluding paragraph of section 10. have reference to the laying of the Regulation before the House pursuant to the preceding provisions of the section - i.e., to the laying of theRegulations before the House by a Minister in pursuance of his statutory duty. In my opinion, therefore, a disallowing resolution, passed by the Senate before the Regulation has been laid before the Senate by a Minister in pursuance of the Statute, or of which notice has been given before the regulation has been so laid before the House, is not within the terms of the statute and is inoperative. My answer to the second question is therefore " No ". </para>
                        <para>On this construction of the Statute, it becomes unnecessary to answer the first question. I would point out, however, that Standing Orders 363 and 364 are rules of debate. Standing Order 363 is based upon a rule of the British Parliament cited in <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> (13th Ed. ), page 328, that a Minister is not at liberty to quote from a state paper not before the House, unless he is prepared to lay it upon the Table. Standing Order 364 is an extension of this rule to documents quoted by private members. </para>
                        <para>The purpose of the Rules is to prevent a document from being quoted in debate without  giving members an opportunity to see the whole document. They do not contemplate the laying on the Table by a private member of a document which will in the ordinary course be laid on the table pursuant to Statute by a Minister. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>I therefore think that there is strong ground for contending that Standing Order 304 does not apply to such a case as this. </para>

                        <para>. - The suggestion that honorable senators are wasting time on this matter is unworthy of the Government or of any person holding executive office. The miserable tactics in which the Government is now engaging constitute one of the most deplorable instances in the history of the Commonwealth Parliament. They are a travesty of constitutional and parliamentary government, and I hurl the suggestion back in the teeth of the Leader of the Senate that the action of the Opposition is merely a waste of time. The Opposition is attempting to protect m;en who are guilty of nothing except loyalty to the awards of the Arbitration Court, which was properly constituted by this Parliament. Loyalty is a virtue that is probably unknown to some honorable senators opposite. The Opposition is using every means in its power, and will continue to do so, to bring relief to those oppressed loyalists by repealing the iniquitous regulations which the Government seeks to perpetuate. Recently, the Leader of the Government, with the petulance of a perturbed parrot, suggested that the Government would re-enact these regulations from day to day, if necessary. I contend that that is flouting parliamentary government, that it is subversive of constitutional principles, and will bring upon Parliament the contempt that it would so richly deserve if such a course were persisted in. Not only is it contrary to all authority, but to the very provisions of the statute under which the regulations were made. Although in the hurly-burly and heat of the war period certain decisions were given by an eminent predecessor of yours, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> it is obvious  that Parliament never intended under the Acts Interpretation Act to relax its power of control over any statutory rules or regulations. It is apparent that " within so many days after " simply indicates that there is a limit of time within which Parliament must act; that otherwise it will be deemed to have sanctioned the regulations. This matter is a vital one from the Constitutional viewpoint: Whether Parliament is to hand over absolute power for a certain period to an executive which behaves itself as this one has. </para>

His Excellency the Governor-General acts pursuant to certain advice that is tendered to him. I resent any departure from precedence in this matter. The action of the Government is the outcome of a .revengeful petty spirit, and I propose to support the resolution. It is not that I believe for a moment that the efforts that have been made today and the divisions that have been called by the Government have been necessary. I submit that it is in the power of Parliament at any time, within the period fixed by the legislature, to disallow any regulation whether it is laid on the table of the House or not. I have ample authority to which to refer in support of that contention. </para>

                    <para class="block">I have no desire to see the Senate do anything which would amount to a travesty of government. I hope that honorable senators will not be led away by what they may consider to be the real issues in this conflict, but that they will view it from the constitutional aspect, as is expected of the Senate. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> first of all moved a certain resolution for the adjournment of the Senate. Then a certain document was called for and tabled. The motion now before the Senate does not expressly allege that that document is the regulation. It is very ingeniously worded to cover what might be a regulation, and what might be a disallowance of that regulation. As you said, sir, in that inimitable style for which you are noted when dealing with diplomatic problems, it is a matter for the courts of law to decide. I do not think that we should leave the law in a state of uncertainty. In urging the rejection of the motion of the Leader of the Opposition, I am not appealing to the Senate to do anything more than they and their colleagues appealed to this party to do when Labour was in Opposition. I refer to the occasion when an attempt was made to disallow Statutory Rule 273 of 1916, under the "War Precautions Act 1914-16. I invite honorable senators to compare the opinion that was then given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> on a matter similar to that now engaging our attention.

                            knows that the document laid on the table to-day comprises the regulations to which exception was previously taken by a majority of honorable senators. I am only too glad to have the opportunity to express my absolute disgust at the attitude of the Government in setting at defiance the decisions of the Senate. That action of the Government justifies honorable senators making every endeavour to maintain the dignity of this chamber. Never previously in the history of Australia has a government stooped so low as to defy the decision of the Upper House in an important matter such as this. Honorable senators know that the regulations were originally introduced when Parliament was in recess, in order that they could operate without Parliament having an opportunity to deal with them. As soon as that opportunity presented itself, the Senate very definitely disallowed the regulations. Now the Government endeavours to repeat its previous action.

                            that sort of thing were countenanced, it could go on interminably. There must be an end to it.

                        in defence of the Government's action. Regulations dealing with the waterside workers were promulgated, and, in due course, came before this chamber, which disallowed them in the ordinary way. The Government then deliberately held its hand in order that it might act behind the backs of the representatives of the people in this chamber. It refrained from taking any action until Parliament was in recess. Then it made regulations and brought them into immediate operation. When Parliament resumed a few weeks ago the Government refrained, for a considerable period, from laying those regulations on the table. When they were tabled they were disallowed by the Senate. Immediately following their disallowance, regulations in the same terms were gazetted and brought into force again. Does
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline>
                        stand for practices of that kind? Does he approve of the action of an administration which seeks to defeat well-known principles of parliamentary government by taking away from the representatives of the people in Parliament any check upon the regulation making power of a government? In this country the only authority to make laws is the Parliament, elected by the people. But Parliament has power to delegate its authority in certain matters. It may delegate authority to the executive to make regulations, under specific conditions. There is no portion of the British Empire in which the delegation of this law-making power to the Government is as wide and as generous as in Australia. But this wide and generous provision imposes upon the Government the responsibility at all times to act honorably and decently. The moment that a government, by trick or. subterfuge, abuses that power, it brings itself into contempt, not only in the Parliament, but in the eyes of the people. The Acts Interpretation Act, under which this delegated power is given to the executive, provides that regulations shall be tabled in both Houses, and, if disallowed in either,  3hall  thereupon cease to have effect.

                    <para class="block">Senate, immediately re-enacted the regulations which had been disallowed, and brought them into force. By its  action  the Government virtually set itself above the people. It said, in effect, " We do not care what the people say, or what the representatives of the people in Parliament say. We have this delegated power, and intend to use it. It is true that it  was  never given to a government to be abused in this fashion, but, having got it, we are going to keep it, and we do not care to what extent we abuse it." Lt must be obvious to all who give the matter a moment's thought, that the abuse of this power by a government means that the authority of Parliament,  in  regard to regulations is entirely abrogated and destroyed. If the action of this  Government  is  to pass  unchallenged, there  will be no  longer any power residing in either House  of  Parliament  to  render ineffective regulations made  by  governments. Does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> stand for that principle ? </para>

                        COLEBATCH.The  President  has ruled that they have been tabled. That  is  sufficient for me. I  go  further and say that,  if  they have  not  been tabled  by  the Government, they ought  to be.  I add that,  in  not laying the regulations  on the  table immediately they were promulgated, this Government was guilty  of  a gross and grave abuse  of  its powers. The provision  in  section 10  of  the Acts Interpretation Act  is  not designed  to  enable a government  to  sneak away from and defraud Parliament  of its  rights. It ia intended  to  give the Government a proper opportunity  to do  its work. The instruction that, regulations made must be laid on the table of either house of the Parliament within 30 days means that the Government must table regulations at the earliest possible moment. Every decent government has at all times observed that practice. It has been the invariable rule, when regulations have been made during a recess, to place them on the table of either house immediately on the reassembling of Parliament. The regulations to which objection is now taken were withheld, not because if. was inconvenient to lay them on the table, but for the express purpose of muzzling the representatives of the people in this chamber. The action of the Government in this matter is contemptible, improper, and unjust.

                            <para>- 1 am not speaking of the merits of the regulations themselves; but I do condemn the Government for flouting the Senate by ignoring a cardinal principle of responsible government. Whatever may be the immediate outcome of this particular motion, I trust that the Senate will not allow the present session to continue much longer without taking the necessary steps to clip the wings of this Government. I hope that the Senate will make it absolutely clear that this delegated power was given on the definite understanding that a government would act decently. If this Government is not prepared to do the decent thing; if it is determined to abuse the wide power given to it we should amend the law so that a regulation made under it shall be again subject to the will of the representatives .of the people in either House of the Parliament. I hope that, by an amendment of the Acts Interpretation Act, the Senate will restrict this regulation making power of the Government. If in another place the Government chooses to  use  its majority to reject the amendment, the people will be informed of the true position. They will then realize that this Government disregards the principles of democratic government; that it seeks to be a law unto itself; that it will not tolerate any interference by the representatives of the people, and intends to do just what it likes.

It is alleged that the Government is flouting the will of the representatives of the people. I deny that, and assert, on the other hand, that the Senate, by disallowing regulations made by this Government under the Transport Workers Act, and by its attitude towards other Government measures, is flouting the will of a government that was returned with a definite mandate to pass certain legislation. Having in mind the political views held by the majority of members in this chamber, I assume that in promulgating the regulations referred to the Government decided to give effect to its policy without introducing a bill to repeal the act. I hope that the Government will continue in this course, and that if these regulations are disallowed it will re-enact them without delay. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> was not justified in his assertion that the Government was legislating by way of regulations behind the backs of the representatives of the people. </para>

Apparently the honorable gentleman was not so well informed on this subject as he usually is upon other matters. If he were he would have been familiar with the circumstances connected with the making of regulations under the War Precautions Act in 1916. At that time the right honorable the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> was Minister for Defence. Certain regulations, promulgated on the 3rd November, 1916, were not tabled in the Senate until the 6th December, some considerable time after Parliament had re-assembled. In reply to criticism concerning the action of the Government the right honorable gentleman took exactly the opposite view to that which he takes to-day.

                    <para class="block">If there were good reasons for the observance of the rule in 1916, there are equally good reasons to-day, because of the known intention of the Senate to prevent this Government from giving effect to its industrial policy, thereby taking out of the hands of the executive government power which has been specifically conferred upon it by Parliament. Honorable senators opposite are endeavouring to prove that they are the chosen of the people, and that to them the community must look for protection. I remind them that since most of them were elected to this chamber an appeal has been made to the electors, and that the party to which they belong »was overwhelmingly defeated. The result of that appeal placed a new government in power, with the result that the present Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> and his supporters took seats on the left side of the Chair instead of on the right as formerly. Honorable senators opposite know well that had they also sought the suffrages of the electors at that time, they would have been transferred not from one side of the chamber to the other, but from inside the chamber to places outside Parliament. They know these things; yet they desire to take the business of the country out of the hands of the Government. No amount of argument can alter that fact or controvert that principle. </para>

                            <para>- The Parliament of the Commonwealth comprises two Houses. It is in another place, not here, that governments are made and unmade. The representation of parties in another place more truly represents the will of the people than does the representation of parties in the Senate. Why was not this motion moved in another place? The Opposition was afraid to do so. The matter was brought up in the Senate because the Opposition knew that it had the numbers to frustrate the Government's desire to maintain peace on the waterfront, and to mete out justice to those unfortunate men who have been so maligned in this chamber recently. The action of honorable senators who have spoken harshly against waterside workers is the more strange when we reflect that many of them owe their position in this chamber to the financial and other assistance rendered them by waterside organizations. I know many of the waterside workers in South Australia to be as conscientious, loyal and efficient as are the workers in any other industry. </para>

                        <para>.- Both in this chamber and outside, the Government has stated that it will continue to issue these regulations despite their disallowance by the Senate because of a mandate which it has received from the people. I deny that that is so. The Senate, which is representative of States as such, is more representative of the people than is another place. If the Government is so keen on effect being given to the will of the people, why does it not make an appeal to the electors? Only a small section of the community is affected by these regulations, yet all the powers of government are being used on their behalf. Every conceivable subterfuge is being resorted to by the Government to further their interests. The persons affected are where they are because of their own actions. The action of the Government in resorting to all these subterfuges is degrading. If the Government continues to use its executive power to defy the Senate, I am prepared to go to any length to bring it to a sense of its responsibility. The Senate has certain constitutional powers which it has every right to force the Government to recognize. Senators O'Halloran and Dooley said that for some time there has been peace on the waterfront. They cannot say that that is the result of these regulations having been gazetted. These regulations were not framed to bring about peace on the waterfront. It is true that there has been comparative peace on the waterfront for some time. It is also true that since volunteer workers took the place of members of the Waterside Workers Federation pillaging on the wharfs has decreased enormously. Prior to the employment of volunteer waterside workers, Australian ports were notorious for the pillaging that took place. I do not say that amongst the members of the wharf labourers' unions there are not any honest men. Many of them are honest, worthy citizens, who for fear of victimization have been compelled to shut their eyes to what went on. The trouble is that the organization was used by gangs of thieves for the carrying out of their nefarious purposes. I have no  doubt that the motion will be carried. Should the Government again gazette the regulations, the Senate would be justified in going to any length to assert its constitutional authority. </para>

                            <para>- I know that the Senate is Australia's House of Lords. That admission may be some solace to honorable senators opposite. Nevertheless, another place is the house of the people. No Australian Parliament should engage in a vendetta against any set of individuals. Admittedly, the waterside workers were ill-advised in the action they took at one stage; but is that any reason why this Parliament should force them and their families to starve? Are we here to legislate for a small minority or for the people as a whole? As the result of action taken by the Bruce-Page Government to penalize members of the Waterside Workers Federation, the business community of Port Adelaide has been thrown into a state of confusion, and many of the traders in that seaport have been brought almost to a state of bankruptcy. </para>

In consequence of the legislation passed by the Bruce Page Government many of the business people of Port Adelaide, who support the political policy of honorable senators opposite, have been practically ruined. Surely it is time that we studied this matter from a more humanitarian viewpoint, and realized that the members of the federation have been sufficiently punished. </para>

                        <para>.- The argument of the Government Whip <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Hoare),</inline> who suggests that because the men working on the waterfront at Port Adelaide do not live in the vicinity of the port the regulations should be allowed, is illogical. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hays</inline> mentioned by interjection, the work on the waterfront is at present being efficiently carried out. It is ridiculous to suggest that regulations should be framed, merely because those who reside in Port Adelaide are not getting all the work. If the volunteers working on the waterfront at Port Adelaide or the Outer Harbour prefer to live at Glenelg, or some other attractive suburb in the State, they should not be prevented from working on the wharfs. Since the Transport Workers Act, which provides for the licensing system, came into operation, there has been a complete cessation of those industrial upheavals, which were continually occurring at practically every port in the Commonwealth. The Transport Workers Act was not passed for the purpose of excluding members of the Waterside Workers Federation, but in order to ensure peace on the waterfront at a time when. Australia was threatened with a big industrial upheaval. </para>

                    <para>I want to show that work on the waterfront is now being carried out faithfully and well. In North Queensland it is certainly being carried out more expeditiously and at a lower cost than it was prior to the passing of the Transport Workers Act. The primary producers have reaped the benefit, and there has been less pilfering. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Halloran,</inline> the purpose of these new regulations is to ensure peace on the waterfront. What was the position in Queensland prior to the passing of the Transport Workers Act? Every year, just at harvest time when it was necessary to get sugar away to the refineries in the south, there was a strike in practically all the northern parts of Queensland. The people of Bowen depend largely on the fruit and tomatoes that they can send away to the south. Their season lasts for about three months. Prior to the passing of this act there was always a strike when the farmers were ready to get their produce away. They had either to face ruin or pay heavy transport charges by sending their fruit and tomatoes south by train. It is only in recent years that there has been a train service available to them. Two or three years ago the position became so desperate in the North Queensland ports that sugar-farmers in the Cairns district and many members of the Australian Workers Union, timber-getters and others on the Atherton tableland, were obliged to combine into an army for their mutual protection. They entrained for Cairns and cleaned up the waterfront there. They afforded protection to men who were prepared to load sugar, timber, and produce into ships at the wharf. Previously, there had been upheaval after upheaval in Cairns, but, fortunately, the moderates among the federation men eventually came out on top. Work is now proceeding peacefully at Cairns. In Bowen it was necessary for the mayor of the town to organize the whole of the townspeople. They marched down to the wharf and voluntarily did the loading and unloading of cargo in order that their businesses might not be ruined. Such was the state of affairs in practically every port of Australia prior to the coming into force of the Transport Workers Act when the Waterside Workers Federation had absolute control on the waterfront, and it continued until men, whom the Prime Minister now describes as " scabs ", came to the assistance of industry and agreed to abide by the awards of the Arbitration Court. Since then the work of the waterfront has been carried on continuously, but prior to that there was no peace in the transport industry, and the primary producer had no assurance that ho could get his produce to market. </para>
                    <para>It is useless for honorable senators opposite, one after another, to plead the cause of the members of the Waterside Workers Federation as against the men who are working on the wharves at the present time. I quite agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid</inline> that there are probably thousands of men in the Waterside Workers Federation who were not in sympathy with the action taken by the executive of the federation, and I think that some honorable senators opposite expressed disapproval of the action of that executive in not abiding by the award of the Arbitration Court. But when we know that men have been working peacefully on the waterfront, and that they have reduced pillaging to practically nothing, and have given continuity of service, why should we sacrifice them by throwing them out of their jobs? I do  not propose to do so, nor do I propose to place the primary producers of North Queensland once more in danger of being brought nearly to ruin season after season by handing over the control of the waterside work to the members of the Waterside Workers Federation. </para>

                        <para>. - As this subject has been threshed out in the Senate on several occasions I do not intend to say anything upon the question of the disallowance or otherwise of these regulations. I have risen merely to give a few figures to show how the cost of loading and unloading of vessels has been brought down since the Transport Workers Act has been in force. We should regard this matter from the point of its effect on the prosperity of the country; because only by bringing down costs of production can we compete in the world's market and restore prosperity to Australia. The figures I have relate to general stevedoring charges at Townsville, Bowen, and Mackay. The cost of discharging cargo at Townsville, in 1927, prior to the passing of the Transport Workers Act, was 13s. 8d. per ton. In 1928, during which year the act was in operation for three months only, this charge was reduced to 13s., but in 1929, when the full effect of the regulations made under the act was felt by the late Government, the cost fell to11s.1d. per ton. The figures in regard to Bowen show an enormous reduction. In 1927, the cost of loading sugar was 8s. 2d. per ton. In 1929, when the regulations were in operation for three months only, the cost was reduced to 5s. 1.8d. per ton, but in 1929, when the regulations were in force for the whole twelve months, the cost of loading was only 2s. 5.6d. per ton. Compare that with 8s. 2d. per ton. in 1928. I have not the figures in regard to frozen meat for 1927, but for 1928, when the regulations were in force for three months only, the cost was 18s.1d. per ton, whereas in 1929, when the full effect of the new regulations was felt, it was only 10s. 6d. per ton. For general cargo, which includes tallow, hides, &amp;c, the cost of loading was 12s.8d. in 1928, and 4s. 5d. in 1929. These figures speak for themselves. </para>

                            <para>- I think that a full report on the sugar question is to be tabled shortly. When we have that report we shall probably have an opportunity to discuss the point raised by the honorable senator. I am merely indicating what good has been done by putting into force the regulations made by the previous Government under the Transport Workers Act. It is quite possible, however, that if the regulations issued by the present Government come into force, we shall go back again to the old costs of loading, although every Government in Australia to-day is crying out for a reduction in the costs of production and an increase in employment. The operation of the Transport Workers Act reduced costs, and increased employment. For those reasons I shall do all in my power to oppose the re-enactment of regulations which would bring about a retrogression to the state of affairs which existed before the Transport Workers Act was introduced. </para>

                        <para>.- I propose to comment briefly on the reply given by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Theodore)</inline> through the Leader of the Senate, to a statement I made on the 19th March, regarding newspaper reports of  a  speech delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Theodore</inline> at  a  public meeting in the Cremorne Theatre, Brisbane, on the 14th instant. I said that he was reported in the newspapers to have made certain statements which were grossly misleading, and I was fortified by the fact that at least three persons had told me that they had heard those statements by wireless. I brought the matter before the Senate, and the Treasurer, through the Leader of the Government, said that his statement was not as reported in the newspapers, but was in the terms of a speech he had made in another place on the 12th March. I have consulted the report of that speech in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and have also taken the trouble to refer to the reports in the Brisbane  newspapers of the public meeting on the 14th March. I quote, first, from the report of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Theodore's</inline> speech published in the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Standard,</inline> which, I understand, is a Labour journal - </para>

                        <para>The six years of the Bruce-Page Government, 1923-29, had been a period of extravagance, wasteful expenditure and reckless exploitation of overseas loan markets, which had made Commonwealth credit a by-word. In their last three years of office the Bruce-Page Government had borrowed ?129,000,000 in London and New York. This money had come to Australia in the form of goods and was the cause of the present depression and unemployment. </para>

                            dealt with the Bruce Page Government which, he said, had been wantonly extravagant with wasteful expenditure and reckless exploitation of the overseas money market. In its last three years that Government had raised from London and New York ?129,000,000 of loan money, which resulted in the consequences Australia was suffering from to-day, and which left an empty Treasury.

                    <para class="block">In his reply to questions asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glasgow,</inline> the Treasurer stated explicitly that the total of the overseas debt, incurred for Commonwealth purposes, during the three-year period mentioned, was ?4,500,000, not ?129,000,000 as alleged by him in his address in Brisbane. It appears that one must speak plainly in this matter, if the people of Australia are to be informed of the true position. lt is extraordinary that a man occupying the high and honorable position of Treasurer of the Commonwealth, should endeavour, by misrepresentation, to inflict a deadly blow upon political opponents who, for the most part, are always prepared to deal fairly with the Government and its supporters. The honorable gentleman must have known that his statement in Brisbane would mislead the people. He should be condemned in the strongest language, because it is generally understood that, as the result of such statements, which it is not always possible to refute promptly, Australia is in its present position, largely owing to the borrowing and financial policy of the  Bruce-Page Administration. But, as I have shown, the figures supplied by the Treasurer himself to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glasgow,</inline> give the lie direct to any such suggestion. The Treasurer also admitted, in his reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glasgow,</inline> that the bulk of the money borrowed by the Bruce-Page Government was raised on behalf of the several State Governments. The amount required for purely Commonwealth purposes was comparatively small. Furthermore, the sum of ?20,000,000 was paid off the overseas debt, thus making the net increase, for Commonwealth purposes, ?4,500,000. It was necessary that I should again refer to the statement of the Treasurer because he endeavoured to make honorable senators believe that, when speaking in Brisbane, he merely repeated what he had said on the floor of the House. If that were so, all I can say is that the Brisbane newspapers reported him incorrectly and those who heard his address over the air evidently failed to understand what he said. I did not quote extracts from the reports in the other Brisbane newspapers, but in essence they agreed with the report which appeared in the Labour journal. I take this, the earliest opportunity available to me, to again place before the people of Australia, the true position, and conclude by saying that it is not fair, even in politics, for the representative of any party to make public statements which are absolutely untrue. </para>

                        <para>. - I protest as strongly as possible against the action of the Government in adjourning Parliament for a period of nearly three weeks without first passing legislation to provide for immediate financial relief to be given to the wheat-growers of Australia. It is incredible that any government with a sense of its responsibility to our primary producers, upon whom the prosperity of Australia so largely depends, should give the wheat-growers a definite promise of assistance and then agree, in the middle of this week's sitting, to a lengthy adjournment in order that the Ministers and their supporters may attend a labour conference in Sydney. Our wheatgrowers should receive assistance at the earliest possible moment. They should have been in a position to purchase superphosphates at least a month ago, because in some of the earlier districts in my State farmers are already carrying out seeding operations. Unless help is forthcoming promptly, thousands of farmers will he unable to purchase  superphosphates this year. A great number are in actual need of sustenance. They were led to believe that they would receive a bonus on production this year. Immediately Parliament re-assembled, I brought their desperate plight under the notice of the Government. Since then honorable senators have attended regularly the sittings of the Senate in the hope that legislation for the assistance of the farmers would be sent up from another place, but up to the present we have been disappointed. It also appears that the bill which is being debated elsewhere, provides only for n bonus of 6d. per bushel on the exportable surplus. This will work out at about 4£d. per bushel on the total production. But the point which I wish to impress on the Government is that, from the point of view of encouraging next year's wheat production, £1 worth of assistance given to our wheat-farmers to-day, would be worth £5 worth of help given a couple of months hence. The State Governments are anxious to assist the growers, but unfortunately they have not the means. Therefore, this Government should use every endeavour to give effect to its promise to do so. In addition to the £3,500,000 to be paid by way of bounty on export the Government proposes under a bill now before another place to make available £2,500,000 for distribution by the State Governments for necessitous farmers who </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Deed  fertilisers to put iu their crop. Some such help as this is required if our wheat production is to be maintained. When the Wheat Bill introduced in the other House was being considered the Leader of the Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page),</inline> suggested that the money should be raised from the Commonwealth Bank, the loan to be secured by a sales tax on flour. We do not care whether the Perkins plan is adopted, and a sales tax of £7 4s. a ton imposed, or whether a smaller tax of £2 10s. is decided upon. Even a tax of £2 10s. would be sufficient to pay off the whole loan, interest and principle, in three or four years, and should not make it necessary to increase the price of bread. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Earle</inline> Page intimated that his party was prepared to support the bill, without prejudice to its declared hostility to a fiduciary note issue. As soon as it became evident that the bill was likely to receive the generous support of members of all parties the Government shelved it. I maintain that we are not doing a fair thing by the farmers if we adjourn Parliament now for nearly three weeks without first passing the Wheat Bill. In all the wheat-growing States of Australia the farmers are in urgent need of the assistance that has been so often promised them. In Western Australia, at least 8,000 farmers are in a desperate plight at the present time. They need a full bonus of at least 6d. a bushel on this year's production to meet the most urgent of their obligations. Many of them were put on new land, which they had to mortgage to its fullest capacity in order to make it productive. The State instrumentalities are unable to carry them any longer, and they need money, not only to put in this year's crop, but, in many cases, for actual sustenance. We naturally expect that the Government, which urged them to grow more wheat, and which last December had a bill passed through Parliament guaranteeing them 3s. a bushel at the port of export, should now keep some of the promises it has made. It is evident that the Government, in seeking this adjournment now, is preparing once more to abandon the farmers to their fate. Western Australian members of this Senate have gladly come 2,500 miles to attend the sittings of Parliament in the hope that legislation to assist the wheat farmers would be put before them, but during the past three weeks the time of the Senate has been wasted on unimportant measures. Although to-morrow is a regular sitting day both Houses are adjourning this afternoon, and I venture to prophesy that a number of Ministers will be present at the Federal Labour Conference in Sydney to-morrow. I further prophesy that some Ministers, probably including the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Theodore),</inline> will be head-hunting for some Labour members of this chamber, who only a few weeks ago were working strenuously to secure the reinstatement of the Treasurer in the Cabinet. I protest against such things going on when Ministers should be here attending  to urgent  business. </para>

It was not likely that Western Australian members should consent to the proposal brought forward under which that State was to be saddled with the Liability for half of any loss incurred. This was the first time in thirty years of federation that Western Australia was to receive any assistance for her industries, and then it was attached to an impossible condition. Ever since federation Western Australia has been contributing to the support of the industries carried on in the bloated cities of the eastern States. The Government's proposal was dishonest, unfair and unjust. If it had been reasonable we should have given it our unmeasured support. </para>

                        <para>- The Labour Government re-appointed <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Gibson, and very properly so. Any one of the previous governments which, during the 30 years of federation, have occupied the Treasury bench could, without difficulty, have found the money for the payment of that guarantee. The present Government could not find it because of a general lack of confidence in its administration. A great mistake was made by the Labour party when it forced Messrs. Fenton and Lyons out of its ranks. During the absence of the Prime Minister in England, when the present Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Theodore)</inline> was a private member, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fenton</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyons</inline> as Acting-Prime Minister and ActingTreasurer respectively, appealed for a loan of £28,000,000. So great was the confidence in their integrity that the loan was over subscribed. Later, however, when disastrous changes in the personnel of the Ministry were made, the Government found that it could not borrow the comparatively small sum of £6,000,000 with which it had hoped to pay a bounty on wheat, and assist necessitous farmers. It is time that a government so unworthy of confidence tendered its resignation. Particularly in the office of Treasurer there should be a man in whom the people have confidence. Financial institutions, as well as private individuals, would be prepared to lend sufficient money to assist necessitous farmers, and to pay the bounty if only there was in power a government worthy of their confidence. </para>
                    </talk.start></continue><para>The inability of the Government to borrow money resulted in the introduction into another place of certain legislation for the creation of a fiduciary note issue. That legislation would not be necessary if confidence in the administration were restored. No other government has over had to make the confession of failure that the present Government has made ; no other government has ever had to admit its inability to raise a shilling. </para><para>Even to-day the Government of Western Australia would have no difficulty in obtaining money to assist the wheat farmers of that State were it not handicapped by the shackles that federation has forged. Before Western Australia entered into a financial agreement "with the other States and the Commonwealth, the Government of that State had no difficulty in obtaining funds in London on better terms than were granted to the Commonwealth. </para><para>Before the Senate meets again the farmers will have commenced putting in their crops. They should have been supplied with superphosphates a month ago. I protest against the callous action of the Government in adjourning Parliament for nearly three weeks without first having dealt with the Wheat Bill. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- I have taken the first opportunity to register my protest. I have done my best to hasten the passing of the "Wheat Bill. It is evident that the Government is not greatly concerned about the needs of the farmers. It is regrettable that their difficulties and vicissitudes have again been made thr plaything of party politics. </para>

                        <para>.- At an earlier hour the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Barnes)</inline> laid on the table two reports on the sugar industry, and one by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Rivett</inline> dealing with the hydrogenation process of extracting fuel from coal. I should like to have the Minister's assurance that those very valuable reports will be made available to honorable senators. I am aware that, in the interests of economy, many reports are not now printed; but, in my opinion, these reports are of sufficient importance to justify their being printed. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>I desire also to refer to an answer given to-day to a question relating to one of these reports. The Minister said that the Government's action would depend largely on what happened to its financial legislation. I assure the Leader of the Senate that, if the Government acts more or less on the lines of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Rivett's</inline> report, it will cost little, if anything, to give effect to the recommendations. I had the pleasure of meeting <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Rivett</inline> in London, and I know something of his investigations, both in England and in Germany, regarding the extraction of fuel oil from coal. If the Government would make the position clear to companies such as British Industrial Chemicals Limited, and the German company that is interested in the production of this fuel, there would be no difficulty in inducing them to establish works here, provided legislation to ensure the consumption of their fuel in Australia were guaranteed. Representations were made to certain financial groups in London when I was there, and a friend assured me that, if an undertaking could be given, either by State or Federal Governments, that every assistance would be forthcoming in the protection of their capital, large sums could be obtained overseas for the development of this important industry. I do not favour State enterprise; but I advise the Government to get into touch with the overseas group, which, I believe, is anxious to extend its operations to Australia, particularly in view of our failure to discover flowing oil. </para>

                        <para>. - I understand that the usual procedure is to make such reports available to honorable senators, and I shall do my best to see that they are supplied with copies of them. In reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne,</inline> I may say that it is difficult for an honorable senator to defend himself against a member in another place, and vice versa; but a deliberate statement by a member of either House should be accepted in preference to newspaper reports, which are often very inaccurate. I may inform <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> that he will have ample opportunity, after the Easter adjournment, to give all the assistance possible to wheat farmers and others. I can remember the time when he was not so enthusiastic as he now appears to be in his desire to assist the farmers. A few months ago the Government endeavoured to guarantee them 4s. a bushel for their wheat, but the honorable senator voted against the measure. A day or two afterwards he received a telegram from Western Australia on the subject, and this brought him to the penitent form. </para>
