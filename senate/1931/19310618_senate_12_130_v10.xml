          <para class="block">In April last the Senate rejected a bill designed to authorize the Governor-General to require the. Commonwealth Bank to hand over to the Treasurer gold held in the Australian notes reserve, subject to the gold being required for the  discharge of the indebtedness of the Commonwealth in London. Under that bill all the gold could have been requisitioned provided it was necessary for the discharge of Loudon indebtedness. The measure also set a limit of £60,000,000 -to the amount of notes which could be "issued in Australia, that limit being :approximately four times the gold then  held  by the bank. </para>
          <para>The position in regard to London indebtedness to-day is practically the same as when the previous bill was rejected. </para>
          <para class="block">The total short-term indebtedness in London remains unchanged, as recurring obligations are being met from the exchange pool. The short-term debt in London, therefore, remains unchanged at £38,075,100. The only change in the nature of the indebtedness is that treasury-bills have been issued to the Westminster Bank to cover an overdraft of £5,000,000 at that bank in the names of the Governments of New South Wales, Victoria, and Western Australia. The details of the short-term debt are set out in the following table: - </para>
          <para>The short-term debt includes £5,000,000 of treasury-bills held by the public and maturing on the 30th of this month. The other short-term debt is not so pressing. The bills and debentures held by the Commonwealth Bank and the Australian trading banks, though issued for short periods, are being renewed from time to time. The bills held by the Westminster Bank mature on the 30th September next. </para>
          <para>The immediate need is to find means for dealing with the treasury-bills maturing on the 30th June. It has been known for a considerable time that difficulty would probably be met with in renewing these treasury-bills. Until March last, the total of the treasury-bills held by the public in London was £10,000,000. This amount represented two issues, namely, a first issue in September, 1929, and maturing in September, 1930, and a second issue in November, 1929, and maturing in June, 1930. The second issue was renewed in July, 1930, and matured on the 31st December last. This second issue was then again renewed and now matures on the 30th of this month. The first issue was renewed for six months from September, 1930, and matured on the 2nd March last. As it was impracticable to renew the March bills in the open market, they were paid off by the Commonwealth Bank. </para>
          <para>In March last the Commonwealth Bank, in a letter dated the 6th March, notified the Government that it was not in possession of funds to meet the treasury-bills falling due on the 30th June. The bank then asked the Government to give consideration to these maturing bills, and to take such steps as it deemed necessary to meet the position. As a result, the Government introduced the bill to which I have already referred. </para>
          <para>After the rejection of the first bill by the Senate a letter, dated the 15th May, was forwarded to the  chairman  of directors of the Commonwealth Bank, asking the board what action it considered should now be taken to cover the treasury-bills maturing this month. The text of the letter was as follows: - </para>
          <para class="block">Dear <inline font-weight="bold">Sir,</inline></para>
          <para>I desire to invite your attention to the difficult position now existing in regard to the treasury-bills for £5,000,000 falling due in London on the 30th June next. For the last three months it has been clear that difficulty was likely to be encountered in renewing these bills. A warning to that effect was contained in your letter of the 6th March, as well as in advices received by the Commonwealth from London. </para>
          <para>As you are aware, the Government some time ago introduced an amendment of the Commonwealth. Bank Bill to enable gold held in the Australian notes reserve to be used for discharging Government liabilities in London, in the event of such a need arising. This bill would have provided means of paying off the bills maturing on the 30th June if it proved to be impracticable to renew those bills. </para>
          <para>Last week the Senate called you as a witness to give evidence regarding the Commonwealth Bank Bill. I do not desire to traverse that evidence, but wish to refer only to your statements to the effect that it would, undoubtedly, bo better to ship the gold rather than to default, and to your statement that there is a third alternative. </para>
          <para>The Senate has now rejected the bill which would have provided means for paying off the June bills by the use of gold in the notes reserve. As a result, the plans made by the Government for the redemption, if necessary, of the June bills cannot be put into operation. </para>
          <para>The Leader of the Opposition in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Sir George Pearce),</inline> after referring to the evidence given by you before the Senate, stated, <inline font-style="italic">inter alia -</inline></para>
          <para>Assuming that no gold is shipped, default can only occur if (1) The money or credit being available in Australia, the Australian banks from cash or credit resources at their command in London, either cannot, or will not, provide the requisite exchange facilities: or (2) The money or credit not being available in Australia, or the Australian banks being unable to provide exchange facilities, the credit of Australia is such that no financial assistance of any kind, or for any period, is available from any source in London, notwithstanding that its refusal means default by the Commonwealth. </para>
          <para>As the Senate rejected the bill after hear ing evidence from you as  Chairman  of the Commonwealth Bank, I shall be glad if you will be good enough to advise me whether, in the opinion of the Commonwealth Bank Board, it is possible for the Government to provide for the treasury-bills maturing in London by adopting either of the courses of action referred to in the above extract from SenatorPearce's speech in the Senate on the 13th May. </para>
          <para>In view of the evidence given by you before the Senate, I should also appreciate advice as to the course of action which the Commonwealth Bank Board considers should now be taken by the Government to cover the treasury bills in question. </para>
          <para>It is perhaps unnecessary for me to stress the urgency of this matter, and to ask that it should be given immediate consideration by the bank. </para>
          <para>I may add that the treasury-bills for £5,000,000, which mature in London in June, were arranged on behalf of Australian Governments as follow: - </para>

          <para>Edward G. Theodore, Treasurer. </para>
          <para>In its reply, the board stated that it would be preferable for Parliament to authorize the shipment of £5,000,000 in gold rather than default. The board also indicated it was unable to see any solution to this treasury-bill problem through any of the alternatives that had been suggested. The board stated, too, that if Parliament authorized the shipment of £5,000,000 gold, the board could arrange for paying off the bills on maturity. The text of the board's reply to the Treasurer is as follows: - </para>
          <para>Dear <inline font-weight="bold">Sir,</inline></para>
          <para>I have to acknowledge your letter of the 15th instant with reference to the treasury bills faling due in London on the 30th June next, amounting to £5,000,000. </para>
          <para>My board has given consideration to your communication, and it is desired that I convey to you the following, as representing the views of my board: - </para>
          <para>The board refers you to my letters (2) of the6th March, and desires to say that, in so far as the bank is concerned, the position remains unchanged in respect of the inability of the bank to take up these bills, and, further, adheres to the view that the matter is one for government action. </para>
          <para>The position in regard to these bills cannot be disassociated from the whole question of national finance in respect of which my board has called the attention of the Government on many occasions over a long period. </para>
          <para>Neither I, nor my board, propose to enter upon discussions which took place in the Senate, nor to traverse the evidence submitted by me before the Senate. The board supports me in the view expressed before the Senate that it would be preferable for Parliament to authorize the shipment of £5,000,000 gold rather than default. The alternatives to this course which I had in mind, I purposely refrained from indicating when before the Senate, for the reason which is obvious to everyone, that it would involve myself and my board in matters touching on government policy and, therefore, assuming political aspects. </para>
          <para>In view of the position, therefore, and the absence of any likelihood of alternatives referred to being practicable as matters now stand, my board is unable to see any solution of this immediate problem through the mediums suggested in your communication. Assuming, therefore, that Parliament decides that £5,000,000 gold be shipped to meet this obligation, my board is in a position to say that, acting with the authority of Parliament, the Bank Board could arrange for the necessary assistance in London to meet the bills, pending the arrival of the gold in London; such gold to be definitely hypothecated by the Commonwealth Bank for the purpose of discharging the obligations incurred by such temporary assistance. To carry this into effect, it will be necessary for Parliament to create the authority for disposal of the gold prior to the middle of June. </para>
          <para>Yours faithfully, </para>
          <para class="block">Robert Gibson, </para>
          <para>Chairman of the Board of Directors. </para>
          <para class="block">The latest advices from London are that it is impracticable to renew the bills which mature on the 30th June. As there is no source, other than the gold reserve, from which the bills can at present be paid off, the Government now seeks authority for the use of £5,000,000 gold for that purpose. The new bill definitely limits the amount of gold which may be used to £5,000,000, and provides also that the only purpose for which gold can be used under the authority of the bill is the discharge of the treasury-bills maturing on the 30th June. </para>
          <para>The gold reserve on the8th June totalled £15,234,000. At that date the notes issued amounted to £50,653,000. As the law stands, a reserve of 25 per cent. of gold must be held against the issue of notes required to carry on the industries of the country. Therefore, the limit to the issue of notes on the basis of the present gold holding is approximately £60,000,000. It is not desirable that this limit should be disturbed, as the Bank Board must have some margin beyond the present note issue. If the gold reserve be reduced by £5,000,000 the limit of note issue under the present provision of a reserve of 25 per cent. would be approximately £40,000,000. This would not meet requirements. It is, therefore, provided in the bill that the percentage of gold which must be kept in reserve shall be reduced from 25 per cent. to 15 per cent. With a reserve of 15 per cent. the limit of the note issue will still be approximately £60,000,000. The bill thus is not designed to increase or decrease the limit of the note issue. </para>
          <para>Provision is also made for gradually restoring the gold reserve to 25 per cent. The maturing treasury-bills in London were issued on behalf of Australian governments as follow: - </para>

          <para class="block">The position regarding these treasury bills has been carefully considered by the Loan Council at its recent meetings. After very full discussion, the Loan Council, on the10th June, unanimously passed the following resolution :  - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>In view of the responsibility of the Loan Council in respect of the conversion, renewal and redemption of public debts of the Commonwealth and the States, and of the difficulties existing in regard to the renewal of £5,000,000 of treasury-bills maturing in London on 30th June, 1931, the Loan Council is of opinion that, if it is found impracticable to renew the said treasury-bills, authority should be obtained to enable not more than £5,000,000 of the gold held in the Australian notes reserve to be made available for the purpose of meeting the said treasury-bills. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>Less than two weeks remain before these London treasury-bills mature. If Parliament grants authority for the use of gold, some little time will be necessary to enable the Bank Board to make the necessary arrangements. The board has suggested that the authority would be required prior to the middle of June. The Government, therefore, desires the Senate to deal with the matter as one of great urgency, so as to enable it to give the necessary authority to the Commonwealth Bank Board to make whatever banking arrangements are needed, in order that the claims of those who hold these treasury-bills will be met on the 30th June in the manner usually adopted in financial transactions of this character. That is the purpose of the measure. It must be patent to honorable senators that the matter is one of urgency. A great  deal has been said within recent weeks regarding the financial circumstances of our country, and, if the matter be handled quickly and determinedly, it will be a gesture that will go a long way towards disillusioning those who may have any doubts with regard to the preparedness of Australia to honour its obligations. I commend the bill to honorable senators, and urge that it be given as speedy a passage as possible. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir</inline>GEORGE PEARCE  (Western Australia)  [3.23]. -  At the outset of my remarks, I wish to take strong exception to a statement that has been made by the honorable the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Theodore),</inline> to the effect that this bill is the same as that which was previously rejected by the Senate. Far from its being the same bill, there are very vital differences between the two measures. Were it the same, it would have no more chance of passing the Senate than had the previous bill. I do not know what object underlay the making of that statement, unless it was a desire to mislead the public and to make it believe that the Senate adopted an unreasonable attitude towards the last bill, and was now being asked to recede from the position that it then took up. The statement has been made on more than one occasion, and I therefore publicly assert that, if this bill were the same, there would be no chance of its passing the Senate. </para>
          <para>To show how vitally this measure differs from the last, I need merely say that under the latter it was proposed that the Treasurer should be made the sole judge of whether or not gold should be exported from Australia, and that he should have the right to ship away at his sweet will the whole of the gold reserve. Such action was not linked up in any way with the approval or consent of the Bank Board. Parliament has constituted that board the trustee of the gold reserve. The previous bill sought to remove that power from the board and to place it in the hands of the Treasurer. </para>

The necessity for Parliament authorizing the shipment overseas of  £5,000,000  of gold, I believe can. be demonstrated. In that connexion I wish to say that the Opposition, at the suggestion and with the consent of the Prime Minister, communicated direct with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Gibson, the  Chairman  of the Commonwealth Bank Board, and also with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. G.</inline> D. Healy,  Chairman  of the Associated Banks, Victoria, both of whom regretfully admitted that this action was necessary at the present juncture. But there was a period when, had appropriate action been taken by the Government, this would not have been necessary. That was clearly indicated when, in giving evidence before the Senate, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Gibson said that there was another alternative to the shipment of gold overseas. The Government, however, neglected to adopt that alternative until it was faced with the prospect of immediate default, and there are now before another place certain measures which are necessary to give legislative effect to that alternative. There is clear indication that had those steps been taken earlier this particular action would not have been necessary. That is shown by the appreciation that occurred in Australian credit when the determination of the Commonwealth and State Governments to take the necessary steps towards economy was  announced.Asaresultofthatannouncement, Australian stocks' Appreciated in London to a total value of £30, 000,000 in one day. Had such steps been decided upon and an earnest attempt made to put them into operation at an earlier date, judging by the effect of the recent announcement on the London Stock Exchange, I venture to affirm that it would not have been necessary to ship this gold abroad. </para>

          <para>It is unquestionable that the continued neglect of the Government over a period of twelve months to implement the' decisions of the August conference in' Melbourne, despite the fact that the financial position of Australia was drifting, drifting, drifting m6nth by month; Has made this action inevitable. It is not a good advertisement for Australia that it has td be taken. It is a desperate resort, and I deeply regret that it has become necessary. Only as a last resort; and only because of the inevitability of default if this action is not taken, do I refrain from opposing this bill. If I were not convinced of that I would oppose the bill, because I am a firm believer in the principle of a gold reserve, and think that the percentage should be that which is recognized the world over as necessary. The fact that Australia accepts a lower percentage than is accepted by the foremost civilized countries of the world is indeed a bad advertisement for us: I am glad to find that since this bill was introduced the Government has seen its way to embody in it a promise that we s'hall aim at the' restoration of a gold reserve of 25 per cent. within a specified period, arid that the measure also provides for the approval df the Commonwealth Bank Board as well as that of the Government to enable this shipment of gold to be made. I regret the necessity for themeasure,and also regret that our financial position has been allowed todrifttosuchanex- tent that this course has to be adopted, I do not intend to oppose' the second readingofthebill. </para>

            <para>. -I am not going to oppose the bill ;but as far as my vote is concerned I shall assist its passage with the greatest reluctance. After' all is said and done, that which is of vital concern, and which if is the sacred duty of this Parliament to protect, is the' credit of Australia. Credit is one of the' most delicate instru- mentsknown to monetary science. Let me give' a brief quotation, which sums up the doctrine I have just enunciated, from a book entitled <inline font-style="italic">Applied Business and Finance,</inline> by E. E. Lincoln. On page 369 of that work, the following paragraph appears: - </para>

              <para>- No. If I may be permitted to digress for a moment I may say that ones of the most notable features' of the English language is the way in which' the same word is used to express different ideas. The credit which is mentioned in the paragraph which I have read is hot the credit to which the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> has just referred. In this instance, credit is used in the sense of con- fidence.We have credit meaning belief, credit meaning confidence, and also credit meaning the issue of credit in the form of monetary obligations. There are various other uses of the word, and very often it is abused in the most extraordinary way. </para>

          <para>The Senate, as I see it, is faced with the choice of either agreeing to the bill or of the Commonwealth facing default in London: We have to adopt a course which is likely to be the least detrimental to the credit of this country. Would default on the 30th June do greater damage to our credit than would a reduction of the gold reserve behind our note issue at the present moment? I think that the Senate, in the circumstances which confront us, has to say that the course which it is proposed to adopt will be the least harmful to the credit of this country. I shall return to that phase of the subject a little later on, when I am dealing with the policy of the Government as reflected in this measure, and in the first bill which the Senate rejected some weeks ago. Before doing so, I should like to say a word or two concerning the policy of the Government as enunciated from time to time by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Theodore).</inline> So far as I have been able to follow the Treasurer's public pronouncements, he did not come into the open, as to his real policy in relation to a gold backing to the Australian note issue, from the time when he made his notable speech on the original bill in which he proposed to take over the reserves from the private trading banks, until he spoke at the Parkes byelection. It was then that he unmasked his guns to those who had eyes to see. On that occasion, he stated in the most definite terms that he saw no reason why Australian currency should be tied to English sterling.  His  definite announcement was that as far as he was concerned he did not believe in the gold standard as applied to. the Australian monetary <inline font-style="italic">system.</inline> The final development of this is to be found in the two bills which this Senate rejected - the Fiduciary Notes Bill and the last measure dispensing with the whole of the gold reserve behind the note issue. I was in another place for several hours, yesterday, following the debate on this measure, and it was easy to recognize fr om the  interjections  which came in storms from those supporting die Government that the members of the Labour party have abandoned all intentions, if they are allowed to put their policy into operation, of continuing to back the note issue with gold. </para>

              <para>- If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> is prepared to show that that is so, I can only say that words have lost their meaning. That is the deliberate policy of the Treasurer. It may be that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> is not in sympathy with that policy and that it is for that reason he no longer sits on the front ministerial bench. That the Treasurer of the Commonwealth definitely holds that view, and that the Labour party as a whole also holds it, is abundantly manifest from a study of the bill which was previously introduced by the Treasurer, and which he, as the Leader of the Opposition has pointed out, has endeavoured to convince the country was the same as  the measure now before us. </para>

The mere production of gold is in no way connected with the gold reserve behind the note issue. Australia might produce gold to the value of £100,000,000 per annum and yet not have one penny of gold backing behind the note issue. </para>

Whatever may be the method employed to use gold in the world's financial system in the future the effect must be that every country on the gold standard will have its price levels determined in relation to a. common standard.

At the conference to which I have referred, the gold exchange standard was discussed at length, as was also the question of the reserves which the various gold standard countries maintained. One leading economist, who was not a banker, ' suggested that it would be possible to take concerted action, through the instrumentality, in the first place, of the Bank of International Settlement, to reduce the statutory requirements of those countries by a certain percentage. Among those who addressed the conference on that proposal was <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Otto</inline> Niemeyer, who said - </para>

            <para>That would mean altering some fifty bank statutes: or, if you leave out the smaller countries and say it is enough to take the leaders, then it would bc some ten bank statutes. That means in the case practically of every country getting thu consent of the shareholders of the note-issuing banks in question to an alteration of the bank statutes. More than that, I think it means, almost without exception, legislation by legislative bodies who are not particularly well-informed as a rule, or particularly sympathetic on currency questions. Moreover, it would mean doing that in a great many countries which in fairly recent times have had shocks to their currency, and where currency legislation is naturally regarded as dangerous, and where the arguments for prudence and doing nothing may seem very strong. Not only would you have to obtain such legislation firstly by the banks then by the legislature in a large number of countries, but you would have to obtain that legislation more or less simultaneously. I must confess that seems to me a very difficult proposition. Can one really contemplate Congress in America readily legislating on that subject, or even the House of Commons in </para>

Therefore I must confess I always have thought that possible solution is a very difficult one. It may be that the B.I.S. would provide a place for hatching such a universal conspiracy as I think would be necessary; but, even then, political difficulties would remain. T feel, therefore, that that particular method, the method of altering ratios, if one were driven to it. and if one thought it were sound in itself, does present very great practical difficulties </para>

          <para class="block">I make this quotation to show how a banker of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Otto</inline> Niemeyer's standing regards such a proposal to vary the gold percentages. He says that even the saving of gold by reducing the reserve behind a note issue is in itself an operation so delicate that no country, not even England or America, would be the first to do it, because of the fear of what would happen to its credit. Credit, of course, is 'largely a psychological matter, and one which it is very difficult to explain. It may be possible in the course of years of education to persuade the public that gold can be used in a better way and more effectively for world use, than by being held behind note issues, but until such action can be taken internationally, more or less simultaneously, any country that interferes with the gold backing behind its note issue is at once exposed to an attack on' its credit; any country that is foolhardy enough to do it exposes its credit to a tremendous blow which will necessarily and naturally react against it. </para>

          <para>The present position has arisen entirely, I think, from the deliberate action of the Government: from its deliberate vacillation in tackling the financial difficulties of the country, and its endeavour to give effect to the definite and expressed policy of the Treasurer of the day. Provided the Commonwealth Bank finds it necessary to ship overseas as much as £5,000,000, and I hope it will not be found necessary, we shall have practically £10,000,000 worth of gold left iu Australia. We have been told by the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Barnes)</inline> that there is another obligation falling due to the Westminster Bank in London on the 30th November.

              <para>- I am not concerned with that, but I say that if the Senate consents to this raid upon the gold reserve behind our note issue it will have gone to the absolute limit that is justifiable. I should not vote for it but for the amendment providing for the gradual restoration of the reserve. Instances can be quoted to show that it has been the practice of all the central banks created under the aegis of the Financial Committee of the League of Nations, gradually to build up gold reserves in various countries, starting with 20 per cent, and building up to 35 per cent, or 40 per cent., as the case may be. Providing the matter is handled here as it should be, and the banks in the ordinary operation of banking, and properly supported by the Treasurer, are left alone to implement that banking policy which they believe to be the best for the economic salvation of the country, there is nothing to prevent our gold reserve being re-established once more. The incorporation in this bill of the two amendments for which the Opposition in another place was responsible, will do much to make this bitter pill, which is inevitable in the circumstances, a little more acceptable to those who  have  any regard for Australia's credit. </para>

If there is one thing above another which will establish our credit, not only abroad, but also internally, it is the building up of a gold reserve. According to a return furnished in answer to a question asked by an honorable senator, the present Government since it has been in office has shipped overseas £32,000,000 in gold. That amount of gold, which could have been used for' creating a much larger credit than the actual payment of the gold to our creditors overseas has provided, was shipped overseas simply to enable the Government to stave off the evil day, which is now upon us - to enable it to move along the even tenor of its way regardless of the trouble into which the country was drifting. </para>

              <para>- But we have no longer any control of gold once it has been used to meet obligations overseas. If it had been used in other directions, it would have stabilized the credit of Australia, particularly overseas. The misunderstanding that arises in the minds of some is that once gold has been used to liquidate a debt it has been used for a good purpose. As a matter of fact, it has not been used as effectively as it could have been in connexion with our national credit. </para>

              <para>- It is a reflection on the Government that would not face the position. Had it done so, there would not have been what I regard as a wastage of our gold reserve. In any case, I care not upon whom it reflects. Parting with our best asset is a short-sighted policy, particularly when it is done to enable some other nation, institution, or  body to use it for the purpose of enhancing its own credit. It is, however, of no use to cry over spilt milk; but if a measure of this character had come before us in ordinary circumstances, without the urgency of the national interests so prominent at the present moment, I should not have voted in favour of it. If our gold holdings had been maintained at the standard cited by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene,</inline> there would not have been a misapprehension in the minds of creditors as to the ability of Australia to meet its obligations. We should have been able to obtain ample credit and loan money. But the Government parted with that gold and now asks the Senate to agree to a. reduction of the gold reserve to 15 per cent. of the note issue, thus bringing the Commonwealth to the status of certain countries, which have been a jibe and byword in our own mouths in recent years. </para>

          <para>It is difficult to define the financial policy of the Government. At no time has the Treasurer indicated definitely that he is prepared to abandon the gold standard ; but it is true that certain legislation has been sent up from another place to which the Senate could not give its support. I devoutly trust that no portion of the existing gold reserve may ever have to be moved from Australia. The fact that Parliament approves of this bill may restore confidence abroad, and possibly some financial institution will come to the rescue of the Commonwealth in respect of the treasury bills which mature on the 30th June. But if the gold must be sent to Great Britain I suggest that the Government should take insurance cover in London instead of in Australia. I know it has been the habit in the past, because I have had some experience in the matter, for the insurance cover to provide that any loss shall be made good in Australia. If the insurance for this shipment does not provide for London cover there would be a loss of at least 30 per cent. to Australia in the event of any untoward happening. The moving of gold is not a matter upon which any banking institution cares to enter lightly. It has been noised abroad that the Commonwealth is about to ship £5,000,000 worth of gold to London, so it is advisable that every safeguard should be taken for its safe transit. I know that this is always done, and my observations on this point are merely offered by way of suggestion to the Government through the Leader of the Senate. I shall vote for the bill with the greatest reluctance - I might almost say, shame. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir HAL</inline>COLEBATCH(Wesern Australia) [4.9]. - My chief objection to the measure, which I do not intend to oppose, because, in the circumstances, it seems impossible to do other than accept it, is that it has been introduced at such short notice that we are unable to give it that mature consideration which its importance warrants. We are told that it must be passed at once, so that the best use may be made of the gold and Australia prevented from defaulting in London. This seems to me to be a very wrong way of carrying on the business of the country. I fear that the shipment of this portion of our gold reserve may lead us into an infinite amount of trouble. I remind the Senate that the first bill brought down by the present Government concerning our gold reserve was that submitted and passed in 1929. On that occasion the Senate was informed of a letter which had been written by the  chairman  of the Commonwealth Bank Board to the Government, in which the  chairman  stated - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>My board is of the opinion that the last resource which should be adopted would be any course which meant even temporary departure from the operation of the gold standard on the part of Australia. Such measure would reflect most adversely against Australia in respect of oversea credit, and incidentally have a most serious effect upon our abilities to raise loans abroad. As a measure which would very materially help the position in the meantime, and in addition, having regard to precedent would, in the opinion of the board, be a sound measure of permanent legislation, my board definitely recommends your Government to consider immediately the bringing in of legislation on similar lines to that which now exists and is operating in England. I do not propose to traverse the effect of such legislation, as perusal of the acts will fully acquaint you with the position; but I might briefly say that such legislation would place the Commonwealth Bank in immediate control of all gold in Australia, by whomsoever held. As a matter of fact the Government did introduce, and the Senate was induced to pass a bill containing provisions in no way resembling those contained in existing acts of Great Britain. That legislation did what the board said ought not to be done. To all intents and purposes it took Australia off the gold standard. </para>
            <para>I am wondering what is the meaning of clause 2 of the bill, and what is the need for it. There is no provision in the existing act to prevent the Commonwealth Bank from exporting gold for the settlement of Australia's overseas indebtedness. As a matter of fact the board has been sending gold abroad, at periodical intervals, during the last two or three years, and altogether it has exported bullion to the value of approximately £31,000,000. It is clear, therefore, that the bank does not require authority from this Parliament or even an instruction from the Treasurer to export gold. But the intention of the bill is clearly indicated in clause 3. </para>

              <para>- Nevertheless there is no need for the passing of a bill to do what the Minister has suggested. The Government may, at any time, advise the Commonwealth Bank concerning its overseas obligations, and certainly there is no need for this legislation to enable the bank to ship gold. But we know that further inroads upon the existing gold reserve will interfere with the statutory requirement concerning the minimum of reserve to be held against the note issue. The bill provides that the amount of gold to be shipped under this authority shall be limited to £5,000,000, but there is nothing in existing legislation to prevent the Bank Board from shipping any amount of gold, so long as it retains the statutory minimum of gold reserve against currency. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </interjection>
          <para>There is another point which I wish to make clear to the Senate. When moving the second reading of the bill the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Barnes)</inline> stated that with the present gold reserve of £15,000,000 the Commonwealth Bank was, under existing legislation, authorized to issue notes to a total of £60,000,000 on a 25 per cent. gold backing. He said further that if the bank shipped £5,000,000 of the existing reserve, and the minimum is reduced to 15 per cent., it would still have authority to issue notes to the same amount, namely, £60,000,000. I suggest that the figures furnished by the honorable gentleman were very rough indeed. It is true that on a 25 per cent. basis, and with a reserve of £15,240,000 the paper currency may be increased to £61,000,000 ; but if the statutory requirement concerning the minimum gold reserve is 15 per cent., and if the reserve is reduced to £10,240,000, the bank will have authority to issue notes to the value of approximately £68,000,000 or more than £7,000,000 in excess of the existing authorization. This is a point which I think the Senate should have had time to consider carefully. </para>
          <para>There is also this further feature which should be borne in mind : The act of 1929 authorized the Commonwealth Bank to acquire the gold holdings of all private banks, and also all the gold mined in Australia. Assuming that production amounts to £2,000,000 a year, the Commonwealth Bank, under this bill would be authorized to issue a further £12,000,000 of notes each year against the gold so acquired. </para>
          <para>To my mind, there are many directions in which this bill may prove dangerous. Although the act of 1929 was passed, ostensibly to enable the Commonwealth Bank to concentrate the gold resources of Australia in order that it might be put to the best use in the interests of the nation, the act has, in effect, been used to enable this Government to continue a course of extravagance which otherwise would not have been possible. But for that legislation, the motive of which was good, this Government, several months ago, would have been compelled to face the position which it is up against to-day, and I suggest that it would have been infinitely better for the people of Australia if, many months ago, it had taken the drastic action now contemplated. The Prime Minister, in a speech delivered the other day, admitted that for over twelve months he and his Government had been fighting against the necessity to make reductions in governmental expenditure. The 1929 act, I repeat, permitted the Government to continue with its extravagant administration much longer, with the result that the difficulties with which we are confronted to-day are infinitely greater than they would have been if action to check the drift in public finance had been taken at the proper time. </para>
          <para>We are informed that the shipment of this £5,000,000 of our gold reserve is the only satisfactory arrangement that can be made for the discharge of our overseas obligations on the 30th June. I shall refrain from voting against the bill, but I shall do so with a very uneasy conscience, and with a feeling that the passing of the measure will probably bring as much trouble in its train as did the legislation which we passed in 1929. </para>

            <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> has challenged the need, for the insertion of clause 2. It occupies its position of priority for  the convenience of draftsmanship. The policy of the Government is to ease the financial position from the point of view of the gold standard. Obviously the Ministry could not ask the Commonwealth Bank to accept responsibility for the shipment of gold which forms part of  our statutory backing for the note issue. When <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Gibson,  Chairman  of the Commonwealth Bank Board, appeared at the bar of the Senate recently he indicated to the Senate, and subsequently, in a letter to the Treasurer, that it was not the function of the board to dictate government policy. He made it clear that the responsibility for the issue of notes for internal currency on a gold backing less than the existing minimum by £5,000,000 must rest with the Government. The Government, having accepted the position, it was necessary to insert a provision in the bill to give effect to its policy. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> must realize that in the domain assigned by the legislature to the Commonwealth Bank, the Bank Board is supreme. This Parliament cannot fetter in any way the discretion of the Commonwealth Bank unless and until it is prepared to do so by statutory enactment. The Commonwealth Bank has said to the Government : " There is your statutory legislation, enacting that we shall hold against the note issue of this Commonwealth a certain amount of gold. It is your job, not ours. It is your policy, not ours. You define your policy, you enact your laws, and we shall obey them ". The Government has agreed to adopt that particular course, and, if an agreement is arrived at between it and the Opposition in regard to policy, there is not one clause of the bill that is not absolutely essential. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I am rather surprised at the manner in which the bill has been received by honorable senators opposite. For some reason or other that I cannot fathom, there appears to be a feeling in their ranks that anything which touches the present Treasurer of the Commonwealth must be regarded as contaminated. The right honorable the Leader of the Opposition alleged that the Treasurer had made a certain statement regarding the bill. What the Treasurer, in fact, said, was that a similar bill was introduced a "few weeks ago. </para>

              <para>- The clause, as originally drafted, proposed to enable the Treasurer to secure from the Commonwealth Bank sufficient gold to satisfy certain obligations of the Commonwealth in London ; but the Commonwealth Bank, through the mouth of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Gibson in this chamber, said: "If you desire to ship gold to London, it is your responsibility and not the responsibility of the bank ". How was the Government to indicate its intention to the Bank Board? The board would say : " The Treasurer certainly desires that this money shall be shipped to London for the purpose of satisfying our London obligations, but how do we know that such a request has the imprimatur of Parliament?" The Government, in an endeavour to act in the manner dictated by the banking institutions, has brought down this measure. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> must realize tha't, unless that particular provision was inserted, even though this Parliament might agree with the policy, the Commonwealth Bank Board would take up exactly the same attitude as it has adopted all along. This bill is the creation, not of the Treasurer alone, but of the Cabinet and the Government. The Government, having agreed upon the policy, it was a question of introducing legislation that would give effect to it. </para>

              <para>- Neither the banking institutions nor the Premiers Conference have said that, as a condition precedent to the creation of confidence in this country, the Government should get out. On the contrary, the Premiers Conference, which was representative of all the leaders of political thought in Australia, decided upon a policy that would keep the Government in office. It evolved a plan - for what reason? Was it not designed to keep this Government in power, so that it might put it in operation? It is idle for the honorable senator to suggest that any right-thinking man, of any school ©f political thought in Australia, would make such a suggestion. I sincerely trust that, in the interests of the movement that I have the honour to represent in this chamber, the Government will remain in power. Honorable senators who have any sense of justice will admit that one experience equivalent to that through which the Government has passed is sufficient in the lifetime of any average politician. </para>

If the honorable senator has not heard of them, inquiry will prove to him that my statement is absolutely accurate. Had those warnings been heeded, Australia would not have been in the mess in which the present Government found it when it took over the reins of office. </para>

              <para>- There will be no question of vaccination. I understood that that word had been removed from the vocabulary of honorable senators opposite, and that they were familiar only with the term " vacillation ". There has been no vacillation on the part of this Government. It has attempted to carry out the policy upon which it was elected: but in this hour of Australia's need it has been compelled to admit that it cannot give effect to the promises that it made to the electors. I cannot see that there is any discredit in that. Now that the Government can no longer resist the demands of the Opposition, and can no longer dictate the terms upon which it shall legislate, the Opposition ought to be generous enough to refrain from referring continually to the actions of the Government, especially in view of the fact that, as every honorable senator opposite well knows, Australia's position to-day is due to the gross incompetence and misgovernment of the previous administration. </para>

              <para>- The introduction of such a measure was not mentioned at the August conference or in the agreement which the Prime Minister signed. Apparently the right honorable gentleman at the time had not the slightest intention of giving effect to such a policy as in writing to a conference of trade unionists in Sydney he said, "For twelve months I have resisted this thing and I can no longer do it." We are now being asked to take this action because, on the admission of the Prime Minister himself, he has failed to do his duty, and in neglecting to do so has betrayed the Commonwealth. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> charged the previous Government with extravagance, and with having disregarded the warning of its financial advisers. I would remind the Senate, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> in particular, that at a conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers held prior to the last elections the then Prime Minister told the delegates that we were on the edge of a dangerous precipice and that in view of the difficult financial period which was approaching. Australia would have to recast its financial policy. He went to the country on that issue, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> and every other member of the Labour party told the electors not to take any notice of the warning then given. </para>

The supporters of the present Government went from one end of Australia to the other telling the people to disregard the warnings of the ex-Prime Minister. They declared that the Government of which he was the leader was out to slash wages, and to crush the working men and women of Australia. Similar statements have been repeated during State election campaigns. To-day, the position is almost intolerable and we are now asked to adopt a course which is repugnant to the good sense of every man and woman in Australia. We are advertising to the world that we are hopeless and helpless derelicts; that we are down to our last shilling, and that as a result of the vacillation, twisting and turning of this Government we can meet our obligations only by depleting the gold backing to our paper currency. I enter my most emphatic protest against this proposal to do something which I abhor. </para>

At that time it was the desire of the Government to secure control of the £15,000,000 worth of gold held by the Commonwealth Bank in order to meet certain of our commitments in London. After hearing the evidence of the  Chairman  of the Commonwealth Bank Board, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Gibson, the Senate, very properly, rejected that measure. The Treasurer now submits a request for £5,000,000, but I venture to say that if this amount is made available it will not be long before a similar measure is introduced. Like Oliver Twist, the Treasurer will be asking for more, until the whole of our gold reserve is exhausted. The financial position of the Commonwealth is the same to-day as it was six weeks ago when <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Gibson gave evidence with respect to the shipment of our gold reserve to London. At that time, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> was asked if apart from default there was an alternative to the shipment of gold, and he said in terms which resounded throughout the whole Commonwealth, " There is an alternative." </para>

              <para>- The objective would have been achieved if the advice given by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Otto</inline> Niemeyer in August last had been acted upon. All Australia knows, and no one better than the members of the Ministry, and particularly <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly,</inline> that the policy he proposed was that of living within our income. Up to the present, such a plan has not been adopted. It is true that the Government is now talking of adopting it, but I venture to say that no definite decision will be reached until the conference of representatives of the Labour movement, which is now sitting in Canberra, has concluded its deliberations. We do not know whether the alternative referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Gibson will ever be put into operation, but I am sure that it will not while the present Government is in power. We are now asked to approve of a part of a policy which on the advice of the  Chairman  of the Commonwealth Bank Board we very properly refused to accept six weeks ago. The only difference between the measure rejected and that now under consideration is that the former gave the Treasurer access to the whole of the £15,000,000 in gold held as a backing to our note issue while this measure is to provide for the release of only £5,000,000 worth of gold. If this bill is passed, I believe that further similar measures will be introduced. I strongly object to the insidious methods adopted by the Treasurer in seeking to accomplish his own ends by different means. The Treasurer will not take "no" for an answer. In this case he comes up with the same request in another form. If this measure is passed, it will be an invitation to our other short-term creditors in London to press us while there is still a " shot in the locker " in the form of the remaining £10,000,000, which the Treasurer previously tried to obtain. This measure constitutes another step towards the objective of the Labour party, which is to place our note issue on a fiduciary basis. It is a proposal to reduce the gold reserve from 25 per cent, to 15 per cent, of our currency, and by passing it the Senate will approve of a course of action which for months past it has been telling the people of Australia should not be adopted. I have no faith in the promises of this Government, even if incorporated in the bill, to restore the gold backing to its present basis within a specified period. I am opposed to the measure, and intend to vote against the second reading if afforded an opportunity to do so. My experience in Parliament has been that bills are only rushed through Parliament when they will not stand careful deliberation. There is generally a " nigger in the wood pile." I object to the measure <inline font-style="italic">in toto,</inline> and particularly to the manner in which it is being rushed through both Houses of Parliament. </para>

              <para>- I still hold the view that the attitude adopted by the honorable senator was unbecoming in view of the fact that he charged the present members of the Opposition with accepting a measure that we rejected some weeks ago. It is well known that the honorable senator does not take the trouble to closely study the bills that come before the Senate; if he had done so on this occasion he would not have made such a statement. This measure is totally different from that which was rejected some weeks ago. </para>

              <para>- In view of the information now in the possession of honorable senators it is imperative that something be done immediately if the good name of Australia is to be upheld in financial circles. Honorable senators who support the Government must accept a large share of the responsibility for the distress and privation so prevalent in Australia to-day. Any one who reads the records of the Labour party, whether in the parliamentary or in the industrial sphere, must conclude that most of the present distress is the outcome of the advice tendered by Labour leaders, before and since the present Government came into office. Our first duty is to prevent Australia from having to say to its creditors that the country cannot meet its obligations. </para>

              <para>- That question is not now before us. Our present duty is to decide whether Australia intends to meet its obligations or to make default. Evidence tendered before the Senate a few weeks ago made it abundantly clear that default was inevitable unless a certain course was followed. This bill provides for the taking of action which will, at least partially, restore confidence in Australia. Later, we shall have before us other measures to give effect to the decisions of the extraordinary conference recently held in Melbourne. Before Australia will again be in a sound financial condition, we shall have to get down to bedrock. We must investigate the causes of the present troubles and do everything possible to prevent their recurrence. This bill and the other measures which have been foreshadowed will, after all, be more in the nature of palliatives than remedies. We must work for the elimination of the causes of the present trouble if we are to ensure that they shall not recur in the future. </para>

          <para>The alterations which have been made in this bill since its introduction in another place, will materially safeguard the future solvency of the note issue. Clause 3, which deals with the gold reserve, is most important. Clause 2 limits the export of gold to a certain amount, and a specific purpose. It also provides that the temporary shortage in the present statutory gold reserve shall be made up within a certain period. I do not know whether the period prescribed is too long or not; but I should say that, with careful administration and due regard to the necessity of living within our incomes, we ought, within a reasonable time, to be able to retrieve the position brought about by the export of this £5,000,000 of gold. Although I regret the necessity for this measure, I feel compelled to support it in order- to maintain the good name of Australia. If another way of retaining that good name could be found I should do what I could to defeat this bill. Having heard the arguments put forward in favour of the measure before us, I am convinced that the proposals contained in it are made only as a last resort, and that therefore the Senate is justified in passing it. </para>

            <para>. - Many involved principles have been emphasized by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> if not to-day, at any rate in debates on a similar subject on many other occasions. It may be true that an omission from our legislation has created the situation to which the right honorable senator has drawn attention, but I must oppose this motion on the ground that the Senate cannot claim the right  to  hamstring every piece of legislation brought forward by a government whose policy has just been endorsed by the country. That, however, is an argument upon which I have no desire to enlarge to-day. The Government has given expression to its desire, and will continue to do so. On the other hand, the Senate will no doubt continue to exercise the right of disallowance it claims to possess. But the matter has already been talked to death on five or six occasions, and as I have no wish to resurrect the dead, I dismiss it with the statement that I am in strong opposition to the motion. </para>

Honorable senators, as a whole, do not represent the body of men whom Senators Hoare, Kneebone, O'Halloran and I represent in South' Australia. They are therefore not aware of the relief that these regulations have afforded to men on the waterfront who are legitimately engaged to work under them. I also protest against the action the Senate is taking at this time when the Government is seeking its cooperation. And I protest against its attempt to flout the power that Parliament has delegated to the Executive to make regulations. When Parliament delegated that power to the Executive,  it took the full  responsibility for its action. </para>

              <para>- Quite so; but it was never intended that a regulation  should be capriciously disallowed or that the Parliament should fetter the control of this particular executive action. It is an insult to the Government for the Senate, without any argument or discussion, and without advancing any reason, to disallow that which the Government has enacted by regulation, and it is adding insult to injury by tacking on to its verdict a rider. Indeed, it is as great an affront to  His  Majesty's Government as was the address of the Senate to  His  Majesty's representative. </para>

            <para>. - The honorable senator has had the temerity to say that he and his colleagues from South Australia represent, more than do other honorable senators, the interests of persons affected by these regulations. I try to represent the interests of people who have been very badly injured by the action of the Waterside Workers Federation prior to the Transport Workers Act coming into operation. The honorable senator also had the temerity to say that the Senate had disallowed these regulations capriciously and without discussion. I cast that accusation back into his teeth. There has been no caprice about the action of the Senate. Several times during the session these regulations have been fully discussed. If there be any caprice, it is on the part of the Government in restoring regulations immediately after they have been disallowed. It is time the Senate took up a determined attitude on the point. Year after year for several years prior to the passing of the Transport Workers Act, Tasmania was so penalized by the attitude of the Waterside Workers Federation that many people were reduced to a state of penury. Since the passing of the Act, we have had no interruption whatever in the steamship service between the mainland and Tasmania. For the first time in the last ten years, we can recall three years of uninterrupted service, where previously there was interruption brought about, as honorable senators are well aware, by the total disregard and defiance of the law by an organization which brought pressure to bear upon the units comprising it, the great bulk of whom wished to continue at work but were prevented from doing so. I shall be no party to the suggestion that we should allow the matter to rest. I know that it appears to many of the public that this is a fight between the Government and a majority of the Senate. It is nothing of the kind. It is a fight by the Senate to maintain its constitutional power to disallow a regulation of which it does not approve. The same power is given to the other branch of the legislature. At any time it can disallow a regulation, which thereupon becomes null and void. The Senate is merely exercising the power conferred upon it by the law. It is common knowledge that no bill can become an act unless it has the approval of both Houses. The same principle applies to a regulation. The Acts Interpretation Act lays it down clearly. In those circumstances I cannot understand <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly's</inline> statement. It is quite contrary to a commonsense reading of the law. </para>

              <para>- While in Tasmania recently I moved about among the business section of the community and among people who gain their livelihood through work available for the waterside workers in the different ports, and in the course of my investigations I did not hear one individual express opposition to the continuance of the provisions made in the Transport Workers Act, which, as I have already said, have ensured uninterrupted service for the last three years between Tasmania and the mainland. The people of Tasmania - not a section of them only - resent very strongly the unworthy action of the Government in declining to recognize that the Senate is only within its rights in disallowing a regulation which it feels sure if put into effect would lead before long to a recurrence of that state of turmoil, unrest, and deprivation of employment, which was so noticeable before the Transport Workers Act became law. </para>

            <para>.- Notwithstanding that this matter has been before the Senate on many occasions, I desire to offer a few observations concerning it. I resent <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly's</inline> statement that the Senate is not representative of the people. Honorable senators represent States and not a section of individuals, as does the honorable senator who made the objection. I also deprecate the statement made recently by the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> that the Senate has more dignity than capacity. It would be well for that dignity to be carried into some other channel. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> knows better than anyone else that the continual re-gazetting of regulations which have been disallowed by the Senate, is contrary to the spirit of the law. It is time the Government ceased this childish policy. Prior to the passing of the Transport Workers Act, members of the Waterside Workers Federation had a monopoly of all work on the wharfs, and from time to time they held up- the trade and commerce of the country. This condition of affairs obtained for a considerable time, but finally the patience of the people was exhausted and the Bruce Page Government introduced legislation, known as the Transport Workers Act, the effect of which was to ensure peace on the waterfront. These regulations are designed to give again to members of the Waterside Workers Federation a monopoly of all waterside work. Is it fair that any small section of the community should have the right to all work that is available on the public wharfs? Although I do not believe in the principle, I should be prepared to concede preference to members of the Waterside Workers Federation if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes,</inline> when next he addresses members of that organization, succeeds in persuading them to open their books to all volunteer workers. But, as we know, the Waterside Workers Federation is a restricted organization. It has closed its books to outside applicants by demanding prohibitive fees. In this way, it has become a dangerous monopoly. If the federation opened its books to every man who wished to join it, many of the objections which honorable senators on this side have to the principle of preference to unionists would be dispelled. Although the Attorney-General has a capable staff, I suggest that if this business of gazetting regulations is persisted in the limitations of the English language will eventually prevent the issue of fresh regulations. But, speaking seriously, the Government should bow to the will of Parliament and cease the gazetting of regulations only to have them disallowed by the Senate. </para>

              <para>- Members of that organization get their fair share of the work now. They are not prohibited from taking out licences under the act and applying for the work in the ordinary way. It is idle for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> to imply that members of the Waterside Workers Federation at Port Adelaide  are models of propriety in trade union ethics, or have never been provocative in their attitude towards other workers. It is well known that they have always been the most rebellious section of the Waterside Workers Union in Australia. However, I hope that the Government will now accept the position and obey the letter and spirit of the law. </para>

          </talker>
          <para>. - Yesterday the right honorable the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> expressed a doubt whether the bill preserved the rights of certain members or officers of the North Australia Commission. I have made inquiries, and I am advised that this clause ensures that every person, who was a member or officer of the North Australia Commission and had rights by virtue of section 13 and 14 of the Northern Australia Act, will have those rights preserved. The right honorable gentleman referred to the fact that paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> of proposed new section 17a applied only to members or officers who were continued in employment, and stated that he desired to be assured that members or officers who were not continued in employment would also have their rights preserved. The position of members or officers who had rights but were not being continued in employment was fully considered by the Minister for Home Affairs, who directed that such officers were also to have their rights preserved. The Crown Law authorities advised, however, that there was no necessity to mention such officers in the bill, as they preserved their rights by virtue of section 8 of the Acts Interpretation Act, which provides, <inline font-style="italic">inter alia,</inline> that where an act repeals a former act, the repeal shall not affect any right, privilege, , obligation, or liability acquired, accrued, or incurred under any act so repealed. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The bill does not propose to confer any rights on members or officers of the commission who had no rights under the Northern Australia Act. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hobler</inline> is the only member of the commission who had rights, and his rights were in respect of leave and superannuation. Those rights are preserved to him, and will be honoured by the Government. Only four officers of the commission have any rights, viz., Messrs. Moyes, Shepherd, Pigott, and Binet. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Moyes,</inline> who is not being continued in employment, has the right to return to the Commonwealth railways service, from which he was appointed to the commission. That right is preserved to him by virtue of the Acts Interpretation Act, and arrangements have already been made for him to return to the Commonwealth railways. The other three officers are being retained in employment, and their rights are preserved by clause 4 of the bill now under consideration. The Leader of the Opposition referred to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Easton</inline> as a member of the commission who had rights by virtue of his State service. I am advised that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Easton</inline> was at one time employed by the Government of Western Australia in various temporary capacities, such as surveyor, lands inspector, &amp;c, but was not on the permanent staff of the Western Australian Government. When the Land Board of the Northern Territory was being constituted, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Easton</inline> was appointed to the position of  chairman  of the board, as a nominee of the pastoralists. His appointment was for a period of five years, and was not a permanent appointment. On the coming into force- of the Northern Australia Act, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Easton</inline> was appointed a member of the North Australia Commission for a period of five years. He has no State or Commonwealth accrued rights, except rights in connexion with leave as a member of the North Australia Commission, and the right of tenure of office as a member of such commission until the 31st August, 1931. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Easton</inline> is not being continued in employment, but is being granted all accrued leave due to him, payment for which will extend beyond the 31st August, 1931, the date on which the appointment of the commission w.ould have expired had the Northern Australia Act not been repealed. One of the most important factors in the decision to dispense with the services of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Easton</inline> was the necessity to make provision for officers with rights. The Minister had to give consideration to the financial effect of the retirement of officers with rights. It was decided that officers with such rights should be given preference in employment in the positions for which they wer.e suitable, over officers who had no rights. </para>
