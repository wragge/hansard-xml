            <para>- In reply to a question asked by me on Wednesday last the Leader of the Government in the Senate promised that the new regulations under the Transport Workers Act would be laid on the table of the Senate as soon as the no confidence motion in another place was out of the way. I have listened to the list of papers just laid on the table by both Ministers, but apparently the regulations under the Transport Workers Act are not included. I, therefore, ask the Minister what has become of his promise? </para>

        <para class="block">The late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chapman,</inline> who was elected to the Senate in 1925, was well, and I am sure favorably, known to every honorable senator. Although during the whole of the time he was a member of this chamber he had most indifferent health, he always kept a brave face, and did his work well and truly for the people whom he represented. He was a general favorite, and discharged his duties  conscientiously  without hurting the feelings of others. I am sure that I am meeting the wishes of every honorable senator in submitting this resolution of sympathy. I was fond of the late honorable senator, and personally regret his death very sincerely. </para>

The late honorable senator displayed great courage in the face of physical disabilities and suffering. He was regular in his attendance in the Senate, and, as we all know, was most conscientious in the discharge of his parliamentary duties. I also desire to tender our sympathy to his widow and family in the loss they have sustained. We cannot gauge the extent of their loss; but we sympathize with them in their bereavement, and pay this tribute to the memory of one who  always tried to do his duty to his country and the people who sent him here. </para>

          <para>. - On behalf of the Country party, of which the late honorable senator was a member, I desire to endorse the remarks of the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Barnes),</inline> and the right honorable the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce).</inline> We feel that we have lost the services of a colleague who was conscientious, painstaking, and persevering in the discharge of his duties, and whose help was valued most highly by the Senate. Whatever opinion posterity may have concerning the work of the late honorable senator in the position which he occupied in this House, I think we all will agree that one valuable attribute that he possessed was that he always stood four-square to the policy he supported, and the promises he made to the electors who sent him to this chamber. During the whole of his term as a senator, he conscientiously advocated the policy that he thought was in the best interests of the State which he represented, and Australia as a whole. As the right honorable the Leader of the Opposition said, he frequently attended to the responsibilities of his position when he was physically unfit to do so, and we have no doubt that his devotion to duty hastened his untimely end. I have the greatest sympathy for his widow and his family, and feel that it is only right and proper that we, as members of the legislature to which he belonged, should send a formal message of sympathy to them. </para>

          <para>. - On behalf of the representatives of South Australia on this side of the chamber, I should like to say how sincerely we regret the death of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chapman.</inline> The demands made upon members of this Parliament are many and exacting, and death plays havoc in our ranks. Motions of this character are all too frequent. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chapman</inline> was a most regular attendant, and his devotion to duty may possibly have hastened his death. He recognized the importance of his position, and, despite ill health, always took a direct and serious interest in the business of the Senate. It wag my privilege to know the late honorable senator for a number of years, during which period I learned to recognize his ability, and his conscientious devotion to duty, as well as his honesty and integrity. I regret his passing. </para>

A day or two before I left Adelaide for Canberra I had a telephone conversation with the bte honorable senator, and I noted his pleasure at the prospect of again taking up his duties in this chamber.  Although <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chapman</inline> was in delicate health for a number of years, he still carried out his duties most conscientiously. Nothing was too much trouble in the way of research if only it would strengthen the appeal that he so frequently made on behalf of those whom he assisted to represent in this Parliament. He was most assiduous in looking up records and authorities to support his contentions. With other honorable senators, I deplore his passing; I regret that we shall see him here no more. I hope that the tributes to his memory by honorable senators this afternoon will be some comfort to his widow and family in their ' bereavement. Nothing has been said to-day that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chapman</inline> did not richly merit. With deep sorrow I add my tribute to the memory of a man who did his duty faithfully and well. </para>

I also associate myself with the sympathy with his widow and family which the motion voices. </para>
