          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">May on the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> to the motion for the printing of papers relative to the sugar agreement. A week prior to the vote being taken, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford</inline> approached me in Sydney, stating that he had received a telegram from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator J.</inline> B. Hayes, of Tasmania, asking for a pair on any division on the sugar question, but that he felt he could not give a pair on a matter of such vital importance to, Queensland. He therefore asked me if I could find another pair for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator J.</inline> B. Hayes. I had already received information from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cox</inline> that his medical adviser had advised him not to go to Canberra that week because of the state of his health, but that, if necessary, he was willing to attend any meeting of the Senate at which a vote was likely to be taken on the sugar question. I was able to tell him that I would pair him with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator J.</inline> B. Hayes, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cox</inline> remained in Sydney. On my return to Canberra, I confirmed the arrangement with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator J.</inline> B. Hayes who was anxious to get away. The vote, however, was not taken until the following week. In the meantime, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cox</inline> returned to Canberra. I am quite satisfied that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator J.</inline> B. Hayes left Canberra fully believing that he was paired with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cox,</inline> and the blame for any misunderstanding that has arisen rests entirely upon myself. </para>

        </quote><para class="block">Honorable senators will recall that I took this point when the right . honorable the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> moved to disallow the previous regulations that had been gazetted by the Government and, with all respect to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> I think my point then was not understood. Honorable senators opposite have always contended that the Government is continually gazetting the same regulations, and I submit that, under the standing order which I have just read, action cannot be taken by the Senate to disallow these regulations unless the Senate rescinds the resolution carried previously. The motion is out of order in that it proposes to determine a question substantially the same as one which has already been determined in the affirmative this session, without the previous resolution having been rescinded, namely, the disallowance of regulations granting preference in certain employment to returned soldiers and members of the Waterside Workers Union. When previously you ruled in this matter you stated that you understood the contention to be that the regulations before the Senate were not the same in substance as those previously laid on the table. Accordingly you ruled that the motion was in order. </para><speech>

I have been a member of the Senate for a number of years, and have heard many rulings given from the Chair; and I can affirm that times out of number debate has taken place on a point of order prior to the ruling being given by the  President.  What I now wish to ascertain is, whether you rule that the Standing Orders provide that the  President  shall give his ruling immediately a point of order has been stated, or whether in this case you considered that sufficient debate had taken place to enable you to give your ruling? </para>

The question which I submit you, sir, had to determine, was whether the motion was the same in substance as that on which the Senate had previously reached a decision. </para><para class="block">That is the angle from which I think the Senate should consider your ruling under this Standing Order. The motion deals with something entirely new. How can it be said that Statutory Rule No. 64, which has not been disallowed by the Senate, is the same as Statutory Rule No. 51, which has been disallowed? Standing Order No. 133 does not cover the ' substance of the statutory rule, but the substance of the motion. I pass on now to what, perhaps, is a more important question - one which our own procedure controls. We cannot, by any action we may take under our Standing Orders, control the legislative provision of an act of Parliament. As you are aware, sir, the provision for the disallowance of a regulation is a statutory one, and, in any case, must override any provision that we may make for the conduct of our business. Even if we provided in our Standing Orders that a statutory rule, once having been disallowed, could never be disallowed again it would be abortive, for there is a statutory right in the Acts Interpretation Act to disallow regulations from time to time. No provision that this Senate might make would be valid against the enactment of the Parliament which governs this matter. Even if, for our internal procedure, we make certain provisions for the control of our business, as in Standing Order No. 133, I submit that the question or amendment has to be the same, and not the provision or regulation the disallowance of which is sought. To argue that a motion for the disallowance of Statutory Rule No. 64 cannot be moved until the motion for the disallowance of Statutory Rule No. 51 has been rescinded, because the two rules are in identical, terms, seems to me to be quite beside the point, because the two rules are entirely different. Each motion would apply to different statutory rules. I submit that the first statutory rule is dead. By virtue of the action of the Senate, it has disappeared. The powers of the Senate have been applied to it and it has passed out of existence. A new statutory rule has come in its place. Anything that may be moved in the Senate, or any notice of motion that may be given in relation to a particular statutory rule, can affect only that nile. </para><para class="block">The  notice of motion now under discussion has particular reference to a specific statutory rule, notwithstanding that the contents of that rule may be literally exactly the same as the contents of another rule. The crux of the whole matter is the question or the motion, and not the statutory rule. It cannot by any stretch of the imagination be maintained that a motion to disallow Statutory Rule No. 64 can be the same as a motion to disallow Statutory Rule No. 51. They are quite different things. Statutory Rule No. 51 has disappeared. It is no longer in existence. I can quite understand that the Minister and honorable senators who are supporting him in propagating this gospel of the Standing Orders, have been led astray by the phrase, " the same in substance ". But it is the question or amendment that must be the same in substance, and not the regulations. For these reasons I felt obliged, somewhat regretfully, to move my motion of dissent. </para><interjection>

            <para>-  I support the President's ruling because I think it is indisputable. I am buttressed in my opinion by statements made in previous debates by honorable senators opposite on this very subject. They alleged that the Government was out of order in gazetting regulations similar to those which had previously been disallowed, and they argued the matter before the Senate at considerable length.. At that time I took a point similar to the one that is being taken to-day. I know, that it is difficult for the  President  to have questions like this sprung on him, and when a ruling was given against me I was sorry, though T did not take umbrage at it because I knew that it had been given with strict impartiality. Since then, I have given a good deal of careful' consideration to this subject. It is true .that the regulations which have been gazetted are the same in intent and purport as the regulations previously disallowed by the Senate. </para>

            <para>-  The regulations gazetted in the first place were for a specific purpose; they were challenged by honorable members opposite and disallowed. The Government caused similar regulations to be drafted. These may have been altered a little in language, but the .purport and intent of them was unequivocally the same as the regulations that had been disallowed. As honorable members opposite have said in numerous speeches, the regulations were, in fact, the same. In this circumstance, there is only one method by which they can be dealt with and that is by the rescinding of the resolution previously carried. That is what you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.- President,</inline> have ruled, and I maintain that your ruling is sound. </para>

The new regulations differ from those previously disallowed only to the extent that the statutory rule embodying them bears a different number. The number is not a part of the regulations; it is necessary only for identification purposes. On the ground that the motion for disallowance cannot be out of order, seeing that the Leader of the Government in the Senate has admitted that the regulations to which it relates are not different from those previously disallowed, I support the motion of dissent. </para>

Before this matter reaches that stage, I ask you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> to consider for a moment the peculiar wording of the Standing Order under which your ruling has been given. To my mind there is no doubt that the intention of Standing Order 133 is to prevent the Senate, from altering a previous decision without due notice being given. The Standing Order is badly worded, and its meaning is not so clear as it should be. Nevertheless, its intention is clear. It is a common practice in all deliberative assemblies that a decision cannot be altered without notice having first been given. Standing Order 133 reads - </para>

        </quote><para class="block">Unless that Standing Order is interpreted to mean that the Senate cannot alter a previous decision without notice, it becomes an absurdity. Otherwise, as in the present instance, it would mean that the Senate could not re-affirm a previous decision without rescinding it - the very thing that a majority of the Senate does not want to do. What would be the legal effect if the Senate could, and did, rescind its previous decision in relation to the waterside workers' regulations? It would mean that the Senate's disallowance of those regulations would have no effect. It might also mean that persons who have been prosecuted for offending against regulations which they thought had been disallowed, would be again subject to prosecution because the resolution of the Senate had been rescinded. It would be absurd for the Senate to rescind something that it had no wish to rescind. Why should honorable senators, in the exercise of their privileges, be called upon to rescind something of which they entirely approve - something which they did in the past and want to do again? The purpose of the Standing Order is to prevent the Senate from arriving at an opposite decision without due notice being given to honorable senators. That contention is borne out by the wording of Standing Order 134, which goes so far as to say that seven days' notice must be given of any intention to rescind a resolution of the Senate. In the light of that Standing Order I submit that it is entirely contrary to reason to say that honorable senators must be given seven days' notice of a motion to re-affirm a previous decision of the Senate. Because of the peculiar wording of Standing Order 133. your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> appears reasonable; but I submit that it is contrary to the intention of the Standing Order to rule that the Government, having gazetted regulations, and the Senate having disallowed them, the Government can again gazette them and. the Senate be silenced for a week. </para><interjection>

            <para>- I support, with a great deal of diffidence, the motion to disagree with the ruling of the Chair. It is certainly distasteful to me to have to take this action, but I feel that I owe a debt to this Senate, and consequently, I must support the motion. The question at issue is not that the contents of these regulations are the same as those of the previous regulations. If your ruling is correct, then I hold that if at any future time during this session, it is necessary for the Senate to move to disallow a regulation which after disallowance has been re-gazetted, this ruling would apply with equal force. The question is not whether these regulations are of the same substance as the previous regulations, but whether the motion for disallowance is in substance the same as one already passed this session. The question is whether you, sir, as  President,  have power to deny to this Senate the right to disallow any regulations that may be tabled in the Senate during the session. </para>

            <para>- The Acts Interpretation Act clearly gives to this Senate the statutory power to reject, by disallowance, any regulations which may be tabled in this Senate, irrespective of their contents. "We are, therefore, justified in assuming that when regulations are tabled in this House, the majority of honorable senators may disallow them, notwithstanding their contents. The case put. by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> is reasonable indeed. We have to interpret our Standing Orders in the spirit in which they were framed, and the honorable senator has put plainly before the Senate the  spirit in which the standing order in question was framed. It was never framed to give the Senate an opportunity  after seven days' notice being given, to confirm or rescind a vote for disallowance that had been taken a few days previously. I submit that the Acts Interpretation Act confers full powers upon this Senate to deal with any regulations that are before it. These regulations are new. We have that on an authority which I cannot quote in this chamber. New regulations have Been issued, and we have the power under the Acts Interpretation Act to disallow them. For that reason I intend to support the motion. </para>

            <para>- It is with considerable reluctance that I find myself compelled to disagree with the ruling of the Chair. It is easy to understand how the interpretation which you, sir, have placed upon the standing order was arrived at, but I am satisfied that if we are to be limited by that interpretation the Senate will be deprived of its statutory rights and authority in this regard. The motion that such and such a statutory rule should be disallowed is in substance and effect the same as the resolution that was previously moved, if the assurance which has been given by the Leader of the Government in this chamber is correct. It is moved at the close of each day's proceedings that the Senate do now adjourn, yet no one would deny to-morrow, if we then moved to that effect, that the motion could be submitted because it was the same in substance and effect as that moved the day previously. Again, supposing that some honorable senator disobeyed the Chair and on motion submitted by the Leader of the Government in this chamber, was suspended for a certain period, and supposing that honorable senator when he returned to the chamber committed another offence and another motion was moved that he be suspended, the question could be raised with just as much force as it has been raised to-day by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> that that motion was the same in substance and in effect as a resolution that had been carried previously in the same session. And so we reduce the position to an absurdity. We are now moving, not for the disallowance of regulations that have previously been disallowed, but for the disallowance of new regulations that have been promulgated. There is no question that this is a new motion. How is it possible for us to rescind the previous resolution? It has exhausted itself; it has been acted upon. That resolution disallowed previous regulations, and if we were to submit and pass a motion that that resolution be rescinded, would it mean the restoring of the regulations previously disallowed ? </para>

            <para>- I do not think so, because a motion of rescission could not operate retrospectively to the time when the previous resolution was carried.  If  we adopted the interpretation of the Chair we should land ourselves in the absurdities to which attention has already been drawn. We cannot rescind a resolution that has already been acted upon and has exhausted its legal force. We could not in that way restore regulations which had been previously disallowed, and annulled by reason of the action of the Senate. This is clearly a new resolution dealing with new regulations. The fact that these regulations may deal with the substance and be in the form of previous regulations which have been disallowed has nothing to do with the case. I support the motion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan,</inline> and I agree with the interpretation that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> has placed upon the Standing Order. I hope that the matter may be cleared up without honorable senators being put to the necessity of disagreeing with your ruling, sir, but I think that in this case you have made a mistake. </para>

            <para>- Honorable senators must realize that my duty is to see that the proceedings of the Senate are conducted in accordance with the Standing Orders, which are, so to speak, my tools of trade, and may, by experience, prove to be good or bad. Honorable senators must also realize that an absolutely unparalleled set of circumstances is being dealt with at the present moment. These circumstances have arisen from the re-assertion on several occasions of certain regulations which, I think I am right in saying, is unprecedented in the history of the Federal Parliament. No ruling can be given by the Chair on a regulation which is merely laid upon the table without a motion being made in the chamber as to its fitness or otherwise for administration. Regulations are laid upon the table without debate and, in very many instances, without being seen by any honorable senator, either before or after their presentation. The  President  is, therefore, not in a position to rule any regulation out of order. My ruling to-day is, I contend, in accordance with the provisions of Standing Order 133. I admit that that Standing Order has very little application to the present circumstances; as I have already said, it was evidently not framed with any idea of its being applied to the consideration of regulations in circumstances such as have arisen in this ease. As a matter of fact, if my ruling is disagreed with, the result may be, as I hope it will, the framing of a special standing order to cover motions relating to the- disallowance of regulations. I do not think that the course followed in connexion with these regulations - a regulation being disallowed one day and regazetted  the next - was ever contemplated, or there would have been some standing order to exempt them from the provisions of Standing Order 133. That no such standing order has been framed is due to the fact that the position is unique. I assure honorable senators that I shall  not  in the least mind their disagreeing with my ruling, because I feel that in so doing they will be disagreeing not so much with my ruling as with the Standing Order which I have quoted. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I do not attach much importance to the points raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan.</inline> After all, they are purely legal. I do not think that the argument that the identity of regulations cannot be concealed by the fact that one is numbered 64, and another 53, carries any weight. If the state of affairs that has arisen had ever been contemplated, the Acts Interpretation Act would have contained provisions to overcome it. It is obvious to me that the present situation was never thought of by those who framed either the Acts Interpretation Act or the Standing Orders under which I have to conduct the proceedings of the Senate. I maintain that 1 have correctly interpreted Standing Order 133, but I repeat that the Standing Order itself lacks provisions to meet a situation such as has arisen. It is the responsibility of the Senate to rectify that omission. </para>

              <para>- I deny that. What reason would the Government have for taking action if the work had been proceeding peacefully? Only the obstinacy of honorable senators of the Opposition makes them continue throwing a wrench into the machinery. Since these regulations were first promulgated there has been no disturbance in connexion with the waterfront - except in this chamber. Some honorable senators seem intent on causing dissension and disorder; one would think that they themselves were trying to live up to the reputation they give to the waterside workers. Prior to the regulations being introduced the newspapers recorded almost daily disturbances, injuries to individuals, and interruptions of work on the waterfront. Lately, no occurrences of this kind have been recorded, and it is evident that the work on the wharfs is proceeding serenely. Why then do honorable senators persist in creating turmoil? They may have the satisfaction of irritating the Government, but they achieve nothing else. Work is interrupted only when the regulations are disallowed. As soon as new regulations are issued the shipping companies engage men for work that is impending. The continual meddling by the Senate is not fair to the ship-owners or the workers. If evidence were adduced that the handling of the merchandise on the. wharfs was not being carried out efficiently under the regulations honorable senators would have some ground for their . opposition to them. But while the work is being done well and amicably this chamber has no warrant for interfering with it. The action  of  the Opposition in this matter is harassing a Government which already has enough trouble on its hands. </para>

              <para>- The Government is endeavouring to pull Australia out of difficulties in which previous incapable administrations landed it. Surely honorable senators opposite realize the foolishness of being brought back here week after week merely for the purpose of disallowing regulations under which industry is being carried on satisfactorily? The procedure of the last few weeks is open to ridicule. The Senate disallows regulations and, when new regulations are gazetted, it proceeds to take precisely the same action. The only disaffected section of the community appears to be in this chamber. Here we have the spectacle of honorable gentlemen representing the various States of the Commonwealth coming back to Canberra once a week to pass a certain motion. The challenge was thrown out to the Government several weeks ago. The course which they are pursuing may give satisfaction to some honorable senators opposite, but I remind them that the inconvenience caused to Government supporters who in this chamber number only five or six, is as nothing to the annoyance caused to honorable senators opposite. I appeal to their sporting instincts if not to their commonsense to cease this stupid and foolish procedure. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir</inline>HAL COLEBATCH  (Western Australia)  [4.38].  - I was under the impression that this business would be decided without a repetition of all the arguments that we have heard on previous occasions when the Senate has been considering the disallowance of similar regulations. Apparently I was mistaken.  I  do not intend to give a silent vote on this motion because the Leader of the Senate has charged honorable senators on this side with being guilty of foolish and stupid action when, as a matter of fact, all that we are endeavouring to do is to uphold the principles of justice and observance of the law. We are essaying, among other things, to support the decisions of the Arbitration Court and endeavouring to ensure that persons who entered into solemn obligations with other persons shall be permitted to discharge those obligations. Peace is very desirable, but peace is not everything. I commend to honorable senators that most delightful book <inline font-style="italic">The Exploits of Asaaf Khan,</inline> which tells how Asaaf brought peace to his people. Having assembled the two disputing parties, he singled out those from whom he had most reason to expect trouble and reducing them, by an excess of hospitality into a state of insensibility, he promptly chopped off all their heads. In that way be brought peace to his village. That is the kind of peace that honorable senators opposite seek to bring about on the waterfront, by debarring from labour any who do not agree with their particular brand of politics. There is one point to which I should like to direct the attention of honorable senators with regard to this set of regulations. In a statement that was made by the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> for publication on -the day that the regazettal of these regulations was notified, the honorable gentleman said - </para>

The only effect of gazetting the regulation on Monday instead of Wednesday was that on those two days a certain set of people obtained employment instead of a certain other set of people. I believe that it will be admitted that, from the point of view of their worthiness as citizens and the need of their families, each side was equally deserving of consideration. The immediate urgency which, in the opinion of the Government, justified it in brushing aside the personal desire of the representative of  His  Majesty the King was that it desired to give those two days work to its own political supporters. In effect it said, " We will even flout the personal desires of  His Excellency  the Governor-General in order to please our political supporters." </para>

What I say to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> and other honorable senators opposite is that this Government was returned to power to govern the country. It has done nothing that conflicts  Avith  its constitutional rights. I admit that the Senate has the right to veto any legislation that may be enacted by the Government in this form ; but I contend that the grounds upon which it exercises that right should be stronger than those that have been advanced on this or any previous' occasion. It  is  of no use to take this action on the ground that the Government has brushed aside the personal desire of the representative of  His  Majesty the King. </para>

              <para>- I sincerely trust that the Senate will allow these regulations to remain in force, and that it will permit the Government to govern this country until such time as it is satisfied that that government is upon wrong lines. Not one honorable senator opposite has been able to cite an instance of industrial unrest on the waterfront that has been due to the action of the Government. They all admit that there is industrial peace on the waterfront; that no protest has been lodged against the action of the Government by the shipping companies; that for the period during which the regulations have operated no stoppage of work has occurred and no pillaging has taken place, and that there have been no offences such as those with which they charged waterside workers prior to the enactment of the Transport Workers Act. But they say that, in the interests of justice and of law - to use the words of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> - they should disallow  these regulations. </para>

          <para>What is the position ? The Government tried unsuccessfully to induce the shipping lords of Great Britain, through their mouthpieces in Australia, to meet it and to arrive at a peaceful solution of the trouble. It found those representatives unrelenting. They were determined to fight, not the militant trade union movement of New South Wales and  Fremantle,  but the trade union movement of Port Adelaide and Port Melbourne. Consequently, a proclamation was issued covering those particular ports, and the decent trade unionist was really hounded off the wharf. Any person who visits Port Adelaide must sympathize not only with the workers, but also with the tradespeople of that port. The Government, in its anxiety to meet the wishes of both of those classes, attempted to have means provided whereby the work on the waterfront would be distributed between that band of workmen to whom the employers felt that they owed some allegiance, and the- men to whom the work rightly belonged. But a deaf ear was turned to every entreaty of the Government, and, after many months of unsuccessful negotiation, it felt that, in the interests of justice and of these men to whom the work rightly belonged, some drastic step must be taken. Even now the door is not closed against these shipping lords, to whom certain honorable senators opposite are prepared to bow the knee in adoration; it is still open to them to confer with the Government. It would be better for the Senate to allow the Government's discretion in this matter to remain unfettered, in the hope that, being unable to sustain a firm stand, the shipping lords might confer with it and thus pave the way for what we all hope to see, namely, absolute and permanent peace on the waterfront. I resent very deeply the suggestion that the peace desired by honorable senators who sit on this side is the peace of  Asaaf  Khan. That is not the sort of peace that we desire, or are pleading for to-day. .It is not the sort of peace that the waterside workers are anxious for; but, apparently, it is what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> would mete out to them. </para>
          <para>I feel that the regulations are doomed to be disallowed. In that event I strongly urge the "Government to re-enact them immediately, so that a measure of justice will be meted out to the members of the Waterside Workers Federation, even though it be for only a short period. </para>

            <para>.- "We on this side of the chamber propose to disallow these regulations because we believe in unionism and fairplay. It has been unfairly stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> opposite that I am opposed to unionism. I am strongly in favour of it, and realize that there must be unions in connexion with all trades and occupations for the purpose of collective bargaining. I propose, however, to defend, as far as I can, the interests of the Permanent and Casual Waterside Workers Union, an organization registered under the Arbitration Court. Its members came to the assistance of their country at a time when trade was interrupted by repeated strikes on the waterfront.' The members of the Waterside Workers Federation had disobeyed the awards of the Arbitration Court, and perishable goods and other primary products were allowed to lie on the wharfs awaiting shipment. Members of that union practised cruel victimization on the volunteer waterside workers who were brutally attacked by members of the federation whenever they were in sufficiently large numbers. They were pushed under trains, battered with bottles, and even their wives and families were maliciously persecuted. One of the best measures passed by the last Government was the Transport Workers Act, which required that waterside workers be licensed. Prior to that there were continual strikes on the waterfront, trade was disorganized, and pilfering of cargoes  was  rife, with the result that this country got a very bad name. It is well known that many members of the Waterside Workers' Federation had criminal records. We, on this side, propose now to defend the interests of the volunteer workers - who, I repeat, are unionists - and to frustrate this attempt to hound them off the wharfs, and prevent them from making an honest living. It is simply humbug for the Government to say that it is seeking to do justice on the wharfs. It is seeking to defend persecution. The subversive attempts of the Waterside Workers Federation were checkmated by the loyal workers who came forward and offered to work when the work was there to be done. Until the advent of this new union there was almost continuous trouble on the waterfront of the various ports of Australia. Even during the war strike after strike occurred. The waterside workers refused to send forward to the men overseas the comforts which were being despatched to them by the Red Cross Society. They also refused to ship the primary products which, at that time, it was so vital should be sent overseas. Since the members of the new union have been working on the wharfs it has been found that they are much more efficient than their predecessors. The stevedores and shipowners are agreed on this, and they also state that pilfering, if it has not entirely disappeared, is not anything like so bad as it was. Personally, I should like to see all the men on the wharfs obtain work if it were there for them, but I cannot agree to support regulations designed to give law-breakers a monopoly of what work is offering, while the loyal workers are allowed to starve. Honorable senators on this side are justified in coming here week after week to disallow these regulations which are framed in the interests of law-breakers, and directed against those who obeyed the laws of their country at a critical time in its history. </para>

I am one of those who, while not preaching class hatred, believe in the class struggle as the very basis of the Labour movement. There are two bodies of men on the wharfs at the present time, the unionists, and those who are euphemistically styled volunteers. </para>

              <para>- Tes, of a sort. The honorable senator who has just resumed his seat spoke of these volunteers coming to the rescue of their country, as though they were heroes who sacrificed their own interests for the sake of their country. Honorable senators must know that these so-called volunteers were mighty glad to get the jobs which were formerly not open to them, largely owing to their inferiority, either of physique or skill. The general testimony of expert  observers and investigators, such as sociologists, as well as of those directly concerned with industry, is to the effect that, on the whole, the best workers in every occupation are unionists. Ever since the inauguration of trade unionism, the tendency has been for the best men in various occupations to join their organization, by which, alone, experience has sho wn that they can obtain a modicum of justice under the existing capitalistic system. There can be no stronger indictment of the system which honorable senators support than is provided by the fact that, if the system had any economic stability about it, there would be no quarrel between the unionists and the volunteers, because there would be work for all. But unemployment, which is the root cause of industrial troubles, is not only the inevitable product of the system under which we live, but is also necessary to its maintenance. It is the keystone of the capitalistic system, and so long as unemployment continues, so long will there be a class struggle between those who serve the bosses' ends and those banded together to look after the interests of the workers. </para>

The so-called volunteer workers belong to a bogus organization that was formed for the purpose of serving the interests of the shipping employers. To that extent those workers are traitors to their own class, and we must necessarily fight them. In loyalty to the working class, we must take every opportunity of helping the organization through which, alone, the workers may receive but a modicum of justice. Were it not for trade unionism, the working class would be the most brutalized section of the human race.

All human experience proves that unionism, with , -all its defects, which I admit and regret, has done more than anything else to secure for the working classes a share of the wealth that they produce, and, consequently, I must back up any Government in any action it takes to help the organized working class. Therefore, I shall vote against the motion before the Senate. I hope that the Government will continue to re-enact these regulations, if necessary " to the Greek calends ".

The union which the Government seems to desire to shelter and give work to, to the exclusion of the other union, has, in effect, by its refusal to accept the award of the Arbitration Court, deliberately over-ridden the law of this country. To the Waterside Workers Federation the Government proposes to give the preference which was refused more than once by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Beeby and by the full Arbitration Court. </para>

              <para>- The society to which I belong is conducted in a manner that may help at times the muchtroubled  president  of the Australian Workers Union. The Government, by the very act of issuing these regulations, debars from work men who have laboured efficiently on the waterfront for some two and a half years, without a single instance of a stoppage of work. These men are not employed for less wages' than, or under different conditions from, those provided under the award. These are the men whom the Government seeks to drive out of employment to the advantage of those who have refused to obey an award of the court, which has been characterized by the other side as a pernicious award. There were scenes of violence on the waterfront recently in Sydney. The Government, for another reason, interfered with the right of employers to free selection, compelling them to employ members of an organization which has constantly defied the court over a long term of years. This body' has harassed the shipping industry; has caused innumerable delays, and has inflicted loss on the shipowners and the community amounting to; hundreds of thousands of pounds. I have given several of the reasons which actuated the Government in introducing the legislation under which these regulations have been framed. I cannot understand why the Permanent and Casual Wharf Labourers </para>

          <para class="block">Union should be referred to as a bogus union. What has it done to justify such a term ? It is a union registered under the law, and its members are as much entitled to consideration as are the members of any other trade union organization. Why should the members of that organization, who are obeying an award of the Arbitration Court, be singled out by the Government for punitive treatment? Probably it is because the present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin),</inline> when the Transport Workers Act was under consideration, said that in the event of a change of Government the men who were then performing the work on the waterfront, would, so to speak, be thrown to the wolves. In effect the Government is attempting a back-door method to repeal the Transport Workers Act. I am willing to admit that many of the members of the Waterside Workers Federation are honest and deserving men, but unfortunately they were influenced by their leaders to disobey an award of the Court, and, in consequence of that and other actions, are now suffering. It is the responsibility of this Parliament to support any section of organized workers which is observing an award of the Arbitration Court. Honorable senators opposite have said that there is now peace on the waterfront; but that is due solely to the fact that the work is being efficiently performed by the members of the so-called bogus union. Quite recently <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kelly,</inline> the  President  of the South Australian Arbitration Court, at the instance of the South Australian Government, held an inquiry as to the extent to which relief should be afforded to the members of the Waterside Workers Federation at Port Adelaide. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kelly</inline> conducted an investigation into the whole circumstances and instead of reporting  in  favour of action being taken to alleviate the position of the members of that federation in Port Adelaide, reported that its members should approach the Permanent and Casual Wharf Labourers Union and endeavour to arrange for a joint appeal to the Arbitration Court, so that the members of both organizations might get a fair share of the little work which, unfortunately, is now offering on the wharfs  at that  port.  It  is not a question of political bigotry, but of doing the right thing by those men who are observing the law. These men are entitled to all the support that we can give them. "We are not concerned with the opinions of the representatives of the shipping interests so long as the work on the waterfront is satisfactorily performed. ' "When the Transport Workers Act was under consideration promises were made by certain members of this chamber and another place, and those promises must be honoured. As no additional reasons have been adduced to warrant' the regulations now under consideration, I intend to support the motion. Honorable senators on this side of the chamber have already committed themselves to the principle that the members of the Permanent and Casual Wharf Labourers Union should be supported. If some members of the federation are experiencing hardship it is to be regretted, but hardships will unfortunately have to be faced by many others before financial stability is restored in this country. In view of the report submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kelly,</inline> who acted in an independent capacity, there is no reason why action should now be taken to grant preference to those who in the past have openly and repeatedly flouted the law. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir WILLIAM</inline>GLASGOW (Queensland) [5.25].  -  When I moved the motion for the disallowance of these regulations, I was under the impression that, as the subject had been debated at length on previous occasions, there was no necessity to endeavour to justify the motion. Since the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Barnes)</inline> and other honorable senators have raised certain points, I should like to take this opportunity to reply briefly. The Minister said that since the present Government had issued regulations under which preference is given to members of the Waterside Workers Federation there had been peace on the waterfront. He must realize that prior to the passage of the Transport Workers Act, there was continual industrial trouble, and that almost daily the transport of overseas and interstate goods was seriously hampered. Since that act has been in operation, the handling of goods, both overseas and interstate, has proceeded without interruption. Ships have been running to schedule time, cargo has been handled expeditiously, and much more cheaply, while efficiency generally has been increased by from 30 per cent, to 40 per cent. Pilfering and short landings, which were an enormous charge on ship-owners prior to the passage of the Transport Workers Act, have also disappeared. </para>

              <para>- I cannot answer that question. All I can say is that the men who  took  out licences, and who were prepared  to work  under the award of the court,  were  allowed to work. Traders who use Queensland ports have suffered tremendously  in the  past through the actions of the members of the Waterside Workers Union.  There  were two sections df the union  in  Cairns, each of which tried to secure control of the work on the waterfront, and shippers had to stand by while the two sections fought each other. At Bowen the members of the federation declared certain persons black, and refused to handle inward or outward cargo for them. They were a law unto themselves. The result was that these people had to send their cargo to Townsville and rail it back again. That sort of thing has not happened since the Transport Workers Act has been in operation. The people on the coast of Queensland would be very sorry if the conditions which have prevailed in the last two years were altered, as they would be altered if the regulations which we are now seeking to disallow were to remain in force. </para>

          <para>. - I remind the Leader of the Government <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Barnes)</inline> of his promise to give the Senate some information as to the reason why papers asked for by resolution of the Senate over six weeks ago have not yet been produced. The inaction of the Government is the more exasperating when we reflect that other papers which have not been called for have been produced by Ministers voluntarily. Some time ago the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Theodore)</inline> had some correspondence with the Commonwealth Bank authorities. That correspondence was laid on the table of another place, and copies were distributed throughout Australia without, so far as I am aware, the authority of the Bank Board having first been obtained. Last ' week the Minister for Markets <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.</inline></para>

        <para class="block">Parker Moloney) laid on the table of the Library some of the correspondence between the Government and the Commonwealth Bank Board relating to the proposed advance of 4s. a bushel on wheat under . the Wheat Marketing Bill. That is very interesting, and I shall have something to say about it later. My complaint is that the papers containing the correspondence which passed between the Commonwealth Bank and the Government in regard to the non-payment of the 3s. advance have not been produced, although six weeks ago the Senate resolved that they be laid on the table of this chamber. The Government has produced correspondence which passed between the Commonwealth Bank and the Commonwealth Treasurer, although it was not asked for. That correspondence dealt with the inability of the bank to continue to finance the Commonwealth Government. </para>

            <para>- That is so. I wish to know why the correspondence relating to the 3s. advance cannot be produced. This Government should bc able to advance 3s. a bushel to the farmers, and if the correspondence wore made available to us' we could ascertain the reason for withholding from necessitous farmers the relief, small as it might be, of which they are so desperately in need. </para>

          <para>. - I should like some information as to the position of the Senate in this instance. If the Minister in charge of this chamber, in replying on a motion that the House do now adjourn, makes . any statement on a matter of policy or in reply to a question, no other honorable senator, according to the ruling of the Chair on this and previous occasions, can continue the debate. When a Minister moves the special adjournment of the House, as the Minister in charge of the Senate did this afternoon, surely he should be allowed to make a statement in reply to questions asked by other honorable senators, so that they may have an opportunity, when the adjournment of the House is moved subsequently, to reply, and he may have the- right to' a final reply. -If the Minister is not permitted to make any statement when he moves the special adjournment of the House, honorable senators will lose a privilege which they have enjoyed in the past, because it has been the . practice of this Senate, for many years, when the adjournment of the House is moved, for honorable senators to bring up certain matters irrelevant thereto and for the Minister to reply. </para>

          <para>- I understand that the custom in the past has been for the Minister, if he has promised another honorable senator to make a statement on a certain subject, to do so when moving the adjournment of the House. I, perhaps, have erred in preventing the Minister from replying to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston,</inline> but the Minister may now make a statement to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> may reply at the next sitting of the Senate. </para>

          <para>. - In reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston,</inline> let me say that the papers relating to the wheat guarantee of 4s. a bushel have been laid upon the table of the House of Representatives; but the correspondence relating to the proposed advance of 3s. a bushel is the property of the Commonwealth Bank, and this Government has no control of it. The Government is endeavouring to ascertain the views  of  the bank with respect to making that correspondence public, but whether that will be done depends entirely upon the bank and  not  upon the Government. I regret that I cannot give the honorable senator any information other than that. </para>
