                        <para>The Government is anxious to do all it is possible, in existing circumstances, to improve shipping communication between Tasmania and and the mainland, and has already explored a number of suggested methods of achieving this object.It has not, however, been found practicable, up to the present, to provide funds for the purchase or construction of ships for the Tasmanian service, but by payment of a subsidy to an existing steamship line the Government was enabled to provide the people of Tasmania with a service from Hobart to Sydney during the whole of last year which would otherwise have been discontinued during the winter months. It is not correct to say that the Government has agreed, as the honorable senator appears to assume, to continue the subsidy for a period of ten years. The whole position is still under examination, and due consideration will be given to the shipbuilding facilities available at Cockatoo Island dockyard before any final decision is reached in regard to the matter. </para>

                <para class="block">I understand that the right honorable the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> has announced that, if the Senate disallows these regulations, they will be immediately re-imposed. I would suggest, for the consideration of the Government, that a proper way to test this issue is to proceed by way of legislation. That would be in conformity with the Government's policy as announced by the right honorable gentleman at the last election. I am, of course, aware that this suggestion does not appeal to the Government, because members of the Ministry and their supporters do not bother about election promises. I would, however, remind the Senate that, at the last election, Labour candidates definately  promised the people that, if returned to power, they would repeal the Transport Workers Act, and I repeat that the Government now has an excellent opportunity to obtain the view of Parliament concerning its policy. The Ministry, moreover, has announced on several occasions that it. intends to seek a double dissolution. 1 suggest that no question more fitting than this could be pat forward by it to challenge the Senate and to give effect to one of its election pledges by means of legislation in this regard. Knowing the temper of this chamber, and also the temper of the people, I feel sure that if, in that way, the Government sought to bring about a double dissolution, the Senate would willingly accept any such challenge. If, as we are assured, this Government stands for democracy, surely it should not object to consult the people upon this and other points of its policy. </para>
                <para>I propose briefly to survey the history of events which led up to the passage of the Transport Workers Act, lest they should have faded from the memory of honorable senators and the people of Australia. It goes back "to December, 1927, when members of the Waterside Workers Federation went on strike. Then followed a series of strikes in the shipping industry. The Arbitration Court intervened and consented to inquire into the questions in dispute, provided the federation promised to obey the award when made. The federation gave the required promise, and an award of the court covering the points in dispute came into operation on the 10th September, 1928. Then there was a conference of 36 branches of the federation, which unanimously carried a resolution refusing to work under the award, despite the promise previously given that it would be obeyed. Consequently, there was another strike. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce,</inline> the then Prime Minister, in a statement made in Parliament on the 11th September, 1928, warned the waterside workers of the consequences of their action, and appealed to them to resume work. This Government also appealed to the various States to maintain sea and transport services. On the 10th September, 1928, the unions defied the Government and the law, called upon its members to strike and hold up sea transport trade all round the Australian coast, with the exception of certain ports. The position was discussed in Parliament, and the then Prime Minister declared that the Government was determined that the transport services must be carried on. On the 21st September, 1928, the Government introduced the Transport Workers Bill, which gave the executive power to make regulations for the licensing of workers in the maritime industry. </para>
                <para>When the Bruce-Page Government had made known its intention by introducing the legislation referred to, the present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> said that - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>The volunteers who had como to the rescue of the community and were carrying on the industry would not bc supported by the employers when the trouble was over - that the employers would as usual desert them. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">The employers in response to that challenge gave a public undertaking that they would continue to employ the volunteers, who continued to offer themselves for employment until there was sufficient to enable the transport work to be carried on at all the ports in Australia. After this position had been established, the Waterside Workers Union met and carried a resolution that as the repudiation of the award had served its purpose for the time being, its members were; advised to return to work. As a result, members of the Waterside Workers Federation presented themselves for work in a number of ports. Shortly afterwards there was a general election for the House of Representatives, and a new Parliament met on the 6th February, ' 1929. The Bruce Page Government having been returned with a majority, an amending Transport Workers Bill was introduced on the 13th February, 1929. This amending legislation gave authority to make regulations under our commerce powers to supplement the Arbitration Court, and to protect it. A large number of licences were taken out under the amended law by volunteer workers, and in some cases by members of the Waterside Workers Federation, and employment proceeded. At first, members of the federation refused to apply for licences, but subsequently they did so. Then began a movement by intimidation and the use of physical force to drive the licensed volunteer workers off the wharfs. This was followed by a series of outrages, including attacks upon the police who were called upon to protect the volunteers, as well as bomb outrages in Melbourne on the homes of volunteers, and personal assaults by mobs of waterside workers on individual volunteers. The operation of the Transport Workers Act has been followed by the longest period of continuous work on the waterfronts Australia has experienced for many years. That is the history of the position up to the present time. </para>
                <para>I have received a large number of protests against the regulations which have been re-imposed by the Government, and I propose to read the list in order to show how widespread is the feeling that has been aroused by this action on its part. I remind the Senate that the regulations previously brought in by the Government were disallowed by the Senate. This, therefore,' is a second attempt on the part of the Government to flout the power given under the Acts Interpretation Act to this chamber, as well as to the other branch of the Legislature, to disallow regulations. The protests I have received are from the following organizations : - </para>

I am not going to quote all of the protests I have received, but I submit a typical one from the secretary of the Queensland Meat Companies Committee, Brisbane, dated 16th March, 1931. It reads - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>I confirm the telegram sent you reading: " This committee endorses Victorian Meat Exporters letter to you of the 9th instant. Am writing you to-day." At a meeting of representatives of the Queensland Moat Export Companies to-day the matter of the restoration of preference to the Waterside Workers Federation for employment on the waterfront was considered and was viewed with alarm in view of our experience when that federation had control in Queensland ports. </para>
                    <para>Prior to the strike against the award of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court the Queensland works suffered losses through the arbitrary action of members of the Waterside Workers Federation, and there have been occasions when meat sent from the works for shipment has had to be returned to the works  owing to trouble on the wharf. Apart from their own losses, it is common knowledge that the community losses must have been consider- able, owing to the delays, and, at times, the complete disorganization of sailing programmes. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>Regularity of steamer sailings is of the utmost importance to the meat exporters, who enter into contracts or arrange to meet markets, and failure to fulfil arrangements renders them liable to cancellations and monetary losses and, further, undermines confidence in this country as a source of supply. </para>
                <para>Anything that is likely to prejudice the even flow of exports from Australia should  not be  countenanced, and the granting of preference to any section of the waterside workers is such a matter. The members of my committee, therefore, sincerely hope that the regulations recently issued will be disallowed by the Senate. </para>
                <para>I venture to say that, but for the succession of strikes, particularly in the transport industry in Australia, which inflicted great losses upon the community during years of prosperity, our economic position to-day would not be as serious as it is. I can illustrate that point by referring to the fact that recently the Argentine, in competition with Australia, was able to secure a large contract for the supply of meat to the British Army and Navy authorities. This letter from the representative of the meat companies indicates that the danger of interruption in the industry is always hanging over their heads, and that on that account Australian tenderers are at a disadvantage in competing with the Argentine. The Argentine meat exporters are in no such danger. In submitting tenders they do not, have to take into consideration an increase in price which may possibly be necessary in consequence of interrupted work. Knowing at the time when the tenders were prepared that there was a government in office which was supporting the claims of the waterside workers - a union which had inflicted such terrible loss on Australia - can we wonder that these people were handicapped and unable to compete with the Argentine? </para>

The reason why these 42 men had so applied was because of the tyranny of the Brisbane branch of the federation.

The Permanent and Casual Wharf Labourers Union of Australia membership through Queensland are bound by an award of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration in all respects similar to the award of the federation, and this regulation has disrupted the amicable relations hitherto existing between representative bodies of employers and employees, and caused chaos in place of peace and efficiency. </para><para>So far the Port of Newcastle is the only port  affected by the regulation made under the Transport" Workers" Act of 1928-29.

Theregulations to which the Leader of the Opposition takes objection have stood the test  of an appeal to the High Court. Whether they will stand the test of a vote in this chamber is quite another matter. They have been brought in with the definite object of having the work on the waterfront carried on without interruption. The work is now being carried out without interruption. It was not prior to their issue. The Government realized that it had no chance of adopting the course suggested by the Leader of the Opposition, that of introducing legislation for the repeal of the Transport Workers Act - the bill would not have passed this chamber - and it had, therefore, to adopt some other method of giving effect to its policy. The right honorable gentleman has challenged Ministers to test the feeling of the country upon the matter. At a later stage it may be necessary to do so.

Australia has been plunged into so much trouble recently, mostly, I believe, because of the legislation and administration of the previous Government, that I doubt if the party opposite would have much chance of being returned if we went to the country just now. These regulations were gazetted long before effect could be given to them. The ship-owners used all the means at their command to block the </para></talk.start></continue><para class="block">Government from giving effect to its policy of preference to unionists. They took us through the courts and succeeded in getting a prohibition against us, but upon an appeal being made to the High Court, judgment in favour of the Government was given. As the result these regulations came into effect in the ports of Melbourne, Port Adelaide, Newcastle, Brisbane, Bundaberg, Bowen, Innisfail, Goondi, Mourilyan, Townsville, Lucinda and Port Douglas. The licences issued since then are fairly numerous, although not nearly as many men can now secure employment on the wharfs, because there is not" now the quantity of merchandise passing over the wharfs that there was two or three years ago. Whereas 10,880 licences were issued in the port of Melbourne in the year 1928-29 and 8,267 in the following year the number has fallen to 5,258 for the current year. Reports received from the licensing officers show that no trouble has occurred at the various ports in connexion with the issue of licences. No  difficulty has been experienced in picking up sufficient competent labour for the working of the ships in the ports, and apparently no friction has occurred between members of the Waterside Workers Federation and the returned soldier volunteers, who between them share the work offering. Prior to the issue of these regulations, almost every morning the newspapers reported disturbances on the waterfront. Since their issue, however, there has not been a single paragraph referring to a disturbance of any sort on any wharf. The action of the Government has, therefore, been amply justified. In any case, we make no apology for what we have clone. For 30 years past preference to unionists has been a plank in the platform of labour, and labour has given effect to it at every opportunity, because it believes that it is in the best interests of the country to do so. It may be true that at times bodies of men do not give strict obedience to awards of industrial tribunals - I am not alleging anything to the contrary - but is it not a fact that in every walk of life men are continually breaking laws and courts have been set up to punish them? I am not claiming that the members of the Waterside Workers Federation acted wisely in the past, but they certainly acted  to  the best of their knowledge in seeking  to  preserve their own interests, although, in doing so, they were foolish enough to deprive themselves of work for many long months. There is apparently a great deal  of  sympathy with the British soldier and the foreigner, but little with the Australian, who may have made a mistake in doing something which amounted  to  disobeying an award of an industrial tribunal. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>465</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K2L</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">REID, Matthew</name><name role="display">Senator Reid</name></talker><para>-  Is the Minister certain that it was an Australian who made the mistake ? </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>465</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K1L</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">BARNES, John</name><name role="display">Senator BARNES</name></talker><para>- I think I am right in assuming that an overwhelming majority of the waterside workers of this country are Australian-born, or at any rate British.

Indeed, he so frequently spoke in that way, that I was led to believe that he was a firm believer in the principle that law and order should be maintained at all costs. Yet, when a Government, of which he is not a member, brings in a regulation with the object of promoting peace and harmony on the waterfront, the right honorable gentleman is prepared to throw a spanner into the wheel of industry. When these regulations were first put into operation, their validity was challenged by the shipowners of Australia and the agents  of  ship-owners in other countries. They appealed to the High Court to disallow them, but the High Court ruled they were valid. </para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>468</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KOJ</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">HAYS, Herbert</name><name role="display">Senator Herbert Hays</name></talker><para>-  Was the decision of the Court unanimous? </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>468</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JYB</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">DUNN, James Patrick Digger</name><name role="display">Senator DUNN</name></talker><para>- That is not the question; it was the decision of  the  majority of the judges of the High Court. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> McTiernan refused to adjudicate  on  the case because  of  action taken by him while a member  of  another place.

A good deal has been said about the position of Australian returned soldiers and Imperial ex-service men. We have been told that they are being victimized under these regulations. It may not be out of place if I remind the Senate that between 1914 and 1918 the Sydney branch of the New South Wales section of the Waterside Workers Federation sent over 2,000 of its members to serve in the Australian Imperial Force. A considerable number of those men lost their lives. Any one who has attended the eight hours demonstration in Sydney must have noticed emblazoned on the banner of that branch of the federation a memorial wreath honouring the memory of comrades who gave their lives for their country. Nothing has been said in this debate about returned soldier members of other branches of the Waterside Workers Federation, including the Tasmanian branch. Many of them have been obliged to accept the dole as the result of victimization under legislation introduced by the Bruce-Page Government. The shipping interests concerned believe that the time is opportune for a " showdown ". Australia is in the trough of a depression unparalleled in its history, and as there is a surplus of labour in all the States the Leader of the Opposition challenges the" Government and invites it to appeal to the people on this issue.

            <para>London, Friday. " We must obey the law, but we sincerely regret the decision, as we feel that the Government's attitude constitutes interference with the liberty of the subject, and will still further damage Australia's external credit," stated ship-owners interested, in a statement issued to-day concerning the High Court ruling upholding the Commonwealth Government's decision giving preference to members of the Waterside Workers Federation. </para>
            <para class="block">This is the view of overseas ship-owners, who are. directly concerned in the working conditions on the Australian waterfront. Have they or their representatives been in conference with the right honorable the Leader of the Opposition? I venture to say that they have, and because of his former association with the Australian Labour Party he takes advantage of this opportunity to submit a motion which, he believes will, if carried, humiliate the Government. Similar action was taken yesterday in connexion with ordinances relating to the Northern Territory. These pin-pricks are intended to irritate the workers. The situation on the waterfront in Australia is not satisfactory. Not so long ago the Premier of South Australia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hill)</inline> instructed two plain-clothes police officers to make a special investigation into an allegation that a considerable number of aliens were working ships in Port Adelaide. They reported that on one particular vessel all the 60 men working four hatches were foreigners, and that 90 per cent, of these aliens could not speak the English language. </para>

If these regulations are disallowed, the consequences in Sydney will be serious. The carrying of the motion will be akin to throwing a spanner into the works of smooth-running machinery. From my personal knowledge of the members of the Waterside Workers Federation in Sydney, I know that they will not take this rebuff lying down. I, therefore, appeal to the Leader of the Opposition and other honorable senators opposite not to press the motion, and so cause hatred and distress on the waterfront at all Australian ports. The adoption of this motion will light the flame of discontent. As for Australian returned soldiers, I need hardly point out that, under the existing regulations, they have first preference, so their position is safeguarded. I am proud of the fact that the members of the Waterside Workers Federation are now working peacefully on the waterfront, and that they are no longer afraid to wear their union badges. They are as proud of their badges as I am of being a member of a trade union, or as honorable senators opposite are of being members of a chamber of manufactures or a chamber of commerce.

In support of that contention I refer honorable senators opposite to the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator R.</inline> D.

It is not such a bogus organization as that which the honorable senator tried to establish in Queensland in opposition to the Australian Workers Union. I direct the attention of the Minister to the manner in which these regulations were promulgated. Immediately after Parliament adjourned for the Christmas vacation the Government brought these regulations into operation so that a motion for their disallowance could not be moved until Parliament re-assembled. In that way it was flouting the legislature, which, under the Acts Interpretation Act, is given power to disallow regulations. Two or three years ago when the members of the Waterside Workers Federation were almost daily flouting an award of the court, honorable senators opposite did not attempt to influence them to observe the law. They actually acquiesced in the action which they then took. </para>

                <para class="block">Prior to the enactment of the Waterside Workers Act the conditions at the port of Bowen were such that the mayor convened a meeting of citizens and an essential service association was formed to ensure the handling of merchandise on the waterfront. At that time the members of the Waterside Workers Federation in Bowen were absolutely a law unto themselves. They were dictating the policy in regard to the handling of goods on the waterfront. They had taken all control out of the hands of those who were authorized to control operations. They were absolutely defying the authorities. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline> conditions are now peaceful on the waterfront, but as shown by this letter, the members of the federation are up to all their old tricks again. In Rockhampton a wharf superintendent was assaulted by members of the Waterside Workers Federation, and the offenders had to be taken before the court. Now these people find themselves protected by the Government which knows they are again offending against the law. </para>
                <para>I have no desire to traverse the history of the happenings which made it necessary to enact a Transport Workers Act, as this was done by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir George</inline> Pearce, but no other piece of legislation has justified its enactment more than has this particular law. It has brought relief to the maritime industries. For three or four years there had been continuous trouble on the waterfront all over Australia, and more particularly in Queensland, because that State has a greater number of outports. The members of the Waterside Workers Federation were preventing the loading of ships, and making it impossible for ship-owners to run their vessels according to schedule. It was not a case of one or two isolated offences against an award of a court; there was a continuous series of such offences. There was likewise a continuous series of harassing tactics which made it impossible for the shipping companies to carry on their lawful business, or for producers to get their produce to market. There was considerable interference with the comfort of the seaborne travelling public. A great change was brought about when the Transport Workers Act was passed. Since then there has been peace on the waterfront, with a marked increase in the efficiency of the work performed. Although the men were new to the work, some classes of cargo were handled at the outset more expeditiously by the volunteers than by the federation men, but other cargo, such as frozen meat, was not handled quite up to the previous rate. The volunteers, however, quickly became accustomed to their work, and soon there was an improvement in all classes of cargo. It is considered that the increased efficiency is equal to 30 per cent, on the average. This has had the effect of reducing the cost of handling the cargo and of making it possible for the ships to get to sea quicker, and run according to schedule. There has not been the slightest industrial trouble on the waterfront, nor even a hint at a. stoppage of work. Contrast such a state of affairs with the conditions which existed previously when members of the federation were not only harassing employers, but also holding up industry by squabbles among themselves. Each branch of the federation was a law unto itself, imposing its own domestic rules in defiance of the Arbitration Court, indulging in a policy of go-slow and declaring cargo and individuals black. As a matter of fact, in Cairns, the whole of the work of the port was, at one time, held up while the Dillon and the Brophy sections had a private fight for supremacy. </para>

                    GLASGOW.They have shown by their actions since these regulations have been promulgated that they are up to their old tactics again. But if we forgive the members of the federation, what are we going to do for the volunteers who came to the assistance of the country when the Waterside Workers Federation, not in isolated instances, but as a continuous policy, was doing all it could to harass the shipowners and merchants ? When federation men were employed, vigilance officers of the union interfered with the authority of those who were in charge of the work on the waterfront. There were continual hold-ups and sectional disputes, which delayed vessels. The smooth working and increased efficiency which have been evident during the past two and a half years have enabled the stevedoring contractors to reduce their stevedoring charges against the ship-owners. Pillaging has practically disappeared. In 1927 the losses due to pillaging were estimated at £4,572 6s. 10d., and those due to short landings, £5,541 2s., a total of £10,113 Ss. lOd. In 1930 the losses due to pillaging were estimated at £5S9 18s. 9d., and those due to short landings, £189 16s. 3d., a total of £779 15s., compared with £10,113 8s. lOd. only three years earlier. Admittedly the volume of cargo handled last year was not equal to that which was handled in 1927, but if the cargo was reduced by half, and the figures relating to pillaging and short landings were also reduced by half, there would still be a marked difference between the amount pillaged prior to the enactment of the Transport Workers Act and the amount pillaged since. The volunteers were an orderly lot, and well behaved. Drunkenness was practically non-existent among them, and they invariably turned up to work after allotment of jobs, which frequently did not happen when members of the federation had the work. There has been a better spirit prevailing between the employers and employees, and altogether the work has been done more efficiently. I have not the slightest hesitation in voting for the disallowance of these regulations, because by their disallowance work can be given to men who desire to work, and are willing to give a fair day's work for the reward they get. The transport of goods will be facilitated and work on the waterfront will proceed peacefully and continuously.

                    <para>.- I support the motion. In his concluding words <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline> made some reference to Tasmania. I have no desire to approach the subject solely from the viewpoint of the State which I assist in representing, but I think that it behoves me to review briefly the terrible conditions into which Tasmania was brought by industrial disturbances on the waterfront prior to the Transport Workers Act. Each year for six or seven years, just when the tourist traffic from the mainland was beginning, and from which the people of the State reasonably expected to receive an addition to their revenue, there was always a disturbance on the waterfront which completely isolated the State. The losses suffered by Tasmania were enormous. It is hard to compute them. Consequently, it is reasonable for me to assist the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> in his desire to disallow these regulations. Reference has been made to the manner in which they have been brought forward and put into effect. I cannot find words strong enough to express my disgust at the action of the Government in refraining from tabling these regulations before Parliament adjourned in December last, so that Parliament would have an opportunity to discuss them. That action, which was  inexcusable, was evidently inspired by a desire to put into operation regulations which were entirely opposed to the act under which they were framed, for a period at all events, until Parliament had an opportunity to re-assemble. I shall not labour that point any longer, but will refer to the terms of one of these regulations. It stipulates definitely that priority shall be given to those of such workers available for employment, engagement, or picking-up at those ports, who are members of the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia, an organization which is bound by an existing award of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration applicable to such employment : provided that nothing in this regulation shall operate to prevent the employment, engagement, or picking-up of returned soldiers or returned sailors, as defined in section 81a of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1914-30. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>The provisions of the regulations are very clear and explicit, and have been drafted specifically to exclude all non-unionists from work on the waterfront of Australia, with the exception of the returned soldiers and sailors mentioned. </para>
                <para>For the last two and a half years, during the operation of the Transport Workers Act there has been no disturbance on our waterfront. Trade and commerce between the States have been carried on without hindrance, and a condition of industrial peace and continuity of work has prevailed which was previously unknown. Often, when considering measures, we have conjectured as to how they would operate when they became law. Very frequently our hopes have been disappointed. But never has an act been placed upon our statute-book which has been so satisfactory in its application as the Transport Workers Act. To-day the supporters of the Government are urging us to vote against the motion for the disallowance of these regulations. If the motion were defeated, and the regulations became law, there would be a retrogression to the strife and bitterness that previously prevailed on the Australian waterfront. The significant factor is that if the regulations become law, no non-unionist  watersider  will have an opportunity to obtain employment. </para>
                <para>I listened to the speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline> very attentively. The honorable senator, who is honest in his opinions, believes that if a man is not a unionist he should receive no consideration from the Government or from the community generally. I know a good deal about the activities and ramifications of unionism in Australia, and I say, without fear of contradiction, that the Trades Hall in New South Wales, which State the honorable senator represents in this Senate, is guilty of greater persecution to the square inch of members of its unions than is any other State to the square foot. </para>

                        <para>- They do. I produced a journal in this chamber, and ' can do so again, which conclusively proves my contention. It bore the name of the "New South Wales Furnishing Worker ", and gleefully recorded the fact that a worker had been fined £10 for doing a job in If instead of 2 hours. Reference was made to his return to Melbourne, the' inference being, " Thank God, we have got rid of a man who is prepared to do a fair day's work." </para>

I know the spirit of the majority of the workers of Australia. I know that they are prepared to give a fair day's work for a fair day's pay. I know, too, that the principle of preference to unionists has been prostituted in Australia, that it has been used to prevent men from giving of their best to their employers. My warmth against the reintroduction of regulations such as this will, therefore, be understood. </para>

If, when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline> is retired from the representation of the people in this Senate, he can look back on as lengthy a term as I have served, he will have nothing to be ashamed of. While I represent the people I shall never be a party to the exclusion from work of any Australian who prefers to retain his freedom, and be a true Britisher in the best sense of the term, in preference to becoming a bond slave. As I have previously said the Commonwealth owes a very great debt to the volunteers, who have been instrumental in maintaining in operation our essential services. Those men undertook the work at great personal risk, and carried it out very successfully indeed. Are we at this juncture going to listen to suggestions that the men who rescued the nation from chaos shall be cast aside like a dirty rag; to assist the Government to hamstring the workers of Australia, and make then mere bond-slaves? No. I shall always stand strongly for granting opportunity and freedom to any mau provided! that he lives decently, as an honest worker, and is prepared to give of his best. </para>

                    <para>. - Quite a great deal might be said on this subject. Certainly some things have already been said that do not appear to be very relevant to the issue. I am not going to make any appeal to the Opposition to vote differently from the way which they have already determined upon. I know that such an appeal would be futile, and shall not waste any time in making it. </para>

                <para>Perhaps it is unnecessary for me to say that I am in favour of these regulations. I am hopeful that the Government will have sufficient backbone to continue to reenact them, and' that, as it has not at present the necessary numerical strength in this chamber, it will by other means effect the purpose of the regulations. It is my policy to get a thing one way, if I cannot get it by another. </para>
                <para>All previous speakers ignored the fact that the present social system seems to have ordained that some considerable number of men must be out of employment. There is, therefore, conflict between those who are unionists and those who choose to serve the interests of their employers. If we had a decent social system there would be sufficient work for all, and over-work for none. There would then be no conflict between unionists and " blacklegs ". Under the present system, class struggle is inevitable. Those workers who do not remain true to their own class must be boycotted; and to the best of our ability those of us who are unionists will boycott them. </para>
                <para>A great deal has been said about the waterside workers having flouted arbitration awards. I say, unhesitatingly, that the only way the workers have ever got anything approaching a decent deal from the Arbitration Court has been either by direct action or the threat of direct action. </para>

                        <para>- The shop assistants could go on strike if they had sufficient courage to do so. I repeat that no section of the working class has received anything like the same treatment from the court that would have been granted had it made a more determined stand. Time after time the coal-miners have broken awards of the court; when they could not get a fair deal in any other way they resorted to direct action. It will be a sorry day for the workers of Australia when they relinquish their right to strike as a protest against injustice. Those who talk about the liberty of the subject and similar bunkum must agree that that right strikes at the very essence of freedom. The only weapon which the worker has is his refusal to accept conditions which appear to him to be intolerable. </para>

I maintain that employees have as much right to restrict production by decreasing their output as any body of capitalists has to restrict the production of the commodities in which they deal.

                        <para>- That or any other union. It has been contended by honorable senators opposite that the union referred to in these regulations has acted tyrannically by forcing its members to restrict the output of their labour. Surely I am in order in pointing out that what has been denounced when done by the workers is habitually practised by employers ! . I do not blame the employers, because, under the chaotic system of capitalism, it is sometimes necessary to 2'estrict production in order to obtain a decent price for a commodity. Honorable senators cannot deny that that is frequently done. All I say is that, if the capitalists have that right, the workers should have it also. Anyhow, they will claim it whenever they get the chance. I remind honorable senators that the work performed by the waterside workers is arduous, and entails considerable risk. Surely they will not deny that those best fitted to perform work of that nature are amongst the staunchest members of the union! I also point out that these regulations do not deprive non-union returned soldiers of their preference. </para>

                        <para>- The conditions which unionists have gained by long years of agitation and struggle would be taken from them by honorable senators opposite if they had thb power to do so. They are out to destroy the trade union organization, and to reduce industry to the chaotic state which existed before trade unionism became a force in the land. I remind them that there has not been a man of any eminence in the public life of Great Britain, or any writer of repute in that country, during the last half century, who has not testified to the great value of unionism in promoting the material, moral and social welfare of those who embrace it. The motion before us is a deliberate attack on unionism in that it aims at preventing unionists from obtaining employment. Honorable senators who object to preference to unionists are well aware that where that principle does not operate, preference is always given to non-unionists in order to destroy unionism. A desire to destroy unionism underlies the mean action of honorable senators opposite in moving for the disallowance of these regulations. Wherever strong unionism exists we find more competent and skilful workers in industry , than where the workers are not organized. </para>

I challenge any honorable senator to debate with me on the public platform my action with regard to the Australian Workers Union. These frequent interjections are a contemptible way of trying to bring me into conflict with the Chair. </para>

                        <para>- I accept your suggestion, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> but it does not express adequately what I mean. I challenge any honorable senator opposite to prove that the interests of the community will be served by the disallowance of these regulations. I assert, on the other hand, that it is not only the right, but also the positive duty, of the Government to circumvent this reactionary Senate, if it can devise the means to do so. If the majority in this chamber is determined to disallow the regulations, the Government will be justified in using every effort to re-enact them and put members of this chamber to the trouble of using all the time-worn and mouldy arguments to support, another motion of disallowance. Although the waterside workers, individually, may have faults, I think that, on the whole, they deserve the admiration and esteem of the people of Australia for the manner in which they have built up their organization in the face of extraordinary difficulties. I do not suggest that unionists are a perfect body of men. Human nature is the same in all of us. I have known unionists to do things of which I did not approve, but whenever I had an opportunity I entered my strongest protest against them. For instance, I denounced their action in closing their books so as to secure for their members a monopoly of work offering on the waterfront. I am totally opposed to every form of monopoly. In the present difficult state of society we cannot expect any section of the people to reach the pinnacle of perfection ; but I have no hesitation in saying that, on the whole, the waterside workers deserve every credit for what they have done to raise the standard of the working classes in this country. Opposition to that organization is founded on class hatred. I may be told that, by my remarks this afternoon, I am encouraging class hatred in the community. I am doing nothing of the kind. </para>

                        <para>- There is a vital distinction between advocating a definite stand in the class struggle and preaching class hatred. Honorable senators opposite choose to ignore it. As long as men are employed, on the waterfront or anywhere else, efforts will be made by their employers to beat down their conditions to the lowest level possible. On the other hand, wherever they may be working, employees will do all they can to get the greatest possible return for the least labour. This is the essence of the class struggle which prevails everywhere. In saying this I am not preaching class hatred. I am merely directing attention to the duty which devolves upon all trade unionists to raise and maintain their status and standard of living in the community. </para>

                <para>With the object of augmenting the national revenue, a general increase in the rates of postage was introduced on the 4th August, 1930, and under the schedule of rates adopted, the postage on printed matter was increased from1d. per 4 oz. to1d. per 2 oz. The term " Printed Matter " covers printed papers, circulars, and catalogues, and, in addition, books, periodicals and newspapers which are not eligible for transmission at the lower rates of postage prescribed for matter of the third class, which comprises concessionary articles such as newspapers, periodicals- and books printed in Australia and registered at a general post office. While the increase in the rate of postage on printed matter did not affect the amount to be paid for the transmission of circulars and printed papers not exceeding 2 oz. in weight, the increase was considerable in regard to the heavier weighted articles, such as catalogues and books. Continued representations have been made to the Government by employer and employee organizations in the printing trade, and by firms and corporations issuing large quantities of advertising matter in the form of catalogues, &amp;c, that the increase in postage has very seriously affected the output of printed matter. In addition, strong protests against this increase in rates have been received from public and other libraries, correspondence schools, government and private, and from people engaged in the publication and distribution of books. </para>
                <para>While it is impracticable to say what proportion of the loss of postal traffic has arisen from the general depression, and what may be attributed to higher postal charges, the fact remains that in the last few months there has been a considerable reduction in the volume of postings of catalogues, price-lists, and books. It is known that many large business houses have adopted a form of advertising in newspapers which, in a measure, replaces the price catalogues formerly issued by them; also, that many of the firms which have continued the issue of catalogues have reduced the size of the publications so as to bring them within 2 oz. in weight, and thus avoid the payment of increased postage. </para>
                <para>Having regard to all the circumstances the Government has reached the conclusion that the additional revenue which may have been derived from the increase of rates of postage on printed matter is not sufficient to justify its retention, especially in view of its adverse influence on business activities, and has, therefore, decided to introduce this bill, which is designed to restore the previous rate of postage on printed matter. It is not proposed to make any change in other rates of postage, as the financial situation precludes such a step being taken at present. </para>
                <para>The decline in postal revenue is to some extent due to the higher rates imposed some months ago, and also to the depression which is affecting trade generally. This measure, which has been introduced with the object of removing some of the disadvantages which now exist will, I am sure, meet with the support of honorable senators. </para>

                    <para>. - The introduction of this bill justifies the action taken by some honorable senators when the measure which it is to amend was before the Senate some time ago. That measure increased the rates of postage on various kinds of mail matter. Some honorable members on this side of the chamber contended that the increased rates on catalogues then proposed would have a detrimental effect upon trade, and predicted that it would not be long before there would be a marked decline in postal revenue in consequence of the additional imposts. We strongly urged the Government to reconsider its decision with respect to business catalogues, but a deaf ear was turned to our requests. We are not gloating over what we may term a victory, but deplore the fact that the revenue has suffered in consequence of an unnecessary amendment of the law. I am glad to find that the old rates are to be restored. </para>

                    <para class="block">Honorable senators will remember that last year the excise duty on. spirit for the fortification of wine was increased by 5s. per proof gallon of spirit, and that amounts equal to the additional duty so received are to be paid monthly into the trust account established under the Wine Export Bounty Act to meet the payments of bounty. The excise duty imposed is 5s. per proof gallon on spirit, but the relevant provision in the act is worded " five shillings upon every gallon of spirit." It is obvious that every proof gallon of spirit is intended to be referred to, and it is considered desirable, therefore, to insert the word " proof " before the word "gallon." The other amendment proposed in the bill is also of a machinery nature. When concentrated must is used in the production of fortified wine, loss fortifying spirit is required to bring the wine to the required proof standard. Accordingly, the trust account is receiving a smaller amount than it should receive - the loss being an amount equal to the duty on the spirit not used when concentrated must is used. It is proposed to meet this position by the imposition of an excise duty on concentrated must, which has been done, and by allocating to the trust fund an amount equal to a proportion of the duty so paid. The proportion fixed in the bill, fiveelevenths, is approximately the same proportion as is payable to the trust fund in respect of the duty on fortifying spirit. As the principle that the bounty shall be paid from the excise duty has been approved by the Senate, I trust that the bill will have a speedy passage. </para>

During the course of his speech on 12th March, the Treasurer stated that in 1927 Australian Governments floated overseas eleven loans totalling £69,700,000. In 1928, five overseas loans were raised totalling £30,500,000, and in 1929, up to the time that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Earle</inline> Page went out of office, three overseas loans aggregating £25,400,000 wore floated by Australian  Governments. The Treasurer stated that it would thus be seen that in that period of a little under three years, Australian Governments, of which the right honorable member for Cowper was the chief financial adviser, floated overseas £125,600,000, an average of £6,600,000 every two months. It mattered little that £36,000,000 of that amount was conversion money, the remainder being new money for expenditure in Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Earle</inline> Page had spoken about the extravagance of the Labour Government and its reckless unwisdom in regard to finance, yet he was the financial guide to Australian Governments that raised over £125,000,000 in loans within three years, and, as a consequence, exhausted the London market for Australian borrowing. </para>

                        <para>- No. As a matter of fact I do not think a question of privilege is involved. With regard to the ruling I gave in the first instance, I hold that the question " that the House do now adjourn " must be put before discussion can ensue. The Leader of the Senate having moved that motion, without debate, and having sat down, debate may ensue which need not be relevant - this I look upon as an invitation to irrelevancy - and the Leader of the Senate has the right of reply to questions that have been raised during the discussion. But my reading of the Standing Orders is that the Minister may not engage' in any discussion in submitting the motion for the adjournment of the Senate. </para>
