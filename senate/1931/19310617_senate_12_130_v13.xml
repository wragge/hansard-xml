                    <para>- I rise to bring under notice a matter which I regard as affecting the privileges of honorable senators. I have this day received a communication, addressed to me personally, from a gentleman named William Usher, manufacturer of Bates salve, residing in Birrell-street, Norwood, South Australia. It is enclosed in an envelope of the House of Representatives, and presumably has been addressed within the precincts of this House. To me it seems highly improper that communications from persons not members of the Commonwealth Parliament should be forwarded to honorable senators in parliamentary envelopes, and, presumably, addressed by a typist or some one else within the House itself. I mention the matter so that there may be no repetition of it. </para>

It is well known that that address related to the action of the Government in continually disregarding the Senate's disallowance of transport workers' regulations by presenting again to  His Excellency  regulations being the same in substance and effect as those which the Senate had already disallowed. I think it advisable to bring before the Senate exactly what the Government has been doing in order to show that the advice which it has tendered to  His Excellency  the Governor-General disregards altogether the established practice in regard to ' regulations, and sets up a new practice.

                        <para>But with regard to the political desirability of certain regulations, there has arisen a serious difference of opinion between one branch of the legislature, namely, the House of Representatives, tacitly and constantly supporting the regulations as framed by the Executive, and the other branch of the legislature, namely, the Senate, expressly and constantly disapproving of these regulations. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">If that is the constitutional position neither House can disallow a regulation. The House of Representatives has not expressly condoned or supported the action of the Government in re-enacting these regulations. But while another place has not been invited to pass a resolution on the subject the Senate has, time after time, disallowed regulations similar in substance to those now before the Senate. Although the Acts Interpretation Act provides that either </para>
                    <para class="block">House may disallow regulations the Government has advised His Excellency the Governor-General that, if the Senate disallows regulations which are not also disallowed by the House of Representatives, the disallowance of the Senate is of no avail. I submit that that advice puts the Senate in an entirely wrong position, and one not contemplated by the Constitution. It is the inauguration of a practice which will seriously limit the power of this chamber in regard to regulations, and I for one will not remain silent while any government attempts to do that. Under the Constitution the Senate is the guardian of the States and is, in fact, the representative of the States. Because of- the extent to which this regulation-making power is capable of being taken, if the advice which this Government tendered His Excellency the Governor-General cannot be successfully challenged, the Senate clearly must occupy a position subordinate to that of the House of Representatives. In one important part of the legislative 'field the Senate will be absolutely impotent and entirely subordinate to another place. I emphasize that the delegation to the Executive of this regulation-making power expressly provides that either House may disallow regulations made under it. The Government, without any specific authority from the House of Representatives, tendered to His Excellency advice which was a negation of the Senate's power and was quite contrary to the spirit and intention of the Constitution.For that reason the Senate is quite justified in taking the first convenient opportunity to challenge it. Until this Government adopted this extraordinary course of action it was the invariable parliamentary practice, when either House disallowed a regulation, for the Executive, as the inferior authority exercising a delegated power in the legislative field, to accept the decision and bow to the will of Parliament.For the first time in our history the Government, in its advice to the Governor-General, has assumed an authority superior to that of the legislature in this branch of law-making for, after all, the making of regulations is something more than a mere executive act - it is the exercise of a law-making  power. This position was never contemplated by the framers of the Constitution and it is not endorsed by constitutional authorities. I enter my protest against the action of the Government. The majority of honorable senators will, I am sure, agree with me that the advice tendered recently to the Governor-General by the Government is a distinct blow at the prestige and power of the Senate and, if unchallenged, would place this branch of the legislature in a position subordinate, <inline font-style="italic">not</inline> only to another place, but also to the Executive with regard to its legislative power. </para>

                                <para>- I am aware of that. A motion has been moved protesting against the advice tendered by the Government to  His Excellency  the Governor-General relating to a certain address presented to  His Excellency  by the Senate, and the motion submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> is to ensure the tabling of certain regulations to-day instead of tomorrow, with a view to their disallowance. I fail to see the connexion between this motion relating to the document read by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> and his motion which, as I have stated, deals specifically with certain advice tendered by the Executive to  His Excellency.  The right honorable gentleman even omitted to insert the date of the resolution because he "might have been called upon to insert the date of the regulations to which he objects. The motion submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has nothing whatever to do with the address that was presented to the Governor-General. Under our party system either party in this chamber may meet before the Senate reassembles, and decide upon a certain course of action; but I appeal to honorable senators not to allow our constitutional rights, concerning which honorable gentlemen opposite appear to have so much regard, to be flouted to the extent intended by the motion submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie.</inline> Honorable senators on this side know why the Leader of the Opposition submitted his motion. The object is merely to afford an opportunity to some honorable senator to move that the document that has been read 'be laid on the table. I protest against the adoption of such a procedure, and sincerely hope that if honorable senators wish to discuss any regulation they will insist upon its being tabled in a proper manner. </para>

                            <para>. -  This practice of moving for the adjournment of the Senate appears to me to be quite wrong, and altogether unnecessary. We should remain here to-day until we have transacted the business that awaits our consideration. It would be purposeless to terminate the sitting at this stage. The proper procedure would be to withdraw the motion that has been moved by the right honorable the Leader of the  Opposition,  and to proceed with the business of the Senate. The right honorable gentleman has not advanced any reason why the business should be deferred until 10 o'clock to-morrow morning. His action is unintelligible. </para>

If that advice is sound, the position of the Legislature of this country is unprecedented. No amount of learning can guide us in this matter, consequently we must resort to first principles to determine the correctness or otherwise of that advice. Having regard to the fact referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> that this action of the Government impinges upon the powers of this branch of the Legislature, the advice that has been tendered to  His Excellency  should be examined very closely and pertinent observations should be made with respect to it.

                                <para>- I have endeavoured to point out that the advice tendered to  His Excellency  the Governor-General creates a precedent of the first importance. A set of circumstances has arisen which could not arise in any other legislature, but Berriedale Keith in his work on constitutional government shows that it is one that should be governed by constitutional practice rather than by positive law. The Senate, which is a component part of the legislature, has been given the power to disallow regulations. The only parallel is its power to reject a measure passed by the other House. But if the advice tendered by the Government to  His Excellency  the Governor-General be correct, the Senate's power in relation to regulations is more limited than that which it has in respect to substantive legislation, which, of course, is an anomaly. Furthermore, ,  His Excellency  has been advised that there is no contest between the Legislature and the Executive. It is true, giving to the word " legislature " its broadest meaning, there may be no contest between " both branches of the Legislature and the Executive," but when we find the power which is allowed to the Senate under the provisions of the Acts' Interpretation Act, is being challenged by the Executive there is certainly in existence a dispute between this part of the Legislature and the Executive. If the Senate had passed a resolution that no regulation or statutory rule of a certain character would meet with its approval during the present session, would the advisers of  His Excellency  the Governor-General be entitled to advise him that it was proper to re-enact a regulation in identical terms? Yet that is exactly the position. There may be no actual record in the journals of the Senate of any resolution having been agreed to by the Senate in certain specific terms; but, as pointed out by my leader, what has happened in this chamber is tantamount to the passing of such a resolution. All along, as we have a right to do, we have been expressing, by continuous disallowance, our objection to certain regulations. Surely that is tantamount to telling the Government not to continue issuing such regulations. Surely we are in no weaker position in that respect than if we had agreed to a resolution " That the Senate disapproves of regulations of this character being introduced during this session". Undoubtedly, the power of the Senate is being challenged by what the Government is doing. It is idle to say that we may accept regulations in identical terms with others previously disallowed, or that this is not a contest between both branches of the Legislature and the Executive. It may be that another place, by its silence, has given its tacit approval to these regulations. But that is not the point. A bill requires the approval of both branches of the legislature, but regulations may be disallowed by either House. The action of the Government! is unprecedented; it is contrary to the best constitutional practice, and the advice tendered to  His Excellency  the Governor-General is little short of a travesty on constitutional government. In the <inline font-style="italic">past no Government</inline> in this country has ever elected to ignore the expressed will of either branch of the legislature in respect to regulations, and it is practically a violation of the rights of the legislature, at any rate of this component part of the legislature, for the Executive to advise the Governor-General to permit a continuance of the practice it has  now  set up. The re-issue of these regulations from time to time is a direct challenge to the rights of this chamber. It is a little difficult to express in constitutional terms actually what contest there is between this branch of this Legislature and the Executive. There is nothing parallel to it under any other constitutional government, but putting the matter broadly, Parliament has never parted with its control over regulation-making except to the extent that  it  has vested it  in  the Executive. Beyond that, the Executive cannot and ought not  go;  "but the control which Parliament has never given up  is  being constantly ignored by the present Government. Such is the charge laid by my leader, and it is a charge which I support to the full. </para>

As a matter of fact, similar regulations were contested before the High Court. The Attorney-General, whom the Governor-General names specifically in his answer to the petition of the Senate, has been charged with giving erroneous advice merely to provide a means of tabling regulations which will subsequently be disallowed. If honorable senators opposite possess any sense of fairness this motion will be withdrawn. Honorable senators opposite are challenging the advice given by the honorable the Attorney-General to  His Excellency  the Governor-General. </para>

                                <para>-What is the real issue? I understand that it is that the advice given by the Attorney-General misled the Governor-General. Prior to his occupancy of his present high office, the Governor-General occupied on the High Court Bench a most dignified position. He has made a name for himself as one of the most eminent jurists Australia has ever produced. "Whether the decision reached was qua Governor-General or qua lawyer does not matter. He said that the advice of the Attorney-General as tendered to him was correct. He did not say he was forced to follow it. He said definitely "my consideration of the relevant legislation and judicial decisions has led me to the belief that the advice of my legal adviser the honorable the Attorney-General is correct ". That cannot be repeated too often. Can any honorable senator opposite arrive at any other conclusion than that reached by the Governor-General, which was that unless and until disallowed by either House of Parliament the regulations would be in force, and would have the force of law. The petition of the Senate asked the Governor-General to refuse to sign regulations until he, sitting, so to speak, as a High Court judge, decided whether  the regulations were in substance similar to regulations previously disallowed by the Senate. I cannot imagine anything more chaotic than to place the Governor-General in the position of coming to a decision as to whether every executive or legislative act is or is not in conflict with something already disallowed by the Senate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir HalColebatch</inline> proposes to move for the introduction of a bill to amend the Rules Publication Act. Has the Governor-General to enter the field of political controversy, and to decide whether that measure is in conflict with something already decided by the Senate? </para>

I am not concerned with the framing, but with the subject-matter of the motion, which in effect asks the Senate to condemn the Government for the advice given by the Government to the Governor-General. The petition requested the Governor-General to do something which he could not do. </para>

                    who secured the adjournment of the debate on this measure, does not desire to exercise his right to speak, I wish to state that, having read the bill, I am still somewhat in the dark as to its effect. I understand that the Government's intention is to safeguard to persons who were employed by the North Australia Commission their existing and accruing rights, which have not been safeguarded in other legislation. Provision was made in sections 13 and 14 of the North Australia Act for the retention of the rights of officers of the public, railways, or other services of the Commonwealth, or of the Territory, or of a State, who were appointed as commissioners or as officers under that act. It was intended that at the termination of their appointments, other than for misconduct, such persons should be re-appointed to positions equivalent to those which they held immediately prior to such appointments. That intention was clearly stated by the then Minister for Home and Territories,

The appointment of an officer to this commission will be on " all fours " with the appointment of an officer to the Canberra commission. He does not resign from the Public Service. When his work with the commission is completed,, he goes back to the Public Service to the position he left. </para>

                <para class="block">It was, however, subsequently discovered that sections 13 and 14 of the 'act mentioned were faulty in that they did not give effect to the Government's intention. In the Officers' Eights Declaration Act of 1928 an attempt was made to rectify that anomaly. In moving the second reading of that measure, on -the 14th of June, 1928, the then Attorney-General stated <inline font-style="italic">inter alia -</inline></para>

                    <para>This 'is a bill relating to the rights of officers in the Public Service who arc transferred to the service of some Commonwealth' authority. Many acts of Parliament provide that, when members of the Public Service are transferred to the service of a Commonwealth authority, they shall preserve their existing and accrued rights. The precise meaning of these terms has not yet been denned. In the schedule to the bill there is a list of some ten statutes, all of which provide that the existing and accrued rights of officers shall be preserved. It is desirable that the position should be made clear in this respect. </para>

                <para class="block">Although the sections of the North Australia Act which I have mentioned were definitely included in the schedule to the Officers' Rights Declaration Act, it was subsequently found that, through an oversight, the last-mentioned act applied only to officers of the Commonwealth Public Service, and overlooked officers of the other services. A promise was then given that an amendment would be made to amend the Officers' Rights Declaration Act; but, before that promise could be fulfilled, there was a change of government. Nothing further has been done in the matter. I should like the Minister, when replying, to say whether the bill before us does definitely clear up that position, and also whether it gives effect to the undoubted promises that were made when the other bills mentioned were introduced. Clause 4 certainly seems indefinite. It reads - </para>

In looking through those names I find that of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hobler,</inline> a member of the commission who has rights only in respect of leave and superannuation. I take it that the bill preserves those rights to him.

                        <para>- He was appointed to the commission, not transferred from a State Service. My recollection is not clear whether, at the time of his appointment to the North Australia Commission, he was a member of the Queensland Public Service or of the Western Australian Service; I know that he had service in 'both States. I assume that he carried with him certain rights as to leave and other matters. I am desirous of ensuring that equal justice shall be done to these officers. Governments have blundered in these matters in the past ; the late Government blundered in that certain things which it intended to do were not done. Already we have had three bills presented to Parliament with the object of meting out justice to these officers. This is the fourth such measure. I want to be certain that, in this instance, we are doing what we have all along intended should be done. </para>

                    PEARCE Clause 4 does not seem sufficiently definite. I want to ensure to these officers their rights, not only while they are in employment, but also on the termination of their employment.

                        <para>. - I am quite in sympathy with the object sought to be achieved by the Leader of the Opposition. Indeed, the object of the bill is to remedy mistakes in various other measures whereby the rights of certain officers were not sufficiently safeguarded. Only five men are concerned. I understand two of them are going out of the Service; one with certain accrued rights and the other without any such rights. The rights of officers who continue in the Service are fully safeguarded in this measure. </para>
