                    <para>The principal result of the International Wheat Conference will be the establishment of a secretariat, representing all wheat-exporting countries, to continue exploration of world problems. </para>
                    <para>The conference found that the existing difficulties were due to the general world trade slump. The possibility that some countries are producing more wheat than can be absorbed will be discussed at another conference later, when further problems may be dealt with. </para>
                    <para>On the conclusion of the conference this afternoon, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. F.</inline> L. McDougall, the Australian representative, stated that the Australian delegates, in common with the Canadian, European, and Argentine representatives, were disappointed that no more definite plans had been made for a concerted effort to improve marketing, owing to the United States having refused to adhere to recommendations for the regulation of exports. " However, we feel that considerable progress was made in getting the United States and the Soviet to agree to an organization for constant consultation," <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McDougall</inline> added, "As a result, an improved situation may be forthcoming." </para>
                    <para>The Canadian High Commissioner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ferguson, chairman of the conference)</inline> said that a week was not sufficient in which to deal with the problems facing the conference. He hoped that further conferences would be held from time to time, in order to develop international co-operation, and prevent undue oscillation and uncertainty in trading conditions. </para>
                    <para>A communique summing up the results of the conference attributes the difficulties of the situation to the world-wide depression. "More wheat is being produced that can be profitably sold in the absence of adequate information regarding movements and requirements, and the existing uncertainty of the market," the communique says. " The conference believes that an understanding of these matters would substantially solve the problem. The reduction of crops, where possible, should be undertaken, and all avenues for the greater use of wheat as food and for other purposes should be exploited. Current information regarding supply and demand movements should be assembled for the purpose of orderly marketing. </para>
                    <para class="block">The conference accordingly decided to establish a committee comprising each wheat-exporting country to submit to the various governments proposals, under the supervision of the conference, for a clearing house to receive information regarding unloading, the areas sown, and crop prospects. The standing committee will develop contracts and draft an agenda  for further meetings in London." </para>
                    <para class="block">When a full report has been received from the Australian representatives it will be given publicity, and the recommendations of the conference will be considered by the Government. </para>

                <para>SenatorKNEEBONE (South Australia) [3.14]. - I cannot allow this motion for the disallowance of regulations gazetted under the Transport Workers Act to pass without a protest on behalf of the State which I assist to represent in this chamber. It seems to me that the intention of the right honorable the Leader of the Opposition. <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> is, firstly, to defend the constitutional rights of the Senate and of Parliament, and, secondly, to ensure to a section of the community the continued protection promised it by a preceding Government. As to the constitutional aspect of the question at issue, I should hesitate to offer an opinion except to say that, as a layman, it seems to me that, if authority is given in legislation to the Executive to issue regulations, and if authority is also given to the Senate to disallow such regulations, no wrong has been done to this branch of the legislature. I have followed with interest the discussion in this chamber, and I am not convinced that the Executive is prevented from gazetting regulations substantially the same as regulations previously disallowed. Nevertheless, I believe that some legislative action should be taken to overcome this farcical proceeding of the Senate meeting only to disallow regulations that are gazetted by the Executive. </para>

                        <para>- Of the several remedies that might be suggested, the one which appeals to me is an amendment of the Transport "Workers Act to limit the number of regulations to be issued under that statute, or, alternatively, an amendment of the Acts Interpretation Act to preclude the repeated gazettal of regulations which are substantially the same as regulations previously disallowed. We appear to be getting into a state of confusion because the Executive and the Senate are at cross purposes. On the industrial side it has been explained that the Transport Workers Act was passed for the purpose of meeting a certain situation that arose during an industrial crisis. The Government which introduced that legislation gave an undertaking to the volunteer workers, as they were called, that protection would be given to them in the future. That Government is not in office to-day. A little over eighteen months ago it was displaced by a Labour Government after an appeal to the people, who refused to endorse the promise given by the previous Administration. I, therefore, contend that Parliament is no longer under an obligation to ensure to volunteer workers continuity in employment on the waterfront or protection from victimization. The Transport Workers Act' was emergency legislation. I gather, from my study of the debates, that it was passed through both branches of the legislature in record time for the purpose of ensuring peace in one of the most important industrial activities in the Commonwealth. The right honorable the Leader of the Opposition, when, speaking yesterday to the motion for the adjournment of the Senate, referred to certain views expressed at the conference of the Australasian Council of Trade Unions in Sydney some months ago, and also gave the Senate a somewhat garbled account of the proceedings of the Labour party caucus. I attended the Australasian Council of Trade Unions' conference as one of its vice-presidents - a position which I esteem it an honour to occupy - and I can assure honorable senators that it is not fair to the industrial movement of Australia to say that the Government of the day was compelled to pass the Transport Workers Act as an emergency measure. It was passed ostensibly to deal with an abnormal condition in the industrial history of the Commonwealth, for which I contend the working classes were not entirely responsible. The Leader of the Opposition also said that the action of this Government, in repeatedly gazetting fresh regulations, only to have them disallowed by the Senate, was suggestive of a condition of affairs that obtained in Great Britain under the Stuarts' regime. I remind him that the Government of which he was a member was responsible for the legislation under which these regulations are gazetted, and that, therefore, he must accept some share of responsibility for the unexpected developments that have taken place. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> suggested yesterday that these regulations might, later, have a boomerang effect. The honorable senator, apparently, is resentful because legislation to which he and other honorable senators opposite attached so much importance, is now being administered by a Labour Government to give effect to its industrial policy. The Prime Minister at the time <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce),</inline> submitting the Transport Workers Bill to another place, said - </para>

                            <para>- A s soon as a point is suggested, honorable senators opposite speak with half-a-dozen different voices concerning it. My view of the position is that the Government of the day should table the regulations within the stipulated time, when they would become the property of Parliament and could be dealt with. I believe that, unintentionally, we are proceeding along wrong lines in permitting these regulations to be disallowed when, if my view be correct, they have not properly been brought before Parliament. That is one point which should be cleared up. Unless it is, the problem that confronts us will not be solved; because, if the present regulations are disallowed, there apparently is nothing to prevent the Government from issuing a further set, following practically the same lines, to-morrow. </para>

                            <para>- That is a distinction without a difference. The honorable member for Batman went on to say that, in effect, Parliament was being asked to sign a blank cheque; that its rights and privileges were being abrogated, and that it was sought to give to the Government a secret concession to do what it liked when Parliament was not sitting. That sweeping authority, he contended, was not given under ordinary legislation. It seems to me that we have reached our present unhappy position because of this hasty legislation, which was introduced at a time of crisis by another Government, and administered by it until the people elected the present Government. </para>

Had another government been in power, I am confident that the Senate would not have disallowed its regulations. When this subject was under discussion yesterday certain honorable senators opposite said that the present industrial position on the waterfront was due to the action of the members of the Waterside Workers Federation, who had defied an award of the Arbitration Court. Although those honorable senators profess to be champions of arbitration they support the action recently taken to deprive hundreds of thousands of trade unionists of  the  benefits  of  arbitration. </para>

                <para>That Your Excellency will be pleased to refuse to approve, during the present session of Parliament, of any regulations presented to the Executive Council being the same in substance as regulations which the Senate, in the lawful exercise of its powers as defined by Parliament in the Acts Interpretation Act 1904-1930, has, in this session, already disallowed. </para>
                <para>We would respectfully point out to Your Excellency that, under the Constitution of the Commonwealth, the function of legislation is a function of the Parliament and not of the Executive, and that Parliament has delegated to the Executive a limited power of legislation, namely, the power to make regulations under an act of the Parliament provided such regulations are consistent with the act, but that Parliament has expressly reserved to either House the power to disallow such regulations. </para>
                <para>We would further point out that in regard to the power of legislation by the Parliament it is the practice of Parliament, as set out in May's <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Practice,</inline> Thirteenth Edition, pages 292 to 302, that- " It is a rule in both Houses, which is essential to the due performance of their duties, that no question or bill shall be offered that is substantially the same as one on which their judgment has already  been expressed in the current session." </para>

                <para>We submit, further, that it is inconsistent with the spirit and intention of the Constitution that the Executive should again present, for Your Excellency's assent and approval regulations the same in substance as those which the Senate has already disallowed in this session. </para>
                <para>We therefore humbly pray that Your Excellency, having regard to the respective powers of the legislature and of the Executive as conferred by the Commonwealth Constitution, will refuse to sanction further regulations, during this session, being the same in substance as those already disallowed. </para>

                        <para>- I rise to a point of order. I submit that the motion is out of order, for the reason that it is a violation of the Constitution, being an invasion by the legislature of the functions of the Executive to advise the Crown. A motion violating the Constitution cannot be in order. The Transport Workers Act empowers the Governor-General - and by the Acts Interpretation Act 1901, section 17f, that means the Governor-General in Council - to make regulations under the act. The making of the regulations is, therefore, an executive act. By section 61 of the Constitution the executive power of the Commonwealth is vested in the King, and is exercisable by the Governor-General as His Majesty's representative. Section 62 creates a Federal Executive Council, to advise the Governor-General in the government of the Commonwealth. It is unconstitutional for a branch of the legislature to assume the right to offer advice to His </para>

                <para class="block">Excellency as to the exercise of his executive functions. An invasion by the legislature of the functions of the Executive is as much a violation of the Constitution as is an invasion by the legislature, or the  Execlutive,  of the functions of the judiciary. If this motion is carried, there will be precedent for the Senate to set up a right to advise the Governor-General on. any or all matters of administration. Should it be urged that the interference of the Senate in this case is justified on the ground that it concerns regulations, which in one aspect may be regarded as a form of legislation, the answer is clear - such interference would not be justified even in a case of direct  legislation. An address by the Senate to  His Excellency,  praying him to disallow a bill passed by the Parliament, clearly would be unconstitutional. </para>

                        <para>- As to the claim by the Leader of the Senate that the substance of the address is out of order, there are two precedents which I can at once recall. The first is that of an address moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> on the 17th of June, 1914, concerning, if I remember rightly, the question of a double dissolution, wherein advice was undoubtedly tendered to the then Governor-General. Again, a few days later, the same gentleman, in circumstances very much akin to those which at present exist between the two Houses of Parliament, offered advice to the then Governor-General concerning a referendum for six bills to amend the Constitution. "We may rest assured that, if any remarks in this address are improperly made,  His Excellency  the Governor-General will at once call attention to them and refuse to give an answer. </para>

                            <para>- I was about to point out that there was ample precedent for the course proposed to be taken, but as you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> in your ruling have referred to them, I shall not again make mention of them. This address to  His Excellency  the Governor-General does not mention the Transport Workers Act. It deals with what we on this side regard as a serious invasion of the rights of Parliament by the present Government, which is without precedent since the inauguration of the Commonwealth. On many occasions the Senate has disallowed regulations; but there is no instance of those regulations having again been submitted in the same form. On the 29th May, 1914, I moved to disallow a regulation made under the Defence Act. The motion was strongly fought by the Government of the day. The division list shows that sixteen senators voted for my motion and eleven against it. That Government did not again bring in the same regulation. On the 4th November, 1910, and again on the 11th of that month, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger moved to disallow regulations under the Census Act. There were several divisions, the result being close in each instance, namely thirteen for and eleven against the disallowance of the first sub-section, and fourteen for and eleven against each of the three following sub-sections. Notwithstanding its defeat by so narrow a margin in each case, the Government of the day did not again bring in the regulation. </para>

                        PEARCE.On the 14th February, 1917,
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline>
                        successfully moved to disallow a regulation under the War Precautions Act.  His  motion was agreed to by seventeen votes to sixteen, a majority of only one. The regulation thereby disallowed was again brought in, but not in its original form. It was amended to conform with the views expressed by the majority of senators who voted against its disallowance. In other words, the Government of the day, even when charged with the responsibility of carrying on a war, had regard to the will of the Senate, and amended the regulation to conform with its decision. The present Government claims the right to legislate by regulation in a manner in which it can not, or will not, legislate by means of an Act of Parliament. In other words it declares : " We think that Parliament will not pass an act, and we are going to abuse our regulation making power to do by regulation what we cannot do by act of Parliament;" although in its policy-speech Labour dis- tinctly  promised the people that it would accomplish what it is now trying to accomplish by regulations, the repeal of the act.

An English King would have become nearly as despotic as a French Monarch. The statute would further have established a distinction between " laws " properly so called as being made by the legislature and " ordinances " having the force of law, though not in strictness laws as being rather decrees of the Executive power than acts of the legislature. </para>

Parliament gives the Executive the right to make regulations 'consistent with an act, but reserves to itself the right to disallow those regulations. If the Executive wrongfully uses the power conferred upon it; if it goes outside its delegated and limited right, the Senate's only redress is to present an address to  His Excellency  the Governor-General, unless it takes the extreme step of refusing to grant Supply in order to bring the Government to .an end. Parliament's right to address the Crown has .always been recognized in British history, and has many times been used when it has been deemed that the Executive was transgressing the rights of Parliament or exceeding its own power in respect to any limited authority delegated to it by Parliament.

But surely it does mean something. In my judgment, the Governor-General is part of the Parliament, and under our Constitution, Parrliament has the right to make addresses to the Crown. This Senate, therefore, is within its rights and is acting in a strictly constitutional manner in directing the attention of  His Excellency  the Governor-General to the Government's flagrant defiance of the Senate in the lawful exercise of its power to disallow certain regulations. The Executive, in promulgating fresh regulations, the samiin substance as regulations already disallowed, is assuming a power superior to that of Parliament. On these grounds 1 ask the Senate to agree to the motion for the presentation of this address to  His Excellency  the Governor-General.

                        <para>. -  I oppose the motion. Since it deals with a matter that is strictly constitutional I, like the right honorable the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> find that I must proceed carefully. In opposing the motion I remind the Senate, in the first place, that legislation is a function of Parliament. Parliament has, however, delegated to the Executive a limited power of legislation, and the Executive  is  exercising that limited power of legislation, strictly in accordance with the terms of the delegation. It is a rule of both Houses that no question or bill shall be offered that is substantially the same as one on which their judgment has already been expressed in the current session. The Government has not infringed that rule; It has not offered any question or bill to the senate. It is not inconsistent with the practice or privileges of Parliament that the Executive, in the making  of  regulations, should be free from a restriction  that is imposed on the legislature. The Executive, in. exercising its functions, has its own practice and privileges, and  it  is not bound by those which the legislature imposes on itself. It is the practice and privilege of the Executive, when at first it does not succeed, to try again. Were it otherwise, the story of Bruce and the spider would lose its point. The  Standing  Orders of the Senate  do not  govern the proceedings of the Executive Council. If the right honorable senator's argument applied to one standing order, it would apply to  all,  and the making of a regulation would require notice to the Executive Council of intention to introduce a regulation, a first  and  second reading in Executive Council, consideration  in  committee of the whole Council, adoption of the report of the committee, and a final third reading. The leisurely methods of Parliament  would  not be conducive to efficient administration. As  to  the impropriety of the Executive being free from a restriction which is imposed on the legislature, the restriction on the Senate, to which the Leader of the Opposition refers, is one which the </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">Senate imposes on itself by its own Standing Orders. If the Senate wishes to be free to have the same question or bill referred to it once a week, it has only to amend its Standing Orders to that effect. Does the right honorable gentleman suggest that the Executive, in the exercise of its functions, should consider itself bound in honour to observe all the restrictions and self-denying ordinances which the Senate may choose to impose on itself ? The suggestion seems to savour rather of the ancient rules of chivalry than of practical administration. It is argued that it is inconsistent with the spirit and intention of the Constitution that the Executive should again present regulations the same in substance as those already disallowed by the Senate. The right honorable senator is not well advised in referring to. the spirit and intention of the Constitution. It is not the spirit and intention of the Constitution that a single gesture by the Senate should,, for a whole session, paralyze the arm of the Executive. The petitioners pray that  His Excellency  "will refuse to sanction further regulations, during this session, being the same in substance as those already disallowed." The prayer is of an unusual nature. In the first place, the petitioners assume the functions of  His  Excellency's advisers - a function which, not only by <inline font-style="italic">Ike</inline> spirit and intention of the Constitution, but also by its letter, is entrusted to the Executive. In the next place, it offers advice, not upon a matter at present before  His  Excellency for decision, but upon one which may come before His Excellency in the future. Also, it asks His Excellency to tie his bands, on a matter of public policy, for the space of a whole session. It is stated in May's <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Practice,</inline> page 70, that the Commons, in addresses to the Crown, "-oftentimes, under Richard II., Henry IV., and Henry VI., did propound matters to the King which were not given them in charge to treat of." The motion, if carried, will be a more modern instance of a similar indiscretion by the Senate. </para>

                            <para>- Certainly not. It is intended as a serious contribution to the debate, and to supply reasons why, in the Government's opinion, the motion should be rejected. The proposal is an extraordinary and ridiculous one. It asks the Governor-General to take a stand against something which does not exist. I feel sure that His Excellency will be at a loss to understand just what the Senate wishes him to do. This chamber should not impose such an indignity upon him. I hope that the motion will be defeated. </para>

                        <para>. -  I am amazed at the line of reasoning followed by the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Barnes)</inline> in this matter, which he dismissed with an airy wave of the hand, suggesting that  His Excellency  the Governor-General, when the address was presented to him, would inquire whether it was intended as a joke. I can assure the honorable gentleman that it will not be regarded as a joke by  His Excellency,  nor is it so regarded by the Senate, or those who have studied the practice and procedure of constitutional government in the Commonwealth and the Motherland. Earlier in the day, the Leader of the Senate admitted the soft impeachment as to the advice which the Executive would tender to the Governor-General. When taking a point of order on the motion submitted by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> for. the disallowance of the latest regulations issued under the Transport Workers Act, he admitted that the regulations in question were, in substance, the same as the regulations previously disallowed. That is the point which is emphasized in the address. The Leader of the Opposition has, I think, demonstrated beyond all doubt the supremacy of Parliament over the Executive, and that only in so far as Parliament has parted with that power, has it lost control. Parliament has delegated to the Executive power to make regulations having the force of law, subject to certain conditions. Once a regulation has been disallowed, it cannot be re-enacted except under the conditions indicated by the Earl of Halsbury, whose views were cited- by the right honorable the Leader of the Opposition a few moments ago. The Executive Government of this country makes a regulation to-day ; it is disallowed to-morrow; and it immediately makes another, which, in the language of the Leader of the Government, is substantially the same. I put it, that apart altogether from the practice of Parlia-  ment, apart from the requirements of the Standing Orders, such a rejection having been made it renders any subsequent regulation utterly inoperative. I put the matter in that way for several reasons; but before embarking upon their recital, may I say that the case put up by the Minister is not a parallel one. This is government by executive act, which is entirely different from government by legislative act. The power of the Government is limited not only by the provisions of the Acts Interpretation Act, but also by the right of this and the other branch of the legislature to address  His Excellency  in regard to the exercise of that power. Is it to be assumed that, having granted this power to an executive government, that Government is thereby made a despot ? That is what was claimed in the days to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has referred. The Minister has argued that no piece of legislation is involved. This matter is outside the scope of such considerations. What is called in question is the limitation that is imposed upon the powers of the Executive Government. Can it be said that this Parliament, having given this power, has stripped itself for ever of any control over the exercise of it? According to the judgment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Starke, that would be the effect of the Executive bringing into force regulations similar to those that had been disallowed. If the Executive is right in what it is doing, it can absolutely transgress not only the principles of that legislation which limits its powers, but also the transcendent power of Parliament. The whole of its power to make regulations is derived from Parliament, and it can. function only within the four corners of the limitations that are imposed upon it by the Acts Interpretation Act. It is impossible for any executive government to defend such action. The power which it derives from its masters, the Parliament, can be exercised only in conformity with the terms of the statute under which it has been granted. It would be a travesty on constitutional government, as well as on the rights and privileges of Parliament, were the Government to be enabled, simply by resorting to the trick that has been practised in this case, to avoid the direct limitation that has been placed upon the power of the Executive. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Let us conjure up the position as it would exist under such circumstances. To-day a regulation would be made by the Executive Government; to-morrow or on the following day it would be disallowed by the Senate; and on the next day it would be brought up again and passed through the Executive Council. Is that the spirit which guided this Parliament when it passed the Acts Interpretation Act? The Government is establishing a position which, if persisted in, will strip the Executive of every vestige of its power. Parliament is not going to be deprived of its right to control regulations. By resorting to the device to which reference has been made, the Government could keep constantly in force a regulation that had been disallowed by one branch of the legislature. I do not think that, altogether apart from the more drastic remedy to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has referred, Parliament has stripped itself of any controlling right; and it still possesses the right to address  His Excellency  in regard to such questions, and thus cause a return to the spirit of the law as any reasonable human being would interpret it. </para>
                    <para>I draw the attention of the Senate to the following observations of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Starke : - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>But then it is said that a regulation can only be disallowed if a resolution be passed to that effect after notice of it has been given at any time within fifteen sitting days after the regulation had been laid before the Houses. The purpose of the provision, however, is to fix a period of time beyond which disallowance should not take place, not  to impose it as a condition on the power of disallowance. The opposite view would enable the regulation-making authority to delay the presentation of any regulation to Parliament, and thus keep it in force for fifteen days at least, and, if disallowed, then re-enact it and delay presenting it to Parliament for another fifteen days. By this method a regulation might be kept in perpetual operation, and, in fact, it seems to have been adopted in the present ease. On the 20th March, 1931, the Senate disallowed the regulations, 1930 Nos. 158 and 159, and on the same date the present regulation, 1931 No. 34 was made, having, as I think, substantially the same effect. This procedure was entirely subversive of the control of Parliament over regulations, which is the main object of section 10 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1904-30 to preserve. </para>

                            <para>- Unfortunately, he did not say anything. Surely, if the Government were not blinded by party prejudice, it would not seek to force this position upon Parliament ! It is fundamentally wrong. It is an attempt to take out of the hands of Parliament control over what, in ordinary circumstances, had Parliament not been so minded as to give to the Executive Government a certain limited amount of power, would require legislation. All this talk about bills and the proceedings in relation to bills has nothing whatever to do with this point, which is a constitutional point, and which concerns the rights and privileges of Parliament. It is not a question of procedure or of practice. The power of Parlialiament is well established. For centuries there have been efforts to subvert it, but those efforts have failed, to the undoing of their originators ; yet now, at the instigation of the present Government, a further attempt is being made to give to the Executive that power for which so many have reached in vain in the past - that control which Parliament alone possesses, control over the lawmaking machinery of this country. Certain power having been delegated, that delegated power can be exercised only so long as such exercise is strictly in accordance with the terms of the delegation as well as of the wishes of Parliament. </para>

                    <para>I assure the Minister that I am confident that His Excellency will not regard this as a joking matter. I do not know whether the Government so regards it. It is no joke to those who study the principles of constitutional government. </para>
                    <para class="block">I venture to think that, unless the Senate wants government to be brought to the level of a kindergarten, the only proper, dignified, and legal course open to it is to address  His Excellency  in the terms referred to in the motion moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> Only one question is involved, and that is the supremacy of Parliament. </para>
                    <para>SenatorRAE (New South Wales) [4.34] .  - It appears to me to be plain that the Opposition is raising more problems than it can settle by this proposalto petition the Governor-General. It has been stated by the  President  that petitions were presented under somewhat similar circumstances to the Governor-General in 1914. I point out, however, that the status of the Governor-General has been changed considerably since that date.  His Excellency,  like  His  Majesty, now acts more definitely on the advice of his Ministers than he did in 1914. It is not my purpose to discuss at length a question that is one for a legal man and not a layman to dogmatize upon; but it seems to me that the Opposition is attempting to create an extraordinary position. The Governor-General, we are told, is supposed to follow the advice of his Ministers. If the Governor-General can disregard the advice of his Ministers and act entirely upon his own initiative, then he can do what honorable senators opposite desire, without any notice from this chamber. If he cannot act on his own initiative it appears to me that he can act only on the advice of those who have the right to constitute themselves his advisers. Although the Executive is appointed and given certain powers under the Constitution, we are told that the Governor-General must disregard its advice and follow the direction of a set of self-elected political partisans. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator forgets that on this occasion the Executive has the full force of a majority of members of another place behind it, and, therefore, it is the representatives of the major portion of the Parliament of this country who are responsible for these regulations. Yet the minor portion is endeavouring to outwit the Executive, and to defy the power which is, undoubtedly, possessed by another branch of the legislature. The members of another place, having come much more recently from the people than the members of this chamber, with a direct mandate on the subject, have - in spite of the cobwebs of constitutionalism which have been brought before us - more right to decide this matter than a partisan body. </para>

                            <para>- I contend that the Governor-General cannot, of his own volition, assent to or dissent from any proposal submitted by the Executive. He must act on the advice of his Ministers. If he does not he cannot listen to the advice of others. He cannot have two sets of advisers. On a partisan vote in the . Senate His Excellency may be advised to act in one direction, and his legally constituted Executive may advise him to act in another. Whose advice must he follow? Obviously, as a constitutionalist he must follow the advice of the legally constituted Executive. </para>

Honorable senators opposite, assisted by those who climbed into power on the ladder of Labour adopt the most venomous and vicious tactics possible in order to accomplish their end. They are depending upon the support of renegade Labourites to carry out the dirty work which they will not do themselves. </para>
                    <para>I challenge honorable senators opposite to deal with this subject from the viewpoint of whether  His Excellency  is bound to follow the advice of the Executive or that of a self-appointed body of political partisans. It is regrettable that the present course has to be followed. Admittedly it is not advisable to continue issuing regulations which are immediately disallowed. I repeat that the major portion of the Parliament stands behind the Executive in the introduction of these regulations while the minor portion persists in disallowing them. The members of the major portion have been before the people more recently than have the members of this chamber, who have taken it upon themselves to thwart the will of another place. In these circumstances the Executive is compelled to adopt a practice which otherwise would not have been considered, but which in the circumstances is abundantly justified. </para>
                    <para>A great deal has been said by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> con cerning the alleged slight upon Parliament, and of the - to them - illegal and unjustifiable action of the Executive in persisting in proclaiming these regulations when it has not the power to introduce a similar legislative measure twice in the same session. The position with respect to regulations is entirely different from an act of Parliament. The object of regulations is to make more flexible the legislation under which they are framed. Consequently, a regulation which is quite inadvisable to-day, might be almost imperatively necessary to-morrow. </para>

                            <para>- The act is not framed to do what the regulations do. It must be clear to the honorable senator that regulations under an act are for the purpose of carrying out details which, if embodied in the act itself, would overburden the statute. Regulations fulfil, not a greater, but a different, function from that of an act of parliament. It is not so much a question of one being greater than the other as of each doing certain definite things. Inasmuch as regulations are specifically meant to meet changing conditions, it is at least sensible to provide that the government of the day shall be empowered to judge for itself as to when it should bring in regulations similar to, or different from, regulations which have previously been disallowed. It may be, for instance, that the position on the waterfront has changed completely since the disallowance of previous regulations, making necessary entirely different  regulations. Regulations eminently desirable to-day may be quite undesirable next week, and vice versa. For that reason, we must retain in the hands of the Executive the right to say whether regulations under an act of parliament shall be proclaimed. If, because of the reactionary nature of one section of the legislature, regulations are temporarily defeated, the government of the day, charged with the administration of the laws of the country, should have the right to say whether it is advisable to proclaim new regulations similar to those which have been disallowed. It is much more important that we should see that the people of this country are well governed than that we should concern ourselves with more or less obscure constitutional points. Personally, I am prepared to see the legislature skittled altogether if a better means of dealing with the affairs of the country can be found. Legislatures ought not to exist merely for their own selfglorification. They are, or should be, the means to an end. If they do not accomplish that end, we must get rid of them. Honorable senators opposite have endeavoured to raise to a degree of vast importance the question as to how far the powers of the Senate may, or may not, be limited by executive action. The people of this country are not greatly concerned with the powers or the prerogatives of the Senate; they are concerned with the way in which they are governed. Those honorable senators who just now raised the subject of arbitration, in order  to belittle my views on that subject, quite ignored the fact that arbitration presupposes the existence of organized bodies for the arbitration law to deal with. Arbitration pre-supposes that it is to the advantage of the community generally for the working class to be organized. For generations, every great public man - and by that I do not necessarily mean men connected with the Labour movement as ordinarily understood - have admitted that one of the greatest factors making for the growth of civilization, and the improvement of the people generally, has been trade unionism. Yet honorable senators opposite continue to make vicious and venomous attempts to cripple trade unionism in one of its most important functions. </para>

                    <para class="block">Inasmuch as our arbitration laws, which honorable senators opposite profess to reverence, cannot function excepting through organizations, arbitration implies that organized labour shall get preference in. employment over unorganized labour. I agree with SenatorColebatch that it is lamentable that there should be any need for dissension between unionists and non-unionists, because in a properly constituted society there ought to be work enough for all. However, owing to the rotten capitalistic system which honorable senators opposite support, unemployment exists. Indeed, unemployment is the very keystone of the capitalistic system. If there were no unemployment - if every man could get a new job as soon as he left his old one - the capitalistic system would crumble within a week. </para>

                    <para>I have raised one or two points which I submit demand a better answer than have so far been vouchsafed to them. I have asked what effect this petition can have? In my opinion, this motion amounts to so much beating of the air. I admit that it gives some publicity to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> and his followers, and may make some people believe that they are great constitutional authorities. I venture to suggest, however, that the right honorable gentleman, and those who now support him would, if it suited them,  break, not only the Constitution, but also the spirit of the Sermon on the Mount and the Lord's Prayer. They value constitutionality only when it serves their purpose. The points that I have raised are valid. The Opposition must show how the Governor-General can properly take any notice of a petition of this kind from advisers who are not recognized by law, and have no qualifications to act as advisers, who, indeed, are so imbued with partisanship that no Governor-General worth his salt could take notice of them. There is also the point as to whether the Governor-General is not bound to follow the advice tendered him by his Ministers. If he is so bound, then this motion is merely a waste of time. If, on the other hand,  His Excellency  may act of his own volition, I ask honorable senators opposite whether it is not a fact that the gentleman who now occupies the high and honorable position of Governor-General is renowned for his ability as a lawyer and his eminence as a judge. Having both a legal and a judicial training, and having attained a high reputation in each sphere, the Governor-General surely knows as much about these matters as do honorable senators opposite. It is, therefore, a piece of amazing impudence for the Opposition to try to bulldoze  His Excellency  into doing something concerning which he has the ability to judge for himself. Those who at one time profess to hold the office of Governor-General in reverential awe are prepared, when it suits their purpose, to drag it in the dirt. If the people of this country had the opportunity to express their opinions on such despicable conduct, they would endorse the views which I have expressed rather than those of the Opposition. </para>

                        <para>. - At least one portion of the remarks of the - honorable senator who has just resumed his seat made a special appeal to me. I refer to his request that you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> would forgive anything that he had done amiss, and would attribute it to his youthful innocence. I, myself, feel slightly oppressed by my youthful innocence as a member of the Senate, in attempting to throw any additional light upon the subject now before the House. As a matter of fact this question has been discussed incidentally in matters which have come before us during the last two or three sitting days, and although I am prepared to concede that it is almost impossible to say anything that is new in regard to it, I feel that we may gain something if we collate the arguments in favour of the view which has been so tersely, and yet so clearly, expressed by the right honorable the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce).</inline> It is well that we should consider carefully the proposal now before us. Although it is merely one that a petition shall be presented to  His Excellency  the Governor-General, the reasons for the submission of that petition go to the very root of the question. It is important that we should  consider why we are asked to agree to the presentation of a petition to  His  '  Excellency.  Might I digress for a moment to remind honorable senators, particularly those on the Government benches, that there is a vast difference between presenting a petition to  His Excellency  and tendering advice to him? It is the right of every person, and of every body of persons in the community, to approach respectfully the person of the King; and <inline font-style="italic">a fortiori</inline> it is the right of the Senate to approach the King's representative in Australia, so long as he is approached in a proper spirit. </para>

                    <para>The first consideration involved in the proposed petition is where the lawmaking power of the Commonwealth resides. On that point, the Constitution is clear beyond all doubt. In almost its first words the Constitution provides - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>The legislative power of the Commonwealth shall he vested in a Federal Parliament, which shall consist of the Queen, a Senate, and a House of Representatives, and which is hereinafter called "The Parliament" or "The  Parliament  of the Commonwealth ". </para>

                    <para class="block">This Parliament is in the position of every other Parliament, in that it has the right to delegate the powers which if possesses. One of the striking characteristics of modern legislation is the enormous growth of the law-making power by means of regulations. No less an authority than the Lord Chief Justice of England, in his book, entitled <inline font-style="italic">The New Despotism,</inline> deals with the importance, not to say the tyranny of the growing exercise of the power of governments to pass regulations. Our own Parliament, I may venture to say, affords a very striking instance of that tendency. If any honorable senator takes the trouble to compare the statutes passed in any given year with the regulations that have been promulgated in that year, he will find that the latter probably are ten times as many as the former. I can say of these regulations, speaking with some knowledge of the subject as a lawyer, that not one lawyer, however eminent, in Australia has the slightest acquaintance with one-tenth of what appears in them. The power to make regulations is usually contained in the statute itself. In every bill giving power to make regulations, there is usually a provision requiring the regulations to be laid before Parliament, and giving either House the right to disallow them. The Commonwealth Parliament has, however, taken a slightly different course. It has provided in a separate act that any regulation made by the Governor-General in Council shall within a certain time be laid before both Houses of Parliament, and that it may be disallowed by either branch of the legislature. But that is only in accordance, it will be seen, with the provision of the Constitution which says that the lawmaking power resides in the two Houses of Parliament and the Governor-General. It is quite true that neither this House nor any other takes any part in the discussion on the framing of a regulation, but the powers of both Houses are preserved by the provision that either House may disallow it when it has been promulgated. When the Leader of the Government in the Senate says that we are seeking as a logical consequence to provide that every regulation shall, in the long run, have to be read a first, second, and third time, I remind him that the elaborate precautions which are taken for the first, second, and third readings of bills in both Houses of Parliament are proof of how carefully we follow an age-long custom : that no legislation shall go upon the statute-book until it has been thoroughly considered by the representatives of the people. The purpose of the motion now before the Senate 'is to see first that the right of this chamber to veto any regulation, which it must be remembered is for all purposes a law, is preserved, and, secondly, to take care that no such regulation goes upon the statute-book of the country until it has been approved by the representatives of the people in both chambers of the legislature. I do not know whether the right of the Senate to veto any or every regulation that comes beforeit is called in question. To me, it seems as plain as possible, in this case, that the same regulations have come up time after time. That being so, it follows that the reasons which actuated the Senate in disallowing them on the first occasion must again operate, unless there is a differently constituted Senate when they come up a second time. </para>

                            <para>- I admit that, and if the representatives of the Government were able to show some change in circumstances which should induce honorable senators to alter their minds, I have not the slightest doubt they would do so ; they would not obstinately adhere to their former decision merely for the sake of adhering to it. But even if these are not the same regulations, but are new regulations, under the terms of the Acts Interpretation Act the Senate is entitled to disallow them. I am utterly unable to understand how the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin),</inline> of whom I desire to speak with nothing but respect, or the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan),</inline> of whom honorable senators will realize I speak with the same respect, can claim, as one can see by outside reports they have both claimed, that this Senate is doing otherwise than preserving the rights that are given to it by taking the step it has in connexion with the regulations that have recently been before the chamber. </para>

                    <para>I venture to put forward the view that honorable senators are preserving, not only the rights of this chamber, but also the rights of another place, and the rights of the people. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> that we are only entitled to respect, so long as we assert the rights of the Senate on behalf of the people. We are not here to assert rights on our own behalf as individuals. But let us imagine what might take place once it is established that the Executive of the day may, by reason of much asking, induce the Senate to allow to pass, against its better judgment, a regulation which it thinks should not be passed. The same thing may happen in another place. The Executive of the day might promulgate a regulation which may be rejected by what honorable senators supporting the Government are pleased to call a more representative chamber than this. If that should happen, are we to understand that merely by presenting a regulation a sufficient number of times an executive is entitled to have it passed? If so, the government of the country passes from the representatives of the people into the hands of the Executive, and, as has been so frequently pointed out, we are taken back to a very old fight - the fight of the people against the King or the King's Ministers, or any other persons except the lawfully elected representatives of the people. ' </para>
                    <para>The Leader of the Government in the Senate said that the Government has not infringed the rule which prevents legislation, once rejected, from being presented again during the same session. Actually it may not have done so, but when the regulations that have been disallowed by the Senate in the past are compared with those which have again been presented to it the only difference between them that can be found is in the collocation of the words. The effect of the new regulations is exactly the same as that of the old regulations. It is because of the concrete instances we have had before us that the motion which we are now asked to pass has been drafted in the way it has been by the Leader of the Opposition.- </para>

                        in his concluding remarks, made some reference to major and minor branches of the legislature. Apparently the Senate is to be classified as the minor branch. I point out that the Constitution makes no distinction between the two chambers. There is no question of one being the major or the other the minor house.

Again I remind the Senate that we are not ruled by the Government. The Senate, if it disagrees with a regulation which has been promulgated by the 'Government, has a perfect right to disallow it, not merely once, but as often as it is laid on the table. </para>

                            <para>- There is, of course, a suggestion of that. There is nothing more that I desire to say. Indeed I am inclined to apologize for having, in my earliest attempt to address the Senate, detained it so long. I may, however, say this, by way of apology, that, had I been as cool as I should have been in other surroundings, there are other arguments I might have put forward. In my humble opinion, for whatever it is worth, the views presented shortly and tersely in the address to  His Excellency  the Governor-General are perfectly sound on matters of law, and are views which the Senate is entitled to place respectfully before  His Excellency. </para>

                        <para>. -  I am at a loss to understand exactly what is required of  His Excellency  the Governor-General. When the Leader of the Oppo.sition moved for the disallowance of certain regulations, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President</inline> ruled  that the regulations in question were not substantially the same or similar to regulations disallowed some time ago. Yet the address proposed to be sent to  His Excellency  the Governor-General refers to regulations the same in substance as those which the Senate has already disallowed in this session, and asks that they shall not be assented to by  His Excellency.  There is only one object at the back of the minds of honorable senators, and that is to disallow certain waterside workers regulations. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has quoted Dicey as an authority of the meaning of the word " law ". According to the Commonwealth <inline font-style="italic">Law Reports,</inline> volume 19, page 629, the High Court considered the meaning of the word "law" as used in the Constitution. That court held that the legislation of the territory, which was made under the delegated power, just as regulations under the Transport Workers Act are made, was a law of the territory. I do not know if honorable senators opposite consider that regulations relating to the territory should be disallowed, but certainly it is competent for either House of the Parliament to express its opinion upon them. No one can doubt that the regulations under the Transport Workers Act have been submitted in a strictly constitutional manner to  His Excellency  the Governor-General by his advisers, and I submit that  His Excellency  has no alternative than to accept the advice according to the law. </para>

                            <para>- And I was suggesting that the presentation of an address would be a reflection upon the Governor-General, because it would imply that  His Excellency  should ignore the advice of his constitutional advisers. I do not complain of the Senate's disallowance of the regulations in question. It is strictly within its power to do that. But it is so much camouflage to suggest that the proposed address is not directly related to regulations which have been disallowed and re-enacted, because the Governor-General is especially invited not to assent to regulations the same in substance as those previously disallowed. In this matter the Senate, in my judgment, is exceeding its constitutional functions. I, therefore, hope that the motion will not be adopted. </para>

                            <para>- I venture to say that the Governor-General, being a sound constitutional lawyer, has already considered the legality or otherwise of the Government's action and is satisfied that it is acting within its rights. There is no need to advise the Governor-General upon that point. The purpose of the address is to make effective the disallowance by the Senate of regulations dealing with waterside workers; but it cannot be contended that the Government, in presenting these regulations to the Governor-General, is acting contrary to the Constitution. The right honorable the Leader of the Opposition, with his long ministerial experience, must know this. Nevertheless he threatened some time ago that, if the Government persisted in re-enacting regulations the same in substance as those previously disallowed, he and his supporters would take other action to prevent the administration from giving effect to its policy. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator knows very well that the making of these regulations is in keeping with the Government's policy. I understand fully the reason for the honorable senator's objection. He is feeling somewhat sore, because the power to make  regula- tions, which a previous government used for the protection of loyalists or volunteer workers, is now being used by this Government to give effect to its industrial policy which has the endorsement of the people. The proper course for the Opposition to take, if it objects to this regulation-making power being vested in the Executive, is to move for the introduction of legislation to prevent this or any other Government from having the power to make regulations. </para>

                    <para>.- When <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Gibson appeared before the Senate as a witness to supply information that honorable senators considered might be useful to them in determining their course of action towards the Commonwealth Bank Bill, I deemed it to be my duty, as a representative of Western Australia, to submit certain questions to him. Those questions were distinctly relevant to the bill to which I have referred, and it  was  entirely a matter for the discretion of the distinguished witness as to what replies he should make to them. But, as a consequence of my having submitted those questions in the proper performance of my duty to my constituents, I have been subjected to a series of unprovoked and untruthful attacks in. the public press of Australia by the Minister for Markets and Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parker Moloney).</inline> Last Monday, the first of these attacks appeared in a number of newspapers, and  a similar attack was made in the press of to-day. From the interstate newspapers that are coming to hand, it would appear that the first attack, at all events, was widely distributed throughout the Commonwealth ; so much so that I have been forced to the conclusion that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Parker</inline> Moloney has made use of the official publicity channels for the purpose of distributing it. As I do not possess the advantage of those official sources for the dissemination of my reply to him, I embrace this opportunity to secure its wide distribution. I am fortified in that decision by the knowledge that these attacks have arisen out of my performance of a duty in this chamber. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Parker</inline> Moloney's sudden and newfound interest in the wheat-growers, no doubt, betokens an early federal election. For nearly a year he has been absolutely apathetic towards their desperate financial plight, and during the whole of this period the members of the Country party, including myself, have been ceaseless in urging this Government to give them the full measure of assistance that has already been given by practically, every other wheat-growing nation to its wheatgrowers. This Government has parliamentary authority to pay 3s. per bushel f.o.b. to the wheat-growers on the whole of last season's crop. It has not paid them one penny, and it is the only Federal Government Australia has ever had, or ever could have, whose credit is so bad that it admits itself unable to find the small amount required for this purpose. This admission is made by a Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Theodore)</inline> whose policy " Brennan and Moloney concurred " in condemning a few short months ago. </para>

                <para>
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Parker</inline>
                    Moloney says that he had a promise from the Commonwealth Bank to pay 4s. per bushel for wheat under the Wheat Marketing Bill. If he had such a promise, it was his clear duty to the wheat-growers to remain in Australia and to see that the promise was carried into effect by the  bank. Instead of that, Parliament was hurriedly adjourned to enable
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Parker</inline>
                    Moloney, quite unnecessarily, to join the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General, and their retinues, on a delightful tour to Europe at the public expense. The Australian wheat-growers were forgotten, whilst
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Parker</inline>
                    Moloney went on to Canada on a mission that has produced no public results.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Parker</inline>
                    Moloney's clear duty as the responsible Minister was to remain at his highly-paid post in Australia, and to secure the fulfilment of the alleged promise, which he now, after nearly a year's indifference, parades.

                <para>
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Parker</inline>
                    Moloney is evidently very annoyed at
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline>
                    Gibson's answer to my question in. the Senate, in which
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Sir</inline>
                    Robert  specifically denied
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Parker</inline>
                    Moloney's reiterated statements as to the arrangements that had been made by the Federal Government with the Commonwealth Bank, covering the proposed 4s.- a bushel guarantee on wheat.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Parker</inline>
                    Moloney finds himself in the position of having put up a gigantic bluff by posing as the friend of the farmer. Now that his bluff has been called, he merely, becomes abusive.

                <para>There is within <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Parker</inline> Moloney's . power one simple method by which he can . effectually settle this controversy. There is nothing whatever to prevent his tabling in Parliament all the correspondence that has passed between himself, the Government and the bank, in regard to the proposed 4s. guarantee. The Senate has already called for the papers relating to the Ss. guarantee; but they have not been supplied. Until these papers are produced, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Gibson's reply must stand as revealing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Parker</inline> Moloney as the. arch-deceiver of the wheat-farmer? of Australia. </para>

                    <para>. - I am somewhat surprised thai any member of the Senate should take umbrage at having been given publicity throughout Australia by so eminent 8 member of the Government as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Parker</inline> Moloney. I should have no objection whatever to offer if all the members of the Opposition were to go round the country talking about me personally. 1 am reminded of the story of the old Scotch lady who, referring to her son, said " It does not matter what you say about him, hut keep talking about him ". The honorable senator has no need to feel either aggrieved or offended. </para>
