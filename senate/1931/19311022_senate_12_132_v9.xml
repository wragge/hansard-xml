                GEORGE PEARCE  (Western Australia)  [3.11]. -  I do not intend to oppose the motion; but I do not wish my acquiescence in it to be misunderstood. I have had an opportunity of reading this bill, as it was distributed to honorable senators  this  morning. It is a complicated measure, which deals in the most intricate manner with a very important subject. It does not appear to me to be the class of bill which should be rushed through the Senate without full consideration. Perhaps the Minister's explanatory speech may make clear to me things which are not clear at present; but I suggest that, after the Minister makes his second-reading speech, the Government should agree to adjourn the debate until a later hour this day, or until to-morrow, so that we may have an opportunity of studying the probable effect of certain obscure clauses. Very often honorable senators, before being asked to deal with measures, have the advantage of reading the
                <inline font-style="italic">Ilansard</inline>
                report of the speeches made on them in another chamber, but that is not the case in this instance, because the bill was only passed by the other House last night. I' have read abridged press reports of the discussion that occurred there, but I do not understand how it is proposed to make the measure effective. I shall not be prepared to continue the discussion immediately after the Minister concludes hiss second-reading speech.

                    <para class="block">I feel sure that honorable senators opposite will agree that the Government  has  left no stone unturned to give the farmers that assistance which it considers they rightly deserve; but many obstacles have been put in the way of its doing so. Through the rejection by the Senate last year of the Wheat Marketing Bill, our farmers were left in a desperate plight. Many of them were faced with ruin. A return recently prepared for the Attorney-. General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> showed that a large number of farmers have been compelled to file their schedules in the Bankruptcy Court. Many other farmers who are in bankrupt circumstances are being carried by their creditors in the hope that, with returning prosperity, they will be able to liquidate their obligations. Realizing the paramount need of granting assistance to the wheat-growers,the Government swallowed the rebuff administered by the Senate, and brought down <inline font-style="italic">lim</inline> Wheat Advances Bill. This measure wai passed through both Houses of Par  liament,  but the refusal of the Commonwealth Bank to provide the necessary advances rendered that scheme nugatory. The Government, however, was able to arrange with the bank to increase its advance on wheat from 2s. to 2s. 4d. per bushel f.o.b. The advance was made to voluntary pools on all unsold wheat in their hands, and those farmers who were participants in the voluntary pools profiled to the extent mentioned. </para>
                    <para>The Premiers Conference held in February, 1931, gave' consideration to ways and means of providing financial assistance for wheat-growers. The proposition considered was the raising of a loan of £6,000,000 to provide a bounty of 6d: a bushel on the 1930-31 wheat, crop, and, iu addition, to enable loans to be made to farmers in necessitous circumstances. However, it was subsequently decided that the time was inappropriate for an approach to the loan market. It was then proposed to grant the necessary relief in another manner, and the Fiduciary Notes Bill was introduced, with the concomitant Wheat Bill. The rejection by the Senate of the Fiduciary Notes Bill closed this avenue. </para>
                    <para>Meantime, the plight of the farmers was growing more and more desperate, and a further attempt was made, by means of the Wheat Marketing Bill, to give the assistance so urgently required. That measure was similar to the 1930 Wheat Marketing Bill, with the exception of the provision for a guaranteed price. Once again the Senate refused to approve of the assistance proposed to be given by the Government. </para>
                    <para>The matter was further considered' at the Premiers Conference held in August, 1931, and the conference endorsed a proposal for the payment of a bounty of 6d. per bushel for wheat produced in the 1931-32 season, provided that the bounty would not bring the f.o.b. price above 3s. per bushel. The matter was referred to the Commonwealth Bank and the trading banks with the object of arranging for the necessary finance, and the  chairman  of the Commonwealth Bank submitted a basis on which a bounty might be provided. This bill has been drafted along those lines. The banks could not see their way clear to include in the scheme the wheat harvested last season, and the bounty is, therefore, limited to the 1931-32 season. </para>
                    <para>The main feature of this proposal 'is that the bounty will be payable to the grower of wheat upon its delivery to a licensed purchaser - that is, a wheat merchant, flour miller, wheat pool, or other prescribed co-operative organization. On. the delivery of the wheat to the licensed purchaser, the wheat-grower will receive a certificate which will indicate the quantity of wheat purchased, and the f.o.b. equivalent of the price paid per bushel. Upon presentation .of the certificate at the Commonwealth Bank, the wheat-grower will receive payment of bounty. As there is no straight-out price fixed in the case of wheat pools, the certificate will bear an estimated price, and provision is made for an adjustment, if necessary, when the price can later be ascertained. </para>
                    <para>The purpose of requiring purchasers of wheat, to be licensed is that control may be exercised to secure compliance with the terms of the act. With regard to wheat sold for consumption in Australia, the bill provides that the licensee shall, pay to the Commonwealth Bank as agent for the Government an amount equal to the bounty . paid, but not exceeding 6d. per bushel. In this respect a separate Wheat Charges Act is necessary to give power to collect the charge not exceeding 6d'. per bushel to which. I have ' just referred. This measure provides for a charge hot exceeding 6d. per bushel to be paid by persons or organizations licensed under the Wheat Bounty Act 1931 on all wheat, in respect of which such licensees have been issued a certificate under that act, and which such licensees (a) have on or before the 31st October, 1932, sold for consumption within Australia; <inline font-style="italic">(h)</inline> have on or before that date used in the production of flour for consumption within Australia; or (c) have on hand on that date. </para>

                            <para>- It was my intention to refer to the repeal of that measure in committee. The Commonwealth Bank could not see its way clear to finance the scheme, and doubtless, as the farmers have commenced to feel that they have been humbugged by legislation, it is thought desirable to repeal the act.I submit that the farmers have no occasion to blame the Government in this connexion as it has endeavoured to place on the statute-book legislation to assist them. Although they may have thought it was only so much eye-wash, in reality, the Government left no stone unturned to provide some form of relief to the wheatgrowers, and the Senate has to take its share of responsibility for the rejection of' certain measures introduced by the Government, to assist the wheat-growers. It has been found impracticable to bring the Wheat Advances Act of 1930 into operation, and it is just as well to tell the farmers that the Commonwealth Bank has refused to make the money available. If we do so, they will know exactly where they stand. We should at least tell them that it is impossible to give effect to the provisions of that measure, and that the only alternative is not to dabble further with this question which, I contend, has already been dabbled with too much. Had the Senate agreed to the Government's first proposal, which provided for the payment of a guaranteed price of 4s. per bushel, something could have done, because at that time the Commonwealth Bank was prepared to make an advance. As time went on, the price of wheat commenced to fall, and eventually dropped from 4s. or 5s. to1s. 6d. per bushel. No one could then foresee that such a drop in the price of wheat would occur just as it could not be foreseen two or three weeks ago that the price would increase to the extent it has. The farmers wish to know where they stand. We must be honest in matters of this kind. The Government, having been refused financial assistance by the Commonwealth Bank in respect of the Wheat Advances Act of 1930, is now endeavouring to place on the statute-book a measure which will be of practical assistance to the wheat-growers. </para>

                    <para class="block">Committee or other similar parliamentary bodies. But having had some experience with bodies similar to the Public Works Committee in the State political sphere, and having been associated with the Commonwealth Public Accounts Committee, I feel justified in defending them from the attacks of some honorable senators. I do so, not from any personal motive, or from a belief that I may some day become a member of the Public Works Committee; but because I believe that such committees are an essential part of the parliamentary machine, and should be functioning in order to exercise some control over public moneys, whether derived from revenue or from loan funds. I listened with considerable attention to the explanation of the activities of this committee that was furnished to the Senate by the Minister who moved the motion for the second reading of the bill, and to the very lucid explanation of its work that was given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson</inline> - who, I understand, has been for some time associated with it, and can speak from experience. </para>
                    <para>Honorable senators ought to be guided by the experience of, not only the Commonwealth, but also the States. For a number of years there has been in South Australia a body known as the Parliamentary Railways Standing Committee. It was instituted about the year 1912, for the purpose of investigating proposals for the construction of new lines of railway, and reporting to Parliament as to the advisability or otherwise of proceeding with them. Under the provisions of the act which constituted that committee, it was mandatory on the government of the day to refer to it any proposal for the construction of a new line of railway, the cost of which was estimated to exceed £25,000, and, if the report of the committee on the project was an adverse one, the government was precluded from going ahead with the work. I understand that similar legislation is in operation in almost every State in Australia. I became associated with this body in South Australia. In the course of our investigations, I and the other members of it learned that, as a result of the restraint that had been placed upon governments and parliaments, expenditure upon new railways that would have run into many millions of pounds had at different times been prevented. While I was  chairman  of this body, the government of the day was keenly desirous of opening up a new tract of country for the absorption of some of the migrants brought to Australia under the £34,000,000 migration agreement entered into by the Commonwealth Government with the Government  of  Great Britain. A proposal to construct a line that would have cost approximately £500,000, which had the support of officers who had carried out a certain amount  of  investigation, was referred to the committee. </para>

There were a number of practical men on the committee, and they refused to even conduct the inquiry until a proper investigation had been made into the likelihood of there being an adequate rainfall. An inspection of the locality revealed evidence of dry conditions, which the practical man could readily recognize, having studied the plants that grow in districts with a rainfall which makes possible the production of wheat, and those that are indigenous to territory which is suitable only for pastoral pursuits. Although good seasons had been experienced in this district for a number  of  years, it was ultimately proved that the opinion formed by the committee was the correct one, and that its prevention of the construction of this line was justified. </para>

                            <para>- I shall reply to the right honorable senator in due course. This district has since passed through one of the worst periods of drought in the history of white settlement, and, had the line been constructed and the unfortunate migrants placed on the land there, one of the greatest tragedies in the settlement of that State would have been witnessed. Through the foresight of this body, not only was the money which would have been wasted on the railway saved to the State, but the expenditure of the further huge sum that would have been involved in the placing and maintenance of the settlers on unsuitable land, was rendered unnecessary. To-day the Government of South Australia is seriously contemplating closing down a number of railways which were constructed us the result of parliamentary agitation and the desire of the Government of the day to please certain of its supporters and their constituents, because, not only are they not making any contribution towards the interest that has to be paid on the capital invested in them, but they are not even earning anything like working expenses. </para>

                    <para>The right honorable the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> has referred to the new Adelaide railway station. The only section of what subsequently became known as the South Australian railways rehabilitation scheme, which was the subject' of inquiry by the Kailways Standing Committee of South Australia, was a short section of gauge broadening between Brinkworth and Gladstone. That work was rendered necessary by other operations connected with the rehabilitation scheme. The balance of the expenditure, running into something like £11,500,000, was incurred on the authority of the Railways Commissioner, who acted under the powers that were vested in him by the Railways Commissioners Act. I venture to affirm that had these proposals for rehabilitation, which were virtually new works, been inquired into by the body to whom I have referred, many of the mistakes that were made would have been avoided, and a number of extravagances, such as that mentioned hy the right honorable senator, would not have been perpetrated. The continuously good work that was performed </para>
                    <para>I ry this committee gained recognition from succeeding governments, which converted it into what in reality was a Public Works Committee; under an authority which enabled works other than railway works to be referred to it; and the practice grew up of referring to it practically aU important public works. In 1927, the Parliament of the day altered the constitution and the procedure of the committee by converting it into a Public Works Committee, in which form it is functioning at the present time. I wish particularly to stress this aspect The conferring of wider powers and the conversion of this body' into a Public Works Committee were effected as late as 1927. With the experience of fifteen years to guide it, the Parliament of South Australia had such confident in this method of investigating proposal for the construction of new works, that it not only accepted the principle in i*M entirety, <inline font-style="italic">but</inline> also gave to the members oi the committee a status which the members of the Commonwealth Public Works Committee do not posses to-day; that is to say, instead of making provision for the payment of fees or allowances, provision was made for each member of the committee to receive a specified salary per annum for the service that he thus rendered to the State. Although the great need for economy has been forced upon the people of South Australia, the work of the Public Works Committee during these years of depression has been so successful that it has not even been suggested by any one in the State that the committee should be either abolished or suspended, as was suggested by certain honorable senators during the course of the debate, on the Committee of Public Accounts Bill should be the fate of the standing committees of this Parliament. My experience in a State Parliament, and in this Parliament, has led me to the conclusion that Parliament is too unwieldy a body to deal effectively with many of the questions it is called upon to control, or with many of the problems it is asked to solve in the interests of the people; and I am firmly convinced that the committee system is a necessary adjunct to the efficient functioning of any legislature, particularly in respect of proposals for the construction of new works. I cast no reflection on the officers of th/j Commonwealth Department which may be associated with proposals for the construction of new works in various parts of Australia, when I say that, unless there is some body to which Parliament Can look to accept responsibility for the proper investigation of those proposals, there will be demands of individual members on the Government, of the day, which the Government will not be able to resist. Very often, in order to increase their numbers, members from one State in which some work is contemplated will seek the  co-operation of members representing other States on the principle that those members will support them in the hope that in three months' time they in turn will be supported in pressing for the construction of a ' work in perhaps another State. </para>

                            <para>- The demand upon the Government of the day from individual members makes its influence felt on the officers of the departments, and, conscientious men though they may be, they are not able to withstand the apparent will of the Government of the day. The honorable senator was right in calling it log-rolling, of which we have had abundant instances in the past; but I think it can be -said that, since the appointment of parliamentary standing committees, we have not had so many instances of it as characterized government activities before they were appointed. ft has been suggested, tentatively, of course, that because wc cannot secure loan money, the Public Works Committee should be suspended for a period. There may be much to commend that suggestion, but if it is looked at from every aspect, I am sure it will . be found that there is a prospect that within the twelve months, for which period it has been suggested the committee should be SUSpended, the Commonwealth will be able o go on with certain urgent works that ought to be proceeded with at the earliest possible moment in order to afford some relief to that unfortunate class of people who for years have followed the occupation of navvies on public works in different States. The earliest opportunity should be taken by this Parliament to proceed with any public works which can be justified in order to minimize, to some extent at any rate, the condition of that most: worthy class of citizens. But if ii should be decided to suspend the activities of the Public Works Committee, the authority of this Parliament and the Government would be nullified to the extent that it would, for the period of suspension, not be able to engage upon the construction of new works of any marni.ude. As a matter of fact, I believe that a sum of money has been made available from revenue for works purposes during the current financial year, and it may be found as time goes on that inquiries into the expenditure of this money are necessary. But if the Public Works Committee is suspended the inquiry cannot take place. What could be saved by a suspension ? The secretary of the committee would have to be retained in the Public Service in some other capacity. <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> understand that his valuable services have already been employed in one of the departments iu connexion with thiFederal Capital Territory. </para>

                            <para>- I am sure that, other opportunities will present themselves for the utilization of any of his spare time. It must be  remembered  thai the members of the committee draw allowances only for attending sittings of the committee. They cannot institute inquiries of their own volition. Any inquiries commenced by the Public Works Committee must be on specific references from the Government or from Parliament. I deny that there is any tendency on the part of the members of the committee to work simply for the sake of holding meetings. From experience I  know  that there is no profit in being associated with these inquiries. At most, a member of a committee derives only approximately sufficient to meet his out-of-pocket expenses in connexion with the work his called upon to do. But apart from that, I have sufficient confidence in  the  men  selected  by the respective branches of this legislature to know that no  charge of  the kind I have mentioned can be sustained against them. </para>

                    <para>I hope that the hostility which the Senate showed to the Public Accounts Committee will not be extended to the Public Works Committee. This bill is a measure of efficiency rather than a measure of economy. The Government has already effected in regard to the Public Works Committee an economy much greater than has been effected in regard to any other activity of this Parliament. But in order to promote efficiency and standardize both standing committees the Government has suggested that the membership should be reduced to seven in both cases.  In the case of the Public Accounts Committee the Senate has further reduced the number to five, but I hope that, after mature consideration of the arguments advanced in this chamber by those who have had experience on these committees, the proposal of the Government that the Public Works Committee shall be reduced from niue to seven will be accepted, and that in all other regards the committee will be allowed to function without any further interference on the part of this chamber. </para>

                        in the discussion on the bill relating to the Public Accounts Committee. The honorable senator had given the subject-matter of his address very careful attention, and furnished much interesting and useful information about the work of that body. I . also congratulate

                        O'Halloran  on his defence of the Public Works Committee, of which he is a member. Because of his long association with the State Parliament of South Australia, the honorable senator has an intimate knowledge of the working of parliamentary committees, and naturally he wishes to  st.e  them continued. But, to-day, there is n definite call for economy. The rehab ilitation scheme, which has the endorsement of all Governments, State and Federal, involves drastic economies in every direction. I believe that the efficiency of the Public Works Committee would not bc impaired if its numbers were reduced, and when the measure is in committee, it is my intention to submit an amendment on lines similar to that made to the Public Accounts Committee Bill. All governments, not only in Australia, but in other countries, are committed to the economies. In Western Australia, recently, the State Government closed down on contemplated expenditure for additions to the wharf at Busselton, and, as the Commonwealth Government has no money available for public works, this committee will have nothing -to do for some time to come. I hope, therefore, that honorable senators will give me their support when 1 submit the amendment of which I have just given notice.

                        <para>.- It is rather encouraging, and perhaps it augurs well for the future of Australia, that the representatives in this chamber of the Beasley party are so anxious to ensure economies in governmental expenditure. I may, however, inform <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline> that, for all practical purposes, the Public Works Committee exists only on paper.

As honorable senators are aware, this committee functions only when works estimated to cost more than  £25,000  are submitted to it, for inquiry and report, and as no works are in hand, the committee is incurring no expenditure. Since its appointment, it has saved the taxpayers of Australia thousands of pounds on the various public works upon which it has reported. No one will suggest that works proposals prepared by departmental officials are always perfect. On  numerous  occasions, expert information obtained by the committee from sources outside the department, have resulted in substantial economies. </para>

                            <para>- I have no recollection of that particular work having come before the committee; but, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> has pointed out, the Navy Department is solely responsible for all expenditure on naval works. If a mistake was made in the matter referred to, the fault must lie with the Navy Department. The secretary of this committee is one of the most efficient officers in the Public Service. He is a man of long experience and marked ability, and has rendered very useful service in his present pOrntion, We should, I think, take a somewhat longer view of the work of this committee. Everybody hopes that Australia will soon emerge from the present, depression, and that the Government will be giving its attention to Commonwealth works schemes for the absorption of unemployed. I, therefore, consider that it would be wise, if the Government has in mind any particular projects, to submit them to the committee for inquiry and report, so that when our financial position improves, they may be put in hand without a moment's delay. An amendment of the bill in committee to reduce the number of members will not mean an economy, because, as I have stated, the committee is not now functioning. I think also that it would be a mistake to reduce the number to five, because, for various reasons, it is difficult always to ensure the attendance of all members at meetings, and if the personnel were reduced to the number stated, it might be difficult to obtain a quorum. 1 am just as anxious as any other honorable senator to see all possible economies effected, but no economy will be achieved through interfering unduly with this committee, because it is not costing anything at present. </para>

                        <para>. - An impression was created during the debate on the Public Accounts Committee Bill that the officers of the committee were not doing any work. The Leader of the .Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> made a personal explanation yesterday in regard to his statements in that connexion. It may also be thought that the officers of the Works Committee have nothing to do while the committee is not functioning. But I point out that the secretary of this committee, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Whiteford,</inline> is the  chairman  of the committee appointed to inquire into the milk supply of Canberra. </para>

If the honorable senator can advance sufficiently good reasons for the making of it, it will doubtless be made. The officers of these committees are not simply waiting about for something to turn up. Their services are fully employed in various ways. When officers of other departments are absent through sickness or other causes, the officers of these two committees are available for relief purposes. I hope that the Senate will pass this bill, and also that it will accept the proposal of the Government in regard to the membership of the committee. </para>

                        <para>. - I hope that the committee will not accept the amendment. My two years' experience on this committee has shown that it is, at times, extremely difficult to obtain a quorum. If the membership of the committee is reduced to five the difficulties in that respect will be very greatly increased. Such a limitation of the membership of the committee will undoubtedly mean that at times the committee will not be able to function. Even with a membership of nine, there have been times when, through sickness and other causes, the attendance of a quorum has been assured only with great difficulty. No economy will be effected by reducing the membership of the committee to five, because only those members of the committee who attend the meetings can draw fees. I realize the vital need for economy in these times ; but we shall delude ourselves if we think we are effecting an economy by further reducing the membership of this committee. Moreover, we shall make it difficult to apportion the membership fairly between the two Houses of Parliament and the different parties. If a membership of seven is agreed to, some latitude will be allowed. </para>

                        <para>.- I also hope that the committee will reject the amendment. I reiterate the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson</inline> that no economy will be effected by reducing the membership of the committee to five. "We must remember that the interests of efficiency deserve consideration. Economies are needed in these days, but so is efficiency. If the membership of the committee is reduced to five, the efficiency of the committee will be greatly endangered. I ask the honorable senators to accept the assurance of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson</inline> and myself on this point. It is extremely difficult at times, even under existing conditions, to obtain a quorum. Seeing that the committee will only function when Parliament asks it to do so, we shall not be running any risk of incurring great expenditure by accepting the clause as it stands. </para>

                        <para>.- A  day or two ago this con&gt;mittee indicated by an- unmistakeable vote that,' under " present conditions, a membership of five was sufficiently large for these committees. If there has been a difficulty in the past in securing a quorum, I suggest that it has been due to the fact that the wrong members have been appointed to the committee. Hitherto honorable senators have been willing to accept appointments to these committees, because they have realized that it would not always be necessary for them to be in attendance. I will go as far as to say that the attendances at the committee meetings have been more or less perfunctory. If honorable senators, or the members of another place, accept the duty of membership of these committees, they should do the work that is required of them. They should at least make arrangements to attend the meetings regularly. It is hard to believe that sickness has been an important factor in making it difficult to secure a quorum at the meetings of a committee the effective membership of which is 10; but if that is so, I suggest that the remedy is to appoint healthy members to the committee. There is a great similarity between the Public Accounts Committee and the Public Works Committee, and it would be absurd for us to say that, although five members are sufficient for the former, seven are necessary for the latter. When the financial situation eases somewhat, and there is a large amount of work for the Public Works Committee to do, the act could be amended to provide for the appointment of additional members. </para>

                        <para>. -  I hope the committee will reject the amendment. Many of the arguments used in opposition to the proposal to appoint five members to. the Public Accounts Committee apply with equal force to this proposition. An inquiry may be necessary in New South Wales. If the committee has two Tasmanians and two Western Australians included m its membership; it may be difficult for them to attend for I remind honorable senators that these committees do most of their work during the parliamentary recesses when members like to be in their constituencies as much as possible. If the committee had only five members' on * it, I am sure many inquiries would ' have to be made with only three members present. It would be farcical, I suggest, to reduce the membership so greatly. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator has himself suggested that when the committee has more work to do, five members would not be enough. Should we not bear in mind that we are legislating for a committee which will have work to do? It seems to me that the amendment has been moved in a spirit of contrariness. Certain honorable senators wish to be " ag'in the Government." information furnished to me shows that on many occasions not 50 per cent, of the members of this committee are present al its sittings. Many reasons apart from sickness may be advanced to explain this. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid</inline> has pointed out, inquiries are often made in States far distant from those represented by some members of the committee, and this makes attendance at the committee meetings very difficult. If an inquiry is being held in New South Wales, it might be very awkward for Tasmanian or Western Australian members of the committee to bc present. </para>

                        <para>.- I consider that the committee should consist of not less than seven members. T hold no brief for this committee, particularly when I realize that it was responsible, among other things, for rejecting a scheme to provide ornamental lakes in Canberra which, if constructed, would have been of great benefit to those who are compelled to reside here. It would be interesting to know why the Government has introduced this measure at this juncture, when other important legislation is awaiting our attention. Notwithstanding the fact that a Debt Conversion Bill, a Debt Conversion Agreement Bill, a Customs Tariff, a Wheat Bounty Bill, and many other small but important measures are awaiting our consideration, the Government places at the top of the notice-paper a bill which merely provides that the number of members of the committee, which is not even functioning, shall be reduced from ten to seven. It would appear that the Government is anxious to delay a discussion of important measures, otherwise it would not give prominence to such «n unimportant ill. </para>

                        <para>.- In view of the vote which I recorded on the Public Accounts Committee Bill J must, in order to be consistent, support the amendment. Having had experience as a member of the Public Works Committee, I feel that a committee of five could function as efficiently as a committee of seven. The important work undertaken by this committee from tun? to time could be more efficiently performed by a smaller committee, With an unnecessarily large number of members there is a good deal of wearisome repetition in the cross examination of witnesses, and, consequently, unnecessary expense in the printing of evidence. The committee of which I was a member did excellent work, and I believe that with a smaller committee closer attention could be given to the proposals which it has to consider. </para>

Parliament could select a representative committee, the members of which would attend regularly and devote their time to the important work they are expected to perform. It is easy for a member to attend meetings of the committee and claim his fee without giving the slightest attention to the proposal before it. On numerous occasions very important matters have been investigated by a sectional committee consisting of three members. </para>

                        <para>. -  Having had a fairly long experience as a member of the Public Works Committee I am able to speak with authority on the excellent work it has performed on behalf of this country. The Government favours a committee of seven because it, realizes that, owing to the attention which some of its members have to give to the requirements of their constituents, a smaller committee may not be able to efficiently carry out the important work entrusted to it. Moreover, on a committee of. five each State could not have representation. The members of such committees do not profess to be experts, but as practical men they are able to sift the evidence tendered by technical and other witnesses, and come to a satisfactory decision. It has been shown that during the time the committee has been functioning it has investigated public works costing approximately £26,000,000, and has saved the country no less than £5,000,000. </para>

Certain recommendations were made, and the representative of South Australia on the committee possessed first-hand knowledge which enabled him to explain the matter fully to the public men of his State and to the people generally. The amendment should not be considered for a moment, but should be thrown out, so that an opportunity would be afforded for every State to have representation on the committee. </para>

                        <para>.   -  I hope that, even at this late stage, honorable senators, particularly those who represent the smaller States of the Commonwealth, will change their attitude towards  this  proposal. They must already realize how difficult it is, in view of the weight of representation of two of the States in this Parliament, to secure the appointment of their representatives to bodies of this nature. The fewer the number of members, the less chance will their States have of securing representation. It may be advantageous for certain States to be represented on the body that conducts an investigation into proposals for new works within their borders. There would be less opportunity of that occurring if the amendment were agreed to than if the proposal of the Government, were accepted.  As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson</inline> and others have pointed out, this is not a measure of economy, because the Public Works Committee is not functioning at the present time, and is not likely to function until the opportunity is afforded to it to investigate works with which the Government can proceed. </para>

                            <para>- That may be so when an investigation is being made into matters in which a State should have a voice. I should think, however, that it would be almost a disadvantage for a State to be represented when the inquiry was into a matter in which it was interested. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> recalled a ease in which a South Australian member of this committee was able to explain fully to the public men of South Australia why it had recommended against a proposed railway in that State. He must have been a spartan member; because the tendency would be for a South Australian member to throw all his weight behind what he regarded as in the interests of the State and not of the Commonwealth. I consider, therefore, that we should not lend our support to the view that this is intended to be a body on which all the States must have representation. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> has pointed out, the force of that argument, if it ever had any force, is entirely negatived by the fact that what I call the most important State, and what he calls the second State, was not represented on either this or the Public Accounts Committee when the membership numbered nine. It is quite clear, therefore, that the question of State representation was not taken into account in the past. I agree that the amount of economy to be effected is not very large. It has been said that this committee is doing no work at the present time, because no money is available for expenditure upon public works. Consequently, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> might meet with' a greater measure of success if, in the different circumstances which operate in the present case, he moved for the suspension of the operations of this committee for a definite period. </para>

                        <para>. - The major consideration appears to be that we ought to construct a committee upon which all States would have representation. We must bear in mind, however, the fact that when the committee had a membership of nine, the obligation rested upon those responsible for the selection of its members to give to some States greater representation than was given to others. Therefore, those States which had only one representative, or which were not represented at all, had a more pronounced grievance than any State could have if all except one were represented on a committee of five members. There must be anomalies, whatever is done. There are some cabinets in Australia which consist of only five Ministers, and the duties that they discharge are more onerous than are those for which this committee is responsible. Surely we are not asking too much when we seek to reduce its numerical strength to their level. </para>

                    PEARCE ( Western Australia)  [4.55]. -  The Minister who moved the second reading of this bill agreed to the adjournment of the debate until a later hour in order that I might have an opportunity to peruse his remarks so as to help me in elucidating the provisions of the hill. I find that  95  per cent. of the speech was a misrepresentation of the action of the Senate in regard to the other wheat bills, and  5  per cent. of it an elucidation  of  this measure.
                </para>
                <para class="block">It is a pity the Government cannot look on. the question of wheat except in terms of votes. It is said that the mouse values the world in terms of cheese. I am certain that the Minister for Markets looks on wheat in terms of votes.  His  speech reeks of an attempt to appeal for votes for the Government for what it has done, and against the Senate for what it has done. I am not sure that it would not be a good thing to impose a restriction on speakers by compelling them to adhere to facts. It would most certainly be a severe limitation upon some of them. It would cramp their style considerably. We have this fine example in the speech of the Minister - </para>

                <para class="block">The drop in the world price of wheat had nothing to do with the plight of the farmers ! It did not affect them in the slightest! All would have been well if only the Senate had passed the bill for a guaranteed price of  4s.  a bushel and a compulsory pool ! The farmer would have been happy and prosperous, thanking God for the existence of the Scullin Ministry, and, in particular, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Parker</inline> Moloney ! Was there ever such a travesty of the facts as is contained in the speech of the Minister? </para>
                <para>First of all, the Senate was not responsible for the drop in the price of wheat on the world's market. That was a matter entirely beyond the control of the Senate, and in regard to which it has no voice or vote. Nevertheless, it is the principle cause of the plight of the farmer, not only in Australia, but also in every other country in the world. But the Minister blithely takes no notice of that fundamental fact. </para>
                <para>Would the passing of that' bill by the Senate have saved the farmer? I venture to say that it would have put him in an even worse position. Does the Minister think that we are so blind to all that has passed since that bill was rejected not to realize that if the Senate had passed the measure, the Government could not by any means have found the  £20,000,000  which would have been necessary to implement the  guaranteed price in that bill? The disproof of that suggestion is in the fact that when, later, the Senate passed a bill introduced by the Government, which required the raising of only £3,000,000, the Government found that it was unable to raise even that amount. </para>

When the 4s. guarantee was before us there was no mention of any reference to the bank. The Government proposed to find the money. The Government itself was to be the fairy godfather. </para>

                <para>We remember another little instance in connexion with that particular bill. A small clause provided that if any provision of the measure was found to be unconstitutional, the unconstitutionality was to affect that provision only ; the rest of the bill was to stand. I think that honorable senators pointed out at the time that there was a grave doubt about the constitutionality of the provision relating to the payment of a guaranteed price. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; no one raised any doubt about the constitutionality of the compulsory pool. The provisions relating to the pool were absolutely watertight, and the saving clause was not introduced for the purpose of safeguarding those provisions. It was introduced solely because of the doubt in the Government's mind as to the constitutionality of the. guaranteed price part of the bill. What would have been the position of the farmer if we had passed that measure? First of all the Government could not raise the £20,000,000; in any case, it could not have paid the 4s. guarantee. Secondly, any attempt on its part to pay the 4s. would probably have been found to be unconstitutional. The rest of the bill, however, would have stood, and the farmers would have found themselves tied up to a compulsory pool without any guaranteed price. That is the little pitfall from which the Senate saved the farmers of Australia. So far from that action of the Senate having left the farmers in a desperate plight, it saved them from being put into a worse position than that in which the drop in the world prices has left them. Then we have this other gem of oratory from the Minister - </para>

                    <para>Meantime the plight of the farmers was growing more and more desperate, and a further attempt was made to give the assistance so urgently required.

                <para class="block">I think it may be said of that bill that it went to its grave " unwept, unhonour'd and unsung", even by those who spoke in support of it. But while that measure was under consideration the Senate did indicate a proposal that would have been  of some practical help to our farmers in respect of last season's wheat. The Senate declared clearly and unmistakably that if the Government would agree to introduce a bill imposing a sales tax on flour, the Senate would pass it. This would have provided real money for our wheatgrowers, instead of a discredited currency under the Government's proposal. The Government did not take advantage of that offer, because Ministers were afraid that it might mean an increase in the price of bread, but they have now introduced a measure, the indirect result of which will be to cause an increase in the price of bread. </para>

                        <para>- I doubt the ability of the Minister to explain it in committee. It is so complicated that I venture to say it will lead to all sorts of trouble, and, in administration, will be liable to manipulation in the most sinister manner. I do not imply that it will be manipulated by this Government; I simply assert that it is capable of causing great injustice to farmers who sell their wheat at different periods, because what ought to be a very simple proposition has been expressed by a most cumbersome method. Two propositions were made when the previous measure was under discussion in the Senate. One was a sales tax on flour, and the other was to borrow money to assist the farmers. The latter proposal is contained in this bill. Its purpose is, in effect, to raise a loan of £3,000,000 for the assistance of necessitous wheat-farmers in respect of this year's wheat. </para>

                    PEARCE.This sum, we are told, is to be distributed among our wheat-farmers, but the limitation of the amount realized to 3s. per bushel will, I suggest, lead to all sorts of complications and difficulties. As we understand the scheme, the banks have agreed to make this amount available provided the price of wheat does not rise above 3s. per bushel f.o.b. If it does, no bounty will be payable, and, in any event, the bounty payable must not exceed 6d. per bushel.

                    PEARCE.Because of our present difficult financial position, it is of the greatest importance that we should obtain the highest price possible overseas for our primary products. For this reason, we should not insert in this legislation any provision which may damp the ardour of private buyers and pool authorities; on the contrary, they should be stimulated to secure the highest prices possible.
                </para>
                <para>I see another danger in the scheme. As honorable senators are aware, under existing arrangements, Australian wheat is not sold and sent overseas immediately it is harvested. It is disposed of in an orderly manner, and there is always a reserve held to meet home requirements, and also to take advantage of any increase that may take place in the world's market. If this bill is passed in its present form, the incentive will be to dispose of the wheat and ship it overseas as quickly as possible. There will be no encouragement to hold any portion of the harvest for a further rise in the market, and unless the price exceeds 3s. nobody will benefit from the improvement in the market, because, under this proposal, the payment of the bounty will ensure that the farmer gets that amount. </para>

                <para>The provisions of clause 6 appear to me to be rather mysterious. That clause provides for differentiation in the procedure to be adopted in respect of pools and private wheat buyers. It stipulates that the private wheat buyer must state, in his certificate, the price which he has paid for the wheat. It reads - </para>
                <list type="decimal">
                    <item label="(">
                        <para>1 ) Every licensee other than a prescribed co-operative organization shall issue to the grower, in respect of wheat purchased from the grower or received from the grower for sale, a certificate in duplicate, in the prescribed form, specifying the quantity of wheat purchased or received by him from the grower, and stating, as prescribed, the free-on-board equivalent of the price per bushel paid or to be paid for the wheat. </para>
                    </item>
                </list>
                <para class="block">In the case of a prescribed co-operative organization, the same procedure is to be followed, except that the licensee will be required to state the " free-on-board " equivalent of the price per bushel estimated by the organization to be that at which the wheat will be sold ". I cannot understand why there should be this differentiation between wheat handled by a pool and wheat handled by a private buyer, but it seems to me that it will open the door to manipulation that would be to the disadvantage of the Government while not being advantageous to the grower. Furthermore, I point out that in this bill, and in the concomitant measure, there is no reference whatever to a limit of £3,000,000. Apparently the banks have intimated that they are able and willing to make available that sum but no more. </para>
                <para>Surely in considering such a measure as this which, after all, is a bounty bill applied to production, we should, as far as possible, insert provisions similar to those precautions included in other measures relating to the payment of bounties. In the bills dealing with the payment of bounty on cotton, steel, and iron, and other products, we specifically provided for the payment of a bounty of so much per ton, or so much per lb., and stipulated also the total amount of bounty payable under the respective acts. We did not concern ourselves with the market price of the commodities concerned, nor did we insert intricate provisions relating to the manner in which the product is sold, or who sold it. All that concerns the taxpayer is the amount of his liability. Why could not the same simple procedure be followed in this hill? Why did not the Government provide for the payment of a bounty not exceeding 6d. per bushel on all wheat sold, and definitely fix the total amount of bounty payable at £3,000,000 ? </para>

                        <para>-If this scheme were adopted it does not follow that the whole of the amount would be withheld. It would simply mean that something would be kept in hand until after the final adjustment of the accounts. That is done by the pools now. But I ask why the banks should not accept my proposal. They have evidently agreed to accept the responsibility of finding £3,000,000. When they have raised the loan and made the money available, the transaction between themselves and the Government should be ended. It is not the business of the banks, but the business of this Parliament, to decide how the money should be paid to the farmers. Seeing that the banks have accepted the responsibility of making £3,000,000 available for the assistance of the wheatgrowers by means of a bounty, the Government should introduce a simple bounty bill containing a provision for the payment of a bounty of 6d. per bushel on wheat, and a limitation of a total payment of £3,000,000. If that course were adopted, we should avoid the complications of this bill and the possibilities of manipulation which it provides. Have honorable senators thought about what might happen under this scheme, though I do not say that the things which I am about to suggest will happen ? Supposing the price of wheat were 2s. 8d. per bushel, the Government would have to find 4d. per bushel. But supposing certain buyers and sellers of wheat agreed to buy and sell at 2s. 6d. per bushel, the Government would have to find 6d. per bushel. That extra 2d. would allow for a fair margin to divide - to put it mildly - between buyer and seller. </para>

                    mentioned a point to me which I hope he will not mind my referring to as it is of considerable importance. Is there not a possibility of the farmers being treated unfairly by this cumbersome method of granting them assistance? Supposing one farmer sells his wheat to a pool for 2s. 6d. per bushel, and later another farmer sells to the pool for 2s. 8d. per bushel. It seems  as though both farmers will get the same price for their wheat. Should not the farmer who sold his wheat for 2s. 8d. get the advantage of the 2d. perbushel?

                    PEARCE.That is so. There are difficulties in regard to freight and other charges. I can see many ways in which inequalities might fall on the farmers by the operation of the machinery of this bill, which could be avoided if a straight-out bounty act, with a limit to expenditure, were passed. For the life of me, I cannot understand why there is necessity for such a complicated scheme. I suggest that, even at this late stage, the Government should redraft the bill along the lines of other bounty measures. The administrative procedure in connexion with ordinary bounty bills is well understood by our departmental officers, and has proved effective. Here we have an intricate and complicated system which has never been tried. I am afraid that there will be hopeless confusion and numerous inequalities if this scheme is adhered to. I shall vote for the bill, but I suggest that before the committee stage is reached, the Government should consider the advisableness of devising a simpler proposition for the granting of assistance to the farmers. It should be possible to draft a scheme which would be simpler in its operation, more equitable in its effects, and less liable to manipulation than the one laid down in this bill.

                            <para>- It may or it may not be unconstitutional ; but surely the farmers are not to be left to suffer until the question of the constitutionality of certain State legislation can be settled by litigation. The practicability of the Commonwealth Government imposing a tax on flour was inquired into by Professor Giblin, and in consequence of his report, the Government felt that it would have to seek other means of assisting the farmers. In view of the fact that any scheme for the granting of assistance to the farmers would require finance, the Government was compelled to consult the financial institutions on the subject. I am instructed that the maximum measure of relief which the banks are prepared to grant to the primary producers is provided for in this bill. </para>

                            <para>- I did not mention it. All that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator .</inline> Dooley did in introducing the bill was to refer to it in a general way as one of the proposals of the Government for assisting the farmers. My principal object in taking part in the debate at this early stage is to assure honorable senators that the Government has obtained from the banks the maximum amount that they arc prepared to provide to assist the wheat-growers. My instructions are that this hill has been drawn in conformity with the wishes expressed at. the conference with the banks. Another reason why I am speaking at this early stage is to assure the Leader of the Opposition that there is no trap in the 3s. per bushel proposal of the Government. The provisions which the right honorable gentleman referred to as a " trap " are contained in our dried fruits legislation which has been the subject of judicial interpretation by the High Court. I wish also to make it clear that the proposal for the imposition of a tax on flour has been fully considered by the Government. It was dropped, not because nf any spineless attitude by the Government, but chiefly because of fear of the legality of certain proposals in regard to the embargoes, and so on. This bill has been introduced in the hope that at least £3,000,000 will be made available to assist the primary producers of this country. </para>

                        COLEBATCH (Western Australia) [5.34]. - I do not wish to say one word in regard to any previous bill in relation to the wheat industry. This bill is sufficiently important, sufficiently intricate, and sufficiently difficult to occupy our attention. It is unfortunate, I might even go so far as to say it might be the subject of complaint, that the Senate should be asked to deal with a difficult bill like this under conditions which do not provide time for a proper consideration of it. The introduction of the bill was delayed until the last moment. Another House is almost ready to rise, and on the Senate is cast the responsibility of passing this bill after immature consideration, or of exposing itself to the charge that it is standing in the way of the farmers receiving some concession which the Government wishes to give them. Whether or not we have ground for complaint on that score, we have reason to complain of the Government's failure to give the Senate full information, and a complete outline of the proposals embodied in this bill. We are told that it is understood that the banks will not do certain things, but will do others. Why should we have a vague statement of that kind? Why cannot we have the position from the view-point of the banks clearly placed before us? A most complicated and intricate sub-clause was inserted in the bill in another place last evening. Was that inserted at the request or with the knowledge of the banks? I am fully  convinced that there is no banking institution in this country which wishes to see an entirely complicated scheme put up.

I repeat, with all due respect to the hanks, that the question of how the money shall be distributed is more a matter for the Government and the Parliament than it is for the banks. If the banks say - and I understand that they have - that it is possible for them to provide £3,000,000, I suggest that it is easier for the hanks to provide the sum of £3,000,000 if it will bring the price of wheat up to a figure which will show the farmer a small profit, than it is for the banks to supply £3,000,000 when it will still leave the total price of wheat at a figure which will involve the farmers in a loss. It would be a much sounder proposition from the view of the banks and of the States, if we are going to find the £3,000,000, to provide it in a way that will enable the farmer to make a small profit, than so to provide it that it will still leave the farmer at a loss and in danger of being driven off his holding. Many attacks have been made upon the banks, but I put it to the Senate, that if the banks have contended that they will only provide this money conditionally upon the farmers receiving no more than 3s. a bushel, they are adopting an extremely patriotic and self-sacrificing attitude. Surely it is better for the banks to have the Government as their creditor rather than the needy farmer, and if they can get 6d. a bushel from the Government and put it to the credit of the overdrawn account of the farmer surely it would be advantageous to them. I find it difficult to believe that, if this matter were strongly and clearly presented to the banks, they would not infinitely prefer to provide this £3,000,000 as a loan to the Government and have nothing more to do with the job. They would certainly prefer that to a difficult and intricate proposal of this kind, which is bound to lead to an enormous amount of trouble and confusion. </para>

                            <para>- I know the history of the proposal. I should think that clause 6, in its present form, has never been submitted to any authority, and on that account I find it difficult to reconcile that clause with the paragraph in the memorandum from the  chairman  of the Commonwealth Bank Board to the Prime Minister, which deals with that particular feature of the case. I do not think that this bill, in any event, can be quite so simple as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has suggested it might be. It is not merely a matter of providing 6d. a bushel, because £3,000,000 would not provide the wheat-growers with that amount per bushel if given as a straightout bounty on production. I think we are fairly safe in assuming that. Naturally a good deal of it is speculative </para>

                        COLEBATCH Quite so. That is the reason why this bill cannot be so simple as the right honorable senator has suggested. Supposing we assume that the export is equivalent to 120,000,000 bushels, and that the quantity for local consumption is about 40,000,000 bushels. With a population of 6,500,000, an estimated consumption of under seven bushels per head, including seed, feed and other purposes, gives a total of 40,000,000 bushels. In any case that is only a rough estimate. This £3,000,000 would provide 6d. a bushel on the 120,000,000 bushels exported. At one time, there was an alternative idea that there should be a payment of 4£d. per bushel on the total production. The same £3,000,000 would have been required to provide for that alternative.
                    </para>
                    <para>I consider that certain of the provisions of this bill are quite excellent, and ought to work simply enough. They are. the provisions under which the buyer gives a certificate to the farmer, the farmer collects his money, and the buyer is no longer affected so far as his export wheat is concerned; he has paid the ordinary price, and he exports in the ordinary way. Hut in regard to all the wheat, that is to be used for local consumption, he is required to pay the amount of the bounty to the Commonwealth. Naturally, he will add that amount to the price that he charges the miller. By that means this same £3,000,000, which would not be adequate to provide a bounty of 6d. a bushel on the entire crop, is to be made to do that work, because the Commonwealth is to be recompensed the amount of the bounty on all the wheat sold for local consumption. </para>

                            <para>- It is, with this difference, that under the sales tax proposal it was a tax of £7 4s. a ton on flour, which would have been equivalent to an increase of about 7d. a bushel on all wheat produced. I should not think that this tax will increase the price of flour to more than one-fourth the extent of the other; therefore, the increase in the price of bread should not be more than one-fourth as great. At the present time, the intention is that the money borrowed by the Government from the banks shall provide 6d. a bushel on an export of 120,000,000 bushels, and that ti tax on flour will be required to provide the bounty only on the 40,000,000 bushels that are consumed locally. So that, instead of having to raise considerably over £4,000,000, as would have been necessary under the proposed sales tax in order to pay a bounty of 7d. a bushel on the entire production, the amount required to be raised by means of an extra price to the local consumer will total only £1,000,000. While it" is unquestionable that a sales tax of £7 4s. a ton on flour would have made an appreciable difference in the price of bread, I should think it very unlikely that the present, impost will increase that price at ail. In fact, it would not interfere with reductions being made in the price of bread if proper economies were observed in its making and distribution. Considering that Queensland, with a high sales tax on flour, is selling bread at practically the same price as New South Wales, with a very much smaller tax, it is obvious that if the thing is worked reasonably and properly, bread can be sold more cheaply even though a shade more has to be paid for the flour. From that point of view I have no quarrel with the bill, and consider that, the arrangement which it embodies is a good one. But trouble is likely to be encountered because of the fact that the amount of the bounty is not definitely fixed. I entirely sympathize with the officers as well as with the Government, who have had to endeavour to draft a scheme that will meet this extremely difficult position. In the first place, I do not believe that this limitation is in any way justified. </para>

                    <para>Let us consider the matter first of all from the point, of view of the farmers. There can be. no doubt that the farmer is' entitled to feel very much aggrieved at the fact that none of the promises of assistance that have been made have been realized. Let us disregard, for the moment, the question of who is responsible. We can all agree that a number of promises have been made, and that not one of them has materialized. The farmer is entitled to be given something. It must be remembered that when the Government passed its last bill, it was prepared to distribute the amount involved provided that that amount was made available by the banks. The figure then was certainly considerably in excess of the £3,000,000 now involved. Therefore, it seems to me that if the wish previously expressed by this Parliament, as well as the desires expressed by the Government, are to be given effect, this £3,000,000 of borrowed money should be absolutely the minimum amount distributed among the farmers. Looking at the matter from the point of view of the necessities of the farmer, is it not absurd to suggest that if by some fortunate rise in the price of wheat the f.o.b. price reaches 3s. a bushel, he is no longer in need of assistance? I venture to think that out of this period of depression great advantages to Australia will be realized in the future. One such advantage is that production C03ts are being steadily reduced below the abnormal figure of a few years ago. I can recall conscientious and capable farmers having asserted that it was impossible to grow wheat at a co3t of 4s. 6d. a bushel. That figure has been materially reduced, and it ought to be reduced a great deal more. I hope that the operations of this Senate in regard to another matter which will come up for consideration will result in a further reduction of those costs. I made it my business, while visiting "Western. Australia a few weeks ago, to inquire carefully into this matter. Much of the information then furnished to me was of a confidential character ; but I feel at liberty to say that although there has been this considerable reduction, a price of 3s. a bushel f.o.b. would not pay the wheat-farmer to-day. There may be exceptional cases of very good crops that were put in under exceedingly favorable conditions in which 3s. a bushel would return the amount of the outlay. Generally speaking, however, farmers would be at a loss with wheat at that figure. Why, then, say to them, " We will- give you no bounty that will make it possible for you to cover the cost of your production." Surely that would be an ungenerous attitude to adopt towards a section of the community, to whom promises have been made over and over again during the last two years. It would be unfair to say to the farmer, " We are going to do something for you, but no matter to what extent you may be helped by what happens outside, no matter how favorable the conditions may be, we will not allow you to get your money back; the total amount that you receive shall be less than the amount that you have expended." Such an attitude would be a rather foolish one to adopt from the point of view of the State. Surely it would be far better to make an advance that would return to him at least what he had spent this year, than to give him something. less and thus make his position at the end of the year worse than it was at the beginning. Is it not essential not merely to the prosperity, but we may almost say to ti.continued existence of Australia tha. th.' farmer shall be kept on the land? i: a curious fact that at the  present  time we in Australia are depending almost entirely upon two industries that are being carried on at a lo3s. Why is ii that those industries can keep going? .1 take it the reason is that they are still almost entirely individualistic industries. In the development of what my friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> Rae, would term the capitalistic system, within recent years the tendency has been for the majority of industries to get into the hands of big corporations with large accumulations of capital. What has been the result? Directly those industries fail to pay interest on that  large  capital, or the wages that are prescribed by arbitration courts, or agreed upon by some trade union, they have to close down. That, I think, is  one  of the reasons why the present world-wide depression if more severe and prolonged, than were similar depressions in the past, when a greater number of industries were conducted on the individualistic basis, and had to continue whether they paid or not In the old days if a bootmaker could not, on account of depression, obtain 17s 6d. a pair for his boots he had to work harder, make two pairs, and sell then: for 7s. 6d. a pair. If he could not mab?  sufficient  to provide himself with three meals he had to he satisfied with two Because he and everybody else carried on, the world lifted itself out of iw troubles more quickly than we are emerging from ours to-day. The two industries to which I have referred, however,  cannot  carry on at a loss indefinitely. Farmer after farmer is being driven off his land. It is essential in the interests of Australia that this bounty be given for the purpose of keeping men on the land. If  they are given what will bring their total return up to the cost of production, something will be done towards that end. It is up to the Government to place before the banks the strongest possible case on this point. I should like to see, not a statement from the  chairman  of the Commonwealth Bank that this is a proposal based on such and such an assumption, but the result of a deliberate and vigorous conference between the Government and the banks with a view to obtaining the whole of this £3,000,000, which the batiks say they are able to provide, and which this Parliament should, under proposals brought forward by the Government, distribute in a manner which will best serve its purpose. </para>
                    <para>I come now to what to my mind is the most difficult feature of this bill; that is, the provisions that are contained in clause 6. I do not think that any of us wish to do an injustice to the co-operative pools; and 1 hope none of us wish to do an injustice to the ordinary wheat buyer. I confess at once that the securing of fair and just treatment between those two sections is almost impossible if this system be followed. It would be the simplest matter if there were a clear bounty of 6d., and if the provisions in regard to sales for local consumption were maintained as they appear in the bill. There would then be no difficulty between the ordinary buyer and the co-operative pool. But under this system there are difficulties that to my mind are entirely insurmountable. You say to the ordinary buyer, " You shall buy the wheat, give the farmer a certificate stating the amount you have paid, and that, is the end of- your responsibility from that point of view." The same cannot be said to the co-operative pool, because it does not buy the wheat, but receives it with a view to selling it throughout the season and of distributing the whole of the proceeds among its suppliers. If a co-operative pool took a fanner's wheat for 2s. 6d. a bushel, and a private buyer offered at the same siding 2s. 9d. a. bushel, there would be no advantage to the farmer in taking the 2s. 9d., because he would get a 6d. certificate in the one case and only a 3d. certificate in the other. </para>

                        COLEBATCH.No, it is of great advantage to the cooperative organization as against the private buyer, because the latter has to' make his bargain and finish it. I hav already shown that it will be of advantage to the farmer to sell to the pool at 8 lower price than is offered by the private buyer. If at a siding there are agents representing Dreyfus, Bunge, or Darling, and they are offering 2s. 9d. a bushel, whereas the pool is estimating 2s. 8d.: I .defy any one to say that a difference of Id. can be accurately finalized, or thai any one could say that 2s. 9d. or 2s. 8d. is actually right or wrong. It is quit* customary to find differences of Jd or Id.

                        COLEBATCH.Where are they to get the money? Another curious provision is contained in paragraph 3, of clause 3, which was inserted in another place last night. It seems to be contemplated that on some occasion, the co-operative pool may give to a farmer a certificate in which it will  say, " We estimate the price at 2s. 9d. That will entitle you to draw 3d. a bushel from the Commonwealth." But later on, if it finds that the price realized is only 2s. 6d., it will give the farmer another certificate entitling him to a further 3d. a bushel from the Government. Suppose, however, that the estimated price is 2s. 6d., and the farmer is given a certificate entitling him to a bounty of 6d. If the price of wheat should rise to 3s., the farmer would not be entitled to receive any bounty. Is it contemplated that the pool will return to the Government the amount of the bounty already received by the farmer, but to which he is actually not entitled under the clause as it stands?

                            <para>- I think it will be found to be an extremely complicated matter to handle. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> believes that it will cause the pools to rush their wheat forward. I do not know that it will not have an entirely contrary effect. A pool which has advanced 2s.11d. for wheat may say, " We shall hold over this wheat, because, even if there is a drop of 5d. in the price, we shall still not be losers." The pool has already given the farmer 2s.11d., and he has drawn a1d. a bushel from the Commonwealth. The pool itself is protected to the extent of the difference between that1d. and the full amount of the bounty, which is 6d., because, if the price falls to 2s. 6d., the farmer can be given another certificate entitling him to draw another 5d. from the Commonwealth Government. On the other hand, if the price goes up, the pool gets the full advantage of it. It is a dangerous position in which to place the pool if we protect it against any loss which may be incurred through holding wheat for a rise. </para>

                            <para>-I do not say that the pool should be compelled to realise on its wheat at once. What I say is that every buyer, a cooperative pool or not, should take upon itself the responsibility of deciding whether it should realize on its wheat or not. The responsibility for any loss through not realizing should fall upon it alone, whereas, under this bill, it is thrown upon the Commonwealth Government. All these troubles could have been avoided if this measure had been simply one for an advance of 6d. a bushel out of the £3,000,000 which the banks are ready to provide, the balance being obtained in the manner suggested in -this bill in respect of wheat sold for local consumption.I am saying nothing in condemnation of those who have drafted the bill, because I realize the extreme difficulty of their task ; but, if it is not possible to make the alteration I have already suggested, I trust that the measure will he so amended as to remove the dangers which I see in it. </para>

I do not suppose that one wool-grower or wheat-farmer has made any profit on his enterprise during the last eighteen months. Every wool-grower and wheat-farmer is practically carrying on at a loss to-day. But, while I agree that that is so, the whole question 13 whether, if we altered this bill and remodelled it. 011 the basis of a simple bounty, we should be doing something effective. After all, I suppose we are, in the circumstances in which we find ourselves, bound to rely on what the Government tells us. The Government has taken the responsibility of telling us that the banks will agree to no other means of finding the money for the wheat-farmers than that which is embodied in the bill. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; but I want to throw the definite responsibility upon the Government. It says, in clear and emphatic terms, that the banks decline to find the money for the wheat-farmers except under the scheme embodied in this bill. That being 30, I say to my colleagues in the Senate that the bill will at least ensure to the wheat-farmers of Australia 3s. a bushel, and not less, for their wheat unless wheat falls to a very low price, and the Government has to accept the responsibility of the Senate passing this measure with that knowledge. </para>

                            <para>- I regret that a measure like this should be rushed through both Houses of this Parliament at such short notice. »We are dealing with a bill which affects the interests of a vast number of our people who have been having a very bad time, and I am afraid that this proposal will prove a very inadequate form of assistance to them.v It has not been possible for its terms to reach many parts of Australia and to be understood by those whose interests are so vitally affected by it, and although we are quite unable, from our individual knowledge, to say how its provisions will affect the various interests throughout Australia, we are asked to pass the bill through to its final stages at this sitting, the Minister in charge of it having moved the contingent notice of motion, which permits of the suspension of the Standing Orders, to enable this to be done. The Senate should hesitate to pass the bill until a reasonable period has elapsed for its full consideration. </para>

                    <para>The more I study the measure,  the more  satisfied am I that, associated with it, there are certain problems which, i» practice, will be extremely difficult to handle. Consequently, 1 am convinced that the measure requires a most careful consideration before it passes this chamber. At the same time I realize that we are on the eve of the harvest. Within a very few days now, the new season's wheat will be starting to come into the market, and it will be practically impossible, 1 take it, for the Government to reconsider the whole basis of the measure, have further consultations with the financial institutions, and go through the whole procedure that has already been adopted in connexion with the proposal, before asking Parliament again to consider it. In the circumstances, the responsibility for the bill in its present form rests with the Government, and 1 think that, in its essence, it will have to he accepted by this Parliament. </para>
                    <para>I am satisfied that if the PremiersConference had been sitting last week, instead of a few weeks ago, when this subject was under consideration, the probability is that we should have had an entirely different bill presented for our consideration. As far as we are able to follow the genesis of the project, as indicated in the press reports of the proceedings of the Premiers Conference, the fundamental idea upon which it wat based, was the assumption in the minds of everybody that it was impossible, within a reasonable time, to expect to se*1 wheat in the vicinity of 3s. per  bus hel  f.o.b. Australia. That clearly was  the view  held by those most competent t(' judge the situation at the time of the recent Premiers Conference. Sterling had then not broken and, as we know, the decline in sterling materially affected the price of wheat. That was one facto? which affected the wheat situation to &amp; material degree, and, looking into the future, I venture to suggest that two factors which may come into the equation may profoundly affect future wheat prices in Australia. One factor if British sterling. It may harden. We may see it pick up a very material proportion of the loss which has been regis- tered during the last few weeks. This would have the immediate effect of reducing the f.o.b. price of wheat in Australia. The other factor is that, before this harvest is completely sold - indeed, before very much of it is sold at all for shipment overseas - it is conceivable that a material reduction will be reported in the present rate of exchange. </para>

I should hesitate, too, to say the banks would have insisted upon the measure in this form, and no other form. But the Government has taken the responsibility of telling the Senate that this is the best proposal which it could get from the banks. Personally, I think that the present form of the bill is due to the way in which the proposal was submitted to the banks. Had it been put to those institutions in a different way, I think it probable that we should now be considering a different bill. There again responsibility rests upon the shoulders of the Government. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. And the banks, therefore, said : " We will agree to a bounty of 6d. on wheat, which is the amount you ask for, provided we are not asked to find a bounty if wheat goes above 3s. per bushel." If the Premiers Conference had submitted to the banks a proposal for a straight-out bounty of 6d. per bushel, in all probability we should have got it. </para>

                            <para>- Again 1 say the responsibility rests upon the shoulders of this Government. I am afraid that it is too late now to re-argue the details of the scheme with the banks. I believe that in this bill the Government has to some extent endeavoured to rectify what I think was a genuine mistake. By this I mean that it does not tie the bounty down to a price for wheat of 3s. per bushel, but has adopted an expedient which will enable it to re-argue this case with the banks. This is suggested in clause7, which reads - </para>

                        <para>The rate of bounty payable in respect of any wheat shall be the amount per bushel by which the free-on-board equivalent of the price per bushel as stated in the certificate issued by licensee in respect of that wheat falls short of the prescribed price, but not exceeding in any case 6d. per bushel. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">I have no doubt that the Government adopted that form in order to give it a certain amount of latitude in arguing the case anew with the banks, to see if it was not possible to have the bounty paid on a higher maximum price for wheat than that considered in the original request which the Premiers Conference submitted to the banks. This provision will undoubtedly enable the Ministry to do that. But we must be quite sure that no dispute arises later as to what is the agreed amount. It will be of no use for the Government, subsequent to the passing of this bill, to declare its intention to pay the bounty on wheat at 3s. 6d. if the banks have not agreed to that variation of the arrangement. The Government must be quite sure, if the Parliament gives it this liberty of action in clause 7, that it will not render the whole of this legislation nugatory, as other legislation has been rendered nugatory in the past, by not having a clear understanding with the people who have to find the money. Whatever the prescribed figure may be, we must be quite sure that there is no doubt about the matter with the financial institutions that have to find the money. </para>
                    <para>I wish now to say a few words about a point which the right honorable the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> raised, namely, the possibility of collusion between the buyer and the seller, in consequence of which the grower may be paid a greater amount of bounty than would be justified according to the market price of wheat. I admit that there is a possibility of such collusion taking place. I have no doubt that it could happen; but, at the same time, I do not think that the Government would be wholly without resource in the matter. First of all, there will ha a certain amount of rivalry between the buyers. As a. matter of fact, there is very real rivalry at the present time between independent buyers and the co-operative organizations. This competition will tend to keep prices up. But it is conceivable that a.n individual seller and an individual buyer will come to an arrangement under which the seller will get a greater amount of bounty than he is entitled to receive according to the market price of wheat, and the buyer will agree to split with the seller the difference between the amount which he pays the seller and the amount which he receives for the wheat. I think everybody can see the possibility of this collusion, and although I do not know how it is to be overcome, I imagine that the Government proposes to meet such a contingency by the conditions attached to the licence to bc issued to buyers. If it were apparent that any transaction of the kind described was going on, that is to say, if it were evident that some buyers were not giving the market price for wheat, and some sellers were prepared to take less than the market price, the licensed buyer would, 1 presume, lose his licence. </para>

                            <para>- The Government. I believe, could handle any attempt at collusion, although I do not say it would be possible to overcome it in every individual instance. If, however, the practice became widespread it would manifest itself, and the Government could take action along the lines I have suggested. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> has said, this measure has been very ingeniously drafted, and if it were not for one class  of buyer I think the operation of the aci would be a comparatively simple matter. A difficulty arises in connexion with the great co-operative organizations of primary producers, and personally, at the moment, I do not see how it will be possible entirely to overcome it. If I may be permitted to do so, I should like to mak* particular reference to certain provision? now, so that when we are dealing with them in committee, it will be quite clear that they have received that consideration which I feel their importance deserves. </para>

                            <para>- I wish to refer particularly to the provisions of clause 6, in which a distinction is drawn between the ordinary private buyer, whose case is quite a simple one, and the seller of wheat through a co-operative organization. The provisions relating to the cooperative organizations are contained ii&gt; sub-clauses 2 and 3 of clause 6; and also in clause 10. Sub-clause 2 of clause 6 enacts that a co-operative organization shall issue to the grower in respect of wheat received by it from him - a certificate in duplicate in a prescribed form specifying the quantity of wheat so received, and stating, as prescribed, the  free-on-board  equivalent of the price per bushel estimated bv the organization to be that at which the wheat will be sold, and specifying the bounty payable in respect of the wheat. </para>

                    <para class="block">That would be all right, and there would be no difficulty whatever provided the organization could identify each parcel of wheat which it had in the pool, and each parcel which had been sold. But, of course, that cannot be done, because a grower may have had a half a dozen consignments of wheat in the pool. The estimated price of the wheat when he puts his first consignment into the pool, may be different from the estimated price when he puts his second, third, fourth or fifth consignment into it. </para>

                            <para>- Even if he is paid on hie certificates, difficulties will arise. Let us take the case of A, who puts his wheat into a pool controlled by a co-operative organization, at an estimated price of 2s. 8d. It is clear that he will be given a certificate at that price and on the assumption that the prescribed maximum price on which bounty is payable is 3s., the certificate will enable him to obtain a bounty payment of 4d. per. bushel. Then take the case of B, who, a fortnight later, puts his wheat into the same co-operative organization at an estimated selling price of 2s.10d. a bushel. It is clear that he will be given a certificate which will entitle him to obtain a bounty payment of 2d. per bushel. The way these co-operative organizations work ordinarily is to pay to every grower when he puts his wheat into the pool the average price which they receive for all wheat that goes into the pool. It must be quite clear, therefore, that if they proceed along those lines A will get 2d. per bushel more than B for his wheat. </para>

                            <para>- I am coming to that point. I think that the provisions of the bill ensure that the growers will all get the same price for their wheat, but I want to make sure of it. I understand sub-clause 3 of clause 6 to provide that, in the event of the price at which the wheat is sold being greater than the price originally estimated, and on which bounty was paid to A, the duty is thrown on a co-operative organization of issuing a second certificate showing the true bounty which A should have received. I think it is contemplated, though I am not sure that it is actually provided for in the bill, that the co-operative organization, when it comes to finalize its accounts as between A and B and every other member of the pool, will work out the average price paid to the growers in the pool, and state on a second certificate the true bounty which should have been paid. It will then proceed on the final payments to its members to adjust either by deduct ion or addition to the individual accounts the inequalities in the bounty payments. That. I say, is what I think is intended; but I am not quite sure whether the bil! goes so far as to authorize a co-operative organization to take such action. </para>

                            <para>- That provides for a different matter. That is the provision of the bill under which co-operative bodies, if they have paid out to the growers in their organization more than the average bounty which should have been paid according to the realization price of the wheat, shall refund such amounts to the Government. In consequence of this provision it seems to me that in the handling of their accounts the co-operative organizations will have to retain sufficient funds first, to make such refunds to the Government, if the need for them arises ; and, secondly, to equalize the bounty payments as between the various growers who have put wheat into the pool. </para>

                            <para>- I ventured to suggest, when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> was speaking, that the provisions of the bill would be found to somewhat handicap the co-operative organizations as against the private buyers. I must admit that, with this particular kind of organization in the wheat business, and this particular kind of bounty payment, it is almost impossible to overcome that difficulty other than in the way provided in the bill, but I am not sure that even that way is fully provided for. I am not clear whether the provisions of the bill will give the co-operative organizations power to keep back from the individual growers an amount necessary for equalizing the payments in regard to bounty. It is perfectly clear that the provisions should go this far, otherwise it would be impossible for an organization to do justice to its individual members. </para>

                            <para>- That is so; but that is unavoidable as between the cooperative organizations and the private buyers whose operations are so fundamentally different in character. There seems to me to be no escape from that position. A grower who hands his wheat to a cooperative organization is a seller in two senses. He is a seller when he hands his wheat to the organization, and he is also a seller of f.o.b. wheat. Clearly, therefore, a different class of arrangement is necessary to meet that case and the case of the farmer who sells straight out to a private firm. 1 think the provisions of the bill have met this difficulty; but I am not sure whether they go so far as to authorize a co-operative organization to make adjustments as between its individual members in regard to bounty payments. If they do not go this far, another provision should be put into the bill for that, purpose. </para>

The influence of clause upon clause must be considered then. I therefore ask the honorable senator to do his best to keep to the larger aspects and the main principles of the bill. </para>

                    <para>There is one other aspect of the subject in regard to co-operative organizations about, which I should like to say a word, although it lias already received some consideration from the Government. What would be the position of the cooperative organizations in the event of over-payments of bounty having been made? In the event, of the estimated price stated on the certificate issued to the seller to the pool being lower than the actual price received, it may be necessary for a co-operative organization to refund quite large amounts of money to the Government. What is to be the position of these co-operative organizations upon which this responsibility is thrust in the event of a lien being given over the wheat? In such cases, of course the whole of the proceeds received by the pool for the wheat goes to the lienee. The position then is that the co-operative organizations, even if desiring to make the equalization to which I have referred, would have nothing out of which to effect it. In the case of a lien where the whole of the proceeds of a crop are not the property of a member of the organization, it i.1quite clear that the obligation to find the money would be thrown upon the organization. </para>

I am convinced that the form of the bill is governed by the nature of the request made to the banks. I contend that the request to the banks was wrongly framed. It would have been infinitely better for the farmers and for the country if the Government had asked the banks to raise the necessary money to enable it to pay a straight-out bounty of 6d. a bushel to the wheat-growers. I think tha Government could have got the money from the banks if a straight-out request had been made to them in that way. </para>

                        <para>. -  I am glad that at last the farmers are to get something; but I wish to point out some of the difficulties and injustices to which they are. being subjected under this bill. During the 30 years of federation, numerous bounties have been paid to different industries. There occur to one's mind at once the large sums that have been given to those engaged in the iron and steel industries, and to those engaged in the production of cotton, flax and cattle for export. There has never been any difficulty in obtaining a straightout bounty on the total production or the export quantity of these commodities. "We also find that our secondary industries have been generously assisted. No difficulty has ever been found in giving those engaged in secondary production, all the protection and -assistance that they wanted and a great deal more than they needed. During this long period the primary producers, and particularly the wheat and wool growers have had <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> bear the brunt of the burden of tariffs and bounties. It has now become too much for the wheat-growers, who, in their present parlous state, find it impossible to carry on. For the last, two years they have been asking for assistance, but when an offer is made to them, it is on a totally different basis from that on which those engaged in other industries, which have been assisted by bounties or tariffs have had assistance. The wheat industry is the only industry to which assistance has been approved by legislation which has not received a straight-out bounty. When the Government now promises to provide 6d. a bushel on export flour, we find that a string is attached to the proposal. If the price of wheat in the markets of the world should increase - although the increased price may not bring it up to the cost of production, or provide the farmer with a living or even the basic wage - the farmer is to receive only about three-fourths of the cost of production. The generous banking institutions or whoever is responsible, have now said that if the f.o.b. price of wheat reaches 3s. a bushel, no bounty shall be payable. They are saying, " After starving you, we will give you a bone or only one-half of the cost of production." If the price reaches 3s. » bushel f.o.b. they are not to receive anything at all. It is a monstrous proposal, and I hope that the efforts of the Government to increase this pittance to  Sr.  fid. a bushel will be successful. I am glad that the Government has introduced the hill in a form which will permit the payment of 3s. 6d a bushel, or a bonus of 6d. a bushel irrespective of the price of wheat, if the banks agree. </para>

                            growers have experienced during recent years, not with the object at the moment of apportioning the blame, but in order to show how the farmers' interests have been disregarded. The first bill that, came before the Senate provided for the payment of a guaranteed price of 4s. a bushel, but that payment was to be subject to the State governments providing one-half of any loss that might accrue under the guarantee. For the first time in federal history, the States were asked to provide one-half of the bounty, and on an unequal basis owing to the variation in production and in the matter of population. The proposal was so unjust that some States refused to accept the heavy liability involved, and the bill was lost. In December of last year, a Wheat Advances Bill, under which the paltry price of 3s. a bushel f.o.b. was offered, was approved by Parliament. Although that act is now on the statute-hook, the nation has defaulted in its promise to the wheat-growers, who have not received the price promised. They have been " welshed " out of it, as no payment whatever has been made. After 30 years of federation, that is the only bill that has ever been placed upon the statute-book of the Commonwealth or of any of the States which has been entirely ignored.

                            <para>- Yes ; but if effect had been given to the measure to which I have referred, it would have had a striking effect upon the nation's prosperity. Under this measure, the Government now proposes to repeal that act, and the legal promises it contains, to pay a guaranteed price of 3s. a bushel for last year's harvest. This second measure was approved by the Senate, and I trust that this chamber will reject this proposal for its repeal, concurrently, with the introduction of the Fiduciary Notes Bill, the wheatgrowers were promised 4½d. a bushel on the whole of last year's crop under a measure introduced in another place, but which was abandoned. ' The abandonment of the one measure and the defeat of the other were abundantly justified. This is the fourth measure that has been sent along. It  provides for the payment of 6d. a bushel, with the nasty condition attached to it to which I have referred. I object, unequivocally, to the proposal that if the price of wheat in the markets of the world should reach a figure that will give the wheat-farmer 3s. a bushel f.o.b., he shall receive nothing by way of bounty. I agree with previous speakers, that a simple bounty of 6d. a bushel on all wheat produced is what is required, and that a genuine mistake was made by the recent Premiers Conference when it did not ask for that straight out. </para>

                            <para>- Despite the denial of the honorable senator, I maintain that, except in the case of galvanized iron, industries that have been given bounties have had no limitation placed upon them except a limitation of the total bounty. In this case a limit of £3,000,000 would apply to the wheat farmers' bounty for next harvest. The Commonwealth has not the power to regulate the price that is charged for agricultural, and every other type of machinery. It is only when we come to the wheat-growers, who have been wrecked during the last two years on account of the non-fulfilment of: the promises of assistance that have repeatedly been made, as a result of their wonderful response to the invitation to grow more wheat, that this Parliament is asked to approve of such a limitation. Should three-quarters of the cost of production be obtained, they are not to be given any assistance. They and their families are to work under conditions approaching slavery, and are not to receive even the basic wage. If the banks are responsible for this stipulation, they must be made to realize that in the wheat districts of the Commonwealth, the determination is stiffening not to tolerate the conditions of semi-starvation and hardship under which the wheat-farmers, their families, and their employees, have been working for so long. </para>

In the light of those figures, which were ascertained on sworn evidence, taken only a few months ago, why should the banks, the Government, or any other authority, fix 3s. per bushel f.o.b. as the price at which assistance to the wheat-grower under this measure, shall cease to be given ? </para>

                            <para>- That would not be sufficient, but it would be better than 3s. What I ask is that the Government should make a straight-out request to the banks for a bounty of 6d. per bushel on export production. If that wore granted, and the provisions of this measure relating to the charging of 6d. per bushel on that portion of the crop used for local consumption were operated, we should be doing something to help the wheat-farmer, and the assistance would he on the same unrestricted basis as that which has been given from time to time to many other Australia industries. The figures that I have quoted show clearly that the cost of production under average conditions in Western Australia, where there is cheap land and a regular rainfall, is 3s. 5d. per bushel at the rail head, or slightly over 4s. per bushel f.o.b. Yet under this measure, the farmer is to be restricted to three-quarters of the cost of his production. In connexion with other bounties, it is laid down by law that the employees in the industry shall receive the basic wage. The payment of 3s. per bushel f.o.b. will not represent to the farmer, his sons, or his assistants, even that return, let alone show him a profit on his production, interest on his capital, or any remuneration for  the hardships that he is called upon to endure in the way of long hours, isolated conditions, and the absence of many " of the every-day services, such as water supply, electric light, gas, and other conveniences, that are enjoyed by the people in the cities. I doubt whether, under this measure, he will be allowed to receive even three-quarters of the basic wage before the assistance which it professes to give will be withdrawn. I warn the Government that, the wheat-growers are desperate, and that in them are being awakened forces that it will not be easy to control unless justice is meted out to them.

                    <para class="block">I repeat that there can be little doubt that a genuine mistake was made by the Premiers Conference in connexion with the form in which the request for this assistance was made. It seems to me incredible that unless a mistake waa made, the Commonwealth should be restricted by the lender of the money in regard to the extent to which assistance should be given. This is a most unusual condition, particularly when we consider the amount of money which the wheat-growers owe to the trading banks. In many districts the mortgages held by the banks are so heavy that they are virtually the owners of those districts. The decline that has taken place in the prices of products and the value of land is so great that the owners have little equity in their holdings, and are really only managers for the banks. In those circumstances, the banks would not only assist in the rehabilitation of this nation, and in carrying out the desires of the economists who drew up the Premiers' plan, but also would be conserving their own interests very considerably, if they allowed the wheat-farmers the extra amount which would enable them to meet some of their obligations. A great deal of the money would percolate back to the banks, and relieve their creditors in many other directions. Even from that point of view one would anticipate that the banks would much prefer having the Government as their creditors for th, £3,000,000 rather than that the farmers should be denied overdrafts which would furnish them with money for working expenses, as they will be if this bounty is restricted to wheat at 3s. a bushel f.o.b.

Since the original proposition was made, wheat has increased, until to-day the f.o.b. price is approaching 3s. a bushel. Wheat-growers und Ministers for Agriculture who attended the interstate conference last week pointed out that unless the guarantee price was increased the bounty would be of very little use. </para>
                        <para>Bankers in Victoria are divided on the advisability of grunting the request for an increase. They do not agree with the contention of the Minister for Markets <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parker Moloney)</inline> however, that when the original decision was made the question of a guarantee price was merely incidental to the main consideration of the advance of £3.000,000. </para>

                    <para class="block">According to this press statement the Minister for Markets, who conducted the negotiations, evidently contends that the main consideration of the banks was that the advance should be confined to £8,000,000, and that the guaranteed price of wheat was merely an incidental matter. And to me it seems perfectly reasonable that such should be the case. That being so there is, undoubtedly, a distinct obligation upon the banks to find the whole of the £3,000,000, and on the Government to pay the bounty of 6d. a bushel on all wheat exported without restriction as to what, the price may be at the time the advance is made. </para>

                            <para>- I take it that the Government will approach the banks. The form in which the bill has been submitted makes it clear that even now the negotiations with the banks are not completed; even now the bankers have not given any reply to the request the Government put before them at the instance of the conference of the Minister for Markets with the State Ministers for Agriculture, held in Melbourne on the 16th of this month. </para>

                    <para>I think that a mistake was made by the Premiers Conference in regard to the form of the request put to the banks, and I have no doubt that these institutions would give the £3,000,000 unconditionally if the Government asked for it for the purpose of paying a wheat bounty. We do not know that they have been actually asked to do so. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> said that the request was made for the advance with the restriction which! appears in the bill. That might easily have been the case five or six weeks ago, when the price of wheat was about 2s. 2d. a bushel f.o.b., but to-day it is almost 3s. a bushel f.o.b. I contend that the provisions of this bill did not enter into the consideration of the trading banks. I do not know that those banks were even acquainted with them. The memorandum read by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dooley</inline> this afternoon bore no suggestion that the terms of the Commonwealth Bank had been referred to or approved by the trading banks. If this bill, therefore, is not the response of the Government to the request of the trading banks, I hope that the request put forward by the conference of Ministers  of Agriculture will be submitted to the Commonwealth Bank and the trading banks, in a form quite different from that in which, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly,</inline> it was previously put before the banks. </para>
                    <para>The following telegram which reached me this evening from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> D. Seyfort,  secretary of the Wheat-growers Union in Western Australia, shows the feeling in Western Australia in regard to this bill, and the disappointment it has caused among organized wheat-growers there : - . </para>
                    <para>Please urge on Western Australian senators to put the bounty price limit up to 3s. 6d. f.o.b. in bill before the Senate. Wheat at present is over 3s. per bushel in Fremantle and bounty therefore docs not operate at all. </para>
                    <para class="block">I endorse the request made in the telegram. If it is acceded to the country will be saved the risk of exploitation. Much greater justice will be done to the wheat-farmers if no price limit is fixed and the Government and the banks approve of the bounty being paid up to at least 3s. 6d. f.o.b. for all wheat in the coming harvest. I again contend that the 6d. a bushel bounty should be paid on the whole harvest irrespective of the f.o.b. price. </para>
                    <para>This bill is inequitable in its incidence. So far as Western Australia is concerned, it makes no provision for the fact that the f.o.b. price for wheat at Fremantle is generally l£d. or 2d. per bushel higher than the f.o.b. price in eastern ports. This is due mostly to the lower freight from Fremantle to Great Britain and, in some degree, to the very high quality of Western Australian wheat. Being grown in a dry climate it is eminently suitable for milling purposes. But as a result of getting this higher price the Western Australian farmers will receive 1-Jd. or 2d. a bushel less by way of bounty than the eastern wheat-growers if the payment of the bounty is to he limited to wheat at 3s. a bushel f.o.b. . I am sure that it is not the intention to discriminate between States. The difficulty would be overcome and greater justice done by the payment of a straight-out bounty of 6d. a bushel on all wheat, wherever produced, in the Commonwealth. We would then get the benefit of the higher value and quality of our wheat f.o.b. In fairness, I should point out that the consuming public of Western Australia will enjoy an advantage under this bill because of their smaller contribution to the local consumption price. But that advantage will be of no satisfaction to the Western Australian wheat-grower, who will he deprived of the advantage he derives from growing his wheat closer to the world's markets than the wheatgrowers in the eastern States. </para>
                    <para>Promises have repeatedly been made to the farmers - in fact a law was enacted to provide for it - that they would be paid 3s. a bushel f.o.b. on last year's crop ; but nothing has been done to carry out those promises. I support the bill now under discussion in the hope that the whole of the £3,000,000 promised by the banks will be paid to the wheat-growers on the basis of3s. a bushel for the export crop. We are discussing a machinery measure, which is to some extent unsatisfactory inasmuch as we do not know what the farmers are to receive. We do not know even now whether they are to receive any bounty at all. The whole scheme is dependent on an unascertained amount, and that is the f.o.b. price of wheat, which varies from day to day from one end of Australia to the other. In each port it is different on the same day. It varies in regard to different consignments of wheat forwarded to the same port on the same day. If the f.o.b. price of wheat ranges anywhere within 6d; of the prim at which the bounty operates the scheme in the bill will certainly lend itself to Exploitation of the Government. For instance, in Adelaide yesterday, the f.o.b. price of wheat was 2s. 6½d., whereas at Manilla, a country town in New South Wales, the price on the f.o.b. basis was 2s.11½d. and in other country districts it was 2s. 8d. In Melbourne it was 2s. 10d. and, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Seyfort</inline> informs me in his telegram, it is 3s. in Fremantle to-day. It will be seen, therefore, that great confusion will arise. This measure will be very difficult to administer. It would have been far more preferable if a bounty of 6d. a bushel had been paid on exported wheat irrespective of the world's price. In those circumstances we could be assured that the whole of the bounty would go to the producer, but under the shandygaff scheme contained in this bill, if the price ranges about3s. per bushel f.o.b. there is a distinct danger of half of the bounty not reaching the pockets of the wheat-growers at all. This bill will be a wheat merchants' benefit bill if the price of wheat ranges any when? about 3s. a. bushel. TheGovernment will be paying out and the farmer will not be receiving the whole of the amounts so paid. </para>
                    <para>I arn distressed and amazed to find that for some reason, which has never been explained by the Minister,the Government desires in this bill to repeal the Wheat Advances Act 1930, which provided for the payment of 3s.a bushel f.o.b. on last season's crop. This bill deals with next season's crop. </para>

                            <para>- It is a little difficult to say exactly what I want to say. The action contemplated in this bill, adopted from the Lang plan, should not be approved by this Senate. The Wheat Advances Act 1930, is the only measure passed in 30 years of federation, which has not been observed or honoured. No attempt was made by the CommonwealthGovernment to pay the 3s. a bushel. I have the file of the correspondence between the Government and the Commonwealth Bank in regard to the (payment of that advance.I assume thattheGovernment laid on the table a complete file of the correspondence, and that the file is not mutilated. The bill was passed on the17thDecember, 1930,andon the18th December, the Acting Prime Minister(Mr. Fenton) sent a letter the  chairman  of directors of the Commonwealth Bank, asking him to make the necessary arrangements. A copy of that letter was also sent to the Governor of the bank in Sydney. Then follows complete silence. Nothing happened for several weeks. According to the file, neither <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Gibson nor the Governor of the bank had the courtesy even to acknowledge receipt of the letters. There is nothing on the file to show even that it was received by the Governor of the bank, or that the Acting Prime Minister was given an acknowledgement of its receipt. There was, as I have said, a complete silence from the 18th December, 1980, until the 19th January, 1931. </para>

Contrast the Government's attitude towards our wheatgrowers with its treatment of the Wiluna Gold Mines Limited. When it ascertained that it was unable to provide a certain guarantee for that mining company, it requested the State Government to do so, and undertook to indemnify it. But, because of the legal doubt as to the constitutionality of the bank's position with regard to the payment of 33. per bushel for wheat, the Government promptly and illegally dropped the measure.

I submit that the Government is legally and morally bound to make this payment to the wheatgrowers, and I hope that the Senate will not approve of the repeal of the measure which authorized the payment of it. If the Government cannot find this money it might at least remember that another government may assume office which would enjoy greater credit and be able to raise the money. Before the Wheat Advances Act is repealed, the Government should explore every possible avenue of raising this sum of money. I have an important suggestion to put forward in this connexion. </para>

                            <para>- I assure you, sir, that I have not made the suggestion that I am now about to make. I had intended to submit my proposal by way of motion, but an honorable senator with greater experience in federal politics than I have had, advised me to wait until this bill was under discussion, when, he said, 1 would be able to make it most effectively. I suggest that if the Government cannot find cash to make payments to the wheat-growers in pursuance of the provisions of the Wheat Advances Act, it should make the payment by way of negotiable bonds. It will be remembered that the former Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes.)</inline> paid the war gratuity to soldiers by bonds; and the farmers could be paid in the same way. A bill could be introduced to provide for the issuing of negotiable bonds, and so the will of Parliament could be carried out. </para>

                    <para>I shall support this bill, but I hope that the Government will include in it a provision that a bounty of 6d. a bushel shall be paid on the whole of the wheat exported, irrespective of the f.o.b. price! The principle of paying a flat rate has been adopted in connexion with all the  bounty  bills which this Parliament has previously passed. I urge the adoption of that course in this case with all the more force because it is likely that the f.o.b.  price will reach 3s., in which event no bounty whatever will be payable. I am  3'iijre  that with a little negotiation the banks would make £3,000;000 available for the assistance of the wheat-growers and tot place any restriction upon the expenditure of it. I urge the Government to adopt my suggestion. To take any other course will not only jeopardize the utility of this bill, but also jeopardize the very life of the Government. Why pass a measure Under which with a small-improvement in the world's price for wheat the farmer will again get nothing? 1 submit that our farmers are entitled to a living wage, and should not be put off with something that is less than the cost of production. I regret that the Government desires, to push this bill through without allowing proper time for its consideration. The' measure tra* introduced into the other House only yesterday, and we did not see it until a  few  hours ago. We have not had time to consider properly its numerous and intricate provisions! </para>
                    <para>I had intended to refer to certain other" points, but iri- compliance with your \fJshes, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> I shall not do so until the committee stage of the bill is reached. It is two years since the farmers were first promised a bounty on wheat, and it is high time that something at least should be <inline font-style="italic">paid</inline> to them. </para>

                        <para>. - My first duty is to congratulate the Government upon having introduced this bill, though even while I offer my congratulations, I am conscious of a  villainous  sort of second thought that 1 should examine thyself to see whether 1 kuri really justified in offering any sort nf congratulations to it. But I am pleased that aft*" a period of splendid pretence and masterly inactivity' in respect to the wheat-growers, the Government bag at long last decided to do something. The wheatgrowers are the last people iri the wide world who, in the ord- -nary course, would' even think of asking any one to help them. The 30 years' history of this' Parliament justifies the making of such a remark, for this is the" fs rsl trine that the wheat-growers of Australia have ever appeared1 in the' role df -supplicants for a measure of natural justice. They have generously helped other industries and Australia throughout this long period but have had very meagre acknowledgements of their efforts. It is only because of the special. and most unfortunate circumstances of this industry, that they are now seeking assistance. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>While I have congratulated the Government, I must also remind it now that it is sitting on the stool of repentance) that it is more" than twelve months since it very definitely promised to help the farmers. If the assistance now so tardily proposed to be given had been given then, many farmers would still be living on the countryside, whereas now they have joined the throngs of city dwellers who are living on the dole.' Unfortunately, the Government kept promising the farmers assistance and sympathizing with them, but it is only at this eleventh hour that it has rushed the* bill before Parliament. The best that can be said, therefore,  is  that this is belated sympathy. I realize that under existing circumstances, it is a big undertaking to provide £3,000,000 for the payment of a bounty on wheat. From information placed before us to-night, it appears almost certain that not one penny of that amount will go to the farmers of Western Australia. And if the price but barely equalled the cost of production, I sincerely hope that this will be so for the simple reason that 1 should like to see the wheat-farmers of the State which I represent retain their independence, so that they may not be charged in the future with coming like beggarmen to seek help from the Commonwealth, as the captains of other  induS;  tries hav'e been doing for many years. J have been studying the tariff recently, and J have been struck by the fact thai duties have been provided in the tariff schedule which, in many cases, far exceed the manufacturing costs, duties far it) excess of what some manufacturer* wanted. It cannot be said that the bounty now proposed to be paid  will  bring the price of wheal up to anything like the cost of production, for the point at which the bounty will disappear is 3s. per bushel f.o.b.- It is' manifestly impossible profitably fo produce, wheat in this' country at that price. Any one who suggests that it can bo done, shows gross ignorance of the whole subject. </para>

                            <para>- I believe that some such promise was made; but like many other promises to the farmers, it was not fulfilled. The promises made to the wheatgrowers of Australia have been broken with remarkable regularity. In this regard, we have had an exhibition of the most systematic breaking of promises that I have ever experienced. But now the poor farmers are to be given a few crumbs from some one's table. The farmers - and I challenge contradiction of this statement - have been the foundation of the prosperity of Australia for many a long day. When the first citizen of this Commonwealth, the Prime Minister, sent out an S.O.S. from his sinking ship some time ago, did he appeal to his own supporters? Of course not. He singled out the wheat-growers as the only section of the community who could give substantial help to the country in its time of need; and the farmers manfully rose to the occasion and planted more wheat than they should have planted, and landed themselves deep in debt as a consequence. And they have been left in the soup! It is now proposed to give them some grains of consolation and comfort. I again repeat, however, that 3s. per bushel does not represent the cost of producing wheat in Australia. Professor Perkins, who comes from the same State as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly,</inline> and has no axe to grind, puts the cost of producing wheat in South Australia at 4s. or over per bushel; and South Australia is where our best wheat-farmers are to be found. I say that, although I am a representative of Western Australia. The price of producing wheat in New South Wales is also high. At a recent conference convened by a Labour government at Bathurst the cost of producing wheat was put down, not at 4s., 4s. 6d., or even 5s., hut at 5s. 6d. per bushel. I think it is too high. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> B. Johnston has told us something about the cost of producing wheat in Western Australia, and I know from my own experience in this industry that wheat cannot be produced for 3s. per bushel. Although the collective wisdom of the representatives of the wheat industry of New South Wales put down the cost of production as 5s. 6d. per bushel, the farmers are now being offered 3s. per bushel. </para>

                    <para>Notwithstanding this, I accept the bill and am pleased that the Government is coming to the rescue of the farmers at least to this extent. I do not intend to say any hard words about the banks for not making more money available, for I realize that they have had a tough job to maintain the credit of Australia, and to keep our industries still going. Some people in this country have said that the banks are withholding money from circulation, but I do not believe such statements. An examination of the banking returns from time to time, which are published at the end of every month, will show quite clearly that money which is taken at one end of the bank counter, is passed out at the other end, and so is kept circulating throughout the community. The banks cannot extend credit without having the foundation for doing so. They are circulating among the people the money entrusted to their care. They have no philosopher's stone which enables them to turn wood into gold. I am quite sure that the provision of this £3,000,000 will strain their resources almost to breaking point. </para>

                    <para>There were only three ways in which the Government could have raised the £3,000,000 necessary to pay this bounty. It could have been obtained first, by means of a loan ; secondly, by general taxation on the whole people; and thirdly - and this is the course which any government with  an  atom of political courage would have adopted - by a tax upon flour. If such a tax had been imposed the farmers of Australia would have been helped, and the general public would have been brought to realize how dependent they are upon our wheat-growers. Every man who goes into virgin country to hew down trees with the object of bringing land into cultivation, has to pay a heavy tax on the axe which he uses.From the moment when he puts his axe into the first tree on his block until he has marketed his lust bag of wheat, every tool which he employs in successive operations is subjected to a tax imposed by the Commonwealth Government. But when the same farmer asks that a levy shall be placed upon the flour consumed in this country in order that he may receive some slight return of the taxation he himself has paid, to assist him in meeting his obligations, an overwhelming section of the community rise in their wrath and say, " But consider how it will affect the cost of living." The poor unfortunate farmer is taxed upon his axe, his implements, his cornsacks, his food and drink, and clothing, and practically everything under the sun ; but when it is suggested that a tax should be placed upon flour in order to give him some slight return, the people who have benefited at his expense immediately become highly indignant. </para>
                    <para>I now come to the manner in which the £3,000,000 mentioned in the bill is to be provided. I am rather sorry that the banks have fixed such a low limit, and  am  pleased to find that the Government realise the justice of the claim of increasing the f.o.b. price to 3s. 6d. if that is practicable. But even that figure will not allow the farmer to even up his position.  In  essence, it will at least enable him to slightly reduce his indebtedness. I am rather grateful to the banks for what can be regarded as a patriotic act. Perhaps the thought is dictated by the dire circumstances of the occasion. Further credit, if it may be so termed, must be employed in other directions. The banks realize that other calls will be made upon their resources, and that is why they cannot willingly increase the amount to 3s. 6d. a bushel f.o.b., at least for the present. But it is ray most earnest wish that they will raise the limit to 3s. 6d. </para>
                    <para>In the matter of this bounty I realize that there is a choice between two alternatives.We can have uniformity or resort to what I may term non-uniformity. If we were to spread the whole £3,000,000 over the wheat marketed portion, there would be no trouble at all. It is true that if that were done no advantage could be taken of a rise in price which might occur is the meantime. The price of wheat in hardening, and the £3,000,000 to be provided is intended to fill the void between the price realized by the farmer and that prescribed by the Government. The Government is endeavouring to get a declared price of 3s. or 3s.6d. a bushel f.o.b. It is endeavouring to use the £3,000,000 to bridge the gap between what the farmer will get under present conditions, and the amount the Government proposes to fix after consultation with the banks. After doing that, it may be found that the £3,000,000 is more than sufficient or that it is far short of what is required. Two arbitrary conditions are imposed. There is the rigid limit of £3,000,000 as to the amount te be advanced, and a suggested rigid limit of 3s. or 3s. 6d. a bushel in regard to price. The first rigid limit of £3,000,000 presents certain difficulties. If the total export of wheat next season is more than 120,000,000 bushels, £3,000,000 will be quite insufficient to provide a bounty of 6d. a bushel. If, again, the price of wheat should drop to 2s. a bushel, £3,000,000 will be totally inadequate. For instance, if the price is 3s. a bushel, and something should occur to cause it to drop to 2s. a bushel, there will be a difference of1s. between the two extreme points. The sum of £3,000,000 would not provide anything approaching a bounty of 6d. a bushel.  on the total production. If the market moves downwards, £3,000,000 will not do the job, and if it goes up the full amount may not be required. </para>
                    <para>I direct the attention of honorable senators to the provision relating to the private buyers of wheat. This measure throws upon private buyers the responsibility of issuing certificates to growers, stating the f.o.b. equivalent of the price per bushel paid or to be paid for the wheat. How is the difficulty to be overcome in the case of private buyers, who will be called upon to fix a price for wheat which may be sold from three, six or nine months afterwards? How can a private buyer of wheat issue a satisfactory certificate in the case of a commodity which may be marketed months after it is purchased? He will certainly secure himself by estimating a low final figure. The point is covered in the case of organizations or corporations, but no similar provision is made with respect to private individuals. </para>
                    <para>Sub-clause 5 of clause 6 deals with " dockage." Any person who sells inferior wheat should not enjoy the same advantage as one who sells f.a.q. wheat. A person who does not look after his business and produce wheat of fair average quality should bear the penalty. The two additional charges for which provision is made require a good deal of explanation, as an f.o.b. price is a recognized figure in every part of Australia. 1 welcome this bill, nevertheless, as an earnest endeavour on. the part of the Government to do something in the interests of the wheatgrowers. I am sorry that the occasion has arisen for the wheat producers of Australia to make this appeal to the Government. Had they been left to their own initiative, they would never have been compelled to seek assistance in this form. Neither would it have been necessary for my colleagues or myself to put the case for them. They would rather be the donors than the receivers of any benefits. They have been forced into this position owing to an unfortunate combination of circumstances. They are now asking for assistance which in comparison with that afforded by them to other industries is imperceptible. My earnest hope is that the occasion will not arise for the wheat-growers to approach the federal authorities in future. This bill will at least afford them some relief to which they are entitled, and I earnestly hope that their just claims will speedily be met. </para>

                        <para>. - In the first place 1 should like to reply to the pleasantries of the genial Minister in charge of this measure, who dealt with this important subject from what I shall term a political viewpoint. If he desires me to review the action of the Government of which he is a member in connexion with the wheat industry, and the effect of its action prior to and subsequent to the last general election, I may inform him that as a result of promises made by it not only on the hustings, but in subsequent legislation, a loss of millions of pounds sterling has resulted to the farmers of this country. When the wheat-growers were promised «by a representative of Labour 6s. 6d. a bushel what was their outlook? What view did they take of the position? They imagined that there  wa6  some substance in what eventually proved to be empty promises. As they had been promised 6s. 6d. a bushel, they held on to their wheat on a falling market, and. subsequently when a guaranteed price of 4s. a bushel was promised they were again induced to hold their product. Eventually, when the market dropped, they suffered a considerable loss. Again when 3s. a bushel was guaranteed the same thing transpired. I regret exceedingly that the Minister should have dealt, with this subject from a political aspect, because the time will soon arrive when we shall have to justify our actions before those who sent us here. Honorable senators on this side of the chamber will then have ah opportunity to expound their views on the utter ineptitude of the Government in dealing with the wheat question. We have now another proposal before us concerning which I wish to make a few observations. It embodies a proposal submitted by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> when the Government first proposed to pay a guaranteed price of 4s. a bushel, and to establish a compulsory  wheat pool. The members of the Opposition were then prepared to give the wheat-farmers a bounty of 6d. a bushel as is provided in this measure.-* It seems to me that when this Government sets out to do the simplest thing in the matter of taxing the people or in the making of a grant to the wheat-farmers, it has the habit of obscuring to the greatest possible degree the object which it has in view. This measure, which I have only had a short time to peruse, brings my mind into a state of utter dislocation, and leaves me utterly incompetent to grapple with what it is intended to accomplish. I fail to understand why the Government should persist with a bill of this nature when there is so little difference, in the matter of the cost to the taxpayer, between doing something in a definite and concrete form and in a way which it could be easily administered and doing it in this complicated way. Probably the complexity has arisen through a lack of understanding of the wheat business. A consideration of the provisions of this bill involves an understanding not only of wheat-growing, but also of wheat-marketing. It is quite obvious that if something had been done in the direction first indicated of providing an export bounty on wheat the complexities with which we are now confronted would not have arisen. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> referred to the difficulties that must be associated with the effective administration of such a measure as this. Knowing as I do what happened in relation to the wheat pools that were in operation during the period of the war, I can see what opportunities there are for fraud in connexion with the administration of this measure. It is my intention a little later to ask leave to continue my remarks, in order that we may have an opportunity to study this measure more closely so that we may endeavour to formulate amendments that will simplify it and eliminate those objectionable features to which I have referred. Before doing so, however, I wish to recapitulate for the guidance of the Minister, some of the difficulties with which I am faced. In the first place, I direct his attention to the absence of any provision with respect to stored wheat. I understand that not only do the merchants buy wheat, but they also receive tremendous quantities for storage, the growers retaining control over it for all time, and being able to dispose of it or hold it as they think fit. At one time the smaller voluntary pools received wheat in exactly the same way; they had the sheds and other facilities necessary for storage, and accepted it for that purpose. No provision is made in this measure for the man who elects to hold his wheat in that way to receive any assistance by way of a bounty, or to be given a certificate by any authority. The wheat covered by this bill is that which has been sold or delivered for sale to a licensee. But let us examine- the position that exists between prescribed co-operative organizations and the merchants who buy wheat. Discussing this matter with other honorable senators, I have learned that their state of mental fog is as great as mine. Let us assume that on a given date, say the 1st November next, the price of f.a.q. wheat is 2s. 6d. per bushel. A private firm buys at that figure, and gives to the grower a certificate upon which he proceeds to draw from the Commonwealth Bank the bounty of 6d. per bushel in respect of every bushel that he has put in. A pool acquires on the same date a similar quantity of wheat at the sam* price, giving its certificate to the grower, who proceeds to cash it. Ten days later the price of wheat has risen to 3s. per bushel. What happens? The buyer of the wheat receives 6d. per bushel, but the pool has to refund that amount to the Government. There can be only one result: the whole of the wheat will be placed in the hands of those who are prepared to buy it; there will be an out and out sale, and the outcome must be that a number of pools will go out of existence. I believe in the maintenance of voluntary pools, just as one believes in the operation of the totalisator in competition with the bookmaker. With pools in existence, the farmers can elect either to hand over their wheat, or to sell it outright. Some may choose to adopt both courses - send half of their crop to the pool, and dispose of the other half; or they may divide it into three parts, storing one, selling another, and leaving the third with the pool. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Some extraordinary difficulties are presented by the provisions of clause 6. If the position, as those who are skilled in wheat marketing see it, were placed before the banks, upon whom the Government has to rely to find the money for this bounty, I believe that they would say, " We will accept a proposal in the nature of a straight out bounty, for which we will find the money, and you can. apply the provisions of those clauses which relate to the obtaining of an increased price for the wheat that is consumed locally." That would be a much simpler way of handling the matter. It would work less unjustly to everybody concerned, and keep in existence the voluntary pools, which are such a useful adjunct to the wheat-grower. </para>
                    <para>The whole of clause 6 will have to he considerably clarified before I shall be able to accept any responsibility for this measure.I cannot adopt the view expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene,</inline> that we should throw on the Government the responsibility for the bill. I realize the difficulties in which the Government has been placed. This legislation is the outcome of the Premiers Conference, and there is a partial connexion between it and the plan of financial rehabilitation. There has been some negotiation concerning it; but sufficient time has elapsed since the communication of the bank was received by the Government on the 7 th October for a much longer period to have been allowed to this and another place for its consideration. A very close examination of it is necessary, because some of the difficulties that present themselves appear to be insuperable,I have discussed with other honorable senators the likelihood of pools making a much lower advance, hut I have been informed that they advance only up to about 80 per cent. of the amount received, and that that will probably enable them to make the refunds provided for in: the; measure. </para>
                    <para>The bill makes provision for the payment of a bounty: It is true that that is within the scope of the authority of this Parliament.

I doubt whether that provision is within the competently of this </para>
                    <para class="block">Parliament to enact After all, it is the grower whom we desire to assist, and the probability is that that provision was inserted by the Government with a view to assisting him. My unconsidered view, however, is that it will be utterly futile, and that all the remedies provided by State law will be available to the creditors of the wheat-growers. </para>
                    <para>There is another aspect that evidently has had scant consideration from those who have been responsible for the drafting of this legislation. I refer to the position that will arise in connexion with a person who holds a bill of sale or a lieu upon the wheat of any grower. He would not be entitled to be given the certificate that has to be issued upon delivery of the wheat, because the bounty must go to the grower. Yet he has property te the wheat. It is by no means certain what redress the co-operative pooling society would have against the person who received the bounty. </para>
                    <para>Even at the risk of detaining members of another place, the Government would be well-advised te endeavour to recast this measure. It can be made so elastic as to be easily handled.

                    PEARCE (Western Australia) [10.18].  -  I should like to know if the Government has had brought under its notice a press report that, at a meeting of the seamen held in Sydney to-day to receive the report of the delegates who attended the conciliation conference in Melbourne, over the trouble to which I made reference yesterday, a resolution was carried calling out the crews on all ships engaged in the interstate trade. If the Government has had an opportunity to see that report, I should like to know whether it has given consideration to it, and whether it is contemplating any action to protect the trade and commerce of this country.
