                    <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">by leave</inline> - When I awoke from my slumbers this morning I was faced with a newspaper containing great headlines which stated that last evening I defended communism in the Senate. I did not know that there was any need for me to do this, for it has always seemed to me that the communists are quite able to do it for themselves. I thought that I was making a defence of the right of free speech. I was a little surprised also on reading the report of the speech of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> to find that he had put a construction upon my remarks which was very far from my thoughts. I know that he had no desire to be unfair to me; at least, I should be very loth to think so. Under the Standing Orders I had no right to reply to his remarks last night, and it is for that reason that 1 have obtained leave to make this statement. The construction that can be put upon words is sometimes rather amazing. I have given careful thought to the words that I used last night, as recorded by <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and I cannot see very much wrong in them. I cannot see that they should give offence to any one. I certainly had no desire to reflect on any one's religious beliefs, though some of my friends appear to think that I had such a desire. That is not a thing in which I indulge. It is to make these points clear that I am offering this explanation. I hope that the press of this country which gave so much prominence to my remarks last night will be generous enough to give equal prominence to what I am saying now. </para>

                    - I certainly had no desire to misrepresent the Leader of the Government, but I assure him that the words which he used last night conveyed to my mind, and in speaking to several others after the Senate rose, I found that they also conveyed to their minds, the impression that the honorable gentleman had made a comparison between communism and the Saviour, the Founder of Christianity, and had drawn a similarity between them in regard to doctrines and methods. That was my impression.

                <para>- As this is a bill eminently suited for discussion in committee, I shall not speak at length on it at this stage. But it is an important measure, and there are several points to which I wish to allude. Like other honorable senators, I voice my protest against the long delay that has taken place in submitting this measure to Parliament for consideration. Many of the duties provided in the schedule have been in operation for a considerable period. In my opinion, it is wrong for the administration to put such heavy duties into effect without giving Parliament an opportunity of discussing them. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. That some of them have needed reconsideration is borne out by the fact that the Government has altered a number of them since the first of the schedules which are now consolidated was tabled in another place. I support the protests made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> and others who said that in many cases the reports of the Tariff Board have been ignored by the Government, and that in others it has acted entirely on its own initiative in imposing higher duties. Those who were members of the Senate when the Tariff Board was appointed will remember that it was specifically provided that the board, which has power only to recommend to Parliament, was given authority under the act to conduct a thorough investigation into all tariff matters, and to recommend to the Government prior to any action being taken by Parliament. It was recognized by the government of the day that Parliament, the Minister, and the department were at a great disadvantage in not having the necessary machinery to enable exhaustive inquiries to be made with respect to applications for higher or lower duties. Unfortunately, this Government has taken little or no notice of the Tariff Board's recommendations, aud in many instances higher duties have been imposed without any recommendations at all having been made by the board. The result is that information is not available with respect to many of the items on which higher duties have been imposed. The Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Customs in this chamber is in a more favorable position than other honorable senators, and, doubtless, will supply information which should bc . before us now when the schedule is under consideration in committee. In the absence of any recommendation from the Tariff Board, honorable senators are at great disadvantage in discussing many of the duties embodied in the schedule. </para>

                    <para>I think I am safe in saying that a shorter second- reading speech has never been delivered by any Minister in charge of a tariff measure in this chamber than that delivered by the Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Daly)</inline> a week or two ago. In effect, he threw this schedule at us and said, "Here you are. Any information required can be given in committee ". No details were given and the principle upon which the tariff schedule is based was not explained. </para>
                    <para>I protest against the attitude adopted by honorable senators who regard those opposed to unnecessarily high duties as anti- Australians or freetraders.

He said a good deal with which I am in entire agreement; but I resent his insinuation that any one who is not prepared to " hit the roof " in the matter of" tariff duties is a freetrader and indifferent to the welfare of this country. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Halloran</inline> adopted a somewhat similar attitude. </para>

                    <para class="block">The attitude of honorable senators on this side of the chamber will show that they are always ready to render every possible assistance to protect Australia's secondary and primary industries. I have always supported a protectionist policy, and I intend to do so in this instance. A supporter of a protectionist policy does not necessarily have to vote for every item in the schedule carrying an enormous increase in duty. </para>
                    <para>A careful analysis of the policy adopted by the Bruce-Page Government will clearly show that many of the industries established in Australia have been able to continue in operation in consequence of the generous treatment they received from that Government. It is unreasonable to suggest that honorable senators on this side of the chamber who believe that this schedule should be carefully scrutinized are anxious to throw open our ports, and allow foreign goods to be dumped into this country regardless of the country of origin or the conditions under which the goods are manufactured. I remind honorable senators opposite of the benefits obtained by some of the primary industries from the Bruce-Page Government which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Halloran</inline> went to so much trouble to condemn. For instance, the Dairy Export Control Board appointed by the previous Government, enabled those engaged in the dairying industry in Australia to participate in an orderly marketing -scheme which has been of great benefit to them. The sugar industry in Queensland - a great primary industry which is of vital importance to Australia - was safeguarded, in the first instance, by the action of the Bruce-Page Government. It is to the credit of that Government that it took the stand it did to protect that industry which has rendered such service to Australia. The dried fruits industry was practically saved from extinction by the action of the late Government, which was instrumental  in having land made available, and afterwards appointing a board to investigate the disabilities under which those engaged in the industry were operating. In many instances their debts were wiped off, and they were given a fresh start. </para>

                    <para> - The preferences were obtained from the Baldwin Government when the previous Government was in power, but I was referring more particularly to the financial grants made available to fruit-growers in the Murray area, and to the fact that during the period the Bruce-Page Government was in office, a board was appointed to investigate cases of hardship. </para>

                    <para>We must study the position in which this country finds itself to-day  as  compared with that which existed when the previous Government was in office. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Halloran</inline> stated that I am fond of reminding the Senate that to-day there are 400,000 workers out of employment in Australia, whereas at no time during the term of office of the Bruce-Page Government did the number exceed 100,000. Even the latter figure is probably an over estimate of the number who were unemployed at that time, since it was the number quoted by Labour candidates when urging the electors to return a Labour government, so that the problem of unemployment would be dealt with. Notwithstanding that the present Government has been in office for two years, and has had every opportunity to put its policy into operation, unemployment has increased fourfold. The unemployed are now told by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Halloran</inline> and other honorable senators opposite, that their numbers would be 600,000, instead of 400,000, had not the present Government been in office during the last two years. A statement of. that kind will give little satisfaction to men who have been waiting two years for the Government to find work for them. </para>

                        quoted a list of articles, the importation of which was prohibited by the Government. It is generally admitted that the slump in trade and the high exchange rates would have been sufficient to keep out many of the articles without any prohibition. I have a good deal of sympathy with the policy of prohibiting certain imports. Many of the articles included in the list are things that we can do without, especially when, by prohibiting their importation, we are assisting to adjust our trade balance with other countries. The fact remains, however, that the burden of these prohibitions falls on one section of the community-the primary producers of this country. Prom every election platform at every election candidates emphasize the importance to Australia of the wheat and wool industries, and point out that our national progress is bound up with their prosperity. Recent events have shown that Australia's prosperity does, indeed, depend on those two industries. Concurrently, with the fall in the prices of wheat and wool, there was an increase in unemployment; and only when the prices of those commodities rose again did the outlook of the people once more become optimistic. Almost immediately the increased prices realized for wheat and wool were announced industrial stocks rose appreciably. The condition of the wheat and wool industries is a barometer of Australia's prosperity.

Among them are barbed wire, cultivators, harrows, stump-jump ploughs, drills, fertilizers, seeds and grain, reaper threshers and harvesters, including stripper harvesters, horsedrawn hay rakes, chaff cutters and horsedrawn agricultural scarifiers. Those articles comprise the tools of trade of the men engaged in our two greatest primary industries. At  the time when the returns from their labour are lower than ever their very tools of trade are placed on the prohibited list, and they are debarred from buying them in the cheapest market! It is cruel to treat them in that way. </para>

                    <para>We have heard a good deal about Australia's generosity in the matter of preference to Great Britain in this tariff schedule. I agree with those honorable senators who have said that the preference granted to Great Britain is practically meaningless. The British preferential rates have been fixed so high that it is almost impossible for Britain to sell her goods in this country. The foreign duties, of course, are higher than the British rates, and then we are told that British preference is given to the extent of some £10,000,000 a year. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> has dealt fully with that aspect of the tariff, and I do not now propose to discuss it further. </para>
                    <para>I was pleased to notice, on reference to the press this morning, that the British Government has decided to hold the Imperial Economic Conference next July, either in Ottawa or London, and I was particularly gratified to learn that the date fixed was next July, because the federal election will then have taken place, and the representatives of Australia will be able to attend the conference after having heard the voice of the people expressed in regard to preferential inter-Empire trade. I hope that, as the result of that conference, real Empire preference will be achieved. The United Australia Party, of which I have the honour to be a member, stands foursquare for British preference and Empire unity, and as a result of the next election a representative of that party will, I think, attend the Imperial Economic Conference on behalf of Australia. </para>

                            <para>- I am justified in drawing attention to the fact that there are moral and sentimental, apart from purely commercial reasons, why we should trade with the old Motherland. I have no desire to see dumped into Australia from Britain, or any other country, goods that are likely to injure industries which have been, or are being, established in Australia. We should not overlook the fact that we have been privileged to live under the British flag, and that the great defence system of Britain has given such protection to us that we have been able to develop this country for over 100 years without fear of invasion. But for the might of Britain, there would have been little or no opportunity to develop Australia with a population drawn from the white races. It is hardly consistent for us to say, in effect, to the Mother Country, " We do not want your goods or your people",when we have been very glad in the past to be defended by Britain. Moreover, large sums of money have been made available by Britain for the purpose of developing Australia. I believe that, as the result of the recent election in Great Britain, we are on the threshold of greatly increased inter-Empire trade, and a much closer trade relationship, particularly between Australia and Great Britain in connexion with our primary and secondary industries. </para>

The reason why American cars have obtained such a grip on the Australian market is not only that they are considered more suitable than British cars for our conditions - a point which I dispute - but also that distributors in Australia have held joint agencies for British and American cars, -and on° account of the higher commission and the more favorable conditions which the American manufacturers have made available to their agents in Australia, the American article has been pushed by &gt;the local distributors. </para>

I would buy from the United States of America only the things that I absolutely need, and cannot obtain from Great Britain, because that country has been prepared to take every possible shilling out of Australia, while on every occasion when we have tried to secure a market in the United States of America for our primary products, high duties have been imposed, with the result that our products have been practically excluded. In view of our adverse trade balance with the United States of America, I would encourage the importation of the products of that country only when they are useful to us as raw material, or necessary in other ways to our development. I have noticed that salesmen employed in agencies that handle both British and American motor cars are ever ready to push the sale of the latter in preference to the British article. If British firms had established their own distributing companies in Australia, and had adopted methods of organization similar to those practised by American companies, they would 'have largely increased their sales in Australia. </para>

                    <para>Not only this Government, but previous governments also, have developed the habit of relying too much upon the customs for their revenue. As a result, the revenue obtained when the customs returns were buoyant was taken as the standard. During the regime of the last Government the average return from the customs was about £42,000,000 a year, and that was looked upon by honorable members of all parties in Parliament as something that was likely to be maintained. lt must have been obvious, however, that if the policy of protection wa3 to be successful, customs revenue must fall, and the revenue necessary to meet. our obligations would- have to be found in some other way. When customs revenue was buoyant, direct taxation was considerably reduced, with the result that, when customs revenue fell away, direct taxation bad to be increased. During the boom time, when industry would have been able to bear heavier taxation, such taxation was, in fact, reduced ; now, when industry is suffering from the depression, it is being called upon to bear heavier taxation than during prosperous times. The proper thing would be to collect more taxation in good times, so that it might be reduced during times of depression. </para>

The matter has been discussed by a large section of those who were recently returned to the House of Commons, but, with the exception of the previously existing duties, some of which were for purely revenue purposes, and some for safeguarding industries, Great Britain remains freetrade, and there has been no alteration of her fiscal policy.

                            <para>- Unfortunately, Great Britain has always been the dumping ground for foreigners. Even the most ardent advocates of tariff reform in Great Britain have always maintained that foodstuffs should be either free, or should bear only a very low rate of duty. The late Joseph Chamberlain, I think, always stipulated that high duties should not be imposed on foodstuffs and raw materials. </para>

                    <para>Tariff reform in Great Britain is likely to take the form of protective duties on manufactured goods, and a quota system for foodstuffs. Under' that quota system, I hope it will be possible for Australia to secure a greater market for its primary products. Wemust, however, bear in mind, that, coin&gt;pared with the Australian standard,, wages are low in Great Britain, although the real wage is probably about the same in both countries because of the greater' purchasing power of the English* sovereign. Great Britain i3 dependent on importations of foodstuffs, and an increase in the cost of those foodstuffs, because of the imposition of customs  duties, would therefore be a serious matter to many people. The problem was being fully discussed in. the press of Great Britain whilst I was in London. A quota system would provide an assured market for dominion products, and would, therefore, be of tremendous advantage to Australia. With such a system in operation, we could enter more readily into the spirit of closer Empire trade, knowing that the things we produce could be made available for the people of Great Britain who need them, whilst, in return, we could absorb the output of some of the British factories. </para>
                    <para>Although some of the duties imposed by the United States of America have recently been increased, the average rate of duty in that country is only 15 per cent, compared with 28 per cent, in Australia. One of our difficulties is that our factories have developed beyond the requirements of the home market. Many of them are not working full time. Some attribute this to the reduced purchasing power of the community, but that is not the only cause. Many of our boot factories and woollen mills are turning out more than the Australian market can absorb. Although there are close to this country millions of people who are every day in the week buying articles similar to those produced in the Australian factories, immediately an Australian factory meets the full requirements of the local market, it halts there. Apparently it is hopeless for the Australian manufacturer to look overseas for a market. Except for some commodities like flour, tinned fruits, condensed milk and biscuits, the Malayan States buy nothing from Australia, whereas from the United States of America they buy thousands of pounds worth of goods similar to those manufactured in Australian factories. During recent years, Java has probably bought millions of pounds worth of railway rolling-stock. Australia has modern workshops fully equipped with up-to-date machinery for turning out that material, but has not been able to secure a share of that Java trade. </para>

                    <para>SenatorFOLL. - America probably takes money for what it sells to Java. If we could tender at a sufficiently low . price for the rolling-stock required by Java, no doubt our lender would be accepted, and the people of Java would not concern themselves very much whether they paid for their requirements in bananas or money. Our principal difficulty in Australia is that when a company sets about establishing a factory, it does so with the full knowledge that it has only the limited home market to supply; whereas in the United States of America, Germany, Great Britain, or Japan, the probabilities are that very little attention is paid to the requirements of the home market. When a new company is being formed in those great manufacturing countries to establish a line of manufacture, it looks to the world for its market. In Great Britain, I had an opportunity to see factories manufacturing goods which were to be sold in Germany despite the heavy tariff that Germany was imposing. </para>
                    <para>The Australian manufacturer is limited to the local market, and the Labour party has probably done more than any other party in Australia to restrict that market. Even in the time of the Fisher Government, no encouragement was given to migration. I remember the time in Queensland when every migrant could get work at once. If a man went out west looking for employment, he would probably be met at the railway station by two or three agents offering him work. He would have the choice of two or three jobs. Yet some sort of embargo was placed on migration by the Fisher Government. </para>

                            <para>- The greatest migration to Australia took place during the gold rush. When the Fisher Government was in power, it certainly placed some sort of embargo on the entry of migrants, but the Queensland migration arrangements were solely under the control of the State Government. One would imagine that the development of the secondary industries would have provided more employment and encouraged the influx of population from overseas, but statistics show that New Zealand,  which has a comparatively low tariff, the duties averaging about 15 or 20 per cent., has enjoyed a greater proportionate increase of population during the last 30 years than has the Commonwealth. In 1891, the population of Australia was 2,250,194. By the 31st March, 1901, it had increased to 3,373,801- a satisfactorily rapid advance. During the same period the population of New Zealand increased from 626,658 to 772,719. In 1901 federation became an accomplished fact, and the tariff policy of Australia passed to the control of the Commonwealth Parliament. The slower growth of our population in the succeeding years is significant. By the 30th June, 1931, Australia's population had grown to 6,500,536, an increase in 30 years of less than 100 per cent. In the 30 years New Zealand's population rose from 772,719 to 1,510,914. That dominion cannot be regarded as having greater natural advantages than Australia. We have vast primary industries, metals of all kinds, secondary industries established throughout the Commonwealth, and extensive coal deposits and forests. Having regard to all these advantages there must be something wrong with our policy, when New Zealand, which is very little larger than the State of Victoria,has a relatively greater increase of population than the Commonwealth. </para>

                    </continue>
                    <para>The figures for the last ten years during which very high customs duties have operated are even more striking. Despite an extensive migration scheme, which cost Australia millions of pounds, our population rose slowly; from 5,435,734 at the 30th June, 1921, it advanced to 6,500,536 at the end of last June, an increase of only 17 per cent. during the decade. In that period New Zealand, which, I believe, has not spent nearly as much as Australia on migration, increased its population from 1,218,000 to 1,510,914, a growth of approximately 25 per cent. That dominion is not nearer to the great centres of population, and is not naturally more attractive to migrants than is Australia; yet its increase of population was8 per cent. greater than that of Australia. I remind the Senate, too, that during the last ten years the Commonwealth and States have borrowed enormous sums and. incurred heavy expenditure in the development of primary and secondary production. Our industries have been heavily protected, and the prices of primary products have been high; yet, despite the apparent ability of the country to maintain many more people, the increase of population has been relatively small. Had the increase been at the same rate as in New Zealand, our population to-day would be 400,000 greater than it is. </para>

                            <para>asked a few moments ago whether I thought that we should bring migrants to Australia at the present time. I agree that we cannot introduce more people during the present period of unemployment, but had we given more attention to migration in the past, and increased our population in the same proportion as New Zealand, probably a good deal of the present unemployment would have been avoided. The lack of work for many of our people is largely due to under population; we control a large continent, we have been obliged to expend heavily on public works, and the overhead costs are too great a burden on a small population. The boot manufacturers, woollen millers, producers of dried fruits, and various other sections of producers, would be very much better off if they were catering for a bigger local market. [Extension <inline font-style="italic">oftime granted.]</inline> Over production would have been avoided had our population increased in the same ratio as that of New Zealand. One of the earliest matters to receive attention by any government that may be in office when the worst of the present depression is past, will be an increase of our population with a view to providing a greater local market for our industries. </para>

It would seem that the argument that a country must build up her secondary industries in order to progress is not borne out, for New Zealand has concentrated upon primary industries and has relied upon a relatively low tariff. She has increased her population while ours is decreasing. </para>

It has been gratifying to our people generally to know that our woollen industry has made such great strides in recent years; but it must be apparent . to everybody that too many mills have been established here. At first our woollen manufacturers concentrated their attention upon the manufacture of flannels and blankets. In the course of time the market for these articles became over supplied. Our manufacturers then turned their attention to a more lucrative branch of the industry - the manufacture of worsteds. Factories were established in many places, regardless of economic considerations. Many little country towns received attention from company promoters, and mills were established largely because of the advocacy of the agents of woollen mills machinery. I do not think that this applies so much to Victoria as to New </para>

If I am satisfied that certain duties are necessary for the proper development of this industry, I shall vote in favour of them. But I was surprised the other day to read a. statement of a visiting English lady to the effect that blankets were being sold in Australia more cheaply than in Great Britain. If this is so why is there the need for such heavy protection ? We have a 30 per cent. exchange, primage duty, freight, insurance, and customs duties to give protection to this industry, and yet, I understand, still higher customs duties are being sought. </para>

                    <para>SenatorFOLL. - That is what I should like to know. A gentleman who was in Canberra last week showed us samples of the products of certain Victorian woollen mills. They seemed to me, as a layman, to be of excellent quality. We were told that these goods were selling in Australia at the same price as similar goods were selling for in Great Britain. In these circumstances, it is surely pertinent to ask, first, why there should be any need for additional duties; and, secondly, why we have not a substantial export trade? </para>
                    <para>SenatorO'Halloran. - The statements made by the honorable senator are at variance with those contained in the Tariff Board report. </para>
                    <para>SenatorFOLL. - The Tariff Board report criticizes the present tariff policy in many respects. It is extraordinary that our greasy wool can be taken 14,000 miles overseas, scoured, made into tops, spun, turned into worsted, and sent back to Australia at a heavy return freight to enter into serious competition with woollen materials made in Australia. I have always wondered why it is necessary for us to export greasy wool. Why cannot we manufacture all our greasy wool into tops and hold sales of wool tops instead of greasy wool? I understand that some of the overseas manufacturers prefer to scour the greasy wool according to their own methods; but I look forward to the time when we shall scour all our own wool. I shall support any duties that I consider to be essential for the encouragement of the woollen industry ; but I hope that the Minister in charge of this bill will give us more information about the necessity for these duties than has hitherto been made available. </para>
                    <para>Another item in respect of which I shall expect additional information relates to storage batteries. To-day, storage batteries are on the prohibited list. When they were placed in that category, imported batteries were selling for approximately 25 per cent. more than the locally manufactured batteries. In these circumstances, can it be said that there was any real competition? I understand that there has been a certain amount of complaint regarding the quality of the locally made batteries. In fact, the Minister for Customs gave permission to one gramophone record company to import batteries, although other companies were prohibited from doing so. This shows that the honorable gentleman was satisfied that the local batteries were not all that they might be. If our Australian batteries are of first class quality, there is no need for this gramophone record company to import batteries. I understand that the company to which I have referred has been granted permission to import Columbia batteries, although the people outback in Australia, who require dry batteries for their wireless sets and starter batteries for their motor cars, tractors, &amp;c, are forced to buy Australian-made batteries. </para>

                    <para>The building industry has probably been hit harder than any other industry in Australia. In my opinion, the very high cost of building material is largely responsible for this. A builder told me not very long ago that one union, with which the men he employs are connected, had 90 per cent, of its total membership Unemployed. He said that men had come to him pleading for work for a few shillings a day. I know that the unemployment in this industry has been caused by a number of factors; but I have no doubt whatever that the high cost of building material is blameable to a considerable extent. To-day, the man who desires to build a block of offices in a city, or to knock up a cow shed in the country, or to build a suburban home, finds the cost' of building out of all proportion to what it was a few years ago. The price of timber is a vital consideration in the cost of building. Many of our people think that the importation of softwoods .must necessarily restrict the use of our own hardwoods. I have gone t'o a good deal of trouble to investigate this subject, both in my own State and in other parts of' the Commonwealth, and I have formed the opinion that softwoods and hardwoods are not competitors to any great extent. There is a proper use for both hard and soft woods in the same building. It seems to me that if we restrict the use of softwoods we shall also reduce the demand for hardwoods. The imposition of heavy duties on. Oregon has not had the effect of increasing, very greatly, the use of hardwoods. In practically all building operations, hard and soft woods alike are needed. Queensland is practically the only State in the Commonwealth producing softwoods in any quantity. I do not think Australia could have carried on during the ten or fifteen years when building operations were booming had it been compelled to depend solely upon the supply of local timbers. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Swain,</inline> the Forestry Commissioner of Queensland, in his report for the year ended the 30th June, 1929', said- </para>

                        <para>The native saw-milling industry lias been encouraged in. past years to develop overcrowded proportions by the ready availability of raw material from forests alienated by the Crown and in process of clearing. With the exhaustion of these private supplies the State forests are proving inadequate to carry the existing saw-milling capacity of the State. The normal consumption of softwood in Queensland is 100 super, feet of sawn timber <inline font-style="italic">per</inline><inline font-style="italic">capita</inline> per annum, equal to, say, 130 super, feet of log timber, or, for the present population of 900,000 souls, 117,000,000 super, feet, at which rate the native pineries of Queensland would be finally cut out in twelve years1 time. This time will be lengthened by the rationing policy of the board. </para>

                    <para>The Forestry Department of Queensland, finding that the depletion of the softwoods had reached such alarming proportions, has for. years deemed it necessary to ration the quantity made available to the saw-millers. It is practically impossible for the whole of the softwood requirements of Australia to be supplied by our own mills, and it will always be necessary to depend upon the importation of a certain quantity. The Tariff Board, after investigating the position very exhaustively, more particularly with respect to the quantity of Oregon pine used in the different States, says - </para>

                        <para>Dealing first with the effect on the Australian timber industry, information available to the board appears to establish ns a fact that, notwithstanding any action which might be taken as the result of the conference, it will still be necessary for a considerable  quantity  of Oregon to be imported for purposes for which it is essential, or, if not absolutely essential, at any rate the most suitable'. Amongst those purposes might be mentioned forming for concrete work and scaffolding. Even in hardwood, producing States like Tasmania and Western Australia, Oregon appears to be used for these purposes. Other uses to which Oregon is put, apart from the matter of price, are heavy beams,  shoreing,  gantry work, and for wood pipes. Oregon can <inline font-style="italic">bp</inline> obtained  in greater lengths than it is possible to secure in hardwoods, and for that reason it is particularly valuable where long spans have to be bridged. A considerable proportion of the Oregon imported is " clear " Oregon, which is used, for special purposes, and is only partly competitive with Australian hardwoods. The board is of the opinion that to meet the special requirements referred to the importation of considerable quantities <inline font-style="italic">of oregan</inline> will continue, unless, of course, importation is made prohibitive. If importation were actually blocked, substitutes would necessarily have to be found, but the board considers that for many purposes the job would suffer seriously by the substitution. </para>

                    <para>In dealing with the cost of building to the individual, the board goes on to point out that unless it is possible to import soft timbers for use in conjunction with our Australian hardwoods, the cost of construction will be largely increased.

                            <para>- Yes. When they were in office they used the State forests purely for the purpose of obtaining revenue. I would not offer such strong opposition to the policy adopted had a scheme of reafforestation been embarked upon ; but the whole of the money derived from this source, and which in one year amounted to £300,000, has been paid into the Consolidated Revenue. Unfortunately, this money, which should have been used in reafforestation, was employed by the previous Queensland Government in. establishing State butcher shops and other State undertakings, with disastrous results. The Queensland forests are now largely depleted, and the price of timber has increased out of all proportion to its value. It should be the policy of all Australian governments to conserve the forests in the areas under their control, and to replace all trees that have been removed. I know that it is necessary to utilize the timber in all trees before they become " ringy," but adequate provision should be made for reafforestation in order to provide against the time when softwood supplies from overseas will either seriously diminish or cease. In some continental countries every man who fells a tree is compelled to plant two. </para>

                    <para>I again urge upon those engaged in secondary industries to realize that they are under the same obligation to the country as are those engaged in primary production.

The population of Canada is larger than that of Australia; but, generally speaking, the industries in Canada are conducted on similar lines to our own. According to the Canadian <inline font-style="italic">Year-Book,</inline> exports of fully or partly manufactured goods for the year ended 31st March, 1929, were valued at . £100,000,000. Of that amount £40,000,000 worth was exported to the United States of America., notwithstanding the high tariff imposed against imports from Canada. Those figures should be an object lesson to Australian manufacturers, who should realize that it is time they placed their house in order. </para>
                    <para>No one is desirous of injuring any of our primary or secondary industries, but those engaged in secondary industries in this country should realize that a heavy obligation rests upon. them. It is time they conducted their undertakings on economic lines, and assisted the development of this country by exporting their products overseas, as the primary producers are doing. The exports of primary production have assisted in adjusting our trade balance, in paying for our imports, and in meeting interest on our overseas commitments. It is unreasonable that that responsibility should fall upon one section of the community. I am at a loss to understand why a schedule imposing such heavy duties has been submitted to this Parliament. We protect industries to enable them to become firmly established, and to meet unfair competition  from overseas; but the proposals of the Government in many instances go beyond that. </para>

                        <para>. - As the first Victorian senator to speak on the tariff, I wish to say, first of all, that I am a protectionist to the backbone. Nevertheless, I am prepared to stand up against the Sydney gangsters who, because of the absurd conditions of employment laid down by the Lang Government, advocate a system of protection which amounts to prohibition. I hope that the protectionists of the old school,, among whom I include myself, have sufficient sense to realize that customs duties cannot be heaped on the community without regard to economic conditions, or the welfare of the community generally, including the workers themselves. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The tariff schedule before us appears to have been drafted through an open gate,, for it contains no evidence of having been prepared in the light of the information supplied by economists and members of the Tariff Board, or of economic facts, which should be known to every person in the community. I have always been a staunch protectionist. I realize that, although Australia must rely chiefly on her exports of wool, wheat, butter, fruits, metals and other primary products, it. is essential that, side by side with the development and expansion of our primary industries, we must build up secondary industries in this country. It is wrong to imagine that we can develop and populate this country and find employment for all our people unless secondary industries are encouraged. We have a big and wonderful country; but not every person in it can be a primary producer. Notwithstanding that we have a population of only about 6,500,000 people in a country comprising 3,000,000 square miles, secondary, as well as primary industries are necessary if the country is to prosper. </para>
                    <para>In 192S-29, during the term of office of the Bruce-Page Government, and under a policy of high protection, there were 22,000 factories in Australia, employing 461,000 workers. The average wage for males was then £247, and for females, £110 per annum. Two years later, under a government which has broken all previous records in the matter of high duties, we have unprecedented unemployment. Since May, 1929, unemployment in Australia has increased from 9.5 per cent, of the population to over 30 per cent., with the result that there is stagnation throughout the country. Although Australia will continue to depend chiefly on primary industries, it is economically unsound to export the whole of our production of wool, wheat, skins, hides, fruit, iron and other products in their raw state. We must build up industries which will manufacture these raw  materials into finished articles for use, at least by the people of this country, and also, if possible, by exporting the products of our secondary industries/ assist to pay our overseas indebtedness. So far the whole burden has fallen on our primary industries, since 97 per cent, of the total exports from the Commonwealth consist of primary products. Before I conclude, I hope to show that some of our secondary industries will soon have developed to such a stage that they will be able to find an overseas market for their products. </para>
                    <para>We hear a good deal about the Australian standard of living. At present, there is no real standard of living for our people, although it is true that those who have been kept in constant employment, particularly those in sheltered positions which cannot be interfered with, can still claim a . standard. But where is our boasted standard of living when 30 per cent, of the workers are on the bread line or below it because of unemployment?In the light of the facts which stare us iu the face, the less we say of our standard of living the better. The position was well put the other day by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kneebone</inline> when he said that in South Australia wages had fallen, prices were falling, the purchasing power of the people was falling, and employment also was on the decrease. He pointed out that that State had had two years of falling prices and falling wages, and that every one knew the effect on the workers. Coming from a loyal supporter of the Government, the honorable senator's remarks are a testimony to the incapacity of the Government which has been in power for two years. </para>
                    <para>Notwithstanding that I believe that many of the duties in the schedule are unnecessarily high, I am still a protectionist. I believe that it is necessary to give adequate protection to our secondary industries in order that they may compete with the products of other countries, as, for instance, the Continent of Europe, and Eastern countries like China and Japan, where the working hours are much longer and the wages lower than in Australia. We must give sufficient protection to our secondary industries to enable their products to compete in the home market against the pro- ducts of countries in which either coloured labour is employed, or the workers labour under conditions far inferior to those in Australia. </para>
                    <para>There ' are several secondary industries which can be established in Australia on sound economic lines, among them being the textile industry and the iron and steel industry. On the other hand, it is unsound to go too far in the direction of prohibiting the importation of goods from countries which are good customers of Australia. A policy of prohibition results in the creation of' monopolies and combines. It is, therefore, wise to have a careful investigation of the effect of high duties before they are imposed. Australia is fortunate in having at its disposal the services of able economists and others to advise the Government in tariff matters. I advise all honorable senators to read <inline font-style="italic">'The Australian Tariff - An Economic Inquiry,</inline> by Professors Giblin, Brigden and Copland, and Messrs. Dyason and Wickens. The Tariff Board is composed of business men of experience who, like the other gentlemen named, are entirely unbiased in these matters. The Tariff Board weighs carefully the evidence which is given before it, and its reports are worthy of our most careful consideration. Yet the Government has disregarded its findings, and the advice of economists, while in other instances it has gone ahead without seeking their advice. Its action has led to the creation of monopolies, and has heavily handicapped primary producers, while preventing the cost of living from coming down. Although Australia produces wool, mutton, beef, wheat, fruits, butter and other primary products in abundance, the cost of living has not fallen in proportion to the drop in the prices of those' primary products. Surely something is wrong ! I desire . to quote from the publication to which I just referred to show what these trained economists have to say before we, who are only laymen in these matters, decide on the attitude we shall adopt towards this tariff. The trained economists to whom I have referred conducted their investigation into tariff matters in May, 1929, before the increased duties and the prohibitions which were imposed by the present Government came into operation. In their report they say - </para>

                        made a claim which, I think, was grossly unfair. He said that we give the Mother Country far greater preference than she extends to us, and he alleged that that preference had amounted to as much as £10,000,000 a year. The economists show that as far back as 1929, before this Government imposed prohibitive duties, the actual amount of the preference was £2,000,000 a year; but since the present tariff with its embargoes and prohibitions has come into force, it is an idle boast to say that we extend any preference to the Mother Country. As a matter of fact,
                        <inline font-style="italic">we</inline>
                        give her no preference whatever. When the tariff reaches the committee stage, I intend to do what I can to maintain adequate protection for all industries, that can be economically established and carried on in Australia, and to see also that we give a definite preference to the Old Country that has done so much for us. The economists also say -

                    <para class="block">I have quoted sufficient to show that, after careful investigation, those economists consider that a protective policy is necessary in a young country like Australia ; that we cannot depend entirely on primary production. But it appears to me that the question we should ask is this: Are we to give protection to the extent of prohibition, so that all kinds of factories can manufacture under absurd laws and conditions such as obtain in New South Wales under the Lang Government? Members of the Government, and some honorable senators from New South Wales, seem to imagine that all that is required is to make the tariff wall so high that factories can be carried on irrespective of their efficiency or inefficiency, and of the hours of labour, and the rates of pay. That means slamming the door in the face of the old Mother Country, and other nations which are good customers of ours. It means building and bolstering up a race of  inefficients,  and definitely causes dear, instead of cheap, living. A tariff so high as that asked for in New South Wales, together with the hours of work and the rates of pay observed in that State, would encourage inefficiency, and increase the cost of living to the whole community. I will not vote for that sort of protection, keen protectionist though I am, because it really amounts to prohibition. I am, as I have already said, in favour of protecting only those industries that can be, and are conducted on sound economic lines. They must have well-equipped machinery, and they must be efficient. We have too many badly-managed, tin-pot, hothouse industries in Australia that have been built up amid artificial surroundings, and have produced an entirely false atmosphere, besides increasing the cost of living. </para>

                    </quote><para class="block">From inquiries that I have made, I find that this great industry is definitely entitled to protection. It may be argued that the Australian factories have, at first hand, the biggest choice of the best wool that the world produces. That is true, but I point out that the claims of this industry need careful consideration. Although some honorable senators may think that the tariff on textiles is out of all reason, I do not consider that to be so, after investigating the conditions of manufacture in other countries. The factory rates of pay in </para><para class="block">Australia are four times as high as in Japan, and six times as high as in China. The hours of employment in Victoria are 48 per week - the 44-hour week in New South Wales is too short - while in China and Japan the working week consists of 72 hours. China and Japan have the same opportunities to buy wool as other countries. It will be said that Japan is a good customer of Australia. I admit that she bought 500,000 bales last year, but she does not purchase only Australian wool; she also obtains wool from the Argentine aud South Africa. With her working week of 72 hours, and her wage of 16s. per week, she has a tremendous start on Australian manufacturers, and her mills can produce cheaply compared with those in Australia, which are not in any way molly-coddled. Our employees do a fair day's work for a fair day's pay. They are efficient, they work long enough, and their wages are not too high. Another strong point is that our mills are not profiteering under the very high tariff that has been granted to them, for since this tariff was imposed, the prices of all classes of woollen materials to the  public  have been reduced. The decrease in the factory prices under this admittedly high tariff has led to fierce internal competition, and instead of the public being exploited, it has had the benefit of that competition. Domestic flannels have been reduced in price by 33 per cent.; coloured flannels, 33 per cent.; all wool blankets - and there are none better in the world than those made in Australia. - 41 percent.; rugs, 36 per cent.; worsted suitings, 40 per cent.; overcoatings, 40 per cent.; and low tweeds, 33 per cent. Adding up the various quotations applying to woollen goods, it will be found that the decrease in the prices charged by the mills has averaged over 33 per cent., which shows the efficiency of the industry. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- The woollen industry is worth protecting. I am strongly in favour of adequate protection .for those big industries that have been, established on sound economic lines, and no industry that I know of is more deserving of being placed within that category than the woollen industry, because there is a  huge  supply in Australia of the best  wool that the world produces, and internal competition has resulted in a manufactured product of excellent quality and great variety at reasonable prices. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                    </continue><para>In arriving at a conclusion iu regard to the amount of protection that it is advisable to give to this industry, honorable senators, according to the report from which I have quoted, should ask, first of all, "Is the industry desirable?" Of course the great textile industry i9 desirable. We have proved that, as conducted in Australia, it is extraordinarily efficient, and, having regard to the reduction in prices, there is no profiteering. This shows that the industry has been of benefit to Australian consumers under a high protective tariff; but there are other industries which do not show such results. Therefore, I claim that, when we go into committee, every item in the schedule should be discussed on its merits, according to the evidence available to us from the economists and the Tariff Board, and we should formulate our opinions accordingly. </para><para>To summarize, 1 may say that the prices of the woollen mills have been reduced, the goods are of high quality, and last, but by no means least, the industry gives employment at fair wages to a large number of Australians under pleasant, hygienic and humanitarian surroundings. The dust iu the factories is removed by fans, and the work is One of the most healthful occupations, because the  mills are  comfortable, well ventilated,  and  well  lit.  I  desire  honorable senators to remember these facts when they come to consider the  individual  items  in  the tariff. They may be inclined to say, "Look at these high duties; why cannot our factories compete on equal terms with those of other countries ". I desire them to remember that the wages paid in the textile industry, which are not a penny too much, are high compared with those in Britain, Germany, France, Belgium, and Italy. If we consider the conditions in the textile industry in China and Japan, we find that, in addition to the long hours of work, and the low wages paid there, those countries can obtain their supplies of wool as easily and as cheaply as can Australian manufacturers. </para><para class="block">The wages in the textile industry in Victoria for a 48-hour week are £3 16s. 6d. for males, and £2 for females. In Britain, for a 48-hour week, wages are respectively £2 6s. 4d., aud £1 11s Id. In Japan, however, textile workers have a working week of 72 hours, aud receive 15s., while in China they work 72 hours for Ss. Honorable senators, when considering the duties imposed for the protection of the textile trade, ought to bear these facts in mind, and they will realize that if our mills are to prosper and develop, it is absolutely essential that all branches of the textile industry should receive adequate protection. Australia has always excelled in the production of wool. She is unique in that, while she possesses only 16 per cent, of the world's sheep, she produces in value 32 per cent, of the world's wool. This year we are going to put up a new record both in regard to the number of sheep and the quantity of wool we produce. For the first time, we shall have 115,000,000 sheep, and also, for the first time iu our history, we shall produce 1,000,000,000 lb. of wool, over 3,000,000 bales. We have topped 3,000,000 bales before, but we have never reached 1,000,000,000 lb. of wool, our previous record being 960,000,000 lb. Even at an average price of 9d. per lb., our wool clip this year will be worth £37,500,000. </para><para>The wool-raising industry has been responsible in the past for over 50 per cent, of our exportable wealth, and that industry has been built up without any protection. It has never asked for any. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> said, quite incorrectly, that the primary producers had clamoured for, and obtained, protection. That is not so. The wool-growers, who are the backbone of the community, and who have carried the country in the past, have produced 50 per cent, of its exportable wealth practically every year since McArthur first landed his few sheep in Australia. They have never asked for any protection, nor have they received any assistance by way of grants or bounties. Their lot has been persecution, not protection. They have been singled out for special taxation such as the land tax, which is an unjust class tax. This industry has been built up to its present standard because Australia  is particularly suited in climate, soil, and herbage for sheep-raising, while the early pioneers, and those who followed after them, carried on the industry efficiently. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> said that those engaged in growing wheat, barley, oats, &amp;c, had obtained protection for their products, but I remind him that we do not import those things, and it was most unfair of the Sydney-sider  to say that the primary producers had clamoured more than any one else for protection. 1 have emphasized the efficiency of the woollen manufacturing industry, because it has a direct bearing upon my argument. Until recently, our woollen mills were not receiving sufficient protection, and for 50 years they struggled along making little profit. Some were unable to equip themselves with the most up-to-date machinery. Some never paid any dividends, and many went out of business. Under the present tariff, the industry has developed rapidly, and become so efficient that the mills can produce the whole of Australia's requirements. The best machinery has been put into them, because, without efficient and up-to-date machinery, they cannot' compete. I hope that eventually we shall develop the industry to such an extent that we shall be able to export. Already the wool-raising industry provides employment for a great many people, and furnishes half our exportable wealth, but there is no reason why we should not go further, and export our manufactured textiles. Under the stimulation of the new tariff some of our mills have sent representatives to Canada, the western States of the United States of America, and to South Africa, seeking orders, and we have sold wool tops and blankets to Canada, the United States of America, and China. Some of the best blankets I have ever seen were made in Warrnambool, and, I was informed that they had been ordered for disposal in China and the western States of the United States of America and Canada. We have also exported tops, which are combed wool, to Canada. </para><interjection>

                        said that we should scour our wool here before exporting it, and thus furnish employment. That silly suggestion has been made before, but it is quite impracticable, because every woollen mill makes its own blend of various wools before scouring, according to the type of material in which it specializes. I have never been in any mill anywhere in the world which has not an individual blend.

                    </continue><para>Another advantage of the textile industry is that it encourages decentralization. Victoria has many splendid woollen mills, every one of them up to date, while some have developed an overseas trade. Geelong, of course, is ae Bradford of Australia, but besides the mills in that town there are mills also at Ballarat, Stawell, Daylesford, Castlemaine, and Wangaratta. Australia's policy in the past has, unfortunately,  tended  too much to centralization, with the result that our people have been driven into the cities. Victoria provides a glaring example of this evil, because no less than 57 per cent, of its total population lives within 20 miles of the Melbourne General Post  Office  Last year, the Australian woollen mills  purchased  176,000 bales of wool, and this year it is anticipated that their requirements will be 200,000 bales, or 7 per cent, of the total clip. I hope that eventually we shall manufacture all our own woollen requirements within Australia - I do not want to see an ounce of woollen material imported - but even if we supplied all our own requirements in this respect, our woollen mills could absorb only 10 per cent, of the clip. We must sell raw wool to other countries, and I hope we shall also sell manufactured woollen goods. </para><para class="block">Our woollen mills are efficiently run, and keen competition exists in the trade. We must push the industry for all it is worth. I do not know of any other industry which is so economically sound, and which has benefited so much as a result of receiving adequate protection. </para><para>I cannot agree, however, that it would be economically sound to impose high duties for the protection of every industry which might seek to start in this country. I favour adequate protection for the woollen industry, and for other important key industries, such as iron and steel j but I cannot countenance the imposition of high duties which tend to make more expensive the implements of production needed by those on the land, and those engaged in other primary industries. The primary producers have to sell their output in competition with the whole world, and they should not be unduly handicapped. Nor am I in favour of high duties for the protection of tin-pot industries which are not economically sound. We should try every way in our power to develop still further our primary industries. Probably, we cannot produce much more wool than the 3,000,000 bales we shall produce this year, although I remember that when I prophesied that we could increase our production from 2,000,000 to 3,000,000 bales, my judgment was questioned. There is, however, room for expansion in the export of lambs, butter, &amp;c, particularly since there is now in office in Great Britain a government which favours granting preference to the dominions aud colonies. </para><para>As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> said, we should also be exporting coal. We used to export millions of pounds worth every year until the miners refused to work. They would work for a day or two, and then go fishing for the rest of the week. We ought to be able to produce the cheapest coal in the world, because we have inexhaustible seams situated right on the coast. The high price of coal is a handicap to the iron and steel industry, and to the implement-makers who supply machinery to the farmers. Some of our small, uneconomic industries have been spoon-fed since their inception, and we should be better off without them. Duties should be imposed only after an exhaustive inquiry into the industry it is proposed to protect. If an' industry is economically sound, no harm can be done by imposing almost prohibitive protective duties, but the tariff cannot be framed by rule of thumb. We should sift every application thoroughly to decide how much duty is necessary, and then act accordingly. </para><para>Those industries that are a drag on the community, that add to the cost of living and do not provide any great employment, could be let go. Economists have shown that the added cost to primary production under our protective tariff is 15 per cent. The new government which has been elected in the Old Country, unlike its predecessor, will not give preference to the wheat and butter of Russia which has defaulted to British bondholders to the extent of £1,000,000,000. The Labour Government of Great Britain did not care a snap of the fingers for the dominions and colonies; it made no attempt to trade with them; but I am hopeful that the new government will encourage an expansion of trade within the Empire, to the, advantage of the Empire, and of every individual part of it. I am hopeful that it will give preference to our produce, and that in regard to the schedule of duties in this bill we shall see to it that the service we render to the Old Country in the matter of preference on manufactured goods is real and not merely lip service. Almost every item in our tariff is prohibitive against the Mother Country. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- However keen we may be as protectionists we cannot say that we should shut ourselves in and live within ourselves. We must trade with other countries. It is economically sounder to import some articles than to manufacture them locally. Therefore, whilst we should maintain on textiles and other similar things fairly high rates of duty, it is not good policy to impose heavy duties on things which it is economically sounder to import. We live by sending away millions of pounds worth of produce to other countries. Those countries pay us in goods. </para>

I hope that in Great Britain the socialists have now been relegated to obscurity and impotence - their proper sphere. The voice of old Britain has once more rung true, as it. always has done in times of crisis. That there is room for reform in the matter of Empire trade the figures I am h bout, to quote clearly prove. In 1928 the total Empire trade amounted to £3,307,000,000, of which only £85G,000,000, or 25.9 per cent, represented what was done within the Empire. Foreign purchases accounted for 74.1 per oei.it. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- I think that we have every reason to be hurt at the attitude of the people within the Empire in not sticking together, and trading with one another. America and France have traded almost exclusively with their own colonies and dependencies. In the past the policy of Great Britain has been quire the reverse. The Mother Country imports foodstuffs to the value of £1,000 for every minute of the year. Those foodstuffs could be supplied by the dominions. As a matter of fact, Australia could supply Great Britain's requirements of flour, meat, fruit, and butter, but not  being  greedy, Australia is prepared to share this trade with the sister dominions of New Zealand, South Africa and Canada. It is decidedly wrong that 74.1 per cent, of the Empire's requirements should be provided by countries not within the Empire. Take the case of wheat, and flour. The importations from foreign countries in 192S were valued at £30.000,000. Foreign countries supplied  meat  to the value of £34,000,000, 90 per cent, of the beef coming from the Argentine. </para>

They had no desire, they said, to interfere in our internal affairs, and they did not care if the duty was 60, 70, SO, or 90 per cent., but it was an insult to them to realize that, although they were buying wool from us every year to the value of £10,000,000, the importation of timber from Japan was prohibited. They asked me what I thought would happen if the Japanese Government retaliated by putting a duty of Id. a lb. on Australian wool. 1 said, ' Of course, you would buy your merino wool from South Africa, and your crossbred wool from the Argentine ". Fortunately, the Commonwealth Government saw the foolishness of the policy it. was pursuing, and altered it. The Japanese are wonderfully good customers of ours. Last year they bought over 500,000 bales of our wool. This year their purchases are likely to be fully up to that vast quantity. They buy over £2,000,000 worth of our wheat each year. We should be careful how we handle such good customers for our produce. </para>

In this connexion I may say that the <inline font-style="italic">Year-Booh</inline> has not correctly stated the added value given to our primary production by manufacture, say, of wool into cloth or milk into cheese. The value of primary products as stated is the world's open market price, whereas in the case of manufactured goods the <inline font-style="italic">Y ear-Book</inline> gives the added value by manufacturing as plus heavy ocean freights and enormous protective duties. Even then primary products account for 75 per cent, of the annual wealth production of this country. Although I am an enthusiastic protectionist, I believe in having regard to the' best advice available. I was the originator of the slogan, " Australian goods for Australian people," and I have always practised what I preached. For the last fifteen years I have not worn or used anything not produced in. this country; I apply that practice even to bootlaces. In regard to motor cars, if I cannot get an Australian or British machine, I am  content  to go without. The greatest help we can give to our people is to be enthusiastic supporters of the products of our own country. If our 6,500,000 people were to insist on buying Australian-made goods, they would give much more assistance to our factories and primary producers than is afforded by an abnormally high tariff, which merely increases the cost of living. <inline font-style="italic">[Extensionof time granted.]</inline></para><para>

Yet, notwithstanding a home market of 120,000,000 people and record holdings of gold, the people of the United States of America are experiencing unprecedented unemployment and misery.

I can buy a 4-lb. loaf in Geelong for 6½d.; in Melbourne, the price is 6d. to 8d.; in Albury, 8d. ; and in Canberra and Rand,1s., whereas in Great Britain, after freight has been paid on wheat from Australia, the price of a loaf is only8d. </para><para>The fault I find with the Government's tariff policy is that, by excessive duties and prohibitions in respect of 78 articles, it has created monopolies and crippled the primary producers.

Monopolies have been created in respect of the manufacture of galvanized iron, barbed wire, and wire netting. Consider the effect of the tariff on the requirements of a cottager. Galvanized iron, which is the subject of a monopoly, is £26 10s. a ton, about double the price in any other country; sheet glass for windows is subject to tariff duties amounting to more than 600 per cent. Timber and nails also bear prohibitive duties. These burdens are not borne by the wealthy classes. They live in houses of bricks, mortar, slates, and tiles, but the working man and the farmer must have galvanized iron, timber, and glass. The poor are being penalized for the benefit of rich manufacturers. The Government has given monopolies to a few companies to enable them to pay ridiculously high wages and work their employees too short hours. This is at the expense of the cottager and the farmer. Sugar is grown in only one State, and the taxpayers are burdened to the extent of £7,000,000 a year to support the industry. </para>

The effect of the Lang policy has been to help Victoria, although, as a rule, New South Wales does not love Victoria. The honorable senator has asked for sufficient protection to make the maintenance of industry possible under the Lang gang regime. Do honorable senators realize that last year the bank deposits in New South Wales decreased by £8,000,000, while those of Victoria increased by £5,000,000? The 44-hour week and 20 per cent. higher wage policy of New South Wales has not only crippled industry and reduced employment there, but has been injurious to the whole of Australia. The total amount of wages paid in New South Wales last year decreased by 9.6 per cent., while in Victoria the total fell by only 3.5 per cent. Certain honorable senators from New South Wales have asked for a tariff high enough to enable the manufacturers of New South Wales to enter into competition with those of Victoria; but we cannot be expected to consent to a perpetuation of the policy of the present New South Wales Government. I shall not support a tariff high enough to protect industry against the inefficiency and stupidity of the present New South Wales Government. While the amount of wages paid decreased by 9.6 in New South Wales last .year, the average decrease for Australia was only 6.G- per cent. Unemployment has increased 10 per cent, in New South Wales, while the average increase for Australia has been only 7 per cent. The figure for Victoria is 3 per cent. </para><para>

                        and some other honorable senators from New South  Wale3,  in clamouring for higher and still higher protection, have foolishly tried to misli'«d the Senate by stating that the primary producers want additional protection. It is well known, of course, that the tariff is largely responsible for the difficulties in which the Australian railways find themselves to-day. Extremely heavy burdens have been cast upon our producers by the tariff. To-day it costs ls. per lb. to produce wool, and from 3s. 4&lt;i. to 5s. 6d. per bushel to produce wheat. Why is this? It is because wire, wire netting, shears, traps, and machinery of all kinds have been increased in price in consequence of the tariff. To-day it costs from 10 per cent, to 12 per cent, of the- value of the wool to get it from the farm to the market, and it costs 25 per cent, of its value to get it to Europe". It costs from ls. 6d. to ls. 9d. per bushel to get wheat from the farm to the world's markets. When I first became associated with the wool industry, the freight from Australia to London was -Jd. for greasy wool, and
                        <inline font-style="italic">id.</inline>
                        per lb. for scoured wool; to-day it' costs 500 per ent. more than that?

The gross profits in this industry arc apparently too high. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kneebone,</inline> aud other honorable senators, have pointed out that there is something radically wrong with our industrial situation. In this rich, but mo3t sparsely-populated country in the world, we are not only losing population, but we arc at the same time driving people off the land. We provide the most extreme illustration in the world of the curse of centralization. I made a mistake some little time ago in saying that 59.9 peT cent, of the population of Victoria was in the metropolitan area. The correct figure is <inline font-style="italic">51</inline> per cent. In South Australia over 50 per cent, of the population lives in Adelaide, while 4.9.9 per cent, of the population of New South Wales is to be found in Sydney. The six capital cities of Australia contain 49. 2S per cent, of the total population of the continent. Yet some honorable senators are still crying for higher tariffs. The figures which I have quoted show beyond- all question that our primary producers are being seriously penalized, that the people are being driven off the land, and that the aggregation of population in our cities is assuming alarming proportions. The figures also show that our whole economic structure is lop-sided. The people on the land are being persecuted, while the people in the cities are being spoon-fed. But what can we expect when this Government deals with window glass, galvanized iron, and other commodities as it has been doing? </para>

That results in the establishment of monopolies which are detrimental to any community. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Halloran</inline> quoted the prices of certain agricultural implements manufactured in Australia under our high protective tariff, and compared them with those in New Zealand and other countries. He quoted the Australian price of a header harvester at £154, but in going through the prices charged in Australia I noticed that the rates closely approximate those of the imported article. This shows that notwithstanding the tariff the Australian manufacturers are charging the users almost the same price as is charged for an imported machine. In comparing the prices in Australia and in New Zealand, we must also take into consideration the fact that owing to the nature of the country in New Zealand heavier ploughs, harrows, and other farming machinery have to be utilized. Our coal, iron, and other commodities are unnecessarily expensive. Those engaged in industry have to contend with a multiplicity of arbitration awards as well as excessive cost's, some of which are undoubtedly caused by the tariff. The schedule is full of anomalies, and many of the excessive duties are directly responsible for the high cost of living. </para><continue>

                        <para>. - In following the speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> I found it difficult to determine whether he was a protectionist or a freetrader. Apparently, he is a protectionist when the woollen industry is under consideration and a freetrader when industries in which he is not directly interested are concerned. Some honorable senators are out-and-out freetraders, while others, like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> are what we might term of the "fifty-fifty" type. Frequent reference has been made to the high duties imposed under this tariff, but in view of the situation which confronted this Government when it took office, an amending tariff schedule was necessary, not only to further protect Australian industries, but also to assist in adjusting our adverse trade balance. Honorable senators opposed to a high protective tariff should realize that machinery has played a very important part in secondary production throughout the world, and that this has brought in its train an over supply of commodities. Other countries have found it necessary to protect their industries against foreign competition. The action taken by this Government was long overdue. When it assumed office the Commonwealth was faced with an adverse trade balance of £32,000,000, and the position was rapidly becoming worse. At that time we were importing goods to the value of £180,000,000 annually, and many of the commodities which were then coming into the country could be manufactured in Australia without detrimentally affecting the consumers. Had the Government not tackled the problem when it did Australia's financial position would be worse than it is to-day. It was impracticable to submit every proposal to the Tariff Board for consideration; that would have taken years. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. Moreover, had the importers been aware of the Government's intention to impose heavier duties or place embargoes upon certain importations, huge quantities of goods would have been dumped in Australia, and our requirements may have been met for some time to come. When embargoes were placed upon certain goods many importers wished to exempt orders which were then on the water. It will be seen that prompt action was necessary. Our adverse trade balance was rapidly increasing, and this Government, like the last Government, could not borrow further money overseas in order to meet its commitments. Moreover, the price of primary products, over which we had no control, was rapidly falling. Had the whole of our exportable surplus been sold, at a reduced price, it would have been impossible to balance our overseas trade. Drastic action was necessary in order to save the country. </para>

                            <para>- In 1929 our adverse trade balance amounted to £32,000,000, but as a result of the fiscal policy adopted by the present Government, the position has been reversed. To-day, instead of a huge adverse trade balance, we have a credit balance of about £30,000,000. Whatever the opinion of honorable senators regarding the Government's fiscal policy, they must admit that the Government has tackled a difficult position bravely. It would be well to remind honorable senators of the circumstances which led up to the serious financial position which faced the country when the present Government assumed office. Since the value of imports in 1922-23 exceeded that of the previous year by approximately £28,000,000, it is obvious that the importing interests were able to gauge the lines on which they could get in under the HughesMassy Greene tariff of 1921. The following comparison of the imports and exports of merchandise for the eight years commencing 1922-23 was compiled from figures obtained by the Commonwealth Statistician: - </para>

                    </para>
                    <para class="block">Those figures reveal that over a period of eight years imports exceeded exports to the extent of about £14,000,000 per annum. Even the Bruce-Page Government realized that that state of affairs could not continue indefinitely. It sought to overcome the difficulty by reducing wages, abolishing the Arbitration Court, and allowing industry to find its own level, which meant that employers would be able to bargain with their employees individually. By seeking to abolish the system which regulates the conditions of labour, it attempted to rob the workers in industry of their only protection from exploitation. The last election was fought on the issue of the retention or otherwise of; the arbitration system. The Labour party received a mandate from the people to maintain that system. I do not blame the previous Government for the fall in the national income due to the lowness of the prices received for our products in the markets of the world. Of the causes of the reduction of the national income no government could have had any control; but the fact remains that when the present Government assumed office the price of wheat and other primary products was far below expectations. Faced with the possibility of default, the Government made an earnest appeal to the wheat-growers of Australia to produce more wheat with a view to correcting the trade balance. They responded nobly; but the fall in the price of wheat tended to nullify their efforts. </para>
                    <para>This Government, on assuming office, was also confronted with the difficulty of finding employment for the people. A good deal has' been said about men leaving the land and going to the cities in order to get better wages than are paid in country districts. Surely it is not necessary for me to remind honorable senators that higher wages are necessary in the cities than in the country, where men are able to save money because of lack of opportunity to spend it. </para>

                            <para>- The Government has not lost sight of the desirability of bringing down the cost of production so that our goods may compete with the goods of other nations. One factor in reducing the cost of production is the installation of up-to-date machinery in our factories. In a desire to see as much of that machinery as possible made in Australia, the Government placed prohibitive duties on certain articles of machinery. But the farmer has not suffered in consequence of this, for the implements used on our wheat farms to-day cost him less than similar implements cost in other countries where there is no tariff at all. It will be seen, therefore, that high duties have not increased the cost of production in Australia as compared with other countries. Honorable senators know the extent to which goods of foreign manufacture have been dumped into-  Australia  during recent years. The wai- had not long been in progress before Japanese goods were to be seen in almost every shop in Australia. Foreign goods were dumped into this country because there was no market foi- them in the country of origin. Goods were sold almost on the buyer's own terms. That position has now been altered. When prosperity returns the full benefit of the tariff policy of the Government will be felt. </para>

                    <para>I am pleased to know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> wears clothing made entirely of Australian materials. If we could induce everybody in the community to buy only Australian-made goods, it would be unnecessary, perhaps, to protect Australian industries to the extent that they are now protected; but the fact remains that the people insist on buying in the cheapest market. They have not yet learned to put Australia first. Reference has been made to " tinpot, spoonfed little industries" that have been protected.The honorable senator who spoke of certain undertakings in that way is quite prepared to grant protection to the important industry which he so ably sponsors in this chamber. It must be remembered that Australia is a young country, and that its manufacturing industries should be fostered and assisted where necessary. Our machinery and our factory methods may not be as up to date as those in other part3 of the world, but wo are proud to know that our people enjoy a high standard of living, and are better clothed and fed than those in almost any other country. That should be a sufficient inducement to us to maintain that standard, so far as possible, and to protect our industries against the dumped goods of foreign countries. The people of Australia generally have never complained of the prices that they have to pay for goods made in this country. The costs of production are on the decline, and the cost of living has also fallen. When the Government first considered the need for the greater protection of local industries against the competition of foreign countries, the Australian manufacturers of agricultural implements undertook that if they received the necessary protection under the tariff, they would reduce their prices by at least 5 per cent., and I am pleased to know that they have kept their word in that regard. We must agree that the protective tariff has not placed a serious burden on the community. </para>
                    <para>Some honorable senators claim that the tariff is ruinous to the primary producers, and is imposing on them hardships that are too great for them to bear. The cost of their plant, it is said, has increased to such an extent that they cannot compete with other countries in the production of wheat, but I shall give the cost of farming implements in the freetrade countries of British East </para>

                            <para>- I have disposed of the objection that the tariff policy of Australia has resulted in the farmer paying  higher  prices for his implements. lt is the use of farming machinery and tractors to an ever increasing extent that is chiefly responsible for the exodus of men from the rural districts to the cities. If all the factories were closed tomorrow, and the workers were prepared to work on the land for nothing, not half of them could be employed. This fact alone warrants action by the Government to provide useful employment for the people. Every year large numbers of boys and girls, on leaving school, cannot obtain work on farms, because even the farmers' own sous are driven off the land. By the use of machinery, one man alone can farm 1,000 acres annually. How, then, can there be much demand for human labour on the farms? Other avenues of employment must be opened up, for I can see no hope of finding increased employment on the land. The high prices that have to be paid for land have also to be taken into consideration in dealing with this problem. The tariff is only one of the means by which this Government hopes to restore prosperity to Australia. </para>

                            <para>- That is because the public has not sufficient purchasing power to buy what is being produced. Unemployment is largely caused, as I have indicated, by the mechanization of industry, whether on the farm, in the factory, in the mill, or in the mine. This state of affairs cannot be attributed to inefficient management, or to lack of desire on the part of governments to do. what is right by the people. The regrettable fact is that the purchasing power of the community has fallen seriously, and the people cannot absorb the commodities that are being produced. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. Machinery has been introduced to such an alarming extent that the numbers who are being thrown out of work on account of the mechanization of industry are constantly increasing. The machinery that is put into operation is used for the purpose of manufacturing further laboursaving appliances; but the conditions of the Australian workers would have been much worse if we had permitted the importation of machinery from other countries, thus depriving our own workers of the employment afforded by the manufacture of machinery in this country. What is the effect of the tariff in regard to machines? </para>

                            <para>- No, it is designed to help the manufacturers of Australia to supply all our requirements in manufactured goods, and to prevent the dumping of goods from Russia, the United States of America, or any other country. There is no reason why we should not trade with Great Britain; but, if we buy from her more than she takes from us, we shall find ourselves back in the position that we were in when this Government assumed office, when we had a heavy adverse trade balance. Had the present Government not imposed restrictions on imports we should long ere this have had to default. We were going on piling up debts abroad, and the day of reckoning was approaching. I myself, with a family to support, have known what it is to be thrown out of employment, and to get into debt to the storekeepers; but I realized that eventually the day of reckoning would come, and, when I got work, a heavy reckoning I found it to be. Australia had been drifting for years. She borrowed money wherever she could get it, and spent that money lavishly. She bought all the goods that other countries liked to dump on her, and she put up with land go-getters and every other kind of go-getter there is. Ultimately, we reached the stage when we were called upon to pay, and, fortunately for Australia, the present Government was in office to tackle the problem. </para>

The principle of protection may not be involved, but most honorable senators who have spoken against this tariff have claimed to be protectionists, though they have objected to the duties being so high. Some honorable senators referred to it as a sky-high tariff, but I remind them that the tariff was rendered necessary as much by the wasteful expenditure of loan money as by our excessive imports. </para>

The Government has reason to be proud of its tariff policy, and the manufacturers are to be  congratulated upon  not having taken improper advantage of the protection afforded to them. Despite the high duties imposed, they have reduced the price of their goods. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> sees fit to smile at that statement; but he cannot refuse to accept the Statistician's figures regarding the reduction in prices. </para>

                            <para>- The price of clothing has certainly been reduced. Great stress has been laid by some honorable senators upon the need for exporting the output of our secondary industries. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> said that, unfortunately, ships were coming out to Australia empty, because we would not buy goods from other countries. The ships would not come here if there was no demand for our produce. It is possible that there might not be so much demand from Europe for our wool if the Russians had been allowed a free hand to import our stud stock, but this Government put a stop to that. The Government has nothing to be ashamed of in regard to this tariff, and I am confident that before long Australia will return to prosperity, and our secondary industries will demonstrate what they are capable of doing. </para>

                            <para>- - I should say that many words have been said in favour of freetrade, and one honorable senator, who has always posed as a 100 per cent, protectionist, surprised me very much by his speech this afternoon. It is now evident that he is a 70 per cent, freetrader, and a 30 per cent, protectionist. He balanced himself on the tight-rope very well, sometimes swaying one way and sometimes the other, but always coming back to freetrade. Indeed, he diverged from that principle only when the interests of the wool-growing and manufacturing industries were concerned. To my way of thinking, protection has never been given a fair chance in Australia. We have endeavoured by means of protective duties to foster our secondary industries, and to make Australia the nation she deserves to be, and then we have set about depriving ourselves of the benefits of protection by borrowing millions of pounds abroad. For many years Australia lived on borrowed money, instead of on its own revenue. Every time we borrowed £50,000/000 abroad, we imported £50,000,000 worth of manufactured goods, and every £50,000,000 worth of goods we imported means that we spent £50,000,000 less upon goods manufactured in Australia. If, when in future we are obliged to borrow, we do our borrowing in Australia, instead of abroad, we shall derive the full benefit of protection. </para>

                    <para>According to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> some Australian industries - he mentioned the textile and metal trade industries - should have high protective duties. Such duties should reach the sky, he said. In fact, his idea was that we should prohibit the importation of textile goods because Australia, fortunately, grows the best wool in the world, and because the textile industry is firmly established. But, if it be right to impose protective duties to maintain an established industry like the textile industry, it should be equally right to impose high duties on ploughs and harrows for the sake of establishing in Australia an industry for the manufacture of farming implements. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> says that these implements should be permitted to come into Australia free of duty on the ground that their manufacture is not an established industry in this country. Figures have frequently been quoted in this chamber to show that farming implements are cheaper in Australia than in freetrade countries where the farmers are at the mercy of the importers, who are not philanthropists. Ti our duties on farming implements were removed, these articles would not be one farthing cheaper to the farmers than the present price. </para>
                    <para>The honorable senator also said that something should be done to bring down the cost of production. He omitted to mention that while the cost of living has fallen by 19 per cent., wages have been reduced by 30 per cent. A fair reduction of wages would be more in keeping with the reduction of the cost of living. A reduction of the cost of production can be brought about only by reducing wages, and a reduction of wages means a reduction of the purchasing power of the people. The honorable senator showed that over a period of seven years the United States of America in its trade with Australia, had a favorable trade balance of over £200,000,000. That result came about, not because the people of Australia love America better than any other part of the world, but because they prefer American motor cars to the cars produced in other countries. </para>
                    <para>The honorable senator claimed that under the Bruce-Page Government there was less unemployment in Australia than there is under the Labour Government of to-day, and laid the blame upon the tariff introduced by this Government. He forgets that in every country in the world to-day, whether it be a freetrade or a protectionist country, there are more unemployed than there were two years ago, or even one year ago. The tariff has had no effect upon the unemployment figures. </para>

                    <para>A true protective policy would treat manufacturers, employers and consumers all fairly. No one section should be allowed to fleece or cheat another. If the manufacturer is not absolutely fair there should be some law on the statute-book compelling bini to be fair. A tariff that favours one section to the disadvantage of others is not truly protective. </para>

                        complained that the price of articles used on farms had been increased by the present tariff. He mentioned wire netting in illustration, but, so far as I know wire netting is duty free.

                    <para>I agree with the honorable senator that the metal trades afford a great deal of employment to our people at good wages, but the honorable senator was inconsistent in claiming that high duties should be imposed on metal importations because the metal industry has become well established. He forgot that this industry, and the textile industry, had to make a start. The textile industry was a very small affair when it first asked for, and obtained, protection, aud its growth has been gradual. It is not very many years since the people of Australia were importing 75 per cent, of their textile  requirements.  Other industries are equally deserving of the same measure of protection as was afforded to the textile industry in its infancy. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has told u3 that Australia is exporting blankets to China, Canada, and the West Coast of America, and that in all probability the demand for them will grow because the Australian blanket is superior to that manufactured elsewhere. I trust that the trade will grow, but if the people who buy our blankets prefer them to those produced in other countries, it is probably attributable to the fact that Australia grows the best wool in the world. </para>
                    <para>When Labour was elected with a majority in another chamber, the people were aware that it was the party's intention to increase the protective duties wherever necessary in order to build up home markets. </para>

                            <para>- I withdraw it. There are some people who do not work at all. They have all the good things of this world; they neither toil nor do they spin. There are, however, thousands of people in Australia who want to work but are not allowed to do so.I am in favour of a 44-hour week. Sooner or later the League of Nations must take the hours of labour into consideration. In a few years machinery will so replace human labour that the workers must either be paid a dole or be called upon to work fewer hours. But if the manufacturers in one State work their employees only 44 hours and pay to them higher wages than are paid in the neighbouring States, trade and industry will naturally transfer to the States in which the less exacting conditions apply. The Commonwealth Arbitration Court should fix the rates of wages and work ing conditions in all States; if that were done one State could not compete unfairly against another. </para>

                    <para>Many senators have raised the retaliation bogy; they have said that if we impose high duties and prohibitions against imported articles the nations affected will boycott our exports. Last year Australia imported from the United States of America £31,000,000 worth of goods, and exported to that country only £5,800,000 worth. America does not want our goods; why do we not retaliate? Merely because We prefer the goods that America can supply, and we shall continue to buy from her only so long as it suits us to do so. That applies to all other trading. We have been warned of what Japan may do if we do not remove the restrictions imposed upon her products. According to the <inline font-style="italic">Times Trade and Engineering Supplement,</inline> of the 1st August, 1931, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stuttaford,</inline> of the South African Parliament, demanded higher duties against the Japanese merchandise, and in support of his claim stated that Japan sent £1,557,000 worth of goods to South Africa, and bought only £190,000 worth.

                    <para>Throughout the world, countries are forsaking freetrade and adopting protection. The result of the recent general election in Great Britain did not please me, but one can. plainly see that one of its consequences will be the adoption of a protective policy to some extent. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Newton</inline> Moore, of the House of Commons, mentioned a few days ago that the United Kingdom imported from the United States of America £15,000,000 worth of raw steel which it could produce for itself, and he predicted that as a result of the recent election the fiscal policy of the Mother Country will be so altered as to ensure that in future a large proportion of such steel will be produced by her own workers. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Newton</inline> emphasized the fact that some means must be found to absorb the large number of unemployed in Great Britain, and protective duties will probably be the means adopted. The British people have belatedly recognized that their country cannot continue to be the workshop of the world unless they abandon the fetish of freetrade. Other countries have endeavoured to shut British goods out by means of tariff barriers, and Great Britain must, for her own protection, adopt a similar policy. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator J.</inline> B. Hayes, referring to the manner in which the interests of the primary producers are being safeguarded by the present Government, pointed to the duty of £65 6s. 8d. per ton on butter, and £37 6s. 8d. on hams and bacon, and he asked, " Of what' use are those duties to the farming community? We export those goods; we have ' no need to import them ". That is astonishing reasoning. Was not the duty of 6d. per lb. imposed on butter to prevent extensive imports from New Zealand? </para>

                            <para>- Was not that duty imposed at the request of the primary producer for his own protection? A.bout £76,000 worth of raw pork has been reaching the Australian market from New Zealand each year, and the Government has endeavoured by a protective duty to safeguard the interests of Australian pig farmers. If primary producers accept and even demand the protection of their industries, they must, in fairness, be willing to safeguard those engaged in secondary production. The dairy farmer is granted additional protection by means of. the Paterson scheme, which takes from the Australian consumers of butter about £3,000,000 per annum more than they would otherwise pay. The Australian people do not complain of that impost, because they recognize the need for assisting the dairy farmers. But if primary producers tax the community for the protection of their industries, they should be consistent, and. accord the same treatment to other sections of the community.  As an honest protectionist, I am prepared to give tariff assistance to every industry, primary or secondary, which needs it. A duty of £3 18s. 5d. per ton is imposed on maize. The Australian people could buy abroad, particularly from South Africa, maize that is much cheaper than the homegrown article, but they have. not demurred at paying a little extra to protect an Australian industry. The poultry farmers protested loudly when large quantities of eggs were being imported from China. Once again the Government extended the policy of protection to the primary producer. The community pays about £4,000,000 a year for the protection of the sugar industry, £3,000,000 a year for the protection of the butter industry, and a further £3,000,000 a year for the protection of other primary products. No complaint is made against those imposts, but I do resent the lack of fairness on the part of representatives of the primary producers who want protection for themselves but deny it to others. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Corser,</inline> a Queensland member of the House of Representatives, asked- </para>

According to a newspaper report, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Corser</inline> asked  in reference to the suggested reciprocal trade treaty with New Zealand whether the Government would give an assurance that the necessary protective duties on Australian butter, cheese, and bacon would not be reduced. As a representative of primary producers, he was afraid that they might lose the protection which the tariff gives to them.  His  attitude reveals the inconsistency of the farming sections of the community; they are protectionists in respect of what they have to sell, and freetraders in respect of what they buy. They should broaden their minds, take an Australian- wide view, and recognize that a benefit to one section is a benefit to the whole. The duty of honorable senators is to legislate for all t he people, and not for one section only. </para>

                    <para>The railway systems of the Commonwealth and the States were constructed to promote land settlement and industrial development. Most of them are unprofitable, and the community as a whole has to make good the losses. The following table of details of expenditure also shows how the primary producers have been helped :  - </para>

                    <para class="block">In the two directions that I have just indicated the primary producer has been helped to the extent of £21,000,000. I make no complaint on that account. It is quite proper for the Government to help the primary producers. The trouble is that some honorable senators desire protection for the interests with which they are chiefly concerned, and do not want other interests to be protected. </para>
                    <para>Some months ago, when I was in Tasmania, I had the opportunity in company with a number of other honorable members, of visiting the carbide works near Hobart. The manager of the works said to us, "We need more protection."We promised that we would do our best to secure it. Since then, additional protection has been given to this industry. I suppose that the Australian carbide manufacturers now have a complete monopoly of the home trade. It is right that they should have control of the local market. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator J.</inline> B. Hayes was anxious enough for the protection of the carbide industry of Tasmania; but , he has no concern whatever about the protection of some other industries. Certain honorable senators arc freetraders, moderate protectionists, or high protectionists, according to their own circumstances. </para>

                            <para>- I have already said something on that subject. We know that the best wool in the world is grown in Australia. Our climatic conditions and the careful breeding of our stock have made it possible for us to produce first-class wool. We <inline font-style="italic">arc</inline> now rapidly developing a valuable textile industry. There are already in the Commonwealth about 40 well-equipped woollen mills, which employ about 12,000 hands. In New South Wales, there are some 4,000 woollen operatives. With their wives and families, the 12,000 Australian operatives probably number about 60,000 persons - all good customers for the products of the farmer. Our mills are well equipped, and variety - that piquant stimulant of desire - is not lacking, as thousands of new designs and colours in cloths are being turned out every half-year. Tariff duties have made textile manufacturing in Australia commercially possible. Our local mills have been able, during the last eighteen months, to reduce the prices of their goods by from 25 to 30 per cent. Almost every kind of material is now produced by Our woollen mills. One can buy Australian face cloths, tweeds, serges, the lightest weights of woollen crepe, marocains, tropical materials suitable for the most northern climate in Australia, worsted suitings of the highest type, and materials necessary for juvenile wear. Cloths for men's working garments have always been a  feature of our production. The manufacture of these things has been possible only through tariff aid, the organizing ability of our manufacturers, the skill and general excellence of their staffs, and the support of a satisfied public. I hope that those facts will find a lodging place in the mind of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cooper</inline> in particular. I am anxious to build up the Australian textile industry, because I think that we should be supplying the whole of our requirements in woollen goods. </para>

                            <para>- If people will not buy our wool we cannot compel them to do so; but if our wool is worth buying, they will buy it. Honorable senators would object to being compelled to buy something that they did not want. If our textile industry were not protected by substantial duties, it is probable that all our woollen mills would have to cease operation. This would result, first in the dismissal of at least 12,000 hands, and secondly, in the general public being left at the mercy of the importers, who would be able to sell inferior goods at higher prices. We have acted wisely in protecting our textile industries. We have a woollen mill at Mount Gambier, in South Australia. Some time ago, the manager of it said to me, "I hope you will help us. If greater protection is not accorded to us, we shall have to close our doors: if it be granted, we shall be able to increase our output". Additional protection was given, and more hands are being employed at that mill, and the enterprise is on a firmer foundation than ever before. I am glad to know this, not because the mill is situated in South Australia, but because it is evidence of the prosperity of an Australian industry. We ought to remember that we are Australians, and that it is our duty to do our best for the whole of the people of Australia. </para>

                    <para>I come now to a consideration of the position of the industries associated in the metal trade. These give employment to 131,000 people, and pay a very big wages bill. If we were to withdraw protection from them, we should not only deprive 131,000 people of their employment, but we should also have to provide money to pay them the dole. Every section of workers would have to contribute its quota of that dole money. The metal trades have expanded very greatly in the last few years, purely because adequate protection has been afforded them. I do not agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> that struggling industries do not deserve protection. It would be unfair to leave a struggling industry unprotected. </para>
                    <para>A few moments ago <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cooper</inline> said that I had not had much to say concerning those engaged in the production of wool. I do not think it will be disputed that one Australian sheep is worth two of any sheep produced in any other part of the world. That is something of which Australia should be proud. </para>

                            <para>- The South African wool and sheep cannot be favorably compared with Australian wool and Australian sheep. Australia has one-sixth of the world's sheep and produces one-third of the world's total supply of wool. Owing to climatic conditions and the care exercised by sheep breeders, we are able to produce sheep and wool infinitely superior to any other country. If our present high standard is to be maintained we should prevent the indiscriminate exportation of stud stock. If that is not done our supremacy will eventually be challenged by other countries with whom we shall be compelled to enter into strong competition. I trust that Australia will continue to produce and export the best wool. </para>

                            <para>- In South Australia, particularly, builders are not substituting other timbers for  Oregon.  They will continue to use  Oregon  irrespective of its cost, and as that will result  in  building being more costly than it is  to-day  I believe the duties should be  reduced.  I think that should prove to honorable senators that I am dealing fairly with the tariff. </para>

                    <para>Computing in New York against the best motor body production of most countries, an Australian-built Holden body recently won the contest for the best body fitted to a standard general motor ear. The Australian body was the only one in the contest not of the famous Fisher design, so the Australian win is of special importance, as the Fisher design is a world standard for nigh quality car body work. The contest was arranged by General Motors to test the products of its different assembly works throughout the world. To guard against special preparation, the cars were chosen by selected dealers, in each country, and had to be shipped direct from dealers' showrooms to America. They were then examined competitively by General Motors experts, who placed the Australian-bodied car first in assemblage, body construction and finish. </para>
                    <para class="block">That is something of which Australia, and particularly South Australia, which docs not speak of secession, has reason to be proud. We have proved that the Australian workmen are quite as efficient as those  in  any other part of the world. We have competed against them  in  the construction of motor bodies and have won out. </para>

                            <para>- We have never at any time claimed to be freetraders, and have never attempted, or even thought of, advocating such a policy. But despite the statement of the Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Daly)</inline> we contend that there is a limit beyond which the protective policy should not go, and that when it exceeds that limit it may defeat the very object for which it was brought into operation. That limit, many of us urge, has been passed in the schedule now before the Senate, and that is the point from which we approach the discussion of this subject. There is no desire on our part to impute motives to those who do not see eye to eye with us. We do not charge them with not being as good Australians as we are, but we do say that the salvation of the country does not lie exactly in the direction which they suggest it does. I remind those who do not see eye to eye with myself and others on this subject, that we are just as good Australians as they are. We are just as anxious for the welfare of this country, just as eager to see it succeed, and become all that we hope it will be, even though we are not quite at one with them with respect to the manner in which that desirable result may be brought about. </para>

                    <para>Before proceeding further, I propose to reply to several statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hoare,</inline> for whom I have the greatest regard, with respect to the production of our primary industries. He quoted - I do not charge him with having done so with malice aforethought - certain statements concerning the protection given to primary industries, suggesting that it had been freely granted by the people of Australia, and that the Government was now asking for similar protection to be given to the secondary industries by means of the tariff. Any protection given to the primary industries of this country was quite a secondary consideration - almost an afterthought. It was not the first move, but was demanded by those engaged in the industry because of the unfortunate position in which they were placed - because of the intensive struggle in which they were engaged in a country whose secondary industries were highly protected. I refer honorable senators who hold a different view to the reports of the Tariff Board, particularly the report of 1926, which deals specifically with the dairying industry. After a most exhaustive inquiry on the subject, the board stated that it was impossible for the dairying industry of Australia to continue, and to pay decent wages, and that were it not for the fact that the dairy farmer and his entire family worked regardless of wages and conditions imposed by the Arbitration Court, it would be impossible for them to live. </para>

                            <para>- That is true. The protection which the dairying industry receives was levied upon it by those engaged in the industry itself. The protection it receives was not provided by the Government in the first instance. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Paterson,</inline> the author of that scheme, asserted, on behalf of the dairymen of Australia, that if we were able to revert to normal conditions the primary producers, and particularly the butter producers, would dispense with all the protection  granted them under the Paterson scheme or the tariff, provided that the reform had general application. The primary producers did not seek protection ; it's acceptance has been forced upon them. </para>

                            <para>- They would still sell their product. Did they not produce their butter before these iniquitous burdens were placed upon their shoulders by the more favoured section of the community? I am merely explaining why we have to do these things, and answering the charge of inconsistency in asking for protection in respect of our own products while being unwilling to give it to others. That charge cannot lie against us, because protection was granted to other industries long before it was given to primary industries. </para>

                        referred to glucose as an example of protection to a primary industry. The honorable senator's reference was unfortunate. He said that the high duty on glucose was of great benefit to the maize-growers of Australia. I well remember when the honorable senator, us Assistant Minister for Trade and Customs, introduced into the Senate a measure to increase the duty on glucose. That was a different thing altogether from any of the duties now before us, because, in that case, the Tariff Board recommended the increase. Evidence had been presented to it that (he American manufacturers of the glucose which was being sent to Australia were making it from maize which cost them 2s. 8d. a bushel, whereas Australian manufacturers of glucose had to pay 5s. 9 el. a bushel for their maize. As soon as that duty was granted by the Government, the price of maize in Australia dropped from 5s. 9d. to 3s. 8d. a bushel; it has not again risen to its former price. Those who gave that evidence before the Tariff Board were guilty of false pretences, and they ought to have been put in gaol. The honorable senator also referred to dried egg albumen, which, he said, is dutiable at the rate of ?560 a ton. At first sight that seems a tremendously high duty; but the honorable senator did not tell us how many thousands of dozens of eggs would be necessary to make a ton of dried albumen. Having mentioned ?560 a ton as the duty on dried egg albumen, he went on to say that the duty on bananas was only Id. per lb. Probably a ton of dried egg albumen has never yet been imported into this country, so that his whole argument is worthless.

                    <para>During recent weeks all honorable senators have been inundated with a tremendous amount of literature from those who are seeking favours at their hands- I cun not put it otherwise. I am not annoyed at having received this literature - I regard it as a necessary affliction, lt reminds me of the story of a man who alighted from a railway carriage at a suburban station on the outskirts of a city, having in his hand a leaflet issued by a firm of land salesmen. Seeing a boy, he inquired how far it was to the place mentioned on the leaflet. When he was informed that the distance was about 3 miles, he told the boy that that could not be so, because the leaflet he held stated that the lond was only five minutes' walk from the railway station. The boy replied that he could believe him or the land salesman, adding, " But I am not trying to sell you a block of land ". I regard this literature in that light. The people who send it to us are entitled to send it; but, like the land salesmen, they have an object in doing so. Throughout this debate honorable senators have quoted from the pamphlets, leaflets, and letters, statements which they have described as facts. They would have' us believe that they are incontrovertible, like the words of Holy Writ. The mere recital of such statements proves nothing. No honorable senator .has yet attempted to show that these statements can be substantiated. </para>

                        by a number of well-known economists, all of whom can safely be regarded as having dealt with the problems from an academic point of view, entirely without bias. Several quotations from their book have been given to the Senate in support of n policy of high protection, yet any one who has read the book right through cannot but feel that those men were apprehensive of high duties. Indeed, they say that the policy has been carried beyond reasonable limits.

                        <para>. - Some days ago, when discussing the Commonwealth Debt Conversion Bill, a promise was given that consideration would be shown to small bondholders. The Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Barnes)</inline> gave his assurance that the matter was engaging the attention of the Government, and that provision would be made for necessitous cases. Notwithstanding that promise, a man whose life savings amounting to £200 were invested in government securities was recently told that it was most unlikely that any assistance would be extended to him at all, and that if he was in need of the money, he could sell his bond. I submit that that is not the kind of communication which should be addressed to a man who either assented voluntarily to the conversion scheme, or was compelled to do so under the legislation passed by this Parliament. After all, he was merely asking for something which was his own, and of which he had been temporarily deprived. I hope that the Minister will look into this matter, and give instructions that replies of that nature are not to be given to bondholders. </para>
