          <para>- Is it a fact that the details of the bill, and the suggestion for a flat rate bounty were not submitted to the banks until this week? Has a decision been reached whereby a bounty to the amount of Â£3,000,000 will be paid at a flat rate in respect of the 1931 crop? If so, will the bounty be paid in respect of the exportable surplus or on the total production ? </para>

Through the courtesy of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly,</inline> I have been permitted to peruse the correspondence between the Commonwealth and State governments, and I. find that, in the first instance, four States regarded the proposed statute with such hostility that they were constrained to send their objections direct to the British Government. Western Australia, Tasmania, and South Australia - the three least populous States - persist in their objections, and have informed the Commonwealth Government that the supplementary motion now before the Senate does not meet their views. A motion of protest by the Premier of Western Australia, in the Legislative Assembly on the 28th July, was carried unanimously. In that chamber three parties  are stronglY  represented, the Labour Opposition  being  in only a small minority, and it  is significant  that the motion submitted by  the  Premier  wa3  carried unanimously  in that  chamber, and in the Legislative Council.

The Government of Queensland also advised the Prime Minister that it supported the representations made by Tasmania, and the Government of South Australia, in a communication to the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, intimated that it identified itself with the requests and objections of the Government of Tasmania. This was the position when, on the 8th September, SirRobert Garran, the Commonwealth Solicitor-General, at the Premiers Conference in Melbourne, circulated a memorandum which, to a large extent, embodies the views expressed by the Federal Government, and which, for the purpose of record, I ask permission to have incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.

            <para>It is understood that some of the States have expressed a wish to be consulted before the Statute becomes law. The Statutehas been framed to give effect to the Balfour Memorandum of 1920, and the report of the conference on the operation of dominion law; and to bring the law into harmony with the established principles of dominion status. So far as Australia is concerned, it deals for the most part with Commonwealth legislation. There are only two clauses which in any way affect the States. Referring to the clauses by the numbers which they bear in the resolution of the Federal Houses of Parliament, they are as follow :  - </para>
            <para>Clause 1 declares that the Parliament of a dominion has full power to make laws having extraterritorial operation. It does not affect the laws of a State. </para>
            <para>Clause 2 makes the Colonial Laws Validity Actcease to apply to future acts of a deminion parliament. Such acts will not he void for repugnance to a British act of Parliament. This clause does not affect acts of the State Parliaments at all. </para>
            <para>Clause 3 declares that no future British act shall extend to a dominion, unless it contains a declaration that the dominion has requested and consented to its enactment. In the case of Australia, the re quest and consent must be by the Parliament and Government of the Commonwealth. </para>

            <para class="block">It has, however, been suggested by the Western Australian Parliament that the Statute, as drafted, may affect the right of the States to ask for legislation by Parliament at Westminster on a purely State matter, without seeking the concurrence of the Commonwealth Parliament. The Commonwealth Government cannot conceive that such a question is likely to arise in practice; but is prepared to consider the making of provision for it in the Statute. Clause 5 is merely a definition clause, desired by the British Government, which wishes in future to restrict the word " colony ", in British acts, to Crown colonies, and not to use it, for instance, in reference to the Commonwealth or a State. Clause 6 deals with the application to dominions of certain existing British laws. The first paragraph provides that sections 735 and 736 of the Merchant Shipping Act, dealing with the powers of colonial legislatures, shall be construed as not referring to the Parliament of a dominion. This does not affect the Parliament of a State. The second paragraph relates to Colonial Courts of Admiralty, and- merely provides that a provision of the Colonial Courtsof Admiralty Act, which requires certain laws to be reserved for the King's assent,and certain rules of court to be approved by the King in Council, shall cease to have effect in any dominion. - This clause, as it stands, would apparently apply to a State act and a rule of a State Court of Admiralty. It does not, however, affect the relations between Commonwealth and Status, but merely frees the States, as well as the Commonwealth, from a disability. If, however, the State Governments do not all concur in the clause, the Commonwealth Government will consider its limitation so as to exclude State laws and rules of court from its operation. </para>

            <para>Adverting to previous correspondence on the subject of the proposed Statute of Westminster, and to the statement in regard thereto which you circulated at the recent Conference of Premiers, I desire to append hereto the text of a report which I have received from the Crown Law Authorities of this State on the matter: - </para>
          </quote>
          <para>Such statement closely agrees with my own views of the position, but I would suggest the following': - </para>
          <para>Clause 1. Extraterritorial jurisdiction is desirable in both Commonwealth and States. </para>
          <para>Clauses 2 and 3. If this is to be conceded, component States should in respect of matters within their own sphere of legislation be placed on the same footing as dominions. The reasons for objecting to these clauses appear to be (a) the confusion which will ensue on different legislation being passed by different dominions on matters of common interest; (b) the deprivation of the States of power to appeal to the British Parliament in cases of emergency; (c) the deprivation of all classes of the undoubted benefit of appeal to the Privy Council - a perfectly indifferent body-a great privilege to "a small country. </para>
          <para>Clause 4. If allowed, the clause should be more carefully drafted, as indicated in first part of letter. </para>
          <para>Clause 5. As indicated, this definition might be extended to make " dominion " include a " component State " for the purposes of this act. </para>
          <para>Clause6. Is subject to - the objections set out in regard to clauses 2 and 3. - The statement that the Commonwealth Government is willing to consider excluding the States is worth nothing in practice, the matters being at present Commonwealth matters, in respect of which the desires of the Commonwealth have already been limited owing to conflict with Imperial acts. Hence the desire to throw off the chains. </para>
          <para>It appears to me that the whole effect of the act will be to aggrandize the Commonwealth at the expense of the States, and greatly disturb the balance, so strenuously fought to be protected at the time of entering the federation. </para>
          <para class="block">The concluding sentence sets out very clearly the objections and fears of the four States mentioned. There is a wellgrounded belief in those States that, because of the definite trend to be noticed almost daily in the attitude of Commonwealth Ministers and officials towards the aggrandizement of the Commonwealth at the expense of the States, they would be in a more secure position without this statute. </para>

              <para>- It was possible for Southern Ireland, notwithstanding its proximity to the seat of government in Great Britain, to take action in that direction. But whether or not the States may do this is, for the moment, beside the question. It is our responsibility to see that the sovereign rights enjoyedby the States at the foundation of the Commonwealth, are not interfered with. The smaller States, numerically, would never have entered the federation if the people had thought that, later, there would be this growing tendency towards unification, and the definite attempt, on the part of successive governments, to increase Commonwealth legislative authority in every direction. The objections made by Tasmania and South Australia contain the gravamen of the objections made by the Government of "Western Australia. The unsympathetic reply of the Prime Minister to the Premier of South Australia, suggests the belief that, in introducing this statute, the ambition of the Commonwealth Government was to take further power from the States.

              <para>- At all events it is clear that, in their view, it does not remove their objections to the statute. They have said this definitely. In my opinion, it takes away constitutional rights which they have enjoyed up to the present. If passed in its present form it would establish a Commonwealth suzerainty over the States. This amendment does not go far enough to protect the States. I therefore hope that honorable senators will approve of an amendment which I intend to submit, the effect of which will be to preserve the existing rights of the States, including the liberty to secede from the federation. </para>

I would point out that the proposed Statute of Westminster has the unanimous support of the Governments and Parliaments of all the dominions, and also received the support of all parties in the Commonwealth Parliament. Objections by a State which wore based on a possible prejudice to the position of the States would, of course, receive careful consideration; but in the absence of any such possibility I invite you to reconsider the matter and withdraw your opposition. </para>

I appreciate the courtesy of the Government in permitting us to see the correspondence which passed between, the Commonwealth Government and the State Governments in regard to this matter, but I should also like to see the communications which passed between the British Government and the Commonwealth Government. Our Australian Constitution is an Imperial Act, and the power which created that legislation can amend it if it thinks fit. As a matter of fact, the Western Australian Government is about to introduce legislation to enable a State-wide "referendum to be taken on whether or not Western Australia shall secede from the Commonwealth. This information was published in this morning's newspapers. The people of Western Australia are not asking for any privileges; they are asking only to be allowed to exercise the rights which the Constitution allowed to them when they agreed to federate. They are asking that the position shall not be altered on the very eve of the referendum by this proposed legislation. </para>

              <para>- On the 7th October, the  Tasmanian  Government announced its intention to submit a resolution to the Parliament of that State setting forth that the enactment of the Statute of Westminster would not be in the interests of the people of Tasmania. That resolution has not been dealt with. On the 13th October, the clause which it was proposed to insert in the amending legislation, was submitted to the Tasmanian and Western Australian Governments. On the loth October, a telegram was sent conveying to them the terms of the legislation we are now considering. That telegram was read in the Senate yesterday by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> On the 16th October, the Government of Queensland telegraphed stating that, in view of the assurances given, it withdrew its objection. On the 19th October, the Premier of Western Australia telegraphed stating that, as the protest of that State represented the unanimous decision of Parliament, it was not competent for him to withdraw the objection. On the 19th October, the Premier of Tasmania telegraphed stating that the Government of Tasmania considered that the present was an opportune time to place on record its protest against certain portions of the statute. The message went on to say that the Government could not understand how this matter could be one of great urgency, and that, as the resolution was before the Tasmanian Parliament, the Government must accept the decision of that body. On the 20th October, after this proposed legislation had been submitted for the consideration of the Premier of South Australia, he advised that the South Australian Government was unable to withdraw its objection to clause 3. </para>

              <para>- Home rule for Western Australia, certainly; and it also seeks an escape for Western Australia from federal taxation and dominance and a tariff which is killing our primary industries. The Commonwealth Government has not met the objections of Western Australia, Tasmania, and South Australia. On the contrary, having sought the opinions of those States on the merits of the amendment before us, it now proceeds to brush those opinions aside. It has the support of the big battalions who represent the three more populous States in the House of Representatives, and, with their assistance, it will force this legislation through in defiance of the wishes of the ' other States. That, of course, is in accordance with the practice of federal governments in their dealings with the 'smaller States of the Commonwealth. I propose to move an amendment which will meet some of the objections raised by the State Governments to this legislation. I doubt whether it goes as far as it might, particularly in safeguarding the position in regard to merchant shipping and the Navigation Act. </para>

Western Australian senators received many protests on the subject. The people in the smaller States are merely seeking to retain their rights under the Constitution as these existed six months ago. The revolutionary proposals of the Commonwealth Government for unification show how necessary it is to have the safeguard contained in the proviso I am moving to insert in the statute for the protection of the smaller States. The Parliament of Western Australia, by a resolution passed unanimously in both Houses, has expressed its opposition to the statute, and its desire to strengthen and preserve the ties between the people of the State and the homeland; unless the amendment I have moved is accepted, those ties will undoubtedly be considerably weakened. The amendment, at any rate, will enable us to attain the very desirable object aimed at by the resolution passed by the Western Australian Parliament. </para>

              <para>- I have read and reread the Government's proposal, and I do not think that it is clear enough. I think that it could have been put in a much simpler form. If it had been stated as clearly as the first portion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston's</inline> amendment, we could understand its effect better. I forwarded the Government's proposal to Tasmania last week asking for any comments upon it, and the reply I received in a lengthy telegram was simply to the effect that the people who are interested in the subject are entirely opposed to approval being given to the Statute of Westminster. That approval, unfortunately, was given over two months ago, and we arc now considering an addendum to the resolution to which both Houses agreed at that time. </para>

          <para>Tasmania has greater cause than any other State for dreading the taking away of powers which the States have always possessed. Because of its peculiarly isolated position, it has for years been subjected to disabilities which are not suffered by any other part of the Commonwealth, and we feel that at any moment it may be necessary to appeal to the Home authorities for protection against some of the legislation on the Commonwealth Statute-book, to wit, the Navigation Act, which has been so oppressive in many directions to Tasmania. One can understand the disinclination of the Tasmanian Government and of commercial men in that State, who have formed associations to safeguard the interests of the State, to approve of a resolution which takes away from them some of the rights they now possess. At any rate, that was my reason for oppos-  ing the resolution when it came before the Senate in July last. It also explains why I am heartily in accord with the first portion of the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston.</inline> I have had no indication or suggestion from Tasmania, from the Government or the Chamber of Commerce, or any of the bodies which are watching this matter, concerning the second portion of the honorable senator's amendment in regard to secession. </para>

            <para>- Prominent authorities differ with regard to' the legality of certain portions of that act. I have before me the report. of a sub-committee appointed by the Hobart Chamber of Commerce regarding- the effect of the Statute of Westminster, and the report has been described as remarkable for the clarity with which it has dealt with the subject. It warns Tasmanian exporters interested in the oversea trade of the consequences which, in the opinion of Professor Berriedale Keith, Doctor of Civil Law, seem sure to follow if the Commonwealth, unfettered by the Merchant Shipping Act, is allowed to pursue its objective, whatever that may be. Therefore, it is difficult to decide the best course to follow with regard to the motion before the Senate. But I am desirous of doing all I can to protect the rights of the States, and if that object can be achieved by voting for the amendment, the amendment will have my support. </para>

        <para class="block">This amendment alters the form of the proposed new sub-section. 1, in order more clearly to express the intention of that sub-section. It is considered that, in its present form it might be held to limit the power of the Governor-General to fix more than one maximum rate, percentage, or- extent to which Commonwealth remuneration might be subject under all the laws of a State imposing a tax upon incomes; that is to say, that the Governor-General might not have the power to fix a maximum rate, percentage, or extent of ordinary income, tax, and another maximum rate, percentage, or extent of tax for unemployment relief within a State. It is intended that . the power of the Governor-General in this respect should en able him to fix a maximum rate, percentage, or extent to which remuneration -received from the Commonwealth should be subject in respect of ordinary income tax, and to fix separately a maximum rate, percentage, or extent to which the remuneration shall be subject to any special tax such as unemployment relief tax. Accordingly, the amendment now proposed has been drafted to confer the desired power' upon the Governor-General. </para>
        <para>It has also been found necessary to consider an alteration in the form of the present sub-section 1 to clause 3 in order to meet the position in Tasmania caused by the manner in which its taxes have been imposed to provide funds for the relief of unemployment. In that State a special income tax of 3d. in the Â£1 has been imposed on all taxable incomes, except salaries and wages received by employees other than Commonwealth employees. On the salaries and wages of employees other than Commonwealth employees a stamp duty equal to 3d. in the Â£1 has been imposed, to be paid by a stamp affixed to each receipt given for the payment of salary or wages of Â£1 or over, which is payable at a rate equal ' to, or exceeding, Â£1' per week, on whatever basis the sum is calculated, whether hourly, daily, weekly, or otherwise. </para>
        <para>There is nothing in either the Income Tax Act or the Stamp Duties Act by which these taxes have been imposed to connect the taxes with unemployment relief; but it is officially understood that the taxes are for that purpose. That, however, would not be sufficient to cause them to be affected by the proposed maximum rates, percentages, or extents to be fixed by the 'Governor-General, as those to which Commonwealth remuneration in Tasmania would be subject for purposes of unemployment relief. It is, therefore, necessary to make a special provision to that end. That provision is expressed in the later part of the new paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> proposed to be inserted in the bill. That proposed amendment should meet the objection raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch.</inline> It is designed to make the legislation clearer, and to simplify its working. </para>

          <para>. - A most extraordinary method appears to have been adopted in sub-clause 1 to deal with a simple position, although. possibly, the Leader of the Government <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Barnes)</inline> will be able to give good reasons for it. Already we have statutory legislation which gives the States plenary powers' of taxation over the public servants of the Commonwealth. It is now proposed to empower the Governor-General - the executive government of the country - to fix a limit to that power by notice published in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette,</inline> without any reference at all to the 1907 act. I doubt whether in thi3 measure we are effectively exercising our legislative powers. In any case, it is an extraordinary course to adopt. The provisions of the 1907 act appear to have been overlooked. Unless we exercise care now, we may have to ask the courts to determine whether the law, as laid down in the 1907 act, or the present legislation, is effective. I question whether this legislature can delegate to the Executive Council, either by a proclamation or other means, the power virtually to limit the statutory powers of the States. I agree with the Minister as to the need for this legislation ; but I suggest that the point mentioned should be taken into consideration by him in consultation with the law officers of the Crown. My only desire is that this legislation shall be as perfect as possible. The Parliament of the Commonwealth should have some control over the proclamation, or the regulation, whichever is contemplated. Apparently, these provisions have been drafted without regard to the provisions of the 1907 act. </para>

          <para>- That does seem to help; but it seems wrong that this Parliament should empower the executive Government either to increase or decrease the rights which were conferred on the States by the 1907 statute. Whether we can do it at all is a matter of doubt; and whether it should be done in this way is open to question. I think that I know the Minister's intention in this matter, and I sympathize with him accordingly. He hopes that this power will never need to be exercised, but, should it be required, he wants to be sure that it can be exercised effectively. If the power is to be used at all, it will be used only in a time of difficulty, when heavy inroads on the incomes of Commonwealth public servants are contemplated. At such a time a serious conflict might arise between the Commonwealth and a State. Should such a position arise, I want the Commonwealth to be well armed, so that justice may be done. </para>

          <para>The limitation is that the agencies of the Federal Government are only exempted from State legislation, so far as that legislation may interfere with, or impair their efficiency in performing the functions by which they are designed to serve that Government. </para>

        <para class="block">The only limitation upon the power of a State to impose taxation upon Commonwealth public servants and members of the Commonwealth Parliament is that it shall not impair their efficiency. Who is to be the judge of that matter, if it be not the States which have the power to levy taxation? If we allow the Federal Parliament to exercise that power we admit that the Federal Parliament is arrogating to itself a right which constitutionally belongs to the States, because the High Court has said so. The amendment of the Minister mystifies the position still further; it leaves the original contention unanswered. The bill makes it clear that it is the intention of the Federal Government that the Commonwealth shall usurp a power which does not constitutionally belong to it. It proposes to step in and say to the States, "We intend to do the job for you, as we think proper ". What kind of a position is this, that allows the taxation that rightly falls within the province of the States to be fixed by a foreign body? I use the term " foreign " advisedly. This Government desires to take from the States an autonomous right that belongs to them. If the Federal Government can usurp the powers to which the States are constitutionally entitled in respect of public servants, it can do so in respect of any other power. I want to prevent the Commonwealth Government from reaching out an .unconstitutional hand and taking to itself a right which the framers of the Constitution never intended that it should enjoy. So far as I am concerned, the efforts of members of the Government to camouflage the position are in vain. They talk of the need to give " protection " to federal public servants. Very shrewdly, they do not define " protection ". If they declared their intentions honestly, it would be disclosed that this clause is designed to save Commonwealth public servants, and members of Parliament and Ministers, from a degree of taxation to which ordinary citizens are subjected. Such an action is unwarranted. Do honorable senators seriously contend that the framers of the Constitution would have countenanced the action that is contemplated by the Government? Not for a moment would they have done so. </para>
        <para>This Government merely wishes to add another power to the many that it has usurped. It is but natural for an individual or a government to grasp at additional powers. We all have the octopuslike propensity of reaching out continually for more. Shelley stated that power is the most detestable possession ever placed within the reach of man, if improperly used. The acquisitiveness of nations, ever seeking additional power, has been a curse since the world began. If the struggling principalities which constituted Germany had not been welded together by one who was greedy for power, and if the resultant empire had not sought more and more power, the Great War would not have occurred. That holocaust was thrust upon the world merely because the German Empire possessed power, and was hungry for more. Why does this Federal Parliament want additional authority which can be attained only at the expense of the States? As Aristotle wisely said, " There can be no real justice between combatants that are unequal ". Here we have a powerful federation, greedily acquisitive, pitted against a number of States. The combatants are unequal, and there is no real justice. </para>
        <para>While it is natural for man to reach out for more power, it is also natural for the section which will be afflicted by the abuse of that power, to try to prevent the predatory person from acquiring more. The Constitution exists to prevent the improper acquisition of powers by the Federal Government, and I stand for the maintenance of a federal system, and its strictly proper spirit. This Senate has just dealt with another measure that encroaches upon the spirit of the Constitution, by which it gives to the central authority additional powers to the detriment of the States. I learnt at school the truism, as old as the hills, that "Finance is government, and government is finance". If the Commonwealth is granted this additional power, the States will be deprived of a source of taxation, and therefore of finance, which is necessary ' to enable them to carry out the many varied and costly social services that have conferred benefits on so many. When I was in Queensland years ago, the Government of that State gave to the people many amenities of life that were made possible only because of the inflow of taxes. This proposal will close an avenue of taxation to the States, and do them an injustice. Let us preserve the balance fairly. There was- a time when it was necessary that all should encourage the federal spirit. That time has passed. Now, it is imperative that we should endeavour to preserve the rights of the States, in fact the life of the States, against the predatory Commonwealth Government. This proposal is merely the forerunner of many other similar actions which will engender bad blood between the States and the Commonwealth. This chamber is the custodian of the rights of the States, and- its members should say to the Government, "You shall go this far, but no farther." Let the public servants and parliamentarians pay their measure of taxation like everybody else in the community. I object strongly to the clause, and move - </para>

            <para>- I have already done so. I am afraid that it is the honorable senator who lacks knowledge on the subject. The present law provides that federal members, ministers, and employees shall not be taxed by the States at higher rates than those in force on the 30th June, 1930. Every one in Australia now recognizes that that was an iniquitous provision, and for that reason the Government is proposing its repeal. I commend it for doing so. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> desires to eliminate from the bill the substitute proposal of the Government, which is that the Governor-General in Council, which really means the Government, may at any time interfere with the taxation laws of the States in so far as they relate to federal members, ministers, and employees,  and,  incidentally, interfere with the practice in Australia for the last ten or fifteen years of taxing all residents in a State at the rates applicable to their incomes. I can- not see that there is any room for argument about the equity of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch's</inline> amendment, and I hope that it will be agreed to. </para>

            <para>- It was not. When it came to applying the provision which really pegged the amount of State taxation at which federal members, ministers and employees were liable, it was found that an anomaly had been created. The object of the clause which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> is seeking to amend is to correct that anomaly. What would be our position if one clay we affirm a principle and the next day, without any reason whatever, we abandon it? The Government is really asking the committee to restore to the States a right which was inadvertently taken from them. If the clause is agreed to, the States will be able to impose heavier taxation upon federal members, ministers, and employees than they can now impose. The provisions of section 19 of the principal act were part and parcel of the financial emergency plan, the underlying principle of which was that the sacrifices of the community should be 33 near equality as was possible. But by enacting that certain, residents in the States should not be called upon to pay State taxation at a higher rate than that which applied on the 30th June, 1930, we fettered the State Governments to some extent, and created a somewhat sheltered class. in certain States. The object of the Government is to enable the States, in collaboration with the Commonwealth, to provide that there shall be no such sheltered class. </para>

            <para>- The honorable senator surely realizes that, in pursuance of the provisions of the financial emergency plan, certain governments were authorized to take individual action. The Commonwealth Government, for instance, made percentage reductions in the remuneration of members of Parliament, ministers of the Crown, and Commonwealth employees generally. In considering the burden of taxation which the persons affected by that action should be called upon to bear, such salary reductions should surely be taken into account. If the amendment is agreed to, and the remainder of the bill passed, the position will be as it was before the Financial Emergency Act came into operation, and there will certainly be inequalities of sacrifice. </para>

            <para>- As I have said, the main principle underlying the plan was that there should be equality of sacrifice, and it was felt that to secure such equality in respect of federal members, Ministers, and employees, it  Was  necessary to peg the amount of State taxation to which they should be liable. This was found to be anomalous. The Commonwealth Government wishes to give greater elasticity to the law relating to the taxation by the States of those who draw their incomes from the Commonwealth. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch's</inline> amendment is agreed to, and the Government finds it desirable to drop the bill, the States will continue to suffer the present disabilities iu this regard. </para>

            <para>- But the terms of the partnership were submitted to Parliament, and this particular provision was agreed to without a word of discussion. The plain fact is that an endeavour is being made to return to the States a right that was taken away from them, and I cannot understand <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> making a fuss about such a proposal. We shall have a glaring case of inconsistency if the Senate agrees to this amendment, seeing that it agreed to the provision in the principal act only a few weeks ago without a single dissentient. The financial emergency plan was very carefully considered by the Senate. The object of this clause is to remove an anomaly caused by the pegging of the amount of State taxation which federal members, Ministers, and employees may be called upon to pay. By asking us to accept this amendment, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> is, in effect, inviting us to repudiate the terms of the partnership to which I hav referred. </para>

This matter has received the most careful consideration of the Government, and it prefers its own wording to that of the honorable senator. The honorable senator may have a greater knowledge of drafting than is possessed by the expert advisers of the Government, but I take leave to doubt it. I understand that Australia is the only dominion which is lagging behind in expressing its will regarding the proposed Statute of Westminster. </para>

I hope that the Senate will not, therefore, waste any lime in discussing the amendment. </para>

            <para>. -  When the resolution consenting to the proposed Statute of Westminster was before the Senate last July, I and a number of other honorable senators opposed it for what we considered to be good and sufficient reasons. The objections that we then urged against it have not lost any of their force iu the meantime. I do not consider that it would be in the interests of the Commonwealth to agree to the proposed Statute. No request for such legislation has ever been made by a State government, or even by the Commonwealth Government. The Commonwealth Parliament has the power to legislate within certain constitutional limits, and I have yet to learn what necessity there was for the proposal to which this Parliament signified its assent some months ago. A majority of honorable senators differed from me on that occasion, and the resolution submitted by the Government was agreed to. It would now appear that certain doubts existed, and that those who were -in a minority in this chamber had strong grounds for the attitude that they took up. I venture to affirm that had it not been for the determined stand that we then took, in order to make doubly secure the position of the different States, the motion that we are now discussing would not have seen the light of day. I am at a loss to understand the reason for the opposition of the Government to the amendment that has been moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> E. Johnston. In this case, also, those honorable senators who are behind the mover of the amendment, even though they are in a minority in this chamber, may be adopting the right course. Although we were almost ridiculed for our opposition to the previous resolution, the very Government that then strongly condemned our attitude now proposes an amendment that is designed to make doubly secure the position of the States. It is abundantly clear that those who drafted the previous resolution, do not view it to-day as they did then. We who support the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> B. Johnston, have the backing of some of the States, who do not believe that their position has been sufficiently safeguarded. Can any serious objection be raised by the Government to this latest proposal? This is the States House, -and it is our duty to safeguard their interests. If there is the slightest doubt in the minds of the Premiers of the States, and they make representations to us, we are bound to pay heed to them. </para>

              <para>- Did they say that they were satisfied with the objections that we raised to the passage of the previous resolution? They did not. But we, as their representatives, drew attention to the position that we considered would be created ; and the objection that they raise to-day proves that <inline font-style="italic">kc.</inline> were amply justified in what we then did. The Government ought to welcome anything that does not destroy or conflict with the object that it has in view. You, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> having looked into the matter, have ruled that in its present form, the amendment will make a reasonable and an intelligent addition to the resolution. As a representative of one of the States, I consider that this is the proper cause for us to adopt. We should prevent, as far as possible, the peaceful penetration and absorption by the Commonwealth of the sovereign rights of the States. The Commonwealth Parliament has, from time to time, made serious inroads into the rights of the States, which the people, when they voted for federation 30 years ago, believed would not be interfered with. The Commonwealth Government has passed legislation and committed many acts which some people contend amount really to a violation of the Constitution. Many persons are suffering injustices under Commonwealth law, and it is only the heavy cost involved in taking legal proceedings that prevents them from testing, the constitutionality of certain Commonwealth legislation. I support the amendment of the Government, and also the further amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> B. Johnston, which seeks to safeguard the rights of the States. </para>

Johnston we are acting in conformity with the desires and view of the States, whereas if we support the motion of the Government we shall be acting against their interests. I submit that the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> B. Johnston has never been submitted to the States, and it, therefore, cannot be said that they are prepared to accept it as an alternative to the proposal of the Government. Both amendments have the same meaning, and the question is, therefore, which is the better drafted. Whatever objection the States may have to the amendment of the Government applies equally to the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> B. Johnston, because both mean the same thing. Let us examine the substance of the objections of the States, with which we are mainly concerned. First of all, the States took exception to the statute as it was originally drafted. So did I. I spoke against it and voted against it. Then certain correspondence  took place between the Commonwealth and the States, and the States expressed reasons for their objections. The Commonwealth Government framed the amendment now before us, after having heard the objections of four of the States. It was submitted to them, and in a further letter, the Prime Minister asked whether they were now satisfied. The Queensland Government said that it was satisfied, and it withdrew its objection to the statute. The Premier of Western Australia telegraphed - </para>

I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> will agree that, if we added the relevant portion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston's</inline> amendment, it would not be surprising if the Imperial Parliament decided that it would be better to dissolve the Commonwealth Parliament.

If the final words of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston's</inline> amendment had been ruled to be in order, I could have understood his persisting in the amendment, but I ask the Senate to refuse to forward to the Imperial authorities that portion of the amendment which, while considered to be in order, would not do credit to a thirdclass school. </para>

At that time we were at great pains to safeguard the rights of the Commonwealth and of the States; we endeavoured to maintain the <inline font-style="italic">status quo</inline> in regard to both the States and the Commonwealth. Subsequently, exception was taken by a well-known legal authority in South Australia to the provisions of paragraph 3 of the schedule, which reads - </para>

              <para>- Before the dinner adjournment I addressed myself to the provisions of paragraph 3 of the schedule, with which South Australia was not completely satisfied, and in connexion with which it desired to have the position clarified. The proposal of the Government tends to have that effect. As I see this proposed legislation by the Imperial Parliament, which is the outcome of the 1926 conference, it is not intended to interfere with the -rights of either the States or the Commonwealth. They are preserved in <inline font-style="italic">statu quo;</inline> parapraph 4 undoubtedly points in that direction. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline></para>
            </talk.start>

          <para class="block">Johnston has moved, an amendment, seeking to add a proviso that " nothing in this act shall be construed to take away from the States of the Commonwealth of Australia any of the constitutional rights that they retained at the foundation of the Commonwealth". I submit that there is absolutely nothing in the proposed enactment that suggests that anything of the sort should be done; that the limitations that have already been provided have been put in out of " abundant caution " as the lawyers would say, so that none of the existing rights shall be interfered with. Further, I point out to the honorable senator, as <inline font-style="italic">1.</inline> think I did on a previous occasion, that we seem to be jumping before we have reached the stile. When made, this enactment, and I particularly have in mind paragraphs 1, 2, 3 and 6, is subject to adoption by the Commonwealth Parliament, and any act of this Parliament which adopts an amending section may provide that it shall have effect from the commencement of the statute, or at some future date. There is a further safeguarding provision, that the Parliament may at any time revoke the adoption of any section of an act. That may not afford a great deal of assistance to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston,</inline> but it is quite obvious that before this statute can be put into operation, the Commonwealth Parliament has to pass a law adopting the enactment. It, therefore, appears to me that the time for considering the effect of such legislation should be when it is proposed to adopt the statute. </para>
          <para>The amendment proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> does not carry the position one whit further than it stands under the existing provision. The amendment of the Government is simply to make abundantly clear what is meant by the words of sub-paragraph 3 of the recommended statute. It might have been argued that the request need only come from the Commonwealth Parliament of Australia under sub-paragraph (2) of paragraph 3, and it now is made quite manifest by the Government's motion that the action must have the concurrence not only of the Commonwealth, but also of the States, if their rights are affected. </para>
          <para>I can see no reason for passing the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston.</inline> After considerable reflection on the subject, I cannot even see the necessity for the motion that is proposed by the Government, but as the States have expressed some doubt as to the effect of subparagraph (2), I propose to vote for the motion.  I  do not think that the amendment is really in keeping with the intention of the legislation. The . vice that the honorable senator aims to cure is not present in the statute that we are asking the Imperial Parliament to pass. In the circumstances, I suggest to the honorable senator that it is futile to incorporate his amendment, because there is no suggestion anywhere, except in that amendment, that any of the constitutional rights of the States are in any way interfered with. The position that previously prevailed, still obtains. </para>

Had I been I certainly should have joined with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline></para>
          <para class="block">Pearce and those other honorable senators who opposed its adoption. I know that I should be quite out of order in discussing the merits of that resolution now; therefore, I do not intend to do so. I suggest that neither the original resolution nor its amendment should have been submitted to this Senate without the holding of some preliminary conference between the Commonwealth and State Premiers. A number of those conferences have been held during the past few months, and ample opportunity might have been found to  submit  the whole matter before the first resolution was submitted to this Parliament. Had such occurred, it might have been possible to formulate a resolution that would have suited all parties. I am not sure that that would have been the result, because, after all, the objection of some of the States to this entire resolution is fundamental. Underlying the whole business is the fact that a great number of people in some of the States regret profoundly that the Imperial Conference of 1926 was ever held, and wish that the previous relationship between the Mother Country and Australia had been continued. Before the holding of that conference, no bond was irksome, and there was nothing to which exception could be taken. </para>
          <para>I was in England at the time when the conference was held, and I formed the impression that two members attended that conference knowing exactly what they wanted. And they got it. The Prime Minister of Australia was not one of them. That, too, is the feeling of the people in a number of our States. "What has been done since the 1926 conference has been contrary to the best interests of Australia, and of the Empire. Some of us formed the opinion then that two or three more conferences of that nature would go a long way towards destroying the British Empire. That, I admit, is a matter that could better have been discussed on the original resolution. The amendment improves matters to some extent, but I regret very deeply that, when the Government discovered that certain States were strongly opposed to the whole proposal, it did not provide an opportunity for the Premiers to discuss the subject fully. Had that been done, it might have been possible to introduce a motion which would have been satisfactory to all parties. </para>

        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir HAL</inline>COLEBATCH (Western Australia) [8.49]. - I rise merely to express the hope that we are doing the right thing, notwithstanding the rather irregular and cumbersome manner in which We seem to be proceeding. I also wish to offer two observations. In the first place, I trust that- we shall have an opportunity of seeing the bill as it has been amended before we are asked to vote for its third reading; and, in the second place, that the Government will take note of these proceedings, and that this will be the last time that it will attempt to pass legislation containing an utterly improper provision designed . to give it despotic power. I hope it will realize that the Senate does not intend in future to pass any legislation that proposes to give absolutely despotic power to the Executive; that "when it delegates a portion of its law-making power to the Executive it will retain the right of reviewing what the Executive chooses to do under that delegated power. </para>

          <para>. -  I do not think that there was any need for the observations that have just been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> with respect to the Government. The Government desired to provide a simple method of prescribing the manner in which this particular provision should be given legislative effect. When that was objected to by honorable senators, the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Barnes)</inline> readily accepted the alternative suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch.</inline> I strenuously combat the suggestion that the Opposition has given the Government a sound thrashing, in consequence of which it is likely in future to behave more decorously. No exception was taken to this particular provision by the Opposition in another place. The Opposition in this chamber, however, with its big majority, wished to make it more cumbersome than we desired, and. like Lazarus, we have to accept the crumbs that fall to us. If on another occasion we bring down legislation designed, in accordance with the Premiers' plan, to cut down  expenditure, by saving the cost of issuing regulations and resorting to the practice of publication in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette,</inline> and the Opposition, with its majority, insists upon regulations, I do not think that  the Government will take umbrage at their action. I am sure that on this occasion every honorable senator opposite will candidly admit that, from the moment a protest was launched from their benches, we did not show any disposition to withhold from them the satisfaction of achieving what they considered to be a victory. </para>

          <para>. - I do not think that we should allow <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> to get away with his rather uncharitable reference to the Opposition, which has stood him in such good stead in the passage of this measure. Were it not for us, it would never have been passed. I am at a loss properly to describe the amendment. In the first place, it means mischief; but even in its most mischievous aspect it has been robbed of some of its sting by another amendment that the Government has accepted. The Minister declined to accept the amendment of substance that I desired to have incorporated in the bill, but for its rejection he was obliged to depend upon members of the Opposition. Therefore, my complaint is not against him, but against my own colleagues and pals, who could not for the time being appreciate the scintillating wisdom of my proposal for the improvement of this measure. The insertion of the words now proposed is a very wise move, and represents a big concession by the Government. Borrowing the luminous language of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly,</inline> I may say that those of us in this corner who wish to see the measure improved, are glad to accept even the smallest crumb that falls from the Government's table. These three words "by regulation prescribe " will improve the measure. They' are almost as important as the word " not ", which occurs iu the ten commandments. As a result of their insertion, the Senate, which is the equal of another place in power, will, in future, have au opportunity of reviewing the actions of governments in the matter of prescribing the maximum amount, rate, percentage, or extent, of taxation imposed upon public servants of the Commonwealth and members of this Parliament, who, after the passage of this legislation, will form a special class that has not previously existed in the history of this Commonwealth. I congratulate the Government on its wisdom, and myself on my good fortune in obtaining its consent to the amendment. </para>

            <para>. - We are trying to discover whether the States, as such, have any standing at all under this legislation, which has been submitted to us by the Imperial Parliament. The documents which have been furnished to us deal mainly with matters of dominion concern alone. The States are vanishing quantities, so far as Imperial conferences are concerned, the reason being that there are now no State representatives at those conferences. At one time only State representatives attended them, or their equivalent; but, when federation took shape, only representatives of the dominions travelled to the Mother Country to decide questions, not of State importance, but of dominion importance. That is borne out by the view expressed by the Solicitor-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Garran, for whose opinion I have the greatest respect. This legislation contains only two paragraphs, which deal with the affairs of the States. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> was speaking, I interjected that the reason why the States did not get any consideration was that they did not have dominion status. Paragraph 3 of this statute lays it down that the Imperial Parliament may pass legislation affecting the dominions only at the invitation and with the consent of those dominions. There is no reference to the affairs of the States as. if, indeed, their duties and responsibilities had no imperial concern whatever. In consequence of that serious omission, an amendment by way of an afterthought on the part of this Government has been included in this proposed legislation, to ensure to the States an approach to the Imperial Parliament and the retention of that nexus which the federation almost destroyed. There should be no question about that. The States are rapidly becoming political nonentities, so far as the Imperial Parliament is concerned. The reason why they are not consulted is that they are not represented at those conferences, and the representatives there grow forgetful of the concerns of others. This is a positive proposal that any legislation affecting the dominions can be passed by the Imperial Parliament only at the request <inline font-style="italic">and</inline> with the consent of the dominions. It is time that we culled a halt in this matter. It is time that the Imperial Conference should be told that this Commonwealth is comprised of six States, that they were the originators of this Commonwealth*; in fact, the matrix of this federal structure. The States control 90 per cent. of our civic activities, whereas the Commonwealth controls only 10 per cent. When attention was drawn to the position of the States under this proposal, the Government, by way of an aside, introduced an amendment. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> has suggested, we arc not yet certain whether this procedure is proper or likely to be effective. The States ca 11 rely only upon this amendment for their security and well-being in a political, social and industrial sense in so far as Imperial aid or co-operation is concerned. Those of us who hold that the federal structure needs to be maintained, and not brought to rack and ruin, who believe that it is the best form of political government, need to be up and doing to ensure that the States are given a fair deal. They are being thrust into the background and put down the cellar out of sight, because the only political institutions that are to be of any importance under this proposed legislation are the dominions. They are to get first call upon the attention of the Imperial Parliament, and the representation at the Imperial Conference. The States are to be nowhere, and would not bc anywhere but for those members of the Senate who have taken up the cudgels on their behalf. This Government would not lift a finger to safeguard the States, because it is its avowed policy to destroy them. " Let Carthage be destroyed " they say. </para>

              <para>- The Senate is trying to represent the States. The State Governments and Parliaments have more to do with the welfare of our citizens than has the Commonwealth Parliament. They have provided railways, water works, education, justice, and a list of other requirements. They regulate land, mining, education, justice, and so on. Yet under this legislation they are to come in for fag-end attention at the hands of the Imperial Parliament. The time will come when those associated with State interests will rise and -compel us to safeguard the States, without which this Senate would not be in existence. The people will ask us why we have allowed the Commonwealth to usurp the powers of the States. The last measure passed by the Senate is a further example of the encroachment of the Commonwealth on the preserves of the. States. The States are being gradually shorn of their powers. The Premier of Queensland has said that this proposal means the aggrandizement of the Commonwealth at the expense of the States. We cannot continue to do that. If we wish to preserve a fair balance of power as between the States and the central authority we must be up and doing, and ensure that the States, in addition to the Commonwealth, get a fair deal. I am inclined to vote against this proposal. At this stage I wish only to direct attention to the constant pull toward centralization, towards increasing federal powers, and the lessening and belittling of the powers of the States, which have done so much in the past to pioneer this country. For instance, Western A'ustralia carried out that wonderful scheme for carrying water nearly 400 miles inland. Queensland, New South Wales, and the other States, have also carried out stupendous works. It is time that we held the scales of justice fairly as between the States and the central authority. In the past some people in the United States of America used every effort to increase the powers of the central  authority at the expense of the States, but experience taught them a bitter lesson. A battle royal was fought, and won, and now the approved policy of those countries is to have a fair division of powers as between the States and the central authority. We, in Australia, should give the States the authority to which the Constitution fully entitles them. Any institution whose authority is continually being enlarged must, in the end, become despotic. A man who has been reared in a humble environment is usually a good fellow, but once given authority, power and opulence, he becomes a totally different being. So it is with governments and parliaments. This Parliament has become drunk with power, forgetful altogether of the interests of the State Parliaments. It is, therefore, our duty to ensure that our constitutional powers are properly maintained and divided fairly as between the central authority and the States. These amateurs would destroy what they could not create. </para>

          <para>Imagine the countries of Europe governed by one central authority situated, say, in London or Paris! One of the lessons of the late war was that divided authority was beneficial, and, after the war, the political map of Europe was altered out of all semblance to its former political self. But here, in Australia, the weaker elements are suffering because of the aggrandizement of the central power, and a corresponding lessening of State powers. It is time this Senate declared itself as the champion of the rights of the States. I hope that I have awakened my fellow senators to the necessity to make it clear that, while the central authority should retain all the powers that constitutionally belong to it; we should not allow .it to filch any further powers from the States. Otherwise the States will be hampered in their work of developing this huge and but partially reclaimed continent. They will be unable to discharge their functions efficiently, if their financial strength is crippled or sapped. I hope that the Government will take this lesson to heart. I realize that I may be pouring water on a duck's back; but if any further encroachment is made upon the preserves of the States, as political entities, the time will come when the people will be "divided on this issue, and those who are not in favour of upholding the Constitution will bc relegated to that political oblivion from which they should never have emerged. </para>

          <para>.- In view of the results of the British election, and the policy upon which the National Government of Great Britain has been elected, I anticipate that an Imperial Conference will be held in London at a very early date. It is generally admitted that the policy of that Government is one of closer Empire trade, and that there is a general desire for the rehabilitation of the Empire. I desire an assurance from the Government that when the time comes for representatives of Australia to attend the Imperial Conference, a course will be adopted similar to that followed when the plan for the rehabilitation of the finances of the Commonwealth was formulated. On that occasion, representatives of all parties in this Parliament and in the State Parliaments were called into conference. The plan then devised is playing its part in the rehabilitation of the Empire. It was drawn up as the result of the joint efforts of all sections of political thought in this country, and if the present Government is still in power - as it will be if the conference is held prior to the next federal election - I hope that it will see that every political party in this Parliament is adequately represented at the conference, in order that the views of Australia may bc placed properly before the British Government. </para>

        <para>I draw attention to the position of Queensland owing to the proposed cancellation of the Â£34,000,000 migration agreement with the British Government. When that agreement was made, an undertaking was given by all the State governments that they would absorb a certain number of migrants each year, and, in return,  they were to receive certain benefits in the form of loans of money at a low rate of interest for the purpose of developmental works. I am given to understand that Queensland has absorbed its full quota of migrants under this scheme, and, consequently, if the scheme is definitely cancelled - I understand that a decision has not yet been reached in the matter - money that the Queensland Government understood was to be made available for the purpose of such developmental works as ring-barking of timber will not be made accessible. I desire an assurance that before the agreement is cancelled, the undertaking given to the Government of Queensland will be honoured. </para>

          <para>. - Since I understand that there is a prospect of the migration agreement being abandoned. I should like an assurance from the Government that the interests of Fairbridge Farm School in Western Australia will be safeguarded. You, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> know a good deal about that institution, and can bear me out when I say that it has done excellent work in the bringing of migrants to Australia. In having introduced child migrants, it has adopted the only logical method. Boys and girls from the Old Country have been trained on a wellappointed farm for life on the land, and having nothing to unlearn, they will be  in  a much better position to' carry on farming operations in this country than those adults who were brought out at an earlier period, and at much greater expense. The Commonwealth Government has been good enough in the past to grant a small subsidy to this school, and the money has been greatly appreciated. Has any representation been made to the Western Australian authorities in regard to this matter? I shall be pleased to have an assurance that the subsidy to the school will be continued. </para>

          <para>. - I have received several requests from South Australia concerning the latest decision in regard to the fixing of the basic wage according to the cost of living index figures. Whether this is part of the Premiers' plan or not, the fact remains that the workers throughout Australia have had a succession of serious cuts in their wages. Although they realize that the basic wage should rise and fall automatically, in accordance with the cost of living as ascertained by the Commonwealth Statistician, there is a widespread feeling, not only throughout South Australia, but, I am informed, in the other States, also, that the system now in operation in arriving' at the index figures is not quite satisfactory. While the workers have confidence in the method adopted, there is a growing lack of confidence in the figures produced from time to time, and particularly recently. From Canberra, during the past two or three days, the figures have been circulated, and I notice that iu my native town, Kadina, the basic wage would be fixed, if that town were isolated, at Â£2 16s. per week. The workers there contend that they do not enjoy the reduction in the cost of living which the index figures indicate. From other portions of South Australia, I have received a similar complaint, and it is suggested that the Government should seriously consider the holding of an inquiry into the method now adopted in ascertaining the cost of living. I do not suggest that there is anything wrong in that method, but it is hard to convince some workers that the cost of living has fallen 4s. a week during the last quarter. They say that they do not experience such a reduction in regard to their household accounts. To restore confidence in the method adopted, the Government, I think, would be welladvised, and would be doing justice to the organized workers of the Commonwealth, if they made inquiries into the matter. As part of the rehabilitation scheme, serious slashes have been made into the workers' wages, and after the cost of living has been ascertained by the Statistician from reports supplied by various firms and organizations throughout the Commonwealth, there is another cut as the result of an appeal to the Arbitration Court. In South Australia we have the deplorable position that the percentage of unemployed is higher than in any other part of the Commonwealth, while that State has the lowest basic wage and the highest taxation of any part of Australia. If it can be shown that the figures are properly ascertained, I am sure the great majority of the workers will honorably abide by them. If there are grounds for believing that the formula is not accurate, or. that it is capable of improvement, an alteration should be made, in the interests of the community. Contrary to the anticipations of, experts, unemployment is increasing as wages are falling. If we can restore the confidence of the organized workers in the formula in accordance with which periodical cuts are made in their wages- </para>

            <para>- Any rise in their wages always followed a rise in the cost of living, but it was very difficult for wages to keep step with the rise. The workers now object to having to accept  a  reduction of wages before the cost of living has fallen. Tt is desirable that we should, have a contented community. We cannot have a contented community unless the workers are convinced that the basis on which their wages are reduced is fair. If the formula is sound, any reduction of wages made in accordance with it will leave them no worse off than formerly; but unless they are convinced that the formula is sound, dissatisfaction must exist. I hope that the Government will give this matter its earnest consideration. </para>

          <para>. -  In reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> I have to state that negotiations are proceeding between the Commonwealth Government, the State Governments, and the British Government for the cancellation of the Â£34,000,000 agreement. Under that agreement the Commonwealth could do no more than raise certain sums of money; the settling of migrants was the concern of the States," which, under the agreement, were relieved of certain interest payments. The claim of Queensland  for  assistance in connexion with ring-barking was accepted by the Commonwealth Government, and forwarded to the British authorities; but the loan market  at  that time had its door closed against Australia, and unfortunately, the Government does not hold strong hopes of being able to get IIi 0 money in the  near  future. </para>

        <para class="block">Should the agreement be . cancelled, I am afraid that Queensland will suffer, notwithstanding that that State-, carried out its obligations under the&lt; agreement. The honorable senator's, remarks will be forwarded to the representative in Australia of the British Government. If it is possible to include the Queensland ring-barking scheme among the uncompleted schemes for which money is to be made available, I can assure the honorable senator that the Government will be a- powerful advocate in that direction. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carroll</inline>referred to the Fairbridge farm. Having visited that school, I can say that I know of no institution which is more worthy of national support. On behalf of the Prime Minister, I have forwarded tq the Premier of "Western Australia a letter in which it is stated that Parliament has appropriated a sufficient sum to enable it to continue the subsidy to the farm for a further twelve months, provided the State Government pays its quota. </para>
        <para>As to the cost of living, and its relation to the basic wage, I desire to inform <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kneebone</inline> that this matter has already engaged the attention of the Minister for Home Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blakeley).</inline> The honorable senator mentioned Kadina. That town has to come in under the arrangement which provides for the' average of five towns being taken. I have always felt that some better scheme of assessing the rise and fall of the purchasing power of money should be instituted, but the difficulty is to find the correct formula. The Minister for Home Affairs is now in consultation with the Statistician's Department with a view to evolving a formula which will give greater satisfaction to both employers and employees. While it is true that, when prices were rising employees benefited in some districts, the opposite is true now that prices are falling. My experience is that the cost of living figures do not accurately reflect the rise or fall in the cost of living. </para>
