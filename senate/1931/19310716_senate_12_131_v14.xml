These functions are exercisable by magistrates only.

Justices of the Peace of any State in the Territory, or elsewhere, may accept declarations under the Commonwealth Statutory Declarations Act 1911-1922. </para>

                <para>The purpose of the bill is to provide a sum of £10,000,000 from the consolidated revenue fund for the payment of invalid and old-age pensions. Similar appropriations are made from time to time and transfers are made under the authority of the Appropriation Act to the trust account from which pensions are paid. From the inception of the payment of invalid and old-age pensions in 1909 to the 30th June last, the amount expended for this purpose  was  £120,798,000. The amount now asked for, together with the balance of appropriation at 30th June, will suffice approximately for the requirements of the present financial year. The bill has no bearing on the rates of pension payable, or on the provisions of the Financial Emergency Bill now before Parliament, being merely an appropriation of revenue to cover payments of pensions at authorized rates. </para>

                        <para>. - While we all admit the necessity for this bill, I wish to impress upon the Government the need to tighten up the conditions under which pensions are granted. Yesterday we were faced with the unpleasant duty of voting for a measure which had for one of its objects the reduction of pensions that are legitimately payable. The financial position of the Commonwealth suggests the need for the strictest care being exercised to prevent fraud. Recently there appeared in the Sydney press a report of a court case in which a woman was charged with bigamy. The evidence disclosed that the accused had gone through the ceremony of marriage with three different men; that all three were living; that she had an order of the court against the second man for the maintenance of herself and child; that at about the time when she married her third " husband " she sued the second man and had him put in gaol for arrears, of maintenance; that she had an order against a bachelor in New South Wales for the maintenance of two pledges of affection that she had given him, and that, during the whole of this time, she had been in receipt of an invalid pension. I may add that she was sentenced to twelve months imprisonment, and, I understand, that after the trial the three " husbands " met outside the court and held a consultation with regard to the action of the law in depriving them of a property in which, so to speak, they had a joint and several interest. I bring this matter under the notice of the Minister because, no doubt, other cases of fraud are being perpetrated in all the States to the detriment of those who are legitimately entitled to pensions. I hope that the Leader of the Senate will bring under the notice of Cabinet the urgent need for tightening up the regulations, and impressing upon any Commonwealth officials who permit frauds to be committed at the public expense,  a  stricter sense of their duty. </para>

                <para class="block">Prior to the introduction of the system of adjusting salaries annually according to the rise or fall in the cost of living,  no differentiation was made between males and females in the matter of salaries. In 1924 the first general salary adjustment was made following a rise in the cost of living, when adult male officers were granted an additional £9 per annum, and adult female officers an additional £7 per annum. Two subsequent increases of £6 each in the case of male officers, and £4 each in the case of female officers have been granted. It will, therefore, be seen that male officers have received increases amounting to £21, and female officers increases amounting to £15 because of the rise in the cost of living. If the clause stands as printed, and £34 is deducted from the salary of each adult male officer, and £22 10s. from the salary of each adult female officer, an anomaly will be created. In order to overcome that anomaly, and to retain the previously existing relative position of officers, it is proposed that the reductions in the case of male officers shall remain at £34, but that the deduction shall be £28. instead of £22 10s., in the case of female officers. The amendment gives effect to that intention. </para>

I think that members of both branches of the legislature will soon find that that is the case. If Ave give a Minister authority to interfere with wages he will have the power to reduce them below £182 per annum. Under this provision we are placing too much power in the hands of the Minister, who can reject a recommendation of the committee, and use the axe in a drastic manner. Arbitration is the established policy of the Commonwealth, yet we are, by this provision, destroying the principle of arbitration.

If we proceed along these lines, I do not know who will be the winner, and who the loser in the end.1 An unjust method is being adopted of dealing with employees, whether they be inside or outside the Government Service. If we abolish all conciliatory and arbitral methods, and say that he who pays the piper shall call the tune, we shall revert to direct action. I do not believe that in these enlightened days any honorable senator will contend that direct action is preferable to conciliation and arbitration.

If honorable senators will turn to clause 13 they will see that it provides for the setting up of an arbitral, body, consisting of a member of the Commonwealth Public Service Board, a representative of the Public Service Arbitrator, and a person appointed by the Governor-General. I understand that the Governor-General in Council will be empowered to appoint a representative of the particular class or division concerned. Those are the lines on which many conciliation committees in New South Wales are already constituted. The Minister will not be able to act except upon a recommendation of that committee.

                        <para>- That is a different matter. What right has any Minister directly to reduce wages as he thinks fit? If we proceed along these lines we shall absolutely destroy the principle of arbitration. The Labour party won the last elections on the cry that the rise and fall in wages should be controlled by a properly constituted tribunal. Now, however, it proposes what is absolutely contrary to the very principle of arbitration. I cannot understand men whose whole lives have been passed in the industrial mill supporting anything of this nature. </para>

In the first place, a committee will be appointed whose duty it will be to make recommendations in regard to reductions. Under an amendment to be proposed by the Minister, protection will be afforded to those who are likely to be reduced below the minimum wage of  £182  a year. That refers to casual workers, about whom our friends are so keenly concerned. Where there is a danger of any reduction bringing the wage below  £182  a year, the question will be referred to the Minister for his consideration. </para>

                    <para>. -  The Minister's explanation is not satisfactory. The clause clearly indicates that the committee to be appointed will have no power to do other than recommend further reductions. It will not be empowered to recommend increases. In short, this is a one-way provision. Although expensive machinery has been set up for the settlement of all such matters by means of arbitration, the clause gives unlimited arbitrary power to the Minister to effect reductions, and the employees affected are to be deprived of any means of obtaining redress. </para>

My view is that it will do nothing of the kind. It relates solely to a committee which has no relation whatever to the Federal Arbitration Court. One can understand <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dooley</inline> saying that no Minister would deprive a public servant of anything to which he was rightly entitled, but the present Government may not always occupy the treasury benches.

I suppose his remarks would apply, also, to those who support the amendment. Only a few months ago a certain section of employees in the Postal Departs ment did not see eye to eye with the State executive of the Labour party of New South Wales with regard to the Lang plan, and trouble arose over a letter sent by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> asking that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McPherson,</inline> the organizing secretary, should be released for three months to undertake organizing work. It would be only right that this big body of men, 80 per cent, of whom receive little '.more than the basic wage, should be given representation on the committee. </para>

                    <para>. -  I do not know the reason for this storm in a teacup. The clause provides that the committee shall consist of a member of the Commonwealth Public Service Board of Commissioners, the Public Service Arbitrator, and a person appointed by the Governor-General. The provision that the Governor-General may. appoint a member of the committee is the usual provision made in many acts of Parliament. Hitherto, no complaint has been made that he should have that power. If the present Government were in office when the appointment was about to be made, it would, no doubt, ask the Governor-General to appoint a person representative of a large section of the people. </para>

The other two persons proposed to be appointed will represent the general, public rather than the employees, as such.

Their duty is to conserve the interests of the public against any special demands made by the employees. In a democratic country the employees on the lower salaries should have some one on the committee to give expression to their views. If that were done the committee would be much more complete than otherwise. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes,</inline> in accepting as sufficient the practice which has been followed almost from the time of Noah, shows that he is a hopeless reactionary. In the old days employees were looked upon as necessary evils; it was then out of the question for them to ask to be given direct representation on any body which controlled them in any way. Although the clause provides for the appointment being made by the Governor-General, we all know that, in practice, that means the Government of the day. </para>

                        <para>- I can trust the present Government to do anything foolish or reactionary. It has shown an inclination to vie with honorable senators opposite in doing that which is reactionary. I would trust it no further than that. Any honorable senator who believes in democracy must vote for the amendment, otherwise the employees will be- debarred from representation on the committee at all. Honorable senators opposite express concern for the interests of the general public insofar as those interests differ from the interests of the employees; but I maintain that those interests will be amply protected by the other appointments. I should be satisfied if the clause read " a person representative of the employees appointed by the Governor-General". I am prepared to allow the Governor-General to make the appointment. As I have said, only those who are wedded to reaction will vote against the amendment. </para>

                    <para>. -  I have been charged with being a reactionary. I point out that probably 50 or 60 organizations will be affected by this measure. If the Government desired to appoint some one to represent those organizations, it would find some difficulty in doing so. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> says that the Public Service Board of Commissioners is the buffer between the public servants and the State. I remind him that it is proposed to appoint also the Public Service Arbitrator - a man of high standing in the Public Service. The third member of the committee will, if the clause is passed in its present form, be appointed by the Governor-General, which, as the honorable senator states, means the government of the day. The present Government knows of several men of outstanding ability connected with the Labour movement, who would be well qualified to fill the third position. If the appointment were made by the present Government, one of those men would, in all probability, be elected. On the other hand, if a government representing the Opposition were in power, the position would probably be reversed. I submit that the clause in its present form adequately meets the situation. </para>

                <para class="block">That is superannuated Commonwealth public servants -  are receiving very small amounts, and it is probable that many of them will never regain the amount contributed by them, moreover in many cases their small superannuation allowance is their only income. To deduct from this amount would be reducing the standard of living, of which wo hear so much about, to a very low level. Would you please use your best endeavours to have clause 20 of the bill amended so that no deduction should be made below an amount of £156 per annum. </para>
                <para class="block">That letter reached me by mail only this morning. We have admitted in previous clauses of this bill the principle that none of these reductions shall bring any salary below a certain amount. A great injustice or hardship may be imposed on some persons who are in receipt of pensions under the Superannuation Act. We are taking a serious step that can he justified only on the ground that an effort is being made to spread the burden equitably over the whole community. These payments have been made in pursuance of an act of Parliament. That contract is being broken because this country is faced with a crisis in its financial affairs. I do not know how much is involved, and have not had an opportunity to make inquiries or to obtain information ; therefore, I do not propose to move an amendment. But, I suggest that the Minister ascertain the amount that would be involved in the prescription of an amount below which the payment shall not go. I should like to have his assurance that the matter will be fully considered, and that at a later stage of the hill, if possible, effect will be given to the principle of establishing a minimum below which reductions shall not be made. Otherwise, we may deal inequitably with this particular class of person. </para>

                    <para>. - I have had this matter under consideration only this morning, upon the receipt of a letter somewhat similar to that which has been read by the honorable senator. Although, at first sight, the position may appear to be as stated by the honorable senator, I believe that a closer examination will show that there is very little justification for holding that view:For example, in the case of an officer who transferred from the State to the Commonwealth Service, and whose pension amounts to £4 a week, half of the pension is paid by the State and half by the Commonwealth. Seeing that provision has been made for the reduction of the old-age pension by 2s. 6d. a week, we cannot be accused of acting harshly if we take 4s. from a person who is receiving £2 a week from the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>. - I am opposed to this and the two succeeding clauses, which propose to place the maternity allowance on an entirely different basis from what it has been on hitherto. The principle that they seek to establish is that any person whose income exceeds a certain amount shall not be entitled to the allowance. I was a member of the Senate when the Maternity Allowance Act was enacted by the Fisher Labour Government. The strong point then made was that this allowance was not to be considered as a dole for paupers who otherwise would have no possibility of receiving proper medical attention, but as a recognition of the importance of motherhood ; and that, therefore, it should be granted in the case of every birth, irrespective of the financial position of the parents. It would have been a good thing had old-age pensions been based on a similar principle. It appears to me that a great deal of what will be saved by these proposals will be swallowed up in the extra cost of administration. Where a limit is prescribed it must necessarily lead to investigation, inquisitorial methods, and policing. The cost of administration must, therefore, enormously increase. In my opinion, the principle upon which the allowance is based should not, be touched. A reduction by one-fifth will bring about a considerable saving, but it will not all be clear saving if we are to prescribe limitations involving inquisitorial investigations that destroy the basic principle of the act. </para>

I admit that people possessed of large means draw the  allowance.  It was intended that they should do so, because it meant preventing the allowance from having any pauper or charity aspect about it. Even if persons with large means do draw the allowance, it very often happens that what they pay in income tax returns to the State very much more than is drawn from it in this way. </para>

                        <para>- Not necessarily. To prescribe that the possession of a certain income should render a person ineligible to draw the maternity allowance would necessarily mean an arbitrary line of demarcation which, in many cases, might inflict an injustice on persons with heavy commitments. In any case, the machinery necessary to administer the act is likely to be tremendously augmented by preventing persons whose incomes are above a certain mark from applying for the maternity allowance. In my opinion all mothers in Australia, without distinction, should be entitled to claim the allowance. Consequently I oppose the clause. </para>

It indicates, I think, a possibility of effecting a considerable saving. Two persons, who, I am informed, were born in Australia decided to leave this country and live in New Zealand. They resided in New Zealand continuously for 20 years, and then returned to Australia. Being over 65 years of age they applied for old-age pensions, and last year obtained them.

I am not aware of any reciprocity with New Zealand that covers the point. If the Minister will have inquiries made in the Pensions Department as to cases in Tasmania during last year, he will find that what I have mentioned has occurred.

If the facts are as I have stated, it is possible that some persons are in receipt of pensions, although they had resided outside Australia continuously for twenty years.

For many years, they took an active part in the Labour conventions at which the party's policy was framed. Consequently, they had some share in the enactment of the legislation under which invalid and old-age pensions have been paid for so many years. I very much regret that the Government has seen fit to bring down amendments to reduce the pensions payable to our infirm and aged people, especially in view of the fact that the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Barnes)</inline> is general  president,  and his colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dooley,</inline> is  president  of the railways section of the Australian Workers Union, which organization has sent many eminent men to the Parliaments of this country. Both honorable gentlemen are, no doubt, aware that a considerable number of pioneers in the Labour movement are now, in the evening of their lives, inmates of the home for aged people at Lidcombe and the Salvation Array home at Collaroy. Although those old people may not have had their names inscribed on a roll of honour, they have all done their duty and played their part in the development of this country. I hope, therefore, that the Minister will not oppose the amendment. </para>

All honorable senators know that any contribution which the individual can make will not meet the national emergency. I am quite prepared to accept any reduction of my allowance, even down to the basic wage, rather than inflict hardship upon our invalid and old-age pensioners. It has been asserted, but it is a specious, as well as an unworthy argument, that the decline in the cost of living will compensate pensioners for the reduction which it is proposed to make in their pensions. We have no right to assume that the official statistics, relating to the fall in the cost of living, apply in reality to the consumers in Australia, because those figures are based on wholesale rates which are not always reflected in the retail charges. </para>

                        <para>- I affirm, without any fear of disproof, that numberless articles of consumption are not substantially reduced in price, and that prices for other commodities, such as potatoes, eggs, butter, vegetables, fluctuate so enormously that it is impossible to apply to their cost any rule of thumb method. Whatever decline has taken place in the cost of living is spread over a big list of commodities, the greater number of which are quite beyond the reach of invalid or old-age pensioners, so that actually they do not, to any extent, benefit by this alleged fall in the cost of living. The reasons advanced in support of the Government's proposals are in the nature of " after-the-event " arguments to justify its action. "What is given to the people by the Government with one hand, is taken from them with the other. That, at all events, applies to our pensioners, and I contend that we have every right, and without being accused of indulging in sob-stuff, to denounce what I consider is an infamy in reducing our social services in order to save our own pockets. No reduction should be made in any of these services, which affect so closely the lives of our invalid and old-age pensioners, until the last possible shilling has been wrung from those who are able to bear the burden. </para>

I shall express myself differently, and say that the last shilling should be demanded from those who are physically fit rather than that we should take anything from those who arc helpless. These persons are old; their days are numbered; they have lost their punch; they cannot organize for their own protection; they are entirely at the mercy of the governing powers of the country. This infamous action will redound to our eternal disgrace. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline> spoke of the services rendered to the workers of Australia by the Australian Workers Union - that body which honorable senators opposite now love so much, because, having ceased to be a fighting organization, it now plays into their hands - but I know that  90  per cent, of the members of that union will look with scorn and contempt on their officers who have been parties to this swindling of the old people of this country. </para>

                <para>There is still a chance for Labour to regain some of its lost prestige. The Government should say to those who are responsible for the plan agreed to by the Premiers - the professors of economics and the bankers - that it finds itself unable to agree to a reduction of old-age pensions. Were the Government to do that, its members would be able to walk down the streets of our cities and look the old-age pensioners in the face instead of wanting to hide from them by looking into shop windows or turning the first corner. Many of the old-age pensioners have done much to build up the forces of unionism in Australia, and to make Australia what it is to-day. No Labour Government should have reduced pensions below  £1  a week. Surely that is little enough. Even now, the Government should say that it recognizes what the old-age pensioners have done for Australia ; that it acted wrongly in proposing  to reduce their pensions; and that it intends to retain the pension at £1 a week. By so doing, it would prove itself to be true to Labour principles. I assure honorable senators that it hurts me to say these things, but, in my opinion, it is unpardonable that the representatives of Labour should say that, because the country is suffering from a depression, it intends to take 2s. 6d. a week from the old-age pensioners. The Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Dooley)</inline> seeks to justify a reduction by saying that the cost of living has been reduced. </para>

                        <para>- I realize what this reduction will mean to many  deserving  people. Whether Australia is prosperous or otherwise, I shall never vote to reduce old-age pensions. . Not only should a Labour Government not have introduced such a proposal; it should not have tolerated it. I can imagine the howl which would have been raised by our party had the Opposition introduced legislation to reduce pensions. It is astonishing that so few are found opposing these proposals. </para>

                        <para>- As I have said, the platform of the Labour party provides for the old-age pension being increased. Honorable senators have urged that the reduction of the pension to 17s. 6d. a week will mean no loss to the pensioners because the cost of living has fallen in proportion. In that case, Labour could have given effect to its platform by leaving the pension at £1 a week, because, with the fall in the cost of living, that would have been equal to an increase in the pension. It distresses me that men associated with the Labour party should be prepared to do these things. I hope that never again will a Labour Government be guilty of reducing invalid and old-age pensions. </para>

                        <para>- I shall not have much difficulty in doing that to your entire satisfaction. These four gentlemen who stand as the only genuine fount of human compassion in this chamber - there are only four of them, and I suppose we, on this side, are the 32 steel-hearted members - should realize that, after all, we have our own ideals' and human impulses just as they have. We have wandered about the world, have assisted the poor perhaps to a greater extent than they, and have done so without proclaiming it to the world. Some of us have done as much in a single afternoon perhaps for the cause of humanity and charity as they have done in their whole lives. The " big four " opposite pitt themselves forward as the only advocates, defenders and champions of the poor, down-trodden, and afflicted in this country. They are four extraordinary men, and it is pleasing to think that they are the only members of this chamber to condemn those " brutal tyrants " who, in adopting the plan, are treading the course which this Parliament has before it. Why is it so? These four big posturers are only endeavouring to score off their mates in this Parliament. These are the men who went to the caucus-room, and are now employing the tactics of the three-card trick man. The vote went against them, and they are now " scabbing " on their comrades.. They have not an ounce of compassion in their ungrateful bodies. The decision went against them, but they are now endeavouring to appear in a favorable light before the electors to win votes. </para>

Is that in accordance with the principle of fair play? Are you, sir, to allow certain honorable senators on this side of the chamber to be referred to as swindlers and robbers? Are we to be castigated in that way, and not to have the right to ask them to justify such extravagant and outrageous statements? Words of that kind may be used on the Yarra Bank in Melbourne, the Domain in Sydney, or the Botanic Park in Adelaide, but they cannot be used by these honorable senators when face to face with men who have had to fight the grim battles of life, and have maintained an honorable reputation. Do these four honorable senators opposite,  who want to curry favour with the electors, suggest that they are the only ones in this chamber with kind hearts in their bosoms ? </para>

                        <para>- I have supported increases in the invalid and old-age pensions time and again. Every one will admit that this is one of the most unpleasant tasks that we have had to face. The fact that it is unpleasant is proved by our past actions in increasing pensions. That we have assisted in increasing pensions should show that our hearts are not in this job. Owing to the circumstances now confronting us, nothing else can be done. If a Commonwealth government had for its membership samples like these four men - these four impossibles - the pensioners would not have to submit merely to a reduction in their pensions; they would not be getting even bread and water. </para>

                        <para>- I have already said that, if they object to being called "men" I withdraw and apologize. I ask honorable senators opposite <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> contrast the position of an old-age pensioner with that of the person whose case I cited the other night, who has invested £1,900 in government stock, and, at present, is receiving 43s. a week in interest. Under the Commonwealth Debts Conversion Bill, which the Senate passed yesterday, this bondholder will be compelled to forfeit about l1s. weekly, thus reducing his income to£l 12s. a week. Presumably, that is all this man and his wife have to live upon. He has said so. He . is not entitled to receive the old-age pension. On the other hand an old-age pensioner and his wife, even under the reduced rate, will receive 35s. a week, as against the thrifty person, who is to get only 32s. a week. Is he <inline font-style="italic">not</inline> worthy of the same sympathy and some consideration?  His  income, on which he, possibly, has to support a wife, is reduced below that of an old-age pensioner and his wife, and yet this is the man that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> wants to reduce still further. No plea is put forward on his account, because he is a bondholder, whose vote is not of much consequence to those who are opposing reduced pensions. Honorable senators opposite seem to disregard these people in our midst, who, by hard work and frugality, have saved money to lend to the Government, and so have enabled public works, which provide employment for men, to be undertaken. As one who, on four separate occasions, supported an increase in the old-age pension rates when some honorable senators opposite had not been heard of, I am justified in telling them that, unless they can submit better arguments than they have, they should hold their peace. They use violent language concerning men whose boots they arc not fit To blacken. I repeat what I said on a previous occasion, that the time has arrived to hurl back these false charges into the teeth of these scoundrels- </para>

                        <para>- What I said was that so long as physically fit persons had any income at all it would be wrong to attack old-age pensions. For very many years, so I have been told, there have been no snakes in Ireland. I can well understand the reason. The concentrated venom of all the snakes in the rest of the world could not exceed in its virulence that which is exhibited by the honorable senator in his speeches. Those who have left the Labour party are not satisfied unless they are continually blaming those who have remained true to their pledges. I know nothing about any caucus decision on this matter. I have not been  a  member of the Parliamentary Labour caucus for some months; but I am adhering to the Labour platform when I take the stand that in no circumstances shall a reduction of old-age pensions be sanctioned. On the contrary, every effort should be made to raise them. On that point - </para>

                <para>It is useless for honorable senators to state over and over again that they take this action reluctantly, when they will not give any consideration to counter measures of a practical nature such as I and my associates have proposed on more than one occasion. We have demonstrated that there are various ways in which the amount needed could be obtained without touching old-age pensions. It is not right that such a retrograde method as this should be adopted. I am not concerned with who has been responsible for raising the old-age pension from .time to time. It is well known to every honorable senator that the party which actually passes legislation is not in every case the party that has advocated it. Time after time in Great Britain democratic reform legislation, for which the Liberal party had fought for years, has been enacted by the Conservative party. I would never attempt to judge the character of a party by the legislation for which nominally it has been responsible, unless it could prove to have been the originators of it. For some years the old-age pension in Australia has been £1 a week. </para>

Our cost of living, unfortunately, is still higher than it was 20, 30 or 40 years ago; consequently £1 a week can be regarded only as a miserable pittance. So long as there is any possibility of obtaining the revenue required from any other source, those who insist upon making this reduction deserve all that I have said of them. </para>

Their case is rather unusual. They have been receiving a weekly allowance of 7s. 6d. That arrangement was made under a regulation, because it was not thought desirable to amend the act for the purpose, but the partially blinded soldiers feel that something should be embodied in this bill to establish clearly that they are entitled to this allowance, because at any time the regulation under which it is now paid may be cancelled. </para>

As a trustee for the Partially Blinded Soldiers Association of Australia, I am In a position to know that the partially blinded soldiers have the utmost difficulty in securing employment. On account of their disability, they are debarred from working on railways or tramways or in lifts, and, because their partial blindness is almost invariably accompanied by some facial disfigurement, it is difficult for them to obtain positions as salesmen. Some years ago, by regulation, an allowance of 7s. 6d. a week was paid to them, and I ask now if that allowance is to be retained, or if the Government proposes to do away with it. I hope that it will not. </para>

                    <para>.- Sub-clause 3, now proposed to be deleted, provides that the commission may cancel any pension payable to any person whose pension is reduced in accordance with the provisions of sub-clause 1. Sub-clause 1 covers a number of classes of pensioners, but not soldiers. The amendment provides that the Governor-General may take such action as is necessary to give effect to any recommendation made by the committee to be constituted under clause 41 in relation to the cancellation or reduction  of  pensions payable under the principal act to any class of persons whose pensions are reduced in accordance with the provisions of sub-clause 1 of this clause. It will be noted that the amendment makes provision for the " cancellation or reduction " of pensions, whereas sub-clause 3 provides only for the " cancellation " of pensions. I quite agree with the sentiments expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan,</inline> but partially blinded soldiers are among a class of pensioners who are not affected by this clause. </para>

An attempt to insert a safeguarding provision in this bill would involve the insertion of other safeguarding provisions in relation to all other allowances made by regulation.

                    <para>. -  While I appreciate all that  has  been done by the soldiers' committee in connexion with war pensions, I wish to have it on record that, in the absence of a ballot of the rank and file of all the organizations, I cannot support these proposed reductions. I am informed that the soldiers' committee took upon itself the full responsibility of forwarding recommendations to the Prime Minister. It would have been much more acceptable if, before submitting its alternative proposals, the committee had sought an expression of opinion of the members of the various organizations. </para>

Therefore, it had no mandate from the membership to either accept the Government's proposals or submit other recommendations. In my opinion, it should have absolutely opposed any reduction of soldiers' pensions. If it. had done that  it would  have had the country behind it. </para>

                    <para>. -  The statements made by honorable senators opposite that the provisions of this clause apply only to dependants, and, therefore, do not affect returned soldiers, is neither more nor less than a quibble. Surely it is patent to all that if pensions payable to members of a returned soldiers' family are reduced the whole of the family income is affected to the extent of that reduction? In the great majority of cases the family income is pooled, so the total income must be less if these reductions are made, and the returned soldier himself, or some member of his family, must suffer. If, because of his serious illness, the ex-soldier requires special attention, the rest of the family will be compelled to go short of comforts which otherwise they would enjoy. No argument submitted by honorable senators opposite can prove the contrary position. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thompson</inline> asked what mandate we had received. If any mandate is necessary, we have it in the promises that were made to the soldiers when they went to the war. They were then told that if they enlisted they would on their return be treated like heroes, and never want, and that should they not come back their dependants would be well cared for. No one will dispute that those promises were made. Yet here in this bill a blow is being </para>

                    <para>. - I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> that it is hypocrisy to say that we are not reducing the pensions of soldiers. We propose to reduce the payments to their dependants in certain circumstances; and what is that but reducing their pensions? A committee of soldiers has been considering the question of reduced pensions, and has agreed to make heroic sacrifices. I should vote for the amendment were it not that 1 feel that I must stand behind the committee representing the soldiers' organizations. I deplore the fact that the Government is forcing returned soldiers to accept a reduction of their pensions to the extent of £1,291,000 per annum. </para>

I should like to support the amendment, but if I were to do so, I should be opposing the committee which has done such splendid work. Apparently, the members of that committee have given a pledge to make further reductions ; and having done so, I know that they will carry it out. When the committee formulated details to save £1,018,000 per annum as it has already done, the Government ought to have been satisfied, instead of requiring it to devise ways and means by which a further saving of £270,000 could be made. The soldiers who were promised everything when they went away are now to be treated harshly. I was unable to accompany them to the firing line, but 1 feel keenly that they should not be called upon to make this sacrifice. Of the flower of our manhood 60,000 gave their lives in the Great War; 130 returned blind; over 800 were partially blinded; while over 1,000 lost limbs; others developed tuberculosis and other diseases. Honorable senators talk of equality of sacrifice! What sacrifice that is demanded of others can compare with the  sacrifice that these men made? Who would lose his eyesight for £4 a week, or suffer the loss of a limb, in order to receive a pension of £2 a week? </para>

Rather than require them to find this money, I would have taken it from the higher paid officials of the Commonwealth, or from honorable members like myself. The reduction of soldiers' pensions is altogether too drastic. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> is evidently under a. misapprehension. The reduction will not apply to the mothers of deceased soldiers, or to their widows or children. At a recent Federal Convention of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia, held in Canberra, Captain Dyett, the Federal  President,  presided. If I remember rightly, the outcome of the conference was that certain recommendations were made to the Government. The Prime Minister refused to accept those recommendations, claiming that the cuts were not big enough. The Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Dooley)</inline> is entitled to his opinion; but it is obvious that if the amount now spent in pensions to soldiers and their dependants is to be reduced by £1,291,000 per annum, the persons entitled to these pensions will be affected by the reduction. Otherwise, how could a saving be made? Does the Government hope to get the money by means of a fiduciary note issue, or to find it in some paddock in front of Parliament House? As money does not grow, somebody must be affected if so large a sum of money is to be saved. When the returned soldiers met in Canberra for their federal convention, the Prime Minister placed a pistol at their heads when he told them that if they were not prepared to meet the Government in the general reduction that had to be made, they would get nothing. The soldiers were forced into the position of having to accept half a loaf rather than get no bread. As a returned soldier I have a duty to perform to my injured mates, as well as to my own conscience. The proposals of the Government are wrong in principle. I desire to read the following newspaper extract:- </para>

                <para> No pension can give to a returned soldier a limb that he lost in the war. As the invalid and old-age pensions of many of the mothers and fathers of returned soldiers are to be reduced, the income of some families will be further depleted.

Special pensions in force last year of £4. 4s. were: - blinded, 129; tubercular, 1,111; permanently incapacitated, 1,355. </para></quote>
                    <para>Notwithstanding this, some honorable senators contend that returned soldiers will not suffer. As a result of the reduction in the pensions paid to dependants the returned soldiers must experience further hardships. We have also been told that the reduction will not be felt to any extent owing to the reduced cost of living. Prices of certain commodities and house rents have been reduced owing to economic circumstances; but the  unfortunate returned soldiers are not to have the benefit of cheaper houses. The paragraph further states - </para>
                    <quote><para>An analysis of other figures show 5,077 to be on the £2 2s. rate, while 55,000 were receiving from £11s. per week down to 5s. The average rate paid to all pensioners (soldiers and/or dependants) in 1921 was £1 3s.11d., while in 1930 the figures were £11s. 4½d. per fortnight. The Repatriation Commission in the last report to Parliament has this to say of 1929-30 Economic necessity has compelled many soldiers to approach the Commission for assistance.

This is adding one infamy to another. Are honorable senators so dense as to place the power provided in this clause in the hands of the committee or the Minister? The only safeguard is that regulations may be framed covering the constitution of the committee and the duration of its operations. In addition to the disabilities already imposed upon soldiers' dependants, it is now proposed to authorize the issue of regulations providing for the constitution of a committee which shall have power to inquire into the pensions payable under the principal act. Recently there was a great outcry with respect to the regulations promulgated under the Transport Workers Act, because they did not meet with the approval of some honorable senators. In spite of the alleged reluctance of some honorable senators to vote for specific reductions in pensions, they will, I suppose, support this clause under which it will be possible "to determine the extent to which pensions may be further reduced.

I appeal now to the right honorable gentleman and his colleagues to remove this power to regulate the pensions of returned soldiers. The spineless Government that at present occupies the treasury bench has allied itself with the Opposition in this attack upon returned soldiers. I feel like hiding my head with shame at having been associated with it at one time. The proudest moment in my political life was when I was expelled from its caucus. It has filled me with pride to be able to put up this fight with my colleague. The proposed regulations may provide for the constitution of a committee that will have the power to inquire into the pensions payable under the principal act to any classes of persons, and make recommendations to the Minister in regard to reductions.

In this respect the gold-mining industry is in an entirely different position from that of other industries that have received bounties from the Commonwealth on the whole of their output, and is, therefore, all the more deserving of assistance. The bounty is given only for a special effort in the way of increased production, and a mining company must agree to work the whole of its ore body that can be worked, even if it makes no profits in doing so, before it can receive the bounty.

Because of the difficult financial position of the Commonwealth, these reductions are inevitable; but they should be uniform. Why should gold-mining be subject to a reduction of 50 per cent, while other industries which are assisted by bounties escape with a cut of only 20 per cent.? It has been said, and I suppose the statement will be repeated, that the reduction in the case of the gold-mining industry is warranted because the industry gets full advantage of the adverse rate of exchange. But as other exporting industries benefit to the same extent, there is no justification whatever for this unfair discrimination against gold-mining. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir GEORGE</inline>PEARCE (Western Australia) [9.38]. - I intend to vote against the clause. I do not look upon the payment of the gold bounty simply from the point of view of Western Australia, although as a representative of that State, I recognize that the Government's proposal to reduce the bounty by 50 per cent, affects that State very seriously, because, of all the States, it is the largest gold producer. Since the depression manifested itself, there has been a tremendous revival in gold prospecting, not only in Western Australia, but also in other States. I do not suggest that this is due entirely to the promise of the bounty. It has always been our experience that, in times of depression, large numbers of people, having no other profitable employment, turn their attention to prospecting for gold. I know it is said that gold gets the advantage of the present high rate of exchange, and I can only repeat what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carroll</inline> lias already said, namely, that other exporting industries also get the benefit of the adverse exchange rate. I would, however, point out that with the exception of the wine bounty all other industries which receive financial assistance from the Government secure the bounty on products that are not exported, and as an increase in gold production would improve our financial position overseas, it is to be regretted that the Government proposes to reduce the bounty by 50 per cent. Since wine for export also gets the full benefit of the exchange rate, there is no justification for differentiating between the bounty on excess gold production and the bounty on export wine or, for that matter, the bounty paid to any other industry. For these reasons I shall vote against the clause. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>3976</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K1L</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Vice-President of the Executive Council</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">BARNES, John</name><name role="display">Senator BARNES</name></talker><para>. - I hope that the clause will pass, because if there is one product that can stand a reduction of bounty it is gold.

I trust that the committee will agree to delete this clause, and thus place the gold-mining industry, in the matter of bounties on the same basis as other industries in the eastern States receivingFederal assistance. If we cannot obtain redress here, we cannot get it anywhere. The bounties received by other industries, which are to he. reduced by 2.0 per cent. have been in operation for many years, and have cost the country a great deal of money, but the gold bounty, which has been in operation for only a few months, is to be reduced by 50 per cent. before any payment whatever has been made under it. </para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>3979</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JYB</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">DUNN, James Patrick Digger</name><name role="display">Senator DUNN</name></talker><para>. - Had <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> not moved to strike out this clause, it was the intention of Senator Rae or myself, who represent the Lang group in this chamber, to move to strike out the word " ten " in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of sub-clause 2, and to insert in lieu thereof the word " twenty".

When acting as Government Whip, prior to my expulsion from the party because I favoured the policy of the "dinkum" Australian Labour Party, it was my duty to assist Ministers and supporters , of the Government in various directions. I have a vivid recollection of a deputation, headed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. de</inline> Bernales, waiting upon the Government La connexion with the gold bounty. The honorable member for Bendigo <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Keane)</inline> also pleaded in caucus, and in another place, with the Scullin Government- I do not call it the Labour Government pay a gold bounty, and thus relieve the unemployed problem in the various States. The instructions of caucus were conveyed to the Government, which eventually decided to introduce a measure providing for the payment of a gold bounty. I have also a vivid recollection of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> sitting in this chamber until 3 o'clock in the morning to assist in the passage of that measure. I have been under the impression that the policy of repudiation alleged to have been introduced by the Premier of New South Wales <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lang)</inline> was supported only by the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley),</inline> the honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward),</inline> the honorable member for Werriwa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lazzarini),</inline> the honorable member for Martin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Eldridge), Senator Rae</inline> and myself, but during the debate on this measure, honorable senators, including the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> have been openly supporting proposals involving gross repudiation. I am not very much concerned with the position of the Wiluna Gold Mining Company, which is extending its operations, but I am anxious to assist those workers whom I have been sent here to represent. When in Queensland, in 1911 and 1912, I was a member of the Amalgamated Workers Association, and during that time was engaged in gold and copper mining. In 1913 that organization affiliated with the Australian Workers Union. There are thousands of members of that union in Queensland to-day fossicking for gold. If the gold bounty is retained at the present rate, they will receive considerable benefit. It is amazing to realize that the Minister in charge of this measure is the  president  of the Australian Workers Union, and that he is receiving the support of the Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Dooley)</inline> who is also a leading member of that organization'. If the measure had contained a provision to reduce the concession enjoyed by the sugar industry, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thompson, Senator Reid</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford,</inline> who have not shown any inclination to support the gold-mining industry, would have been very indignant. According to the Minister for Markets <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parker Moloney)</inline> 250,000 tons Of canned and dried fruits will shortly be shipped from Australia to Canada under the reciprocal trade agreement entered into between Australia and that dominion, which will be of further benefit to those engaged in that industry. This glaring act of repudiation will seriously affect Western Australia, Victoria, New South  Wales and Queensland, where many persons are engaged in fossicking for gold. Although the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin),</inline> the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Theodore)</inline> supported by some of their stool pigeons have been parading this country denouncing the Lang group, the Government of which they are the principal Ministers, is also repudiating most of its promises and the undertakings previously entered into with different sections of the community. It is difficult to understand how these Ministers can condemn the group of which I am associated for supporting a policy of so-called repudiation when the measures we have passed during the last day or two have consisted solely of acts of repudiation. </para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>3980</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KUP</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">MILLEN, John</name><name role="display">Senator MILLEN</name></talker><para>. - A measure providing for the payment of a gold bounty was introduced some time ago by this Government.

Johnston, who has moved to delete this clause. I deplore the fact that honorable senators who have spoken so strongly against repudiation are now supporting the principle. If, by defeating any clause, we can lessen the repudiation, my vote. and that of my colleague, will be cast in that way. But, apart from that, I consider that those who speak on behalf of Western Australia have made out a good case. I always believe in doing what measure of justice can be done to any section of the nation. I contend that, largely owing to circumstances over which it has had no control, Western Australia has not been able to avail herself of the bounties that have been granted to different industries. That reason operated strongly in the minds of honorable senators who are not personally interested in Western Australia, and induced them to vote for the gold bounty. It was realized that, although the other States might be assisted, the largest proportion of Australia's gold production comes from Western Australia, and that, consequently, that State would benefit immediately. Another fact that has to he considered is that gold-mining is largely what might be termed a speculative industry, and that many chance discoveries sometimes prove to be extremely valuable. The stimulus given in this way to those who are seeking for gold may lead to the disclosure of gold-fields of very great value. Even if it enabled hundreds of men in the gold-producing States to obtain a livelihood by fossicking for gold, that, in itself, would be advantageous, and an indirect method of providing work for the unemployed. </para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>3981</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JYH</name.id><electorate></electorate><party>CP</party><role></role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">ELLIOTT, Robert</name><name role="display">Senator R D ELLIOTT</name></talker><para>- Do the tributers participate in the bounty? </para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>3981</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K1L</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">BARNES, John</name><name role="display">Senator Barnes</name></talker><para>- They do, if they are registered as gold-diggers. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>3981</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K1Z</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">RAE, Arthur</name><name role="display">Senator RAE</name></talker><para>- As nearly all of the States produce gold to a greater or less extent, and may produce more under this stimulus, and as no good reason has been advanced for the reduction of the bounty by 50 per cent., compared with a reduction of 20 per cent. in the case of other industries, on the ground of justice alone, I must support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston.</inline></para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>3981</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KTR</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">MCLACHLAN, Alexander</name><name role="display">Senator McLACHLAN</name></talker><para>. - I wish to say a few words concerning this matter, in which I have taken a very deep interest, and about which I have spoken at length in this chamber.

I am astonished that this measure should deal with such trivial matters as cotton, flax, linseed and sundry other things, when there are one or two outstanding matters which this Parliament must take into consideration if it is to rehabilitate this country. I should not, at this late hour, refer to what the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> ex-President of the Senate once described as the sectarian question - sugar; but it is obvious that such questions must emerge. The first raid is made on gold, forsooth for the purpose of relieving the Commonwealth Treasury, against what? Against an increase in the production of gold, upon which the future of this country depends, and without which we cannot carry on? During the last twelve months, how has this Government remained in office? How has it been able to avoid facing up to the position with which it is now confronted? Simply by the export of gold to England. Those exports, prior to the last shipment, totalled £32,000.000. The importance of the gold industry to this country cannot be measured; it goes to the very root of our national existence. That is evidenced by the adoption by the Macmillan Commission of the report of the Gold Delegation of the League of Nations. It is the basis of the whole of the credit of this country.

Until I heard that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> was moving in the matter to-day, I believed that that was a compromise which had been accepted by those who have at heart the best interests of the gold-mining industry in Western Australia. But to my amazement, the honorable senator stated that that was not so, and that the powers that be in Western Australia were up in arms against the proposal of the Government. I want honorable senators to understand that any support which I may give <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> will be actuated not by State interests, but by something that goes far deeper. I should like the Minister to state whether this compromise was arranged by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. de</inline> Bernales, who is  chairman  of the Gold Committee. I understand that that committee is not yet a legal body, but that it has some sort of floating existence, so that it may protect and stimulate the gold-mining industry. This action is likely to have a serious repercussion. I should prefer some other bounties to be wiped out before the gold bounty was interfered with in any way, because delicate negotiations in regard to this matter have already taken place, the result of which may be greatly to relieve the difficult position in which this country finds itself. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>3982</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JVF</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">DOOLEY, John</name><name role="display">Senator Dooley</name></talker><para>-  The price of gold is as high as it ever was.

Considerable sums of money were promised overseas for that purpose, on the faith of what the Government had done.
