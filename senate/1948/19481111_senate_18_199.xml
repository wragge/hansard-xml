            <para>The position in regard to the shipment of potatoes from Tasmania is that all available supplies nl grade 1 potatoes have already been lifted; the last shipment being on the <inline font-style="italic">River Burnett</inline> about a month ago. 1 understand that there are some supplies of undergrade potatoes in Tasmania, but I am informed that the Combined Traffic Committee has not yet received any applications for shipping space for these stocks. However, should application be made to the Traffic Committee to provide space to ship these undergrade potatoes to Sydney, I am sure a successful endeavour Wm be made to arrange shipping. In regard to the honorable senator&#39;s suggestion that potatoes should be dehydrated in Tasmania and forwarded to Sydney, I shall pass this suggestion along to my colleague, the Minister for. Commerce and Agriculture. </para>

The proposal to import karakul sheep calls for a decision from the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture and I arranged a discussion between him and the Minister for the Interior. They have agreed to endeavour to obtain scientific and otheradvice to guide them in arriving at  a  reasonable decision. I shall advise the honorable senator  as  soon as I have any further information on the subject. </para>

          <para>- Some months ago, a referendum was held on a proposal to confer upon the Commonwealth Parliament power to continue control of rents and prices. In a press and radio campaign, the Opposition parties in this Parliament advocated the control of prices by the State governments, which, they claimed, would result in a fall of prices. As the States now admit that they are not competent to control prices, will the Minister for Shipping and Fuel urge upon the Government early consideration of another referendum to give the people of this country an opportunity to rectify the grave mistake that they made on the last occasion. </para>

          <para>. - The PostmasterGeneral <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cameron)</inline> has not yet given me a satisfactory explanation of the amendment proposed to be made under this clause to section 67 of the principal act. Under that section very onerous obligations are placed upon the licensees of commercial broadcasting stations with respect to accounting to the Minister. Paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">a,b, c</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">d</inline> of sub-section 1 of that section require such licensees to account minutely even to the extent of furnishing an audited balancesheet and trading account. It is now proposed that such returns shall be furnished in a form to the satisfaction of the hoard. I do not cavil at that; but it is also proposed to compel the licensee of a commercial broadcasting station, upon request by the board, to - </para>

        <para class="block">In the absence of any explanation of the inclusion of this provision we must impute sinister motives to the Government. What activities of broadcasting companies does the Minister suggest should be disclosed in their accounts? Of course, it is inevitable that intimate relationships between broadcasting stations and their clients will be revealed. Every conceivable reasonable power to exercise legitimate supervision of the activities of commercial stations is already enjoyed by the Government under section 67 of the present act. The enactment of clause 19 of the bill will enable a Minister, who may be infuriated by the political attitude of a particular broadcasting station, to  require that station to reveal to his jaundiced and biased eye its intimate business relationships so that he may penalize it if he desires to do so. I see in that provision a very real danger in that commercial broadcasting stations may have to submit their legitimate transactions to a ministerial inquisition. Although it is only reasonable that a commercial broadcaster who holds a licence to broadcast  from the Government should be subject to reasonable supervision, there is no justification for the introduction of such a drastic provision as clause 19.

          <para>.- The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O&#39;sullivan)</inline> is once again imputing to the Government sinister motives which are without foundation. Under the present legislation the Postmaster-General has similar powers to those mentioned in clause 19 of the bill, but I point out to the honorable senator that those powers have never been exercised. At the same rime I assure him that as PostmasterGeneral I should not have hesitated to exercise those powers had circumstances warranted action being taken. The honorable senator is assuming that the Minister may exercise his powers without any real justification, but, of course, a similar suggestion may be made in connexion with any measure which invests a Minister with power to intervene in particular matters. The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition realizes that, of course, and the contention which he has just raised is simply another &#34; Aunt Sally &#34; which he has put up to be knocked over. The proposed board is to exercise the powers which were previously exercisable by the Minister in regard to the financial activities of commercial broadcasting  stations.  If the proposed board is to discharge its duties effectively it is essential that it shall have power to compel holders of commercial broadcasting licences to furnish full particulars of their financial transactions. That provision will not be peculiar to the Australian Broadcasting Act. Other acts provide that representatives of the Government shall have power to examine books if necessary. For example, when I was Minister for Aircraft Production, we discovered that the Government was being debited in many instances with costs that properly should have been charged to contractors. We ordered contractors to produce their books for examination. As the result of such examinations, we recovered fully &#163;1,000,000 of costs that were chargeable to the contractors instead of the Government. Had we not possessed that power under the National Security Act at the time, certain individuals would have charged the Government with millions of pounds for work which had not been done and for materials which had not been supplied. Clause 19 provides that the broadcasting control board shall have power to examine books of commercial  stations  to ascertain exactly what has been done by those stations. In my opinion, that power is necessary, especially&#39; in connexion with advertising. </para>

          <para>. - That is a very interesting explanation, but the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cameron)</inline> has not explained why the additional power is to be inserted in the act. All of the powers which he said were necessary are already conferred under the Australian Broadcasting Act. For instance, it provides that the licensee of a commercial broadcasting station shall compile and maintain, in a recognized business or commercial form, separate accounts in respect . of his broadcasting activities, make such accounts available for inspection by the Minister or an. authorized officer, and furnish to the Minister a duly audited annual balance-sheet and profit and loss account in accordance with the prescribed form. I again emphasize that the existing act provides all the powers which the Postmaster-General has mentioned and, in addition, obliges a broadcasting station to keep such records relating to its broadcasting service as the Minister from time to time directs, and to .supply copies of those records to the Minister as required. Every conceivable provision has been made for ministerial supervision of the activities of, a broadcasting station as a commercial enterprise. Clause 19 proposes to go further than that. Without any obligation of secrecy, it will make a broadcasting station liable to lay bare its most confidential transactions with any person, firm or association with which it has business. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">There is no necessity for any such provision. The reasons that have &#39;been advanced by the PostmasterGeneral are not satisfactory. Each one of them can be conceded, and it can be retorted that the Government already enjoys those powers. The clause will enable the Minister to conductan inquisition into the intimate and confidential details and associations of any broadcasting concern. I ask that favorable consideration be given at least to the insertion of a provision that officers who conduct such investigations shall be bound to secrecy, as are officers who act on behalf of the Taxation Branch and other government instrumentalities. The clause contains no provision for secrecy, and, unless it be amended, any station which may fall out of favour with the government of the day may be ruined as the result of confidential records being obtained and laid bare to its competitors. That would be a very unsatisfactory state of affairs, and I ask that it be not permitted. </para>

          <para>. -  The officers who will conduct these investigations, will be public servants, and, therefore, bound to secrecy. It should not be assumed for a moment that they will broadcast any of the information that they may gain as the result of examinations that they make. I assume that the broadcasting control board would have good reasons for ordering an examination of records. The officers who made the examination would be responsible to the board and it would not in any circumstances, in my judgment, broadcast any information that it obtained. The board would decide upon its attitude in the light of such information. It might decide that no action should he taken, in which event that would be the end of the investigation. There would be no publicity, and nobody would suffer as the result of an investigation unless the board decided that action should be taken against a station for some breach of the law.

            <para>- After that introductory remark, I shall proceed to refer to the proposed deletion  of  subsection 2 of section85 of the Australian Broadcasting Act, for which this clause provides. Now, if ever, is the time when I should expect any honorable senator, who is a member of the Broadcasting Committee, and appreciates  the  work that that body has done,  to  step into the breach and say, &#34; This committee has done splendid work. Its powers should not be limited. If anything, they should be widened so that things will not be done hastily&#34;. Representatives of all parties in the Parliament should have an opportunity to investigate and report to the Parliament upon any important matters affecting broadcasting so that the Parliament may be fully informed about them. It was  for  that reason, and to give proper status and dignity to the Broadcasting Committee, that the principal act provides in subsection 2 of section So that the Minister shallrefer to the committee any such matter which the commission or the Australian Federation of Commercial Broadcasting Stations requests him to refer to it. That sub-section imposes a statutory duty upon the Minister. He has no option or discretion. Under it, the Broadcasting Committee considers any matter that is referred to it, and reports back  to  the Parliament. Therein lies  a  substantial safeguard of the independence of the Australian Broadcasting Commission and also of the rights of the commercial stations.Why is that safeguard being removed? Does the Government not trust its own statutory committee? What a slap in the eye it is to the Broadcasting Committee, which is appointed by both Houses of the Parliament, that this power is to be snatched away from it! The Government is saying in effect, &#39;&#39; You might be independent and carry out your work honestly and fearlessly. Your reports might be inimical to the interests of our all-powerful Minister &#34;. This measure provides therefore that matters shall no longer be referred for the independent scrutiny of the Broadcasting Committee. The Minister&#39;s power is to be absolute. The small assurance contained in the  1942  act that the interests of the commission, of the public, and of the commercial stations, would be protected, and safeguarded from the arrogant and arbitrary exercise of ministerial power, is to be destroyed. What do the Labour champions of liberty have to say about that? Do they agree with it? Do they believe that there is no need to protect the public by having a Broadcasting Committee? Do they believe that there is no need for the Parliament to be informed by its own committee? The attitude of the Government apparently is that whatever the dictatorial Minister may say, shall be law and the public be damned. </para>

          <para>. - I consider that this is the most important clause in the bill. We are supposed to be living in a state of democracy. We have an electoral aci which says that no member of Parliament shall spend more than &#163;100 on an election campaign. We know that the Nationalist party - I like that name, which is much more explanatory of that party, which is also euphemistically called the Liberal party and which is really a tory party - can afford a lot of money to spend on radio time. A Labour politician cannot even buy time on the air from some commercial stations. If the people are to judge fairly between the rights and wrongs of political viewpoints, they can do so only if the case of each side is put fairly, and all sides are granted equal broadcasting time. We know what happened when the last referendum campaign was in progress. It was impossible to move without meeting the Opposition&#39;s propaganda posted up on walls, and without hearing it over the air. No matter what public opinion polls said about what the man in the street thought, the truth is that the man in the street had been subject to so much propaganda from the Opposition that he did not know what he really thought of the issue involved in the referendum. The people were misled during that campaign because the Liberal party had the money to spend on propaganda. The &#34;John. Henry Austral &#34; broadcasts distorts the lives of such men as <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Parkes in play form and ends up by saying, &#34; Vote for the Liberal party &#34;. That is done simplybecause <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Casey,</inline> the &#34; moneybags &#34;, has come back from Great Britain with money to spend on propagandato put the Labour Government out of office. The interests represented by the Liberal party are prepared to spend any amount of money to put the Labour Government out of office. How can we have a democracy when such people can say, for instance,  &#34;We want 2UW for three hours a week for the next month &#34;, and they can get that time from the station? Even if the station has not the time available for them they can always get somebody else to pull out and make it available. This clause contains a principle that is the very basis of democracy. I told a story last night in this connexion.I shall now quote what Schopenhauer, the pessimistic German philosopher, said - </para>

            <para>- I think honorable senators will agree that the story I told last night shows how we were told to think about the American elections. It has been said of that election that every one was against  President  Truman except the American people. The propaganda used during the American campaign was like that used in Australia during the last referendum campaign when the Opposition told the working people that if they voted &#34; No &#34; the States would be able to administer prices control. They told the people that the law of supply and demand would get to work and that prices, instead of rising, would fall. Let the people have another &#34;go&#34; on that matter and, in view of what they have learned by bitter experience, they would give a different verdict now. This mass stampeding policy followed by the Opposition parties at every election must be stopped. If all parties are given an equal opportunity the people will lie able to form a fair opinion. This clause will amend section 89 of the principal act so that it will read - </para>

          <para>. - Proposed new sub-section 3 of section 89 of the principal act reads - (3.) Neither the Commission nor the licensee of a commercial broadcasting station shall broadcast any dramatization of any political matter which is then current or was current at any time during the last five pre- ceding years. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">As I mentioned last night, therein lies a note of optimism. The Government must think that the people have short memories when it considers that a period of five years will be sufficient respite to enable them to forget the way they have been shoved around. It has been suggested that the Gibson broadcasting committee, following the precedent set by Canada-, made a recommendation along the lines of the proposal embodied in the clause. That may, or may not, be so. However, those who signed the report of that committee had no authority to speak for me; and, incidentally, none of the persons who represented the Opposition parties on it is now a member of the Parliament. My main point is that those who subscribed to such a recommendation had no idea of the degree to which this powerdrunk Government would abuse its authority. We were assured that no Labour government would attempt to foist socialization and nationalization upon the people. In 1942, I, in common with many Labour supporters, thought that the plank in the Labour party&#39;s platform calling for the socialization of the means of production, distribution and exchange, was just a pious, harmless concession by the majority of the moderates in the party to a militant minority. However, times have changed. The moderates have lost their courage, whilst the militants, although never silent or particularly nonmilitant, have now become the dictators of the once moderate Labour party. 1 am quite sure that had any one known the degree to which an allegedly moderate Labour government would go, no one would have been in favour of giving any further power to a Labour government. </para>
        <para>It is understandable that the Labour Government is very annoyed at some dramatization broadcasts now heard over the air. Government supporters claim that these broadcasts are gross misrepresentations. I assure the Senate that they are not ; they are very precise and correct representations of what has been said and done by Labour Ministers. I propose to give some examples of those broadcasts, and I should like honorable senators opposite to indicate in what respect they are offensive. I take the following extracts from a script of a &#34; John Henry Austral &#34; broadcast. It is headed &#34; The Brick that Dedman Dropped &#34;. Even colleagues of the Minister for Postwar Reconstruction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman)</inline> know that he has dropped a few bricks in his day. I recall the day when he expressed the fear that Australia might become a nation of &#34;little capitalists &#34; because there was an urge to give the people encouragement to own their own homes. I believe that it was the same Minister who described the Government&#39;s banking legislation as &#34; plucking the fowl &#34;. I ask honorable senators opposite to say in what respect this &#34; John Henry Austral &#34; broadcast is offensive. I can quite understand these broadcasts being very hurtful to Government supporters, but that does not mean that they are offensive. Honorable senators opposite know as well as anybody that the most hurtful thing of all is the truth. I agree that supporters of the Government have been hurt by these broadcasts, but they cannot say that the broadcasts are offensive. I do not propose to dwell at length on this matter because I do not want to rub salt into the Government&#39;? wounds. The efficacy of these broadcasts is revealed in the impression that they have made upon the people and by the fact that the Government now desires, by exercising its power arbitrarily, to suppress them. One of these broadcasts was as follows: - </para>

          <para>. - In response to an interjection made by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O&#39;Sullivan)</inline> in the course of the speech which I made last night I said that I was reared in a purer political age than the present. I repeat that assertion, and I regret that the honorable senator who is enlightened and has had all the advantages of life, should protest against the inclusion in the measure of a provision which is designed to protect the purity of the country&#39;s politics. Although he claimed that the parliamentary committee which investigated the activities of broadcasting companies some years ago and furnished a report to the Parliament did not represent his views, I point out that a number of non-Labour members of the Parliament were members of that committee. The <inline font-weight="bold">chairman, Senator Gibson,</inline> was certainly not a Labour supporter, and with all respect to his successors in the office of Postmaster-General, I do not think that any of them commanded more respect from the members of the Parliament. The report which he submitted on postal facilities, following his tour abroad, was excellent, and he considerably improved the service rendered to the community by the PostmasterGeneral&#39;s Department. Another nonLabour member of that committee who was respected by all members of the Parliament and was well-known in Nationalist party circles, was <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Marr, who was later entrusted with the conduct of the Royal 1 tour in 1934. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Price,</inline> of South Australia, an eminent educationist was another non-Labour member of that committee. Those three gentlemen represented the nonLabour parties on the committee. The present Minister for Information <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell)</inline> and the present Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Riordan),</inline> and &#93; believe, also <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Amour,</inline> were member? nif that committee. The committee  reported that the opponents of Labour were resorting to measures which threatened to destroy the purity of the country&#39;s political life. During the early part of the war commercial stations broadcast matter which suggested that Hitler was behind the Australian Labour party, and that the nazis would be pleased if Labour won the election. Indeed, some of the propaganda issued by the enemies of Labour was so repulsive that certain broadcasting stations refused to broadcast it. However, because of the activities of some broadcasting stations it was decided to impose a limitation upon their activities, and the principal act was amended to provide that broadcasts of political propaganda should not be made between the date of issue of writs for an election and the election. However, the enemies of Labour are now  as unscrupulous as ever, and interests which have large sums of money to spend on propaganda are desperately anxious not only to destroy the present Labour Government but also to bring the parliamentary institution into disrepute. They suggest that amongst the supporters of the Government in the Parliament there are disloyalists and other undesirable persons. That is a vicious lie, and it may well be the prelude to the inauguration of a totalitarian form of government, a development which honorable senators opposite profess to abhor. In the circumstances the Government has decided to put an end to abuse of the broadcasting facilities by amending the principal <inline font-style="italic">act</inline> and that is the reason for the inclusion of the clause in the bill. </para>

          <para>.- The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O&#39;Sullivan)</inline> has suggested that the reason for the introduction of this clause in the measure is that members of the Government are annoyed. As a member of the Government, I must confess that I feel some annoyance at the unscrupulous, activities of our opponents, and I am amazed at the leniency which we have displayed towards certain broadcasting stations. On a previous occasion, when a commercial broadcasting station abused its privileges, my namesake, the honorable member for Barker in the House of Representatives <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron),</inline> who was Postmaster-General at the time, simply shut the station concerned off the air. However, when a similar case of breach of privilege of a broadcasting company was reported to me as PostmasterGeneral, I did not take precipitate action, but wrote to the broadcasting station concerned for an explanation. The broadcast item which gave rise tr. complaint in that instance was entitled. &#34;Is Your Home Your Castle?&#34;. <inline font-style="italic">A</inline> wireless licence inspector employed by the Post Office was portrayed making a call on a resident in the course of his duty. During the imaginary conversation which ensued at the house of the householder, the voice representing the inspector made the utterly false assertion that the official had the right to enter and search the premises. The procedure followed by the Post Office in the detection of unlicensed wireless receivers has been unchanged since the inception of broadcasting, and those who have occupied the office of Postmaster-General in governments of various political colour have been responsible for the activities of those officers. That particular broadcast was a classic example of how drama may be used to appeal to the emotions of the listening public, rather than to present a reasoned statement for their consideration. &#34;When I communicated with representatives of the Australian Federation of Commercial Broadcasting. Stations they expressed regret for that broadcast, which was made on behalf of the Liberal party. </para>

            <para>- During last August. The Australian Federation of Commercial Broadcasting Stations admitted that it was an untruth, but so far as I know the Liberal party has never admitted the untruthfulness of any of its propaganda. I have received a number of letters complaining of similar broadcasts, and I had the departmental recordings placed before me. Those records disclose that the broadcasts concerning which complaints have been made were either gross exaggerations or deliberate untruths. I shall quote the last letter which I received. It was written by the Australian Arts Movement on the 6th November and is as follows: - </para>

        <para class="block">Dear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron,</inline></para>
        <para>We desire to enter a protest against the dramatized propaganda of the John Austral series authorized by the Liberal party and enlist your support in the content matter of this letter. </para>
        <para>We are desirous that politics does not infiltrate into the cultural or entertainment sphere. We believe that it is bad for a community to bo fed on drama which carries propaganda and that polities degrades itself when ithas to resort to employing or enlisting actors and actresses in a sordid attempt to belittle the Government. </para>
        <para>Every leader or member of political parties should be ensured of free speech, but in a dignified and truthful manner. A party which has been so apathetic to the cultural needs of the community has lost all right to enter into dramatized political plays. </para>
        <para>The broadcasting stations which allow these broadcasts are not saying, as in previous broadcasts, whether the views expressed are the views of the station, also the names of lice actors and actresses are not mentioned, a nd it is with the intention of fooling the public that they are the man in the street. We ask that you enforce this request for these broadcasts and the Country Quiz to itemize the casts employed. </para>
        <para>We will support the Broadcasting Bill because we feel that some benefit will result, a nd that the broadcasting stations can no longer be allowed to exploit for profit in the manner they have done. We feel, too, that the Government should air the bill, as many people are under the impression that it is merely socializing. We have long worked for government control in such a vital avenue. </para>
        <para>In our work which has brought us into contact with many organizations, political and otherwise, we are of the opinion that big business and the parties who represent them will not be of benefit to the workers. Their apathy to assist in any reform of education and culture is appalling. It is now up to the Government to take more interest in the cultural welfare of the nation and assist in its progress. </para>
        <para>The children of the working class should have the equality of opportunity denied to them at present. In an industrial area like Newcastle the situation is appalling. </para>
        <para>We have no political affiliations. We believe in the common good. In trying to keep politics out of the cultural and entertainment sphere we are voicing the opinion of many cultural organizations. We fought and won against communistic infiltration and will do the same to the Liberal party. It is hoped that the dignity of the Labour party will not let it resort to such a method. </para>
        <para>Trusting you will give this your sympathetic consideration. </para>
        <para>Yours faithfully, </para>

        <para class="block">That letter did not come from a political party or trade union. I have received dozens of letters expressing similar sentiments. Personally, I do not consider that such broadcasts constitute dramatization. For the most part, they consist of lying misrepresentation. That is the proper description which should be applied to them. If the Liberal party proposes to continue to use the air waves for the purpose of misrepresenting government activities, as it has done up to date, the Government would be remiss if it did not take the action that it proposes to take. </para>

          <para>. - The soulful letter which was just read by the PostmasterGeneral <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cameron)</inline> reminds me of some of the letters received by Dorothy Dix. They are very appropriate to the answers that are required. At this stage, and at any stage, I dissociate myself entirely from any broadcast which is not factual, and which is untruthful. I am sure that every other member of the Liberal party does so, too. It is not necessary for the Liberal party to lie about the Labour party. All we want the people to know are the facts. If the facts have been unduly exaggerated, misstated or misrepresented, I certainly offer no commendation of such broadcasts. Anything of that sort is entirely unnecessary. We have enough facts against the Labour party to sink a battleship, and I am satisfied that, if the people get to know the facts, they will do the right thing at the next election. </para>

          <para>. - As I said during my second reading speech, the day will come when the Government will have to amend this provision so as to prohibit completely the dramatization of any political matter. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sheehan</inline> said, the Broadcasting Committee considered the subject of political dramatizations when ex-Senator Gibson was  chairman  of the committee. I believe that, if the members of the Gibson committee were to meet to-day, they would recommend that political dramatizations should not be broadcast. Had they believed that such broadcasts would be used as the Liberal party has used them, they would have recommended a complete ban. For the sake of political advantage, the Liberal party has sponsored dramatic broadcasts falsely purporting to portray events in this Parliament. The passage of this bill will prevent the dramatization of anything that happened in the Parliament for a period of five years&#39; immediately preceding the date of broadcast, but I have no doubt that the broadcasting stations will continue to be used, as the newspapers are used, to spread lies and build propaganda around those lies. I have listened to Liberal party propaganda broadcasts about the &#34;spiral of prices&#34;. Any uninformed listener would assume from such broadcasts that the Labour party opposed the referendum proposals for the retention of prices control by the Commonwealth. He would be led to believe that the Liberal party fought against the surrender of those powers. That party and its supporters will continue to engage in such misleading propaganda. They have wealth behind them but that is all. Even in the House of Representatives, Opposition members are unable to agree amongst themselves. They are like people lost in a wilderness. All that they have to bolster them up as a political movement is money. Without money they would be helpless. Anybody who has studied the use of propaganda for political purposes in any part of the world realizes that its chief object is the destruction of democratic government. The Liberal party&#39;s propaganda is designed to bring ridicule upon this Parliament. I warn its members that, if they continue with such tactics, they may live to see grow up in this country an &#34; ism &#34; which will not be liberalism. Liberalism is bad enough, but communism would be worse. The only aim of the Liberal party, with its wealth, is deliberately to mislead the public and foster a belief that this Government is recreant to its trust and has no thought for the welfare of the Australian peoj.de. We know, and the members of the Liberal party know, that that is not true. Nevertheless, they persist in their efforts to encourage such a belief, &#34;f repeat that the clause is not sufficiently far-reaching. It should have been designed to prevent for ever the dramati- zation of any political matter in radio broadcasts. The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O&#39;Sullivan)</inline> has said that he and his colleagues have enough facts against the Labour party to sink a battleship. If so, why do they need to use lying, filthy, political dramatization? They say that they have the facts. We know that they have the money. Why. therefore, do they not finance broadcasts by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Sullivan</inline> over the two major networks which they control? They should sponsor a sixty-minute session once a week for him on the Macquarie network. He could then tell the people some of the facts that he says that he has against the Labour party. The Opposition has its Harrisons, its Menzies and its McEwens. Why has it not set them up to tell the facts? It has the right to do so. </para>

            <para>- That is so. Members of the Opposition have not the necessary ability, and so they find &#34; stooges &#34; to broadcast their propaganda in dramatized form for money. Of course, Judas sold out, and the actors have sold out for money - money that is handed out by the people who finance the Liberal party. I am very concerned about this aspect of broadcasting, and I should like the Government to give serious consideration to my suggestion. If it be impracticable to amend the clause at this stage, I urge it to insert an amendment when the measure is being considered in the House of Representatives so as to place a permanent ban upon dramatized political broadcasts. </para>

          <para>. -  I gather that this clause will remove from the Australian Broadcasting Act the provision that the Minister administering the Wireless Telegraphy Act shall not, &#34; except on the recommendation of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Broadcasting, grant licences in respect of facsimile, television or frequency modulation services &#34;. I see in this a further diminution of the already dwindling powers of the Broadcasting Committee. I am a member of the committee, and I have previously mentioned in this chamber the fact that the Government completely ignores it in connexion with certain major matters related to broadcasting. This provision will further narrow the powers of the committee. I object to such treatment of a body which could be of great value. It is composed of Government supporters and members of the Opposition from both Houses of the Parliament and it is able to visit places and take evidence publicly. As the result of its activities it should be able to present many valuable reports and sound recommendations. It should be of great assistance to the Parliament. However, its powers are being whittled away at every possible opportunity. As a member of the committee, I feel very strongly about this, and I am sure that members of the committee who support the Government must also feel as I do. </para>

          <para>. -  It is not the intention of the Government to ignore the members of the Broadcasting Committee. The committee can carry out the work that is entrusted to it. The explanation of clause  25  is that the Australian Broadcasting Act, as it will be amended by this bill, will cover also television stations and facsimile stations. It is necessary to make the proposed amendment to section  103  of the act in order to prevent conflict between its provisions and those of the Wireless Telegraphy Act. As the Broadcasting Committee has already submitted a report to the Parliament concerning frequency modulation, television and facsimile services, it is no longer necessary to retain the provisions of paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of section  103  of the Australian Broadcasting Act. </para>

          <para>. -I see another danger in this clause. I understand that newspapers can be transmitted by facsimile services. Therefore, the effect of this clause will be to place in the hands of the Government a complete monopoly of that particular form and type of newspaper. Facsimile reproduced newspapers could contain exactly what the Minister wanted them to contain and omit anything to which the Minister objected. Therein lies the possibility of the commencement of the destruction of a free press. However much honorable senators opposite may rail against the press, I contend that Australian newspapers are of as high a standard as those of any other country. I do not suggest that the press is impeccable. It has lots of faults. It is human, because it is run by human beings, but if we lose our free press we shall be well on the road towards losing our complete personal liberty. This provision may well be the first stranglehold upon our still free press. Newspapers, of course, are subject to the law. They are bound by the law of defamation, and by the criminal code relating to the publication of blasphemous and obscene matter; but. generally speaking, our press is- equal to any in the world. </para>

        <para>I ask the Postmaster-General to indicate to the Senate who will issue licences for television and facsimile reproduction. Under section  44  of the principal act, the granting&#39; of broadcasting licences is at the discretion of the Postmaster-General. Broadcasting is broadly defined as the transmission of matter intended for reception by the general public. That definition would probably cover television and facsimile reproduction; but in this amending legislation, the word &#34;oral&#34; is inserted. That means that licences will be classified under three headings, namely, broadcasting, television, and facsimile reproduction. I may be misreading the measure, but I do not see any provision for an authority to grant licences for television and facsimile reproduction. Proposed new section  103  merely states by whom such licences shall not be issued. If the Minister - still unidentified - is not to grant licences for television and facsimile reproduction, who will grant them? </para>

          <para class="block">This bill is the Commonwealth&#39;s part of a plan which needs complementary legislation by the States. The State legislation is now being provided by the various governments.

          </list>
          <para class="block">This plan has been discussed with the States and each of the four main wheat States submitted it to a ballot of wheatgrowers. The result was that wheatfarmers in New South Wales. Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia voted in favour of it with a big majority in each State. The plan therefore has received the support of our wheatfarmers beyond any doubt. </para>
          <para>The troubles of the wheat industry have been before Parliament many times in the last twenty years. Most of our wheat is sold for export, and so the prosperity of the industry is very much wrapped up with international trade. The result is that our wheatgrowers have prospered when overseas prices were high, and suffered when export prices were low. During the depression wheat prices were low, and this caused so much hardship to wheatgrowers throughout Australia that a long series of relief measures was necessary. The assistance given to the growers in the 1930&#39;s, however, did not remove the cause of the trouble. It simply helped our farmers to carry on from year to year in the hope of better times. </para>
          <para>Before the war broke out all concerned were convinced that a permanent stabilization scheme was needed; and that wheatgrowers should be guarded against the continual risks of big variations of overseas prices. Attempts to get a satisfactory plan were made before the war, and they have been continued until the last few weeks. In spite of the general agreement on the need for a plan, it was not possible to get agreement on details earlier. </para>
          <para>Any effective plan for dealing with wheat requires the co-operation of Commonwealth and States, and complementary Commonwealth and State legislation. The discussions through the years have been directed at an agreement on which Commonwealth and States could agree, and which would meet the desires of wheat-growers. </para>
          <para>In 1946 legislation was passed by the Commonwealth for a wheat plan. That legislation has not been effective because the States did not pass the complementary legislation. Negotiations were continued, and in July, 1946 a suitable plan was devised. It has been approved by growers&#39; polls in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia and the State bills have been introduced in Victoria and South Australia. Similar action is expected soon in New South Wales and Western Australia. </para>
          <para>The plan now presented, therefore, is the result of long and thorough consideration, and it is satisfactory to all concerned. A brief comment may be made on the different features of the plan. A guaranteed price of 6s. 3d. a bushel f.o.r. ports for bulk wheat is assured to growers. That price is based on an investigation by a competent committee of inquiry, and the price is accepted by wheat-growers as satisfactory. The price is to be varied each year according to changes in production costs. The changes will be investigated by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture. The initial price relates to the 1947-48 crop, so that the first variation will apply to the coming crop for the 1948-49 season. The guarantee runs to the end of the 1952-53 wheat season. It is intended to review it within three years, with the hope of having a continuing scheme. Wheat is to be marketed through an Australian Wheat Board, which will conduct pools on the lines familiar through the war-time marketing. </para>
          <para>The guarantee by the Commonwealth will apply to an export quantity of up to 100,000,000 bushels each season. For wheat used in Australia a price equal to the guaranteed price will be ensured by State laws. This means that all normal crops will be covered fully, and only the additional export from a very big crop could be outside the guarantee. Growers will contribute to a stabilization fund while export prices are high. For its part the Commonwealth guarantees a good price while export prices are low. The growers&#39; contribution will be half the excess of the export return over the guaranteed price, but it will not be more than 2s. 2d. a bushel in any season. As the contribution starts with the 1947-4S crop there will be &#163;15,000,000 from that crop as a start for the stabilization fund. A reasonable fund is desired, and if continuing high export prices bring too much into the fund a refund of tax will be considered. This is the principle followed in proposals placed before the Parliament this session to refund tax collected on No. 9 and No. 10 wheat pools. The States will provide for a home-consumption price equal to the guarantee, and for the wheat crops to come into the Australian pool. It should be noted that this maintains the principle that the local price will be fair all the time. Neither the grower nor the consumer will be .exploited on the local market. </para>
          <para>This bill, together with the complementary State bills, will give Australian wheat-growers organized marketing throughout their industry. It will give them security for five years ahead against market risks, and it does so on fair terms. This security goes hand in hand with fair prices for the public, and the public is guarded against excessive prices. </para>
          <para>The wheat plan covers the needs of the industry. It merits support because it will, with fairness to all, enable our wheat-farmers to carry on profitably in an industry which is essential in our rural economy. </para>

        </quote>
        <para>This bill which is complementary to the Wheat Industry Stabilization Bill, imposes a charge on wheat exported. The payment will be the growers&#39; contribution to the Wheat Prices Stabilization Fund. The bill is very similar to the Wheat Export Charge Act of 1946. It was thought &#39; better to repeal that act than to amend it. </para>
        <para>The idea behind the wheat stabilization plan is that growers should pay into a fund, while wheat prices are high. The fund will be used to give them a profitable  price  when wheat prices fall. If there is any deficiency in the fund, the Commonwealth will see that the guaranteed price is paid to them. </para>
        <para>The payments begin with the 1947-48 crop, most of which has now been sold. That crop will give the fund a good start, because collections from it will be &#163;15,000,000. I need hardly say that we do not expect in the future to have simultaneously another record crop, and high prices, which would give a similar amount. It does seem likely, however, that there will be another substantial payment from the 1948-49 crop soon to be harvested. </para>
        <para>The principle of the charge has been approved by growers. Each season the growers will get the guaranteed price; then if there is any surplus from export wheat that will be shared equally by growers and the fund. A limit of 2s. 2d. a bushel is fixed for the contribution, so that the tax will not exceed that amount in any event. Taking the basic guarantee of 6s. 3d. a bushel, this means that growers will get the first 6s. 3d. a bushel from the pool. Then they share with the fund the next 4s. 4d. a bushel, or part thereof, of the  export  price, which means a charge of 2s. 2d. a bushel on export wheat sold at 10s. 7d. a bushel, and a correspondingly lower charge on wheat sold below 10s. 7d. Above the 103. 7d. a bushel mark growers will receive all the additional money from export wheat. This means that although the export price is now 15s: 6d. a bushel the tax on wheat sold at that price remains at the 2s. 6d. a bushel limit. </para>
        <para>I want to make it clear that the guaranteed price is the starting point for the charge, because it will vary from season to season according to production costs. If costs rise the charge will not commence until the higher guaranteed price is reached. If they fall it will start on a lower amount. There is provision for collection of less than the 50 per cent, charge if a lower rate is prescribed. That would be one way of decreasing the charge if the fund had enough money in it to justify a reduction. </para>
        <para>The rest of the bill deals with matters in regard to payments. Payments will practically all be made by the Australian Wheat Board from a pool, and a convenient method of payment has been provided. The board will pay amounts due every three months, and so avoid the need for a big series of small payments. </para>
        <para>The bill is clear, and I do not consider that it has any contentious matter in it. It is necessary to carry out the wheat stabilization plan and to provide the funds for the plan. </para>

          <para class="block">The bill provides for a refund of wheat tax collected on the 1945-46 and 1946-47 wheat crops. In round figures the amount for 1945-46 was &#163;7,000,000, and for 1946-47 it was &#163;4,000,000. These amounts will be repaid to the Australian Wheat Board so that they can be distributed to growers in the same way as are the normal payments from wheat pools. The wheat tax has been collected in accordance with the legislation passed in 1946. A tax was imposed on wheat exported, and the purpose was to provide funds to help to meet the guarantee of a minimum price to growers. This was in accordance with the wheat stabilization plan, which was to give a guaranteed price to wheatgrowers in low-price years. The guaranteed price was contingent on a contribution by growers in highprice years for their own future security. In effect, if growers provided a reasonable fund when prices were high and they could afford it, the Commonwealth was prepared to assure them a reasonable return when export prices slumped. </para>
          <para>It was made clear, when the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> announced the wheat proposals early in 1946, that the Commonwealth did not mean to have an excessively big fund. Wheatgrowers were to make a reasonable contribution, and no more than that. Now, as the result of high export prices for several seasons a reasonable fund is assured, and to prevent it from getting larger than is fair to wheatgrowers, the tax for the first two seasons should be returned. The 1946 wheat plan depended upon complementary State legislation. The legislation has not become effective in the four big wheat States. Consequently, fresh proposals have been made, and they are the subject of separate legislation this session. A record wheat crop last year and high export prices have made it possible to offer generous terms, and to assure wheatgrowers of profitable production up to the end of the 1952-53 season. </para>
          <para>It is now certain that the wheat tax from the 1947-48 crop will bring about &#163;15,000,000 into the Wheat Prices StabilizationFund. At the present stage that amount will be adequate, and so the decision has been reached to refund to wheatgrowers the payments from the previous two seasons. That decision was announced on behalf of the Government early this year, and this bill is intended to give it effect. Naturally, many people will ask why a refund should be made while the present tax is still being collected. On the face of it, a better arrangement would appear to be to suspend this year&#39;s tax. or reduce it, and use the money already in the fund. That would certainly be easier, especially as the wheatgrowers concerned are practically the same group, differing only by the changes that have occurred during a couple of years. It has been decided however, that when refunds of wheat tax are practicable, the fairest method to adopt is &#34; first in, first out &#34;. The growers who actually supplied the money should get back the money which is not needed. This means that the fund at any time, will be supplied from the latest groups of contributors, and they are the ones most likely to benefit from the guarantee. </para>
          <para>There is also the advantage that the oldest contributing pool is always the one most likely to have a number of &#34; hard luck &#34; cases, mostly people who leave the industry because of sickness or disaster, and have a greater claim to special consideration. Lastly, the principle is one which the wheatgrowers approve, and as the matter affects them most their wishes should be met as far as practicable. </para>
          <para>The wheat tax has been placed in a trust fund, and the amount has been invested. Repayment will include the interest earned by the fund. I have said that two seasons&#39; collections are concerned. It is intended to repay the amount for the earlier season, 1945-46, as soon as practicable, and this payment will be made before the end of the year. This will account for &#163;7,000,000.&#39; The payment of the 1946-47 season tax will be made later at a convenient date which has not yet been determined. The payment is made possible by the high export prices of wheat since the war, and I feel sure that it merits the unqualified endorsement of this chamber. </para>

          <para class="block">This bill to amend the Social Services Contribution Assessment Act 1945-1947 has been rendered necessary by amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act which are proposed by another bill just introduced. There is a close connexion between the Income Tax Act and the Social Services Contribution Assessment Act in that the provisions cf the former are, to a large degree, adopted and applied for the purposes of assessing and collecting the social services contribution. The provisions of the Social Services Contribution Assessment Act which will be affected by this bill are those concerning the maintenance of secrecy, and the assessment of social services contribution on the undistributed profits of private companies. </para>

          <para class="block">This bill provides for a reduction of thu rate of social services contribution payable by persons in the lower income ranges. The reduced rate of social services contribution is in consonance with the reduction of the rates of income tax for persons in the higher income brackets. It is estimated that the cost of the proposed reduction will be approximately &#163;S,000,000 in a full year. The present basic rate of contribution commences at 3d. in the &#163;1 and rises on a graduated scale to lSd. in the &#163;1 at an income of &#163;250. Under this bill, the basic rate will commence at 3d. as at present, but the range of graduation will be lengthened so that the maximum rate of 18d. in the &#163;1 will not apply until an income of &#163;350 is reached. Corresponding reductions in the concessional rate of contribution are proposed, with respect to persons entitled to concessional allowances for dependants. &#38;c. As the result of these reductions, the concessional rate will not reach the maximum of 18d. in the &#163;1 until the income is &#163;100 higher than at present. As a consequence of the proposed adjustments to the. basic rate and the concessional rate respectively, the incomes at which the maximum rate of 18d. in the &#163;1 if reached will be raised to higher levels as follows : - </para>

          <para class="block">The bill also incorporates a new provision which is designed to effect certain economies in the costs of administration, particularly in relation to instalment tax deductions. A practice adopted last year requires that a salary or wage earner attach his group certificate or his tax stamps to his return of income. In many instances the instalment deductions closely approximate the amount payable on assessment, leaving a small balance to be paid by, or refunded to, the salary or wage earner. The new clause is designed to achieve a saving of the administrative costs involved in collecting, in refunding, and in accounting for these small balances, by providing that the amount of social services contribution be adjusted to meet the value of the group certificate or stamps, in any case where the balance required to be paid or refunded would be 2s. or less. The new arrangement is being applied to assessments based on the income of the year which ended on the 30th June, 1948, that is, assessments made in the current financial year. </para>

          <para>As the development of Western Australia is of considerable importance to the Commonwealth as a whole, the Government proposes to make a grant to the Western Australian Government towards the cost of a proposal to reticulate water from the Eastern Goldfields Water Supply Scheme to certain agricultural areas in the north-eastern portions of the State&#39;s main mixed wheat and sheep belt which are intersected by the Trans Australian Railway, and to provide a supply from the Wellington Dam  to  towns along the Great Southern Railway The scheme is that referred to in the acre of the State of Western Australia known as the Agricultural Areas, Great Southern Towns and Goldfields Water Supply Act 1947. </para>
          <para>The total cost of that part of the scheme to which the Commonwealth proposes financial assistance is &#163;4,300,000, the Commonwealth&#39;s assistance being limited to meeting one half of the cost of the project, with an upper limit of &#163;2,150,000. </para>
          <para>The scheme provides for the following: programme of works: - (a) Raise the Mundaring Weir, increasing its capacity from 4,600,000,000 gallons to 15,000,000,000 gallons; <inline font-style="italic">(b)</inline> raise the Wellington Dam increasing its capacity from 7,500,000,000 gallons to 38,000,000,000 gallons; (c) increase by stages the capacity of the pumping stations and mains on the gold fields water supply system to enable water to be reticulated throughout certain north eastern agricultural areas comprising approximately 4,000,000 acres; (d) construct a steel main with pumping stations from Wellington Dam over the Darling. Ranges to the Great Southern towns extending from Beverley to Katanning, and (e) construct high level storages with the necessary pumping stations and reticulation system throughout the area. The Commonwealth will not contribute to the cost of increasing the storage capacity of the Mundaring Weir and Wellington. Dam, as the State has already undertaken to meet the cost of this part of the works out of its own finances. The agricultural areas included in the scheme total approximately 4,000,000 acres, and at present carry a population of about 32,700, of whom 23,700 live in towns and 9,000 on farms. Within this area there are 23 towns, none of which has a satisfactory water supply, with the exception of those situated alongside the existing gold fields water supply main. The towns which will be serviced along the Great Southern Railway extend from Beverley to Katanning. This additional assured water supply is necessary to meet the demands on the gold fields water supply system, which already exceed its  capacity; to increase primary production; to provide for the expansion and development of secondary industries; and to provide amenities by making reasonable water supplies available to farms and towns. The proposed scheme has been investigated, and a report has been furnished by an expert committee which visited the area. </para>
          <para>It is acknowledged that the scheme will not be self-supporting, and that it will incur an annual loss of approximately &#163;34,000, but the increased productivity and social welfare which will result from its implementation completely justifies the proposed expenditure. From a national viewpoint, it is desirable that the potentialities of the area should be developed, and the Government considers that the grant, which will be for capital purposes, and is additional to the special grants and other direct payments made to Western Australia for revenue purposes, should be approved. I commend the bill to honorable senators. </para>

        <para class="block">The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> drew attention in his budget speech to the fact that the total liability for. war gratuity is estimated at &#163;80,000,000 and that, whilst limited payments are being made to meet special cases within the provisions of the act and the recommendations of the Parliamentary Committee on War Gratuity, the main liability will fall due in the financial year 1950-51. It would obviously be difficult to provide, in one year, sufficient funds to meet such a large commitment, and it is wise to make provision in the current financial year and the next one to cover at least part of the liability. The bill, therefore, proposes to establish a war gratuity reserve by appropriating from Consolidated Revenue &#163;23,420,430, and to credit that sum to an account which will be a trust account within the meaning of section 62a of the Audit Act. The proposed reserve will be established by the. following payments: (1) &#163;1,420,430, which represents the excess of receipts over expenditure of the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the last financial year ; (2) &#163;5,000,000 from general revenue; and (3) &#163;17,000,000, which comprises balances in excess of requirements in certain trust accounts. </para>
        <para>The previous practice has been to appropriate for a specific purposeany surplus of a financial year. The provision in this bill for the appropriation of the surplus of last financial year is consistent with that practice, and will give effect to the undertaking given by the Treasurer to the Parliament in June last. The moneys in certain trust accounts which it is proposed to transfer to Consolidated Revenue are not directly attributable to war loan expenditure, but have accumulated from financial provision made against certain war-time risks and contingencies. The Import Procurement Suspense Account, from which it is proposed to transfer &#163;4,000,000, was established during the period when lend-lease supplies were being received in Australia, and at that time the Government was also making extensive cash purchases abroad of supplies for military and civilian purposes. Those supplies were distributed at stabilized prices, which included an insurance loading. It is proposed to transfer &#163;4,500,000 from the Marine War Risks Insurance Trust Account. The balances in that account represent chiefly the difference between marine war risk premiums and claims. Balances in the Overseas Shipping Trust Account, from which it is proposed to transfer &#163;3;000,000, arose through the operation of chartered shipping during and after the recent war. It is also proposed to transfer &#163;5,500,000 from the War Damage Fund, the purpose of which was to provide coverage to property against  certain forms of damage during the war period. </para>
        <para>In all the accounts to which I have just referred, sufficient balances are available to meet any expenditure likely to be required from those accounts, but, having regard to the origins of those balances, the Government considers it appropriate nhat the moneys involved should be applied to meeting a commitment which, in the strictest sense, arose from the war and has been carried forward from the war period. As mentioned by the Treasurer in his budget speech, the Parliament will l)e asked at a later date to amend the Audit Act to permit any future unrequired balances in trust accounts to be transferred to the Consolidated Revenue Fund, or to the Loan Fund, as may be appropriate. 1 commend the bill to honorable senators. </para>

            <para>. - I have pleasure in supporting the measure, with the general principles of which I am in complete agreement. I shall not, therefore, impede the passage of the bill. The reclamation - if one may use the term - of those who have had the misfortune to be incapacitated by sickness, accident or hereditary influences and have become a burden upon themselves and their relatives and a charge upon the country, deserves the sympathetic consideration of all members of the community. We owe such persons a duty, not only in Christian charity but also in citizenship, to assist them to recover their proper place in society, and therefore the provisions of the measure are most commendable, &#91;n addition, it is obvious that the national economy will benefit in some degree from work performed by pensioners, who will be enabled to make some direct contribution to the community in return for the assistance extended to them. From the speech made by the Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McKenna)</inline> I obtained the impression that the Government&#39;s efforts will be directed primarily at rehabilitating those who have prospects of regaining their place in society. I urge that particular consideration be given to the claims of youthful invalids, who should be given priority over other classes. In the course of his speech the Minister stated - </para>

          <quote>
            <para>Those payments, as well as rehabilitation allowances and training allowances, will nol be taken into account as &#34;income&#34; in deter mining the rate of any invalid or age pension payable to the spouse of a trainee. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I trust that later we shall be able to afford assistance to all those unfortunate people who are deserving of it, but, as the Minister pointed out, present shortages of material and man-power compel us to restrict the distribution of such assistance. As I have said, youth is particularly deserving of assistance, and although the general distribution of benefits must be restricted I urge that youth be given preference over age pensioners. Since the Commonwealth is to provide the money to finance the scheme, it is proper for it to establish machinery to control the expenditure of the money, and in establishing that organization it should seek the advice of the most able experts available. The reclamation of people who may be weak in body or in mind, but. who have a prospect of complete recovery to a state of useful citizenship, is receiving world-wide attention. I commend honorable senators to a document on this subject which is well worth reading. It is the report of a standing committee on the rehabilitation and resettlement of disabled persons in the United Kingdom. It was published under the aegis of the British Ministry of Labour and National Service, and it emphasizes the wisdom of having the best expert opinions available and ensuring the closest possible degree of collaboration between the Department of Health, the Department of Social Services, the Repatriation Commission and other authorities. The British committee included representatives of the Ministry of Education.  the Ministry of Labour and National Service, the Ministry of National Insurance, the Ministry of Pensions, and the Ministry of Health. I urge the Government to ensure that, in the administration of this bill, there shall be close co-operation between not only the Department of Health, the Department of Social Services and the Repatriation Commission but also the Departments of Education of the various States and any other bodies that are in a position to contribute to the smooth operation of this most commendable plan. The British committee recommended a scheme for the physical and mental rehabilitation of people whose disabilities are such that at present they are unsuitable for absorption, even as trainees for remedial and corrective purposes, in workshops and factories. The scheme embodies the provision of home facilities for such persons. The committee reported - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The act also permits the development of  home  workers&#39; schemes for the benefit of  those  whose disablement (or other circumstances) prevents their taking advantage of workshop  facilities  and restricts their activity to their home?. These schemes may be either for &#34; working  on  own account &#34; or on a contract basis, e.g.. in connexion with a British Factory.  Existing  arrangements by local authorities for thu organization of home workers&#39; schemes for blind persons will be continued, expanded and developed, and schemes for other groups will be developed as necessary. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That deserves the fullest and most favorable consideration of - the Government. T repeat that I have no wish either to impede or to delay the passage of the bill. &#91; conclude with the suggestion that the closest co-operation should be effected with and the utmost encouragement given to private institutions, such as hospitals, which are endeavouring to carry out rehabilitation work. The task of rehabilitating people who are suffering from a condition of invalidity must commend itself earnestly to everybody. We should take great pleasure in assisting to restore  them  to full and fruitful citizenship. </para>

            <para>. - Normally, a person who becomes incapacitated in Australia is required to have a residential qualification of only five years. We are now considering the type of case in which incapacity occurs while the person concerned is outside Australia. If incapacity occurs merely during a temporary absence, it will be deemed to have occurred in Australia. However, occasionally, there are special cases, such as that of a man who was born here, lived here for eighteen years, then went abroad for a number of years, was disabled while overseas, and finally returned. The man I have in mind suffered disability as the result of maltreatment by the Japanese. Under the existing law the Department of Social Services was unable to grant him an invalid pension. The law as it now stands is interpreted to require twenty years of continuous residence in Australia. Broken periods of residence cannot be taken into account. There is also a doubt whether, under the existing law, the period of twenty years must be served before the incapacity occurs or afterwards. The clause which we are now considering provides plainly that the period of twenty years may befulfilled by residence in Australia either before or after incapacitation. Any period of twenty years will suffice. Itis a liberalizing clause, and it will simplify one or two other aspects of the existing legislation. </para>

              <para>- It will definitely liberalize the act. I shall give an example. Assume that a mortgage is taken out covering property that constitutes the home of a pensioner as well as other property that is held against the pensioner&#39;s claim. Hitherto, it has been possible to put the whole amount of the mortgage against the home so that the amount of other property held against the pensioner was much more than it would have been otherwise. The new provision will enable the two lots of security to be examined, their values determined, and the quantum of the mortgage to be apportioned to the exempt property and the property that is held against the pensioner. It will enable the mortgage to be distributed. </para>

            <para>. - Proposed sub-section 5 covers the case of a person who is a claimant for, or a recipient of, the sickness benefit, and is also entitled to workmen&#39;s compensation. It will be appreciated, of course, that if a person were to receive two payments in respect of the one incapacity, one from a private source and another from a governmental source, there would be duplication. Accordingly, if a sickness beneficiary is receiving, or is likely to receive, workmen&#39;s compensation, the law provides that the amount paid by way of compensation shall be off-set against whatever payment is received by way of sickness benefit from, the Commonwealth. Proposed sub-section 5 initiates the machinery clauses which enable the DirectorGeneral of Social Services to notify the payer of workmen&#39;s compensation that he, the Director General, is in the field with his claim. It is merely the beginning of a series of provisions which establish the machinery to ensure that the person paying compensation shall not, at the end of a period, be saddled with a liability, without having had the advantage of prior notice. This proposed new sub-section merely ensures that the person liable to pay workmen&#39;s compensation to a sickness beneficiary, shall be given notice of the fact that the DirectorGeneral of Social Services has a claim. </para>

There is no new principle involved. No objection has been raised by the States in the years during which this provision has operated. In Queensland, for instance, there is a State Insurance Office. My DirectorGeneral has had dealings with that office on many occasions. There, has been no objection to the principle of this law which casts obligations on State bodies or instrumentalities. </para>

            <para>. -  The honorable senator will realize that the scheme is in its incipient stage. The intention is to start with two classes of persons, namely. applicants for or recipients of the invalid pension and the sickness benefit or unemployment &#39;benefit. As the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O&#39;Sullivan)</inline> suggested in his secondreading speech, the scheme will eventually include all sections of the community; but a start must be made somewhere. It would be useless starting on a large scale before adequate facilities and trained staff were available. Deaf and dumb people are excluded at this stage because they do not qualify for the unemployment or sickness benefit by virtue of those disabilities alone. Also, for the purposes of the invalid pension, they are not regarded as being85 per cent, disabled. Another thought that occurs to me is that there are throughout the Commonwealth many institutions which cater for the deaf and dumb, although, undoubtedly, the facilities for those people could be improved substantially. As the scheme develops, attention will be given to other classes of the community, but, at present, its scope is limited, and no provision has been made for deaf and dumb persons. &#39; Amendment agreed to. </para>

            <para>. - Immediately prior to the suspension of the sitting <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rankin</inline> was referring to subsection 2 of proposed new section 135. She asked whether the facilities set out in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> of that sub-section would be available for the treatment of an age pensioner suffering from a disability. The scheme provided for in the bill is a limited one only at the moment. We must make a start somewhere, and the scheme is limited to invalid pensioners, claimants for invalid pensions, unemployment and sickness beneficiaries, and claimants for such benefits. Under these conditions there is no room, at the moment for provision for age pensioners, and I believe that a.ll honorable senators will agree, if they study proposed new section, 135a, which refers to the determination of eligibility, that age pensioners would not fit rightly into some of the categories. For instance, by sub-section 2 <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> of proposed new section 135a, a person shall not be eligible to receive treatment or training unless he is suffering from a physical or mental disability which is a substantial handicap to his engaging in a suitable vocation. Age pensioners do not normally seek to engage in a vocation. Under proposed sub-section <inline font-style="italic">2d</inline> it is also &#39;provided that a person shall not be eligible unless his disability is remediable. Amongst the disabilities of age pensioners is age itself, and J. am afraid that even this Government, good as it is, cannot remedy that disability. I agree entirely with the honorable senator that something must be done for age pensioners, but I remind the Senate that within the next few weeks I hope to introduce into this chamber a bill to provide a national health service. Age pensioners will be covered by that service and not by the -service provided for in this &#39;bill which, as I have stated, has a limited scope and is more con cerned with sufferers who can be cured so that they may return to industry and become contributors to the national revenue instead of burdens on it. I believe that the honorable senator will find my explanation satisfactory. I can assure her that, although it has not provided for them in this particular scheme, the Government has not overlooked the age pensioners. </para>

            <para>. - In proposed new section 135k there is provision for certain benefits to be made available subject to certain conditions, and there are other provisions whereby recipients will be trained. There may be instances in which persons may have to leave their homes to receive such training. Will the Minister give an assurance that the power to refuse benefits to persons who, for some reason, do not undertake training will be used judiciously? When the Government introduced a previous bill to provide unemployment relief it gave an assurance that a clause similar to this one would not be used to force people away from their homes to receive their benefits. Here a.gain we have a provision the operation of which may mean that people who are to receive training will have to leave their own homes to receive that training. I congratulate both the Minister and his officers on the great amount of intelligent work they have put into this bill, particularly the clause the Senate is at present discussing. I consider that the bill contains provisions that have long been desired by the people. </para>

            <para>. - Any requirements making it necessary for a person to leave home to receive training would be exercised with great care. It is recognized by the department administering the service that the approach to people of that kind has to be made most carefully. It is realized that it is not of the slightest use forcing medical treatment on people whose minds may not be in accord, with what is being done for them, and a major feature of the approach made by the department through the social service workers on its staff is to persuade these people to a correct understanding of any proposal for their rehabilitation. The very keynote of the problem is one of securing the willing acquiescence of the patient. The department would consider it unwise to proceed with the treatment against his will of a person who required treatment but was not in a mind to accept it, because it would doubt whether that person would really co-operate with the department in his own rehabilitation. The honorable senator may be sure that until my officers are certain that a patient is willing to co-operate in what is planned for him they shall not seek to rehabilitate him. There will be no coercion. </para>

            <para>. - Perhaps the Government&#39;s approach to this subject is conservative, but it is considered that until the department has gained some experience in these matters it is better to move cautiously. Sub-section 4 of proposed new section 135k provides that if a person is unable to make any payment during the period of his treatment or training he shall not be required to make the payment until he has commenced to engage in a vocation after the discontinuance of his training. 1 consider that such a person would bt asked to make repayments on a scale that was deemed reasonable. A man on a low wage might be asked to pay, say, about 2s. 6s. a week, or some small amount within his competence. The bil! contains no specific authority for the waiving of payment, which is a matter that would have to be done with the concurrence of the Treasurer and, ultimately, would have to be approved by the Auditor-General. A Minister cannot choose lightly to do such things. I can assure the honorable senator that the provisions of that clause will be applied very carefully, and its operation will be watched closely. The appliances referred to in this clause will very largely not be required after the periods of medical treatment and vocational training, although other medical appliance? such as artificial limbs, eyes and crutches may be permanent requisites that a man would need. </para>

It may well be that, as the scheme develops and we find what costs are involved, the whole  question  of repayment may be reconsidered. This bill is not the last word on the subject. I believe that the Senate will agree that it is wise not to embark too boldly on such schemes without some experience. I cannot imagine, for instance, that any one would require dentures to become efficient at work. I do not know of any one who works with his molars. There is a dental health scheme in operation in one of the States. Under chat scheme a miner was supplied with dentures. He found that they pinched just a little, and rather than go back to the dentist and perhaps lose a few days&#39; pay he &#34; accidentally &#34; dropped them on the coal face, put his pick through them, then asked for new dentures. We must take into consideration what happened in England following the launching of a similar scheme there. The authorities found that applications for appliances inch a3 spectacles and hearing aids exceeded the original estimate. We are watching developments in England. &#91; consider that the present conservative approach to the whole scheme is a wise one. </para>

Some time ago I raised in this chamber the question of the &#34;seeing eye&#34; dog. These dogs are of a particular breed. They have been trained to carry out, as well as they can, the function of leading blind persons about and have been of great assistance to such persons. An instance that I have in mind is that a blinded ex-serviceman <inline font-style="italic">who</inline> was provided with a dog of this breed,which became not only a great aid to himbut also a very great companion. I believe that in the United Kingdom and? America there are centres for the training of these dogs, which areallocated to blind people to -assist them tomove around without any other aid. I should like to know whether similar schemes could be organized in Australia for the benefit of blind persons. </para>

          <para>In reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Arnold</inline> I point out that people who are taken into this scheme must have the expectation, or qualification, that they can be fitted for industry within a period of two years. Therefore, a period of three years would not arise. Between the completion of medical treatment and vocational training, there should not be a period longer than two years. If it is found in practice that .a larger amount than &#163;20 is necessary, the matter can always be brought again to the Parliament, but in the meantime it can be dealt with by the Treasurer. Therefore, no practical difficulty will arise. Despite the limitation, nobody is likely to be denied really necessary equipment. </para>

The Department of Labour and National Service works closely in conjunction with the Department of Postwar Reconstruction in the provision of vocational training .for ex-service personnel. Although that work is primarily the responsibility of the Department of Post-war Reconstruction, the Department of Labour and National Service, as the former department&#39;s agent carries out the whole of the vocational training work. Instead of duplicating the facilities provided by the Department of Labour and National Service, the Department of Social Services, in the last few years, has been utilizing those facilities. We have been most careful to ensure that separateauthorities should not set up facilities of their own which would not function better that those already in existence. There is no overlapping, although different authorities are looking after persons coming under different schemes. </para>

That work is undertaken largely by the ladies who are our social welfare workers. &#34;We established that particular section in the department some years ago, and recently r secured approval to expand it considerably. Under a scheme of re-organization of the department the Public Service Board has approved the appointment of approximately 30 additional social wel- - fare workers. They are the people who sort out the mental problems of the various beneficiaries, whom they follow up in order to obviate maladjustments. Thus, machinery exists for the purpose mentioned by the honorable senator. The Department of Labour and National Service has its own welfare workers who follow up its trainees.

I think the reason for that arises from the fact that there is a medical examination by government officers in the first instance, and when necessary cases are then referred to a panel which includes medical men. Thus, if any views are expressed by the individual&#39;s private practitioner they are taken into account by people competent to assess their value. The fact that this power has been in the legislation since 1944 and I have not had one complaint about it is a good augury for its future administration.

              <para>- Yes ; but the problems of all persons should be capable of remedy within a period of two years. It is necessary to have their mental cooperation as well as providing them with physical treatment. If persons do not cooperate with the medical officers in the course mapped out for them it is not of much use persevering with them. </para>

            <para>.- I compliment the Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McKenna)</inline> on having introduced the measure, the benefits of which will not be confined to exservicemen and their dependants. I point out that because of the excellent co-ordination which exists between the Repatriation Commission, the Department of Labour and National Service, the Department of Health and the Department of Social Services and other governmental instrumentalities it is now possible to provide vocational training and employment for patients. The Minister may be pleased to learn that, a recent meeting, of approximately 100 blind industrial workers in Victoria which I attended adopted a resolution expressing its appreciation of the efforts, made by the. Government to improve their lot. </para>

          <para class="block">I mentioned earlier that I consider that the Government should concentrate on assisting the youth of. the country rather than the aged. However, the provision which I have just read apparently contemplates that aged persons are to receive the same benefits as younger persons. That is right in principle when time and circumstances permit wide distribution of benefits, but because of the present difficulty in obtaining accommodation for the treatment of patients and the shortage of; skilled attendants, I think that young patients should receive preference. I should like the Minister to explain exactly why the Government proposes to insert this provision in the bill. </para>

            <para>.Themeasure is intended, to.&#39; cover1 men o.f&#39; 65 years of age and over&#39; and women of 60 years and over. It is not intended that a married woman of 60 years of age shall be deprived of an age pension merely because her husband has noi! attained the age of 65 years. Her husband also may be aged 60 years, and his wife should not be debarred from receiving an age pension merely because her husband is undergoing rehabilitatory, treatment. In some instances married men whose wives are aged 60 years or more, may be incapacitated for periods of up to nine months because of. accidents and illness,, and in fairness to. their, wives the amounts paid to them as  rehabilita-tion.  allowance, fares and other benefit? should not be considered in assessing the joint income of husband and. wife. The value of benefits received by a husband are not to be calculated as family income so as to deprive a wife of the age pension to which she is entitled. I agree with the view expressed by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O&#39;sullivan)</inline> that the scheme should, concentrate on the improvement of youth, and in the course of the second-reading speech which I delivered I forecast that the next  social service measure to be introduced would probably be one to benefit adolescents, that is, persons&#39; of both sexes aged from 16&#39; to 25 years. The present measure is: intended to apply to men of 65 years and women of 60 years, and is intended to rehabilitate for&#39; economic usefulness people who would become &#38; permanent&#39; burden upon the Commonwealth if they did not receive special assistance. </para>

            <para>, - I appreciate the remarks made by the Minister for .Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McKenna),</inline> but I repeat that in my view it is preferable under present condition* to pay to a man aged 60 years a full pension and not worry about rehabilitation training, because we should concentrate our limited resources of materials and trained, man-power on the rehabilitation, of young people. A man aged 60 year? has not, ordinarily, a very long economic life before him, whereas young people may becomeadrainonthecommunity for therestoftheirlivesiftheydonot receiveproperassistance. </para>
