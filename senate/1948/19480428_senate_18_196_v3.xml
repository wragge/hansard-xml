                        <para>-There will be no delay in the introduction of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. Within the next three or four days, I shall make a full announcement on this matter. I am not aware that the British Medical Association has declined to co-operate in the scheme. I have not been advised by the federal council of the association that it intends to recommend that members of the association should not co-operate. I do not know the attitude of the federal council on the matter, but the latest advice that I have had from the president, Sir Henry Newland, rather indicates that members of the association are consider ing their position in the light of the Cabinet decisions that I conveyed to the council recently. I assure the honorable senator that in the very near future a statement of the Government's policy will be made. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator's question takes me completely by surprise because I have not the faintest knowledge of any such request having been made. It is a fact that the friendly societies dispensary movement has been exceedingly co-operative with the Government, particularly in view of the fact that its requests could not be met in full. I appreciate fully the co-operation of the executive officers of the movement. The honorable senator must have been misinformed, because I am certain that such information has not been sought by my department, particularly as it would serve no useful purpose whatsoever, so far as I can see, in connexion with the administration of pharmaceutical benefits. </para>

Did the ceremonial guard comprise 24 members of the Navy and the Air Force instead of the usual 36? Is it a fact that when the Department of the Army was approached for men for the guard,  an  Army spokesman said that equipment for the guard could be supplied, hut that trained men to carry out this duty were not available in the Brisbane area ? In view of reassuring statements issued by the Minister for the Army from time to time regarding enlistments in the Interim Army, can he explain why it was not possible to find twelve soldiers capable  of  performing this ceremonial guard duty? </para>

                        <para>- The Government, in collaboration with interested parties in the meat industry, has given this matter a good deal of consideration. It was considered that the price-fixing machinery in relation to mutton and beef would operate to the greater advantage of the people if the price of lamb were decontrolled. After exhaustive consideration by the Government and the Commonwealth Meat Controller, it was decided to decontrol the price of lamb for the time being. I have noticed with regret that the price of lamb has since been increased. The reasons stated by those responsible are that there is  an  acute shortage of supply, and that the price which the retailers have had to pay to the wholesalers has made inevitable an increase of the price charged to the public. It is hoped that the supply difficulties will be  overcome  shortly and that the price will then be reduced to a reasonable level. </para>

                        <para>I am reminded of a story an honorable senator told me and my colleagues in our party room. He said, "I got a letter yesterday. I am not going to answer it until to-day, and I shall not post it until to-morrow. In that way I will have found something to do for three days of this week anyhow ". From what we can see of our friends in the Senate, most of us would say that that would represent a fair week's work for most of them. </para>

                            <para>- The question might have been addressed to the Leader of the Opposition, who is in a better position than I am to answer it. I am positive that the statement quoted was not made by any senator supporting the Government. It should not be difficult to determine by whom the statement was made. I have always been fully occupied as a senator, and my correspondence has not been confined to one letter daily or one every three days. If any honorable senator considers that he has not sufficient parliamentary work to do, or is not gainfully employed, there is nothing to prevent him from resigning. He would not be missed by either honorable senators or the people of Australia. </para>

There was also a great deal of clamour when the Government was in charge of distribution and there was some agitation in favour of handing control back to the industry. I have referred many complaints to the tobacco distributing authorities with a view to obviating dissatisfaction as much as possible, and they have at all times indicated their willingness to do their utmost to meet the wishes of the public. The suggestion that the Government should again undertake the responsibility of distributing tobacco and cigarettes relates to government policy and therefore is a matter for decision by the Government. </para>

He has asked for the particulars of amounts expended by the Australian Government in payments to Western Australia for application to social service benefits for three years. I point out to the honorable substantial payments - amounting to senator that, pursuant to recommendations of the Commonwealth Grants Commission, the Commonwealth makes very hundreds of thousands of pounds per annum- to Western Australia. The amount granted each year includes a sum to enable the State to bring the level of its social services up to the average level of social services in the eastern States. In addition, specific amounts are paid to Western Australia for particular purposes as, for instance, the control of tuberculosis. A total sum was made available to Western Australia for the purpose of aiding sufferers from tuberculosis and their dependants, but I cannot say whether or not the whole of it has been expended. The money has certainly been made available by the Commonwealth. I shall obtain the exact particulars that the honorable senator seeks and let him have the information at an early date. </para>

                            <para>- Of the income of £3 a week received by the couple from superannuation, £2 would be treated as permissible income. The remaining £1 would be halved, 10s. being regarded as income of the husband, and the other 10s. as income of the wife. These sums would be deducted from the pension in each case, leaving £1 7s. 6d. a week each. This with the £3 superannuation would give a total income of £5 15s. a week. In all such cases the pension payments can be determined by bearing in mind that the total income shall not exceed £5 15s. a week. </para>

If so, what income will pensioners and recipients of other social services be permitted to earn before such earnings affect their social service payments?

                                <para>- The honorable senator's question relates, of course, to the abolition of the means test. The Government has already made its attitude to that matter quite clear. The problem is primarily, and almost solely, one of finance. It involves the expenditure of an additional £50,000,000 annually. On a number of occasions, the Government has indicated that its policy is to secure the abolition of the means test by the progressive amelioration of the income and property tests as circumstances permit. Each year the Government reviews the operation of the means test in the light of the existing financial position. Recently, the Prime. Minister intimated that further attention would be given to this matter when the next budget proposals were under consideration. Obviously, as the problem is primarily one of finance, it has a close relationship to budgetary provisions. Whilst I can assure the honorable senator that further consideration will be given to the abolition of the means test, I am not in a position to advise what change, if any, will he made in either the permissible income limit or the property bar. </para>

                                <para>- It is true that patients in approved private hospitals throughout Australia receive the hospital benefit of 6s. a day and it may be of interest to the honorable senator to know that more than 95 per cent, of the beds in private hospitals throughout Australia are provided for in the scheme. No particular rule can be laid down as to the amount which shall be paid to public hospitals as there are public hospitals conducted by various denominational bodies in addition to those which  are operated by the States. The Commonwealth pays to the States 6s. a day in respect of each patient occupying a bed. The amount paid to a particular institution depends upon what that institution had charged the public before the scheme was introduced. I understand that some hospitals receive from the State 12s. or 13s. a day, because prior to the commencement of the scheme they had collected that amount. For the same reason others receive a good deal less - 2s. or 3s. a day. The 6s. a day paid to the State is much move than most public hospitals formerly collected from their patients. The result is that out of the excess moneys the States are able to provide for considerable capital expenditure in respect of hospitals. </para>

Manila rope is also said to be unprocurable, and substitutes have to be used. Fishermen claim that these substitutes are unsatisfactory for use as mooring and running gear. Blocks, hook-lines and 4-strand coir rope are also in very short supply. Can the Minister give any indication as to when fishermen may expect supplies of those items to be made available? I point out that they are tools of trade to the fishermen. </para>

I notice that there has been a tendency lately for honorable senators to preface their questions with somewhat lengthy statements. That is not in accordance with the procedure of the Senate and I intend to adhere to the prescribed practice. Proceedings of this chamber are broadcast, and it is only fair that honorable senators who wish to ask questions of Ministers should not have their time  curtailed by other honorable senators unduly taking up the time of the Senate with lengthy questions. </para>

                            <para>- I am aware that there has been an outbreak of diphtheria in South Australia, but I have not seen the press report to which the honorable senator has referred. I assure him, however, that no application has been made by the Salisbury Council either to me or to my department for payment or help in connexion with the matter. As to the steps which the Commonwealth proposes to take in the circumstances he has mentioned, I point out that a few months ago, having regard to the need for immunization against diphtheria and whooping cough, I secured Cabinet approval to a proposal that when the pharmaceutical benefits scheme is implemented supplies of sera or vaccine will be made available free of charge to State governments, municipalities and public authorities which will conduct the immunization campaigns. The only condition will be that the campaigns shall be carried out with the approval of either the Commonwealth or the State health authorities. That is necessary to ensure the safety of the persons who are to be immunized, and also to eliminate waste. As a pharmaceutical benefits scheme will be introduced in the very near future, the honorable senator will realize that the Salisbury Council, in common with other municipalities throughout Australia, will be able to obtain its supplies of sera, or vaccine, or whatever is required, without any charge whatsoever. That might dispose of the problems confronting the Salisbury Council and enable it in the near future to include in its immunization campaign children at the particular camp mentioned by the honorable senator. </para>

                            <para>- Before the continuance of petrol rationing was decided upon, consideration was given to the use of petrol by private persons; it was suggested at one period that there should be complete prohibition of the use of petrol for private transport. The Government, however, was opposed to that although the British Government had prohibited the supply of petrol for private cars. That the Australian Government has adopted a sound scheme is shown by the fact that the British Government has again allocated petrol to private car users. No special allowance of petrol is made to bodies conducting motor races. Some people prefer a motor boat to a motor car or motor cycle, and it would be as unfair to deprive them of the use of their motor boats as it would be to deprive others of the use of their motor cars or motor cycles. Supplies of petro] are rationed to all consumers. </para>

                            <para>- I am fully prepared to make a thorough investigation of the distribution of sugar supplies throughout Australia, but I know some thing about this matter and I assure the honorable senator that the Government has no control over the distribution of sugar. Refined sugar is manufactured by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company Proprietary Limited in variousStates and by the Millaquin Sugar Company Limited in Queensland. There isa refinery in each State except Tasmania,, where the quantity of sugar consumed would not warrant the establishment of a refinery. Raw sugar would have to be shipped to Tasmania and then probably some of the refined product would have to be shipped back to the mainland. There have been complaints about the distribution of sugar in recent years Trouble has arisen from various causes. On one occasion we were able to obtain, the services of a naval vessel in order to transport sugar from Sydney to Victoria, where there was a shortage during the fruit-processing season. Honorablesenators are doubtless well aware of the reasons for the shortages of various products, including sugar, that haveoccurred from time to time. Consumption of sugar has increased considerably in. the last few years, and, for this reason,, refineries must work at almost full capacity all the time in order to satisfy the demand. As everybody knows, thework of the refineries has been dislocated because of shipping and other difficulties. The Minister for Shipping and Fuel isdealing with the problem of providing ships to transport large quantities of raw sugar from Queensland to refineries in the other States. ' I am sure that if raw sugar can be distributed to the refineries in reasonable quantities, thepublic will have no further difficulty in securing supplies of refined sugar. This matter has not escaped the attention of the Government, which is doing everything possible to provide the people with adequate supplies of sugar. </para>

However, my question related particularly to what appears to be discrimination in the distribution of sugar by wholesalers to retailers. In some centres &amp; few retailers have ample supplies of sugar whilst their competitors have insufficient stocks to meet the needs of their customers. It appears that sugar is being used for the purpose of restricting the trading operations of various retailers. </para>

"Wholesalers purchase sugar from the refineries in the usual course of trade. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company Proprietary Limited is a big private concern and the Government has no power to control its method of distributing sugar. However, I shall investigate this subject because I consider it essential that the people should be served efficiently by an important industry of this nature.

                        <para>With a view to ensuring that the most modern form of treatment is provided for ex-servicemen suffering from war neurosis and mental illnesses, the Repatriation Department has appointed Dr. Alan Stoller as its specialist in medical psychology. Dr. Stoller has spent most of his post-graduate career in institutions devoted to the care of patients suffering from mental disorders. He received a diploma in psychological medicine before coining to Australia before the war. After his release from the forces he proceeded to England at his own expense to undertake a post-graduate refresher course in modern techniques.  His  status in the profession is disclosed by the fact that he has just delivered, at the Melbourne University, the Beattie Smith Memorial Lecture. </para>
                        <para>The aim of the Psychiatric Service of the Repatriation Commission is to deal with cases at the earliest possible stage, and the present out-patient facilities throughout the Commonwealth are being expanded. It is hoped to prevent cases from developing, and the provision of the most up-to-date methods of mental hygiene will contribute to this end. Where necessary, the Repatriation General Hospitals are used to administer modern therapies, including shock treatment. In many cases treatment is largely a matter of team work on the part of trained experts, comprising the patient's doctor, a clinical psychologist, the skilled nursing staff, the occupational therapists, the psychiatric social workers and the education and training officers. For acute cases of mental disorder, admission to a repatriation mental hospital may be necessary, but the patient will be returned to the Repatriation General Hospital for out-patient treatment as soon as possible, with a view to re-establishing him as an effective cog in the social machine. In certain cases brain surgery is applied. </para>
                        <para>Facilities for group interests are provided for in-patients, such as picture shows, concerts and so on, and education and training officers arrange interesting discussions and provide educational facilities whilst social workers maintain direct contacts with the patients' families. Many recoveries occur in even difficult cases, and the existing method of management will certainly increase the numbers of these recoveries. </para>

                        <para>.- In view of the present acute shortage of timber on the mainland I draw the attention of the Minister for Shipping and Fuel <inline font-weight="bold">('Senator Ashley)</inline> to the fact that approximately 30,000,000 super, feet of seasoned and partly seasoned timber is stacked in Tasmania. As I have no doubt that the Government will require large quantities of timber in its defence projects I urge it to investigate the suitability of that timber for such purposes. Whilst the building industry is clamouring for materials generally, particularly timber, Tasmanian timber merchants are unable to shift these huge stocks because of the shortage of shipping. In view of the high prices prevailing for timber they are doing everything in their power to obtain ship ping, but so far have not been successful. Because they are obliged to hold such large stocks, many of these merchants are rapidly nearing the end of their financial resources. For instance, one small company has timber to the value of £250,000 stacked and racked, and is unable to shift it. I am fully aware of the shortage of shipping, but I urge the Government to do something to relieve the position of these timber merchants. While the timber is held in stock there is always the possibility that much of it may be destroyed by fire. Considerable loss has been caused by fire in the past in similar circumstances. A bush-fire may sweep through the areas in which the timber yards are situated, or a fire arising from carelessness on the part of persons in the area may destroy timber stacked in the open. The Government should investigate the suitability of this timber for use in its defence projects. In any event, as timber is so urgently needed on the mainland for building purposes, every effort should be made to provide ships to lift this timber. Steps should be taken to ensure a fairer allocation among timber merchants of the limited shipping that is available, because whilst some merchants are able to forward their timber to the mainland because they are financially interested in shipping companies the remainder are unable to ship any of their stocks at all. </para>

                            - The problem of providing ships for the transport of timber from Tasmania to the mainland has been raised in this chamber on previous occasions. I believe that in the circumstances the present system is the fairest that can be devised. Requirements are determined by the Controller of Timber in each State whilst the allocation of timber available from Tasmania is made by the Controller of Timber in that State.
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett</inline>
                            has said that whilst some timber merchants are able to ship portion of their stocks others are unable to obtain any transport whatever. The allocation of the shipping available is the responsibility of private enterprise. As the honorable senator is aware, most of the shipping has been derequisitioned. As the Timber Controller in each State determines what timber is required in his State and the Controller in Tasmania decides what timber shall be sent after receiving requisitions from the States, I cannot see how any particular firm could get an advantage. If the honorable senator will give me details of the matter-
