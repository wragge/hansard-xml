            <para>- I have here a petition from the Most Rev. the Archbishop of Sydney, praying that a clause be inserted in the Papua (British New Guinea) Bill prohibiting the importation of intoxicating drink from the Possession. I find, however, on reference to the  Clerk,  that exception is taken to the petition inasmuch as it does not include the surname of the Archbishop of Sydney. It is signed &#34; W. S. Sydney &#34; instead of &#34; W. S. Smith, Metropolitan Archbishop of Sydney.&#34; As this petition comes from the head of the Church of England in Australia, according to the title by which he is recognised, I ask honorable senators to consent to so much of the Standing Orders being suspended as will enable the petition to be presented. I therefore move - </para>

            <para>- Perhaps I ought to explain to the Senate that the  Clerk  considered it to be his duty not to certify to this petition as being correct. The ground that he takes is that by our Standing Orders a petition must be signed by a person, and that this petition is signed with the name &#34; Sydney &#34; ; there being no such person, &#34; Sydney &#39; &#39; being a title. In consequence of the decision given in the Colenso case, and in other cases, by the Privy Council, it has been understood that there are no Archbishops or Bishops in this Commonwealth, in the strict acceptance of those terms, there being no established church here. But it is a question for the Senate to decide whether the Standing Orders shall be suspended or not. </para>

            <para>- I would point out that, although there does not seem to be any great objection to the acceptance of this petition in itself, to suspend the Standing Orders would be to establish a precedent, which might be very unwise. This petition is irregular. It emanates from a very important person, and one for whom we have a very high regard. But we may have irregular petitions in the future from other persons, and the precedent of suspending the Standing Orders to enable irregular petitions to be received may lead to motions of this kind being made in future in connexion with petitions concerning which there is some doubt. I think it an unwise thing to do. Personally, I do not believe that any great &#39;harm will follow if the petition is not received. We all know that it is forwarded by this gentleman in a representative capacity, and, having that knowledge, full justice will be done even if the petition is not accepted. </para>

            <para>- I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould,</inline> out of regard for the Standing Orders, will withdraw this petition until it is properly presented. It is only in cases of very grave necessity that we should suspend the Standing Orders. That course is usually taken for the purpose of enabling the business of the country to be carried &#39;on more expeditiously. This petition will neither hasten nor delay the business of the country which is before Parliament at the present time. &#163;0 far as concerns its influence upon members of the Senate, I think that every honorable senator knowing the circumstances will have just as much respect for the petition sought to be presented at the instance of the Archbishop as they would have if it were duly presented in a regular form. I therefore hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> will withdraw his motion. </para>

            <para>.  - I should like to point out to my honorable and&#39; learned friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould,</inline> that the petition - if I may refer to it as such, for the purposes of discussion - merely brings, under the notice of the Senate a resolution passed by the Synod of the Church of England in Sydney. That resolution is conveyed to the notice of the Senate, and consideration will undoubtedly be given to it. It being within our knowledge that the resolution has been passed, it is not absolutely necessary that the petition should be formally received. With regard to the point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> I confess that I entirely as;ree with him. We know perfectly well that no Bishops, in the sense of their having any territorial or diocesan-  jurisdiction, or having the right to use the name of their See, are recognised in the Commonwealth of Australia by our Government or by the Imperial authorities. They are recognised as &#34; The Right Rev. So-and-so.&#34; It is as well to adhere to that position, or we may establish a regrettable precedent. </para>

            <para>-If the objection to receive this petition is simply that the document is signed by the Archbishop of Sydney with his usual signature, it is very ungracious. I can quite understand the  Clerk  not feeling himself bound to accept a petition so signed, and he has very properly referred it to the Senate. I have no fault to find with that. But if the Senate refuses to admit the petition because it is so signed, it will do a very ungracious act. The petition practically comes from and embodies a resolution of the Synod of the Church of England in New South Wales. If the Archbishop had thought that he was contravening our Standing Orders by signing the petition in this way, I have no doubt that he would have adopted another method. </para>

            <para>- I am sure that the Archbishop of Sydney is too broad-minded a man to misinterpret the action of the Senate in upholding its Standing Orders. It may appear to be an ungracious thing on our part not to receive the petition ; but I would1 ask honorable senators whether they would accept, my signature as &#34;W.G. Queensland,&#34; if I attached it in that form to any Bill passed by the Committee? In my opinion,, the Senate is indebted to the  Clerk  of theParliaments for calling our&#39; attention to thematter. I am sure .that no harm will bedone. The Attorney-General put thematter in a very proper form, when he informed <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> that the attention of the Senate has been directed to the resolution carried by the Synod in Sydney. </para>

It -would be a wise and a gracious thing if we were to find some way out of this difficulty, it being understood that our action on this, occasion should not constitute a precedent, and that the Senate desire that the Standing Orders as they exist shall in future be strictly observed. </para>

It seems to me that we are taking a very red-tapish  course in this matter. We all know that the worthy clergyman who has signed thispetition has signed it in his official capacity, and without any intention to bring himself into conflict with the Standing Orders. If we carry out the very letter of the Standing Orders, we shall be departing from the spirit of them. The Archbishop will nodoubt have effected his purpose, whether we accept the petition or not ; but it has tobe remembered that the right of petition is always regarded as a very sacred one and we should not therefore refuse to any &#39; person through any mere informality the right to put his case before the Senate. It must be remembered that the Papua Bill will probably be dealt with this evening, and if the petition is not presented to-day. the full effect of it may be lost. We ought to have it before us when the Bill is in Committee. If, however, the motion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> is not to be accepted unani- mously,  I hope that the honorable and learned senator will see his way clear to withdraw it. </para>

            <para>- Quite apart from the duty of upholding our Standing Orders, it appears to me that there is a constitutional reason why we cannot accept the petition in its present form. A little while ago, there was some agitation, and some bad blood arose, between the various religious &#39;organizations as to the precedence of their heads at social and political functions. The Senate should be very careful not to participate in anything of that kind. Our Constitution lays down the principle that all religions are equal in our eyes. I hold that, according to section 116 of the Constitution, if we were to accept the petition in its present form we should, to a certain extent, be defeating the object of the section, which says - </para>

I hold that the constitutional reason is sufficient to justify us in rejecting the petition in its present form ; but, at the same time, I do not believe that there is any honorable senator who has any objection whatever to the petition except on account of the manner in which it is signed. </para>

I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> in urging on <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> to withdraw the motion for the suspension of the Standing Orders. There is nothing more certain than that if the Archbishop had had the faintest idea that the adoption of his usual form of signature was not in accordance with the Standing Orders, he would have signed the document in another way ; and no one more than the Archbishop must regret this debate, even so far as it has gone. Not merely for our own sakes, but for the sake of the Archbishop, I urge that the motion should be withdrawn, and the petition presented in another form. </para>

            <para>- I join in urging <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> to withdraw the motion. That honorable senator must realize the awkward position in which he will place the Senate if a division be taken.

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lt.-Col.</inline>GOULD (New South Wales). - I made the request to the Senate for the suspension of the Standing Orders, in the belief that I could rely on the courtesy of honorable senators. I did not regard the motion as one which would cause any dissension, but, of course, when I find that a number of honorable senators are opposed to the suspension of the Standing Orders, I shall not insist on a division. It is well, if there is a desire to have the Standing Orders suspended for any specific purpose, that there should be the consent of the Senate as a whole. But really honorable senators are making a great deal too much of this matter. The Standing Orders simply provide that every petition shall bear a signature on the face of it ; but now technical objection is taken to this gentleman being designated not by his surname, but by the name of his See. </para>

              <para>- By statutory law in New South Wales, the Archbishop of Sydney is recognised as holding property, and in every other respect &#62; and he had perfect justification for signing the petition in this way. If there has been any irregularity, I am, of course, bound to accept the responsibility. Even if there were only two or three honorable senators averse to the suspension of the Standing Orders, I should not be prepared to go to a division. I hope, however, that honorable senators will bear in mind that, if in the future, they should desire the Standing Orders to be&#39; suspended for their own convenience, they may find some little objection and difficulty raised. If honorable senators take up the position that the suspension of the Standing Orders shall be refused on all occasions&#39;, I am with them. I now ask leave to withdraw the motion, and I express my regret that it should have been submitted, and that I have been unable to obtain that courtesy which I expected. </para>

          <para>- -I think the Attorney-General was very severe on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> R. Craig when this motion was last before the Senate. The chief objection of the honorable and learned senator to having a <inline font-style="italic">precis</inline> made of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Craig&#39;s</inline> statement, appeared to be that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Craig</inline> had on various occasions applied for a position in the Commonwealth Service. The fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Craig</inline> did not obtain such a position does not prove in any way that he is a man to whom the Attorney-General, or any other member of the Ministry, should not pay attention when he writes a number of intelligent letters, which, though not couched, in every case, in the language which the Attorney-General might use, contained very serious statements concerning the administration of New Guinea. My object in asking that a <inline font-style="italic">freds</inline> of this correspondence should be prepared was to make Members of the Federal Parliament better acquainted with New Guinea affairs, so that they might be better equipped for legislating in regard to the Possession. The Attorney-General has taken up a very strong attitude in opposition, to the motion, and he appears to have a considerable number of supporters-; and under the circumstances, I should like honorable senators to bear with me, while I give a short <inline font-style="italic">precis</inline> of some of the statements of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Craig.</inline> In one of his letters that gentleman refers to certain atrocities, as he describes them, in the Louislade Archipelago. It appears that in those islands the custom is to allow the natives to obtain goods on credit, payment being demanded in gold. The accounts are kept, and if the natives fail to pay, they are charged exorbitant interest, and very harsh measures are used towards them. It appears that certain persons actually arrested natives for the non-payment of accounts, and tried them for the offence in the storekeeper&#39;s house. In one case, they actually imprisoned a native who failed to pay, 300 feet below the&#39; surface in a mine, and handcuffed to a truck, 1 all night. It appears that this unfortunate native lost his reason, and for some three years he wandered about the island in a half-witted manner until death put an end to his unhappy condition. It would appear also that these people, unauthorized, ventured to administer a flogging to the natives because they failed to pay their accounts. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Craig</inline> states that the only punishment that was ever inflicted upon persons guilty of these offences ,was to deprive one of the .members of the firm of his1 commission as a justice of the peace and of his authority to &#34;sign on &#34; natives. Subsequent to the cancellation of his commission, as a justice of the peace, this man continued to sign on boys for his own firm. The firm had some hundreds of natives employed, and they were signed for the period of three years, which was against the law, at a rate of wages of is. a month and rations. It appears, further, that they forcibly recruited natives, and sent them to places 200 miles from their homes to work for the firm. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Craig,</inline> whose statements have been challenged by the Attorney-General, is borne out by one of the Government officials in an official report, which is to this effect - </para>

        <para>At Sudest certain abuses are cropping up, the result of the objectionable system of giving goods on credit to the natives, which was introduced by these traders a few years ago. Perhaps, when gold was fairly plentiful and easy to obtain, matters went smoothly enough, but now, when the gold is worked out, these&#34; traders have awakened to the fact that they stand to lose a considerable sum if the native cannot meet his liability, and at times they adopt measures of an illegal character in the endeavour to urge the native to greater efforts in his search for gold. The traders who were indicated are Messrs. Mahony, Patrick Carby, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Clyde Mahony, Justice of the Peace,&#39; a qualified officer for the Possession. </para>

          <para>These leaseholds originally applied for by genuine practical miners were withheld by the magistracy, with the connivance of the Executive Council, until such time as members of the magistracy and of the corrupt Customs gang were able to lodge applications and communicate with southern brokers with a view to gigantic exploitation schemes. </para>

          <para>It is strange and a painful fact that, although members of the New Guinea governing executive can get big estates around Port Moresby, and the deeds handed to them at once, we here on Woodlark gold-field - a field of some ten years&#39; standing, and supposed to be regulated by the Queensland Mining Act - cannot get a homestead lease of an acre to build a hut on. </para>

              <para>- It is the duty of the Government, if they know ofthese things, to investigate them. The object of the <inline font-style="italic">precis,</inline> as has been stated frequently, is to get an inquiry into the administration of affairs in the island. Both the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General, I think, have refused to give an inquiry. If a question is asked about the treatment of. the natives, the Prime Minister says he does not consider it necessary to appoint a special advocate for the natives, that a new Administrator has been appointed, and it is his duty to act for them. The same unsatisfactory reply is received to any inquiry concerning these other matters. I have had a conversation with at least one missionary from New Guinea, who tells me that the charges and statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Craig</inline> are matters of common report throughout the Possession. With reference to the Gibara raid of April, 1901, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Craig</inline> says it is the case of a native, who was supposed to have stolen a box, containing gold, from a man named Woolfe - </para>

            <para>A certain officer, with a posse of about twenty members of the armed native constabulary, took Sipilia and other prisoners with him to Milne </para>
            <para>Bay, and he specially invited several diggers to accompany him in a general raid upon the peaceful natives. During the three days&#39; duration of the Gibara raid, Sipilia was led about in irons under the charge of the chief warder, Tauakina. The gold was not recovered, and there was no charge whatever against Sipilia, but he was hated intensely by Symons and certain diggers as being a missionary spy. The officer arranged with four white men that they should execute Sipilia. He instructed Tauakina to hand Sipilia over to the four white men, instructing them if the boy did not find the gold to &#34; remove &#34; him. The four men led Sipilia further into the bush, knocked the irons off him, so as to leave no mark of identification, and shot him dead without any legal form of trial whatever. </para>

              <para>- The honorable and learned senator complains of the language used in the letters, but he should remember that men who lead a pioneering life of that kind are not always in the habit of using the language to be found in Shakespeare. They may be like certain bullock drivers mentioned in a humorous article written by a member of this Parliament. Concerning a certain gentleman, he wrote, &#34;a finished orator, the bullock drivers repeat his phrases to this day.&#34; The Attorney-General should excuse the extravagant language of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Craig,</inline> and not dismiss his statements because he is not as polite as he himself invariably is. The honorable and learned senator said that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Craig</inline> had been charged with a very serious offence. He would not allow that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Craig</inline> was innocent, because he said no verdict has been passed upon him. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Craig</inline> claims that there has been no trial, and that the officials will not bring him to trial because they cannot prove his guilt. </para>

              <para>- There may be a certain amount of misdirected zeal. Since he spoke to me about this matter at Townsville, in November last, I have repeatedly told <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Craig</inline> that he would get a great deal more consideration if he would refrain from using extravagant language. But that is no reason why his statements should be dismissed as unworthy of credence. The Attorney-General could instruct one of his officers to make a short <inline font-style="italic">precis ;</inline> it may be as short as the Government wish, so long as it will give honorable senators an idea of the maladministration in the Possession. <inline font-weight="bold">&#34;Mr. Craig</inline> points out that, through Customs leakages, a great deal of revenue is lost. Because he has happened to apply for a position in the Public Service of the Com- monwealth, and has not succeeded, surely that is no reason why we should refuse to listen to the statements he is prepared to make. I understand that he is willing to make an affidavit concerning a great number of the charges he has made, and he claims that other charges can be substan tiated by witnesses who are either in the Possession or in the Commonwealth. </para>

            <para>. - When my remarks were terminated last week, I was about to refer to some of the evidence given as to the qualifications of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> as a military officer. But before I proceed to discuss that point&#39;, I desire to make one or two remarks in addition to what I said upon two points in particular, because there seems to be some dissent from my criticisms. First, with  regard to the reasons advanced by MajorGeneral Hutton for having selected <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> for retrenchment, I stated that the real reason that had been stated by Major-General Hutton was that he was called upon to retrench, and that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> was an officer whose services could be dispensed with, with less detriment to th&#60;&#187; military service of the Commonwealth, than was the case with some other officers. The statement was challenged by my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson.</inline> It is a very important matter, and, therefore, I need not apologize for referring to it again. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson</inline> said that MajorGeneral Hutton had not put that point forward as a reason. I intend to refer to certain passages in the evidence to show that he did put it forward as a reason. It is important, because it confirms the view which I take, and have previously expressed, that the statement, taken from the letter of the 14th November, did not constitute the reasons for the retrenchment of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll.</inline> I again refer honorable senators to the letter of the 14th November, and will show that that letter does not state that any of the statements made in it are reasons advanced by Major-General Hutton for the retrenchment of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll.</inline> The General Officer Commanding had been called upon in a private letter from the Minister of Defence, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, to give him some particulars about <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll,</inline> and in the last sentence the Minister says - </para>

Honorable senators have been invited to take the view that these statements were reasons advanced by Major-General Hutton for the retrenchment of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll.</inline> But it is clear from the letter that they were not the reasons, and <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> himself has never advanced the contention that they were. </para>

The Minister wrote to Major-General Hutton, asking for particulars, and saying that he desired- to have good grounds for his action &#34; in Carroll&#39;s and all other similar cases.&#34; Major-General Hutton, in reply, gave the Minister the history of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll&#39;s</inline> case. It is quite a distortion of his letter to say that every  passage in it contains a reason for the retrenchment of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll.</inline></para>

              <para>- I have run through the whole of the statements, and expressed my opinion regarding them, and I do <inline font-style="italic">not</inline> suppose that the honorable senator wishes me to deal with them <inline font-style="italic">seriatim</inline> once more. I do intend, however, once more to refer to one of the statements in view of the interjections - not generally improper interjections - which I heard when I was speaking on the last occasion. Before I pass from the present point, however, I wish to refer honorable senators to the evidence given by my late colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, who was then Minister of Defence. In the evidence of the right honorable gentleman, the following occurs : -  6287. Would that be prior to the 12th November, 1902, on which date you wrote to the General Officer Commanding the letter which appears on page 15 of the Minutes of Evidence? - I note that that is a private letter from me, but, in this instance, I have no objection to its being produced. The letter was not intended for any one but the General Officer Commanding, and it will be seen from the same page of the evidence that he wrote me a private and confidential letter in reply. Those letters should never have been produced. I do not say that as objecting to the production of the letters, but merely to intimate that they were nol written with a view to publication. </para>

          <para class="block">It was that letter, written in order to give the Minister confidential information, that was divided up by the Committee and regarded as containing separate reasons advanced for the retrenchment of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll.</inline> This debate might go on for ever if we continued going over the same ground. But I desire to say a few words in regard to statement G, to which honorable senators opposite evidently attach a good deal, of importance. That statement is to the effect that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> was appointed to the Queensland permanent staff after he had made himself useful to the then Premier, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Hugh</inline> Nelson, and it seems not only to have hurt the feelings of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll,</inline> but to have been taken rather to heart by some of the members of the Select Committee. Of course, it is admitted that there was no foundation for the statement that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Hugh</inline> Nelson had been approached in the  matter, or had made the appointment. But, when speaking about the rumour which was undoubtedly current in Queensland at the time, and which was reproduced by the General Officer Commanding in his remarks - though he may have been in error as to details - I understood honorable senators opposite to say that there was no evidence that there had ever been any such rumour. I think it was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> who said that nearly every witness in Queensland had been examined with a view to find out whether they had heard of the rumour. I think the honorable senator is wrong, because I went through the evidence, though certainly not word for word, and I found that the only officer who was asked the question was Lt.-Col. Thynne. </para>

              <para>- I s&#39;hall quote what the General Officer Commanding said in his evidence. Se was being asked at the time by the Minister what <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll&#39;s</inline> qualifications were, and he replied that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> had served three years on probation in Queensland, and had not distinguished himself particularly. The General Officer Commanding went on to say that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> was afterwards re-appointed to the Permanent Staff, and it seemed almost necessary to account in some way for such an officer receiving an appointment of the kind. The General Officer Commanding would no doubt want to know the reason, and he would make inquiries, and in writing a private and confidential letter to the Min ister he would, to the best of his memory, relate what had been told him by his officers. </para>

            <para>It appeared that in February, 1899, Captain Carroll was appointed to the Permanent Staff of the Military Forces of Queensland. The reasons of the appointment were unknown, but it was stated to me that his appointment was made by the then Premier of Queensland, acting, probably, on representations of a favorable naturemade in regard to this officer.  and so on. The following is an extract from the evidence on page 35 -  356. Who is responsible for the statement that he &#34;made himself useful to the then Premier of Queensland &#34; ? - The whole of the officers whom I consulted ; but their impressions may have been&#187; wrong. I merely give the statement for what it is worth. It is the explanation which was offered for the. return of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> to the Queensland Permanent Forces. 357. Amongst those officers you include  Colonel Ricardo,  Lt.-Col. Aytoun,  and Lt.-Col.  Plomer?  - Yes, they were all in Brisbane at the time of my visit, and I have not the slightest doubt but that they will tell the Committee exactly the same thing as myself. There was no imputation that anything improper had occurred in the matter of his re-appointment. </para>

              <para>- The honorable senator harps on that point, but I say again that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> was not retrenched on rumour. This statement is included in a confidential document, which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir .</inline> John Forrest has said should never have been produced, and which was&#39; written in order to put the Minister in the position occupied by the officer who recommended the retrenchment. Major-General Hutton was called upon to retrench, and after he made inquiries of officers in Brisbane, he came to the conclusion that, in the circumstances, <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll,</inline> with another, were the. proper officers to be retrenched. I propose now to read evidence given by the same witness under examination in chief by the  chairman  at question 4196 - </para>

          <para>You never said it ? - No. I thought that simply as an old Queenslander he had gone to see <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Hugh</inline> Nelson in London, and had pled his cause. I never associated the story with anything of that sort. </para>

              <para>- No; he had made application for an appointment to the Permanent Staff, but when he heard of this  appointment, he&#39; was very much surprised. Is it any wonder, therefore, that officers who had continued in the Queensland Defence Force all the time, and who were, perhaps, looking with longing eyes to a position of that kind, should be surprised at the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll,</inline> should have looked round for some reason for that appointment, and that the idea should get about, as I put it myself in speaking, that he had &#34; a friend at court.&#34; That seems to me to be a reasonable explanation of the rumour. <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> says that he did not use or attempt to use any political or other influence to secure the appointment. We may accept that statement without qualification, and agree that the appointment came to him in the way he has stated. But there is still left the almost unavoidable impression upon one&#39;s mind that there was some &#34; friend at court,&#34; who was saying a good word for <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll.</inline></para>

              <para>- I shall say a word about that now, in consequence of a remark made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs,</inline> which was I think unfair to  Colonel Plomer,  and which was to the effect that a statement made by that officer that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> had never passed his lieutenant&#39;s artillery examination then, or at any time, was incorrect. I believe the honorable senator endeavoured to show that it must be incorrect on account of something which  Colonel Plomer  had himself said afterwards. It is a very curious thing that there should be all this disp&#39;ute and doubt about such a matter. <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll,</inline> in his evidence with regard to his examination, says that it has been twice denied that he passed his examination as captain. A matter of that kind should be so absolutely clear on the records that when we find that there is any doubt or dispute in connexion with it, we are justified in seeking for the reason for the doubt. If we do that, I think we shall find on the evidence that the statement in  Colonel Plomer&#39;s  letter, which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> has characterized as untrue, is, strictly speaking and technically, correct. I have no desire in dealing with this matter to do any injustice whatever to <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll.</inline> I have gone through the evidence very carefully, and have tried to arrive at a correct conclusion upon the subject. I find, on page 274, from Appendix 34, that this officer passed his examination for lieutenant in subjects A and B, and unless the practice has been considerably changed - and I do not think it can have been, because it is laid down in the regulations - I do not believe that includes any special examination in artillery. Subject A deals with regimental duties^ and B with ordinary drill. </para>

              <para>-  I do not know in what connexion the statement was made. The fact is that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> afterwards, while in Queensland, passed part of the examination for captain. He then visited England, performed certain service there, and passed some examination before a Board of Officers in artillery. There is no doubt about that. But technically, <inline font-weight="bold">Major C.arroll</inline> had not then passed his examination, because the part of the examination he had gone through in Queensland,coupled with the examination he passed in England, did not constitute a &#34; pass &#34; under the Queensland Defence Act. That is shown by a letter from Major-General Owen, who was Commandant of Queensland at the time. I do not quote this letter as containing anything to the discredit of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll;</inline> but only in order to show that the statement by  Colonel Plomer  that he had not passed an artillery examination, is not to be set aside as an untruthful statement. On page 20, the following letter from. Major-General John F. Owen, who was Commandant of the Queensland Defence Forces at thetime, to the Chief Secretary, who was the head of the State Defence Department, will be found : - </para>

              <para>- He did not know of it at the time, and I am merely pointing out that it was not fair of the honorable senator to characterize.  Colonel Plomer&#39;s  statement as being inaccurate. Holding the opinion that the one reason given for the retrenchment of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> is that he was the officer who could be spared with least detriment to the Force, I consider that the Committee appointed should have made inquiry to ascertain that. A Committee of the Senate is not the best possible tribunal to decide such a matter. I hold the opinion, which I expressed when the Committee was appointed, that a question of that kind should have been submitted to. two or three military experts, who could decide the relative merits of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> and the five or six other officers whose names have been mentioned.. The General Officer Commanding might have made a mistake, because we are all liable to errors of judgment, which are exposed by the light of information subsequently obtained. If the General Officer Commanding had made a mistake as to certain other officers, who could have been retrenched with less detrimentto the service, a board of that kind would be able to find out the fact, and pass an authoritative opinion upon it, to which the Government would no doubt pay the highest respect. But this Committee, unfortunately, seems to have considered it to be its duty to inquire into certain charges against <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll.</inline> In the course of the inquiry, as I have already pointed out, evidence was given in regard to other officers whose names were mentioned in comparison with <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll,</inline> and as I have pointed out, Captain Niesigh was actually prevented from cross-examining  Colonel Tom  Price, on the ground, as stated by the  Chairman,  that  Colonel Price,  being an officer of great experience and ability, it was quite sufficient when he said that, in his opinion, the officers whom he named should have been retrenched before <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll.</inline> I shall have to quote from the evidence of one or two officers, in order to show the military character of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll,</inline> and what his reputation was as an officer. </para>

              <para>- I will refer to the evidence of the officers whom, no doubt, Major-General Hutton consulted, . and the Senate can judge for itself. <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> was first of al&#39;l attached to A Battery as a militia officer for the three years, from 1888 to 1891. The following is a letter written by  Colonel  Plomer  to Colonel Hoad, the Chief Staff Officer. It is printed on page 34 of the evidence. - </para>

            <para>With reference to your letter <inline font-style="italic">re</inline> Captain Carroll. </para>
            <para>Captain Carroll&#39;s service in the Permanent Artillery was long before my time, but from confidential papers in my possession I can give you the following &#39;facts : He joined in January, 1888. In November,  ii 880,  he was placed under arrest by the Commandant,  Colonel French,  on a complaint by <inline font-weight="bold">Major De</inline> Voeux, D.A.A.G., regarding conduct towards him. A Court of Inquiry was held, and  Colonel French  withdrew the recommendation he had made to the Chief Secretary, that Acting-Lieutenant Carroll&#39;s appointment in the Permanent Artillery should be confirmed, and he never served in it except as a probationer. He, however, continued as a provisional Lieutenant, and I find from the records that on 3rd January, 1890, <inline font-weight="bold">Major Grieve,</inline> R.A., commanding the Permanent Artillery, made a report to the Brigade <inline font-weight="bold">Major that</inline> he was dissatisfied with the way in which Lieutenant Carroll, attached to the -battery under his command, performed his duties, specifying one or two minor irregularities, and stating that he had had to find fault with him on several occasions. The matter was investigated, and Lieutenant Carroll was placed under open arrest (second occasion), and dealt with by the Commandant by written warning. </para>
            <para>On the 2nd May, 1S90, Captain Byron reported him for not promptly obeying a verbal order. For this he was reprimanded by the officer commanding the battery, <inline font-weight="bold">Major Jackson.</inline> While I have been serving in Queensland, Lieutenant Carroll was for most of the time absent in South Africa, and while he was here he was Adjutant to an infantry regiment in the North. I had no fault to find with him during these two months.  Colonel Byron,  had he been here, would have been able to throw more light on his military capacity, but I do not think I am doing Captain Carroll any injustice in stating that, from conversations I have had with  Colonel Byron,  he had little opinion of him as a useful officer, and it was on this account, I have been always led to understand, that Lieutenant Carroll thought it preferable to return to England. This he did, and, as the correspondence regarding him in your office shows, he was for years absent from Queensland in England, and undoubtedly while there, he was attached at various times to various arms of the service. It was on this account, through his showing zeal, that he got a chance of again being employed. From the little I know of him, I am afraid I have not a high opinion of his capacity. Zeal may be all right, but we are not all favoured with the same amount of brains, and one must have some to make a Staff Officer of any use. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That seems a very severe statement, and I should, in fairness, petition that  Colonel  Plomer  said in his evidence afterwards, that the idea which he intended to convey was not that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> was destitute of brains, but that he had not sufficient ability for a field officer.

          <para class="block">Perhaps at this point I may refer to the evidence of Lt.-Col. Spencer Browne at page 206 of the evidence. It is fair to say that Lt.-Col. Spencer Browne holds a very high opinion of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll,</inline> and explains that the very strong feeling expressed against him by Lt.-Col. Aytoun  was partly due to Lt.-Col.  Aytoun&#39;s  preference for Imperial officers as against Colonial officers. At question 5Z42 Lt.-Col. Spencer Browne is examined as follows: - </para>

              <para>- Lt.-Col. Spencer Browne, as I said before, speaks highly of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll,</inline> and cites his evidence in fairness to that gentleman, and as partly explaining Lt.-Col. Aytoun&#39;s  feelings. It has been said that Lt.-Col.  Aytoun  gave a certificate as to the conduct of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll,</inline> when it was a question of his being granted a gratuity of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;100,</inline> and that he stated that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll&#39;s</inline> services had been very satisfactory. But we have other evidence,&#34; which shows that Lt.-Col. Aytoun&#39;s  opinion of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> was certainly adverse. Going back to the evidence of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Deacon,</inline> at question 614 he is examined as follows : - </para>

          <quote>
            <para>What report did you make to the General Officer Commanding when he consulted you at Cambooya ? - The same report that I have made to you, namely, that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> was useless as an officer on active service. </para>
            <para class="block">Then, at question 685, in connexion with <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll&#39;s</inline> appointment to the command of a squadron - </para>
            <para>Then he belonged to the regiment? - I was not quite sure about that. <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> reported to me as having been on leave, and having re-joined the regiment. I told him I had no place for him, and that I did not want him, and he then said something about his being entitled to an appointment as second in command. I told him that the recommendation for that appointment rested with me, and that I certainly could not recommend him. In fact, it was not until two days after he reported to me that I took him on the strength of the regiment again. I think he rejoined on the nth, and on the 13th he was posted to the command of the squadron. </para>
            <para>How did you come to place him in. command of a squadron? - The Officer Commanding my corps,  Colonel Jefferies,  told me that I &#39;had better find some place for him. I explained the position that I was in, and that I did not want <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll.</inline> The reason I appointed him squadron leader was because, apart from myself, he was really the senior officer in the regiment. </para>

            <para>Whilst on active service, did you find that it was very much a case of every man for himself, and the&#39; devil take the hindmost. You got rid of an officer, and you let the other fellow who took him look after him? - Yes. </para>

            <para>Did you feel on that occasion, or on other occasions, that the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> was with you in a responsible position, either as Adjutant or as squadron leader, added to your responsibility ? - Very much so. </para>
            <para>Did you ever entrust him with independent responsibility in the nature of command? - Nothing further than that which was imposed upon him as a squadron leader. </para>
            <para class="block">At question 712 - </para>
            <para>Did <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> himself apply <inline font-style="italic">to you for</inline> a recommendation to remain for further service? - He applied for further service, and the application was sent to me.

After returning to Queensland, had you anything to do with the vouchers or requisitions for the payment of the war gratuity - .&#163;100 per man? - I do not think I did. I think Colonel Aytoun , dealt with that matter. 719. If you had been called upon to deal with that matter, I suppose that an officer would re-, quire to be very bad indeed - more than inefficient -to induce you to report so adversely as to prevent him from getting his <inline font-style="italic">&#163;100?</inline> - Yes. 720. He would have to be a downright blackguard ? - Yes, I only knew of one case in which the gratuity was refused. 721. In the ordinary way, when officers come oft service, they feel very kindly towards one another, and would not go out of their way to prevent any man from getting his gratuity ? - Certainly not. </para>
            <para class="block">The next witness, to whose evidence I must refer, is Brigadier-General Finn, who was Commandant of the Military Forces in New South Wales-  869. Did he cease to be an Instructional Officer in New South Wales at the end of 1892? - Yes. 870. What opinion did you form of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> as a military officer ?- Only a fair opinion. 879. What was the oral report you made to Major-General Hutton concerning <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> between July and November, igo2 ? - That he was only a fair Instructional Officer, and that he had much to learn. </para>

              <para>- The next evidence to which I desire to refer is on page 75 -  1491. You stated that you thought that I was below the standard of a militia officer? - No. I said that from my short experience of you I thought you were below the standard of other instructional staff officers. 1492. But had any of the other instructional staff officers done this new drill? - Yes, they were doing it at the some time. 1493. Had they ever done it before? - Not so far as I am aware. 1494. Then what makes you say that you think I was below the standard? - Because I think that you did not grasp it as quickly as they did.  1 have already read the evidence referring to the report of Brigadier-General Finn, and now we come to Colonel  Plomer.  who was Instructional Commandant in Queensland at the time, and was, no doubt, one of the officers from whom the General Officer Commanding got his information - </para>

I knew at that time that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> had returned.  Colonel Aytoun  shrugged his shoulders, and said, &#34; My dear Plomer. we all know poor Carroll.&#34;  Colonel Avtoun  never said anything against <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll.</inline> 1562. What did  Colonel Ricardo  say? -  Colonel Ricardo  always gave me a general idea that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> was a somewhat eccentric officer, on whom one could not very well depend. I had never seen <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> at that time. </para>

              <para>- The evidence proceeds -  1565. So far, you have been giving us information as to what were the opinions furnished you by other persons ; can you now give us your own experience of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> ? - My experience of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll,</inline> personally, is very limited. When he came back from South Africa, some time about April or May, 1902, 1 must have seen him.  I  remember very well his coming to my office when I was A.A.G. ; that was before he went to Charters Towers.  I  remember on one occasion trying to make him understand why at that time he was not  a <inline font-weight="bold">Major in</inline> Australia, and  I  had great difficulty in making him understand. I did my best, but the Committee will understand that one does not wish to hurt any one&#39;s feelings by stating the reason which would be given ultimately. No one likes to be reduced in rank; but  I  tried to explain to him that he was  a  Captain in Australia, whatever he had been in South Africa. I must say that I quite failed to make him understand. Ultimately the honorary rank of <inline font-weight="bold">Major was</inline> allowed by the Commonwealth to all officers who had served under similar circumstances. The opinion that I formed was that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> was extremely stupid. I could not understand how it was that I could not make an officer grasp so simple  a  position. <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> then went north, and I must say that  I  never heard anything against him.  I  had very little dealings with him personally. </para>

              <para>- The honorable senator may be able to ascertain the fact for himself. The next evidence is as to the opinions expressed by officers during the three years in Queensland.  1628. You state, further, in your letter -  . . &#34; I find from the records that on the 3rd January, 1890, <inline font-weight="bold">Major Grieve,</inline> R.A., commanding the Permanent Artillery, made  a  report to the Brigade <inline font-weight="bold">Major that</inline> he was dissatisfied with the way in which Lieutenant Carroll, attached to the battery under his command, perf ormed his duties.&#34; Is that so? - Those  aTe  almost the words of the report. I remember the words - &#34; I am dissatisfied withthe manner in which Lieut. Carroll performs his duties.&#34; The report went oa to enumerate the delinquencies. 1632. Did <inline font-weight="bold">Major Grieve</inline> say why? - He gave specific instances in a report, which ought to be produced. I do not want to say anything worse than I need against an officer. </para>

          <para class="block">That seems to have been the feeling of most of the witnesses.  1633. As Commandant of the Commonwealth Forces in Queensland, did you receive any re quests that you should forward a report to Headquarters or to the Defence Department? - Not to the Defence Department. 1634. These were papers and records connected with <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll&#39;s</inline> case ? - Yes ; as regards his service, so far as I remember. I take it you want to know why that was not produced before. 1635. Quite so? - The real reason was that an officer does not want to say anything worse than he can help against an officer. Why take up what he had done in the Artillery ? It was self-evident to the General ; I have nothing to do with the civil side of the Defence Department. When we knew very well that his service had not been satisfactory, why rake up all manner of other irregularities? 1659. However, I presume that whatever recommendation was made would be truthful? - Certainly. 1660. Then if  Colonel Aytoun  Said that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll&#39;s</inline> conduct was quite satisfactory- ? -  His  conduct, yes; that is different from capacity. 1661. Then for the purpose of getting a gratuity they make a statement that is misleading? - I do not think so. The officer is not asked as to the other officer&#39;s capacity. We were not asked at the end of the war whether an officer was capable, bu&#91; whether he had done his best. 1665. Am I to take it that there is nothing contradictory in the two statements?  - Read like that there is, without knowledge of what they are. When  Colonel Aytoun  signed that statement in regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll&#39;s</inline> services at the end of the war, I know from my military experience that it was with the view of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> getting the gratuity. 1666. And you say, at the same time, that it is a truthful statement? - It was a truthful statement. 1667. Then it is true that  Colonel Aytoun  thought that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> was quite satisfactory? - That his conduct was quite satisfactory. </para>
          <para>With reference to <inline font-weight="bold">Major Hooper&#39;s</inline> report, I am sorry to say that, in my opinion, it was excluded by the Select Committee without good reason. <inline font-weight="bold">Major Hooper</inline> was the officer commanding the Kennedy Regiment, of which <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> was adjutant, and I propose to read the report which <inline font-weight="bold">Major Hooper</inline> made. </para>

              <para>- That matter has been discussed. If the Select Committee had only intimated that they desired <inline font-weight="bold">Major Hooper</inline> as a witness he would have been brought down and his expenses would have been paid. The Select Committee, however, called upon <inline font-weight="bold">Major Hooper</inline> to answer interrogatories, but they were advised by the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth that they had no power to mate such a demand. The Select Committee went out of their way in, as it appears to me, a most unjustifiable manner, to exclude the evidence of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Hooper.</inline></para>

              <para>- They were invited to ask <inline font-weight="bold">Major Hooper</inline> to give evidence, when his expenses would have been paid. It is perfectly clear that if the Committee had said they wanted <inline font-weight="bold">Major Hooper&#39;s</inline> evidence, Captain Niesigh  would have undertaken that he would be present, and that the Department would pay the expenses. But as the Committee said they would not pay the expenses, the Minister of Defence said the Department would not pay. Other documentary evidence of a similar character was admitted, and I can see no possible reason why the Committee should have declined to take <inline font-weight="bold">Major Hooper&#39;s</inline> report into consideration. </para>

              <para>- No, he would not be called a volunteer; he is a militia officer. I do not wish to say anything further. I have pointed out before that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll,</inline> after being retrenched from the staff in Queensland, went down to New South Wales, and with regard to his service in that State we have the opinion of BrigadierGeneral Finn. In evidence very fairly given, and in no way personally directed against <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll&#39;s</inline> character, but viewing him only as an instructional officer, Brigadier-General Finn said that he could not see his way to place him in any position in the Force in New South Wales. I have undertaken to speak on this subject with a very great deal of reluctance. I have no desire to say one word against <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll,</inline> who, as all the witnesses have said, bears a very high character; but the evi dence shows that the officers in Queensland to whom the General Officer Commanding could have applied&#39; for information, were almost unanimous in speaking against his capacity as a military officer. I have no wish to say anything detrimental with respect to the evidence given by the other officers examined in Queensland, but I think honorable senators will find that they were in no case officers under whom <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> had served. I consider that very important. They were brother officers - militia and volunteer officers - and they gave the evidence which has been given by all the witnesses as to <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll&#39;s</inline> high character as a gentleman. With regard to his military capacity, I do not think the same importance can be attached to the evidence of those officers in Queensland as would be attached to that of officers under whom <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> served. It seems to me that if the Committee had to decide whether any injustice had been  done to <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll,</inline> what they should have inquired was whether Major-General Hutton, having been ordered to make retrenchment, made a mistake in recommending that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> should be retrenched rather than one of the other officers who have been named. As I have said before, I think that an injustice has been done to every one of the officers who have been named, because, while they have been mentioned as officers who should have been retrenched instead of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll,</inline> and the inference is allowed to be drawn that they were inferior to him in military capacity, they have not been allowed to give evidence on their own behalf, nor have other witnesses been given an opportunity to give evidence for them. In this respect, I think that an injustice has been done, not only to the officers whose names have beer mentioned, but to the late General Officer Commanding, and to the Department. </para>

              <para>- He was only allowed to go so far as to refer to one of them not having passed an examination in riding, and his cross-examination was prevented by the Committee. I have endeavoured to avoid giving the names of these officers, some of whom are personally known to me, and it seems to me entirely unfair that they should rest under such a stigma. If the instruction to retrench is to stand good, I point out that the re-instatement of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll,</inline> on the report of the Committee, must mean that one of these other officers must go. If so, would not that officer have exactly the same right to appeal to the Minister, and the same right to secure a. Select Committee of the Senate to inquire into his claim? Where would such a thing end? </para>

              <para>- There are very few, and there is not another where such important evidence was refused. As soon as Captain Niesigh proposed to cross-examine  Colonel Price,  the  chairman  of the Committee gave his ruling that  Colonel Price  being an officer of great experience, and occupying a certain position, it was sufficient that he should express an opinion, and it should remain unquestioned. Why did not the Committee accord the same treatment to Major-General Hutton? I submit that Major-General Hutton carried out the duty cast upon him to the best of his ability and judgment, and before the Senate agrees to the recommendation of the Select Committee, which practically means reversing Major-General Hutton &#39;s decision, and upsetting his judgment, at least, the qualifications pf other officers who have been compared with <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll,</inline> should be inquired into. I submit that that can only &#39;be done by a committee of military experts. I hold that the evidence taken does not bear out the findings of the Committee on these separate statements. I submit that, on the whole, the statements made by Major-General Hutton in a private and confidential letter to the Minister are substantially well-founded and accurate, and that no injustice has been done to <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll.</inline> There &#39; is nothing in the evidence to show that Major-General Hutton did not act in the fairest and most <inline font-style="italic">bona fide</inline> manner upon the information supplied to him by his officers. I contend that the judgment of the late General Officer Commanding, instead of being upset by the inquiry carried out by the Select Committee, has really been confirmed and justified by the evidence given before that Committee. </para>

              <para>- I did not propose to say anything very severe, but it seemed to me that the honorable and learned sena tor&#39;s speech, perhaps unconsciously, was in the nature of a special plea for the Department, and, incidentally, for the late General Officer Commanding. I submit that it is probable that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> has been actuated to some extent by unconscious bias. The honorable and learned senator occupied the time of the Senate on last Thursday afternoon for two and a half hours, and again this afternoon for nearly the same length of time, and his arguments have been entirely devoted to those portions of the evidence which go to prove the case of MajorGeneral Hutton. It has seemed to me that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake,</inline> as a representative of the Government in this Chamber, would have acted with more impartiality, if he had not taken that rather one-sided course. I impress upon honorable senators that this is a case in connexion with which there should be no party feeling. I believe that the members of the Select Committee, and those who think with them, in supporting the adoption of the report, will not be &#39; guided by party considerations. The Vice-President of the Executive Council has put the case for the other side almost as though the question had been one between two parties, and <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> had been supported by one, whilst the General Officer Commanding and the Department had been supported by the other. The amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Zeal</inline> is certainly worthy of consideration. I knew nothing of it until a moment or two before it was moved, but before honorable senators consider it, I wish to bring under their notice a matter which I consider of extreme importance. I may possibly take an extreme view, but whether my views are extreme or not, I intend to put them before the Senate as briefly as I can.

              <para>- I am speaking of Major-General Hutton in his capacity as General Officer Commanding. If he was not personally a party to the case, certainly the Department was a party to it. The parties were the Department on the one hand, and <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> on the other. It seems to me to be a distinct breach of privilege that any  individual, being a party to a case, should be allowed, while the case is <inline font-style="italic">sub judice,</inline> to furnish a memorandum for the purpose of influencing the judgment of the Senate. It is all very well to say that objection should have been taken to th? document at the time when it was laid upon the table. The answer is that frequently the Attorney-General lays papers upon the table, and we do not see them until we receive them by post the following morning. Very often they are entirely overlooked. The Senate, in its wisdom, appointed a Select Committee. That. Committee represented the Senate itself. It took an enormous mass of evidence, and in pursuance of its duties furnished a report, which has been in the possession of the Senate for some weeks. While that report is under the consideration of the Senate, one of the parties to the case sends in a memorandum, putting his views before the Senate with respect to the evidence. I submit that the memorandum should never have been tabled while the case was <inline font-style="italic">sub judice.</inline> Let the Attorney-General suppose that a case was being heard in a Court of Justice. Suppose that both the parties had laid their case before the Court, and that, after that had been done, one party sent a document to the Judge emphasizing his own point of view. That is exactly what has happened in this case. The members of the Select Committee are responsible for this report. </para>

But my contention is, that Major-General Hutton, through his private secretary, who represented him, took advantage of the most ample opportunities to call  evidence. But, after both sides have been fully heard, it is simply a farce to allow one of the parties to come in with fresh comments. My complaint is that at this stage, one side is allowed to furnish a memorandum, practically bringing forward fresh evidence. </para>

              <para>-A militia officer approximates more nearly to a volunteer than to a member of the Permanent Staff. Although it is a grievance that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Hooper,</inline> a militia officer, was not called, we are told that the evidence of volunteer officers is that of persons of &#34;necessarily very limited relative knowledge.&#34; I should like to know which is the higher authority - the Senate or an outsider in the person of Captain Niesigh? The Senate appointed the Select Committee, which has furnished a report ; and now an attempt is made to influence the mind of the Senate by means of a purely one-sided statement, sent in after the report of the Committee was furnished. We shall turn our proceedings into a farce if this kind of thing can be done. I do not intend to enter upon an analysis of the evidence, though, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> did so on the other side, I should be justified. </para>

My feeling was that he was unduly dragging out his case. &#39;The honorable and learned senator gave all the evidence he could on the one side, and has occupied so much time that there does not now appear to be any prospect of arriving at a decision before Parliament prorogues. It would take an honorable senator another four hours to summarize the evidence against the arguments advanced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake,</inline> who reduced the case to one of lawyer and client. </para>

              <para>- The honorable and learned senator dealt with the matter at extreme length, and I may have been wrong, but I could hot help thinking that he did not seem very anxious that the Senate should arrive at a decision. There should be some settlement, because it would be unfair to both sides if Parliament were to rise without finding for or against the report of the Committee. So anxious am I that there should be finality, that I am prepared to do myself the injustice of refraining frqm sifting the evidence, and laying before the Senate sound reasons in support of the recommendations submitted by the Select Committee. In common, I believe, with other members of that Committee, I am willing to accept the fullest responsibility for the report ; and, further, we are prepared, even in the absence of any amendment, to accept the verdict of the Senate on the report as it stands. It is only fair, however, that the report of the Committee should be considered on its merits. </para>

I understand, however, that other honorable senators may have something to say, and, in the absence of any promise from the AttorneyGeneral to grant Government time, this may be the last occasion on which we shall have an opportunity to discuss private members&#39; business. I hope that honorable senators who have not yet made up their minds, will carefully read the report of the Select Committee, and arrive at a decision uninfluenced by the memorandum to which I have referred. I know that at least, two Or three honorable senators, after hearing the arguments of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> and reading that memorandum, have gone away quite satisfied that the findings of the Select Committee are unsound. I recommend those honorable senators to read the report for themselves before coming to a final decision. </para>

                <inline font-weight="bold">- Major Hooper</inline>desired to come down to give his sworn test:mony, but, because both the Committee and the Department declined to pay his expenses, he refused to swear to his statements in Queensland. In order to save expense, the Select Committee journeyed t.,.300 miles towards <inline font-weight="bold">Major Hooper,</inline> and I was one of the members who took the trip. Even then <inline font-weight="bold">Major Hooper</inline> would not come to Brisbane, although we were waiting for him; and I must say that the incident made a bad impression on my mind. <inline font-weight="bold">Major Hooper</inline> had every opportunity to make an affidavit and send it down, and we refused to accept any unsworn statement. The Committee had decided that all witnesses should be sworn, and we did not see why an unsworn statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Major Hooper</inline> or any one else should be admitted. I do not blame the General Officer Commanding for the course he took, but I think he was ill-advised. With other members of the Committee I had the advantage, not only) of hearing, but of observing the demeanour of nearly every witness, and we all know what an advantage that is in estimating the value of testimony. In my opinion, the report of the Select Committee is amply justified. If ever I get into a difficulty with the military, I shall retain Captain Niesigh  to prepare the brief and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> as my advocate. Had I been in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake&#39;s</inline> place, I should have done what he has done, namely, gone to Captain Niesigh,  who was the man able to pick out the evidence favorable to the case presented by the Department. </para>

              <para>- I merely say that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> did so, he only did what most people would have done in similar circumstances; but, of course, I at once accept his denial. Unless I am compelled by the Senate, I shall decline ever to serve again on a military Select Committee. I have now served on two, and had the parties been allowed to call all the evidence they desired, I am afraid I should hot have lived long enough to see the conclusion of the work. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> has commented on the refusal of the  chairman  to allow the cross-examination of  Colonel Tom  Price. As honorable senators know,  Colonel Price  does not mince matters, and he declared that he was never consulted as to which officer should be retrenched. </para>

              <para>- Colonel  Plomer  was Commandant, and it was that officer who said that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> was stupid, or used words to that effect.  Colonel  Plomer,  in his evidence, stated that he had known <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> personally twenty-four hours, or forty -eight hours, or some -such period, and that he was unable to make <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> understand that while he might be a major in South Africa, he was only a captain in Australia. I suggested to  Colonel Plomer  that it might be his hazy method of communication which made it impossible for <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> to understand, and  Colonel  Plomer  admitted  that. <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> was charged with being eccentric, and at one time it was even insinuated that he was a coward. At Brisbane, however, when the question was directly put, he was declared to be recklessly brave. </para>

              <para>- It was suggested that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> was not fit to be a soldier because he had appeared in a &#34;wild west&#34; hat with a stockwhip round his waist ; but we all do things in our youth which might be regarded as eccentric in our later years. Had I known that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> would have gone into details so deeply, and had I been in better health, I could have prepared a counterblast. I think I could have quoted the opinion of men who occupy much higher military positions than that of the schoolmaster in  Northern Queensland - <inline font-weight="bold">Major Hooper</inline> - who, I suppose, has never smelt powder except when opossum shooting. Many of the officers who returned from South Africa spoke in the highest terms of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll.</inline> I shall support the adoption of the report ; but I am afraid that the next time I am asked to serve on a Select Committee of a like nature, there will be a vacancy in the Senate. I am certain that, had the Attorney-General been  chairman  of this Select Committee, much of the evidence would never have been permitted. The <inline font-weight="bold">chairman, Senator Higgs,</inline> was most patient, and, in my opinion, allowed too much latitude to the witnesses. The position which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> took up was that, unless the evidence was admitted, it would afterwards be said that the parties had not received fair play. Time after time I pointed out to that gentleman that the Committee were wasting time in hearing evidence which was absolutely useless ; but I recognised that he was in a difficult position. A new charge has now been levelled by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> against the  chairman  of the Committee, but the honorable and learned senator cannot know as well as the members of the Committee what took place. Considering the cost which this Select Committee and the printing of the report and evidence have involved, it would, I think, have been much better to have, in the first instance, given <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline><inline font-style="italic">&#163;300</inline> or .&#163;400 by way of compensation. The result, however, is that, whoever gets the &#34; ha&#39;pence,&#34; the members of the Select Com mittee are receiving the &#34; kicks,&#34; for doing their duty to the best of their ability. </para>

              <para>- I have stated the difficulty in which I find myself. I am not in a position, even with the evidence and the Committee&#39;s report, to say that Major-General Hutton should not have retired <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll,</inline> and should have retired one of the other officers. On the evidence I have to take up the position which is covered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Zeal&#39;s</inline> amendment. I say that the evidence before the Committee discloses the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> is a valuable officer, and that whatever may have been the reason for his retirement, if it is possible the Government should take into favorable consideration the advisability of reengaging him. That is what the amendment provides for, and it seems to me that it suggests the only possible course for the Senate to adopt on the evidence which has been placed before them. I could not support the adoption of the report submitted by the Committee, but I can support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Zeal&#39;s</inline> amendment, and the motion submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> if it is so amended. </para>

            <para>- I do not care to give a vote on this matter without stating my reasons. There is a great responsibility resting upon the Senate if it should decide to vote against the report of a Select Committee which, after going through all the toil and weariness &#39; of examining a great many witnesses, has come to a unanimous conclusion. I cannot say that, like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> I have read every word of the report and evidence submitted by the Select Committee, but I have read a great portion of it. I listened to the very able summary contained in the speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs,</inline> and to the very able speech of the Vice-President of the Executive Council. Having heard those speeches, honorable senators must be very well informed of the evidence- which  was brought before  the Committee. I hold that if an officer in the Military Forces believes that he has been unjustly treated, and comes before the Senate for his defence, the evidence to be produced on his behalf should be of such a character as to make it clear, not only that an injustice has been done by his retirement, but that the Commonwealth Military Department would suffer from the lack of his services. Like some other honorable senators, I shall be very careful before I allow myself to be nominated to serve on a Select Committee dealing with military matters. I believe that the Senate should be absolutely the last resource for persons seeking justice in this way. All history and biography teach us that great military captains of all ages have complained that their military schemes have been more seriously retarded by the interference of persons without expert military knowledge than by anything else. In dealing with our Military Forces, we should be careful that no matter how popular a man may be he should not seek thedefence of the Senate unless the case he submits is of such a character that it would be clearly detrimental to the military interests of the Commonwealth if it were not heard. After listening to the various statements which have been made, I have come to the conclusion that the services of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> have not been such that even his retirement would be detrimental to the Commonwealth Military Forces. Casting no reflection upon his gallantry and personal qualities, I feel that I must take the view of his military capacity which has been taken by the military experts who appeared before the Select Committee. I take it that Major-General Hutton would never have retired <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> if he had not felt that it was his duty to do so, and that, as compared with other officers, who but for his retirement, would have had to be retired, <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll</inline> was on no more than an equality with them from a military point of view. I regret that I should have to vote against the adoption of a unanimous report from a Select Committee, but I must doso in view of the importance which I attach to the <inline font-style="italic">morale</inline> of the Military Forces of the Commonwealth. </para>

          <para>- In rising to discuss the second reading of this Bill, I desire to say, in the first instance, that I am standing in rather a novel attitude in speaking as a supporter of the measure. Because when a year ago <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> made a proposal in favour of the establishment of a Council of Defence in connexion with the Defence Bill which wewere then consider ing, I opposed the suggested innovation. I did so partly because the proposal then submitted was for a sort of semi-military semi-political council. It may be remembered that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> proposed, amongst other things, that there should be members of both Houses of Parliament on his suggested Defence Committee. That was one of the reasons why I took exception to it. It did not seem to me to be a workable proposal. I have very seldom in my political career gone back on any attitude which I have taken up. I have generally gone forward. Possibly it may be considered that I am going forward now. rather than backward. But I wish to make  it quite clear why I take up a totally different attitude to-night. My principal reason for opposing <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mathison&#39;s</inline> proposal a year ago was that, the proposal for establishing a Council of Defence was at entire variance with the greater experience in respect of defence matters that is necessarily possessed by the Imperial authorities at the centre of the Empire. But having noted the immense changes that have been made in connexion with British defence by the establishment in Great Britain of a Council of Defence, and being aware that the&#39; old position of Commander-in-Chief - held latterly by that dear old soldier, beloved by the whole Empire, Lord Roberts, popularly known as &#34;Bobs&#34; - was to be abolished, and that Great Britain was to follow in military administration somewhat the lines that have obtained for many years in connexion with naval administration, I necessarily reconsidered the whole subject. I am free to say that I am not one of those who think that Australia has nothing to learn from the mother country. I think that we may learn a great deal from her. When I found that this momentous change had been made in the motherland, I necessarily began to consider whether a similar change might not have advantages for Australia. Amongst the advantages that occurred to me were those which were so fully submitted by the honorable and learned Attorney-General last night, namely, that a Council of Defence would provide for a greater continuity of method in the administration of defence matters than could possibly arise by having a constant succession of ever varying CommandersinChief. If the Attorney-General had possessed as large a knowledge of military matters as he possesses of law, I am quite sure that he would have elaborated his argument to some little extent. </para>

            <para>- I am not finding fault with the speech at all. I recognise the excellence of the honorable and learned gentleman&#39;s deliverance, particularly on this question of continuity of policy. But I propose to address myself at greater length than &#39;the honorable and learned senator did to the support of this very proposal. Before doing so, I think it is but just that I should place on record my very high appreciation of the moral courage and ability with which the late Minister of Defence, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson,</inline> has drawn up and submitted to Parliament a proposal which I believe will very shortly become the law of the Commonwealth, and be possibly - with some few alterations that experience may prove to be necessary - the enduring defence law of the Commonwealth. With reference to this question of continuity of policy and method, I may remark that supposing we kept up the old system of command by a General Officer Commanding, we should never be likely to have a succession, or a regular supply, of officers, representing the same branch of the military Service. And as long as we had officers representing various branches of the service coming here, we should be absolutely certain to have an ever varying policy, in some important respects at least. </para>

            <para>- Exactly. The General Officer Commanding, who has just left us, was the one mounted rifleman General  in the  whole British service. There is not another officer that I know of who has occupied the same position as <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Hutton has done in connexion with mounted rifles or mounted infantry, as they are sometimes called. It is not possible for us to get another officer who would take exactly the same -stand in connexion with that arm of the service as he did. If we were to seek to import another General Officer Commanding, we should possibly, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson</inline> just now observed, get an artilleryman or an infantryman ; and I would point out, i f we had an infantryman, what would almost inevitably be the first change he would make. We have in use in the Commonwealth at present an infantry drill that was designed by the late General Officer Commanding. It is unlike the infantry drill that obtains in any other part of the British Empire. If we were to have an infantry General as Commander-in-Chief in the course of the next twelve months, it is absolutely certain that the infantry drill of the Commonwealth would be entirely changed. The infantry drill to which I refer took a very long time to hammer out. It is a kind of bastard mounted drill ; and it has the disadvantage that if the infantry of the Commonwealth were ever called upon to fight alongside other British troops in any part of the Empire, it would be impossible to work them together in brigade. </para>

            <para>- I am not proceeding to criticise the drill. I only want to point out how the policy may vary with a change of command. That is all. I am not finding fault with the drill.  1  am pointing out that the infantry drill that is now in use, designed by Major-General Hutton, in its formations, in its movements, and in its commands, is unlike the infantry drill of any other part of the Empire, <inline font-style="italic">lt-</inline> may be the best drill. It is quite possible that this drill is superior to that designed by the British Horse Guards, and signed by Field-Marshal Lord Roberts. Sometimes minor officers know more than their superiors, and possibly Major-General Hutton&#39;s ideas may be infinitely superior to those of his superiors. But the point is that if Major-General Hutton were to be succeeded by an Infantry General, this horse marine drill ,would be abolished, and the whole of the present system would be upset. On the other hand, the Council of Defence, which it is proposed to establish, may consider that it is such an excellent drill that they will keep it on. </para>

            <para>.- 1  take it that the Council of Defence would have the entire administration of the Defence Forces. There would be a continuous policy. There is another question. MajorGeneral <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> French, who was senior officer in the Commonwealth for the first year after its establishment, had a very strong belief in the advisableness of regiments possessing what is known as review-order uniform - that is, a smart dress for special occasions, ceremonials, and so on. He strongly believed in the old red coat for ceremonial displays. Major-General Hutton, on the other hand, when he came along, was only too anxious to get rid of every scrap of scarlet in the Commonwealth. I am not discussing one General&#39;s opinion as against the other. I am stating cases which are opposed to the idea of continuity of policy. Major-General Hutton, I say, sought to get rid of every bit of red cloth in the Forces. That might be perfectly right. I am not questioning it. But the next General Officer Commanding, if we continued the old policy, which it is proposed to change, might be a man who &#39;held the same views as were held by MajorGeneral <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> French. He might want to have the red coats back again. In that event, it will be readily understood that there would be a useless expenditure of money. If we are going to change the clothing of our Forces every few years, according to the views of the General Officer Commanding, we shall have two things - first a very useless expenditure of money, and secondly, a very patchy appearance on the part of the troops. That was seen to be the case in Sydney at Major-General Hutton&#39;s farewell parade the other day, where the troops appeared in all possible odds and ends of uniform, because the clothing was not in proper order Rather an unusual order was given in connexion with the parade. The dress to be worn was not undress, or field service dress, . or review order. It was to be &#34; as prescribed &#34; - or some such term analogous to that which we find so frequently in this Bill. The consequence was that everybody came in what clothing he possessed. One man might have a scarlet coat with a pair of khaki trousers ; another man might have a khaki jacket with blue trousers. It was anything but satisfactory. That was due to the continuous changes; and the difficulty would be augmented if we were to have &#39;a constant change of commanding officers. There is a point which the AttorneyGeneral did not discuss, and to which I propose -to address myself. It is a much more important question than that of changes in drill and uniform. I refer to the apparent impossibility of the Commonwealth,&#39; even by offering an exorbitantly high salary, securing the - services of the class of senior officer that we should have if we are going to put all our eggs in one basket - if we are going to have the whole of our Defence administration under one General Officer. I may remind honorable senators of the fact that for many months the Commonwealth Government busied itself in seeking to secure the services of a British General&#39; Officer, and was unsuccessful. The negotiations extended over fully nine months, and it was only at the end of that time that, failing to obtain the services of any one of the distinguished General Officers whom the Government were seeking, they eventually secured the services of a half -pay colonel. Because at the time the late General Officer Commanding was engaged for the command in Australia, he was, according to his own publication - the <inline font-style="italic">Military Forces List</inline> of the 1st September last - in the position of a half -pay colonel. </para>

            <para>- A salary of &#163;2,500, and unlimited travelling expenses. In view of the rate of pay, the Commonwealth ought to be able to secure a most superior military officer, but, apparently, it could not be done. There are attractions in England and India which prevent our getting such an officer as we ought to have, if we are going to carry all our defence eggs in one basket. One of the reasons why I am supporting the appointment of a Council of Defence is, because its members will not be here to try experiments, but will maintain a continuous policy of management. In England the pay for a major-general on the Staff is ,&#163;1,095 ; a colonel on the Staff gets &#163;750 ; a major of brigade, which, apparently, was the highest appointment that the late General Officer Commanding ever held in England, gets &#163;383 5s. per annum ; but the colonel of a line regiment receives 18s. per day. This information is given in the <inline font-style="italic">Army List,</inline> at page Ii68, and also in <inline font-style="italic">Whittaker&#39; s Almanack.</inline> With a Militia Force of about 44,000 men, Canada does not pay such munificent sums as are disbursed in Australia. It gives the British officer who commands there, only &#163;800 a year. </para>

            <para>.- I do not know what the travelling allowance is. I only know that the net emolument- a few years ago was &#163;800. When I was in London a few years ago, I had the friendship of a very distinguished officer - Lieut. - General Moncrieff, of the Guards. He had a long chat with me one afternoon as to the rates of pay in Australia as compared with Canada, where the Commander-in-Chief - General Burgoyne - was a personal friend of his own, and received a total emolument of &#163;800 per year. When I mention that Major-General, now <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> French, drew even more in the New South Wales command than Major-General Hutton has drawn in the Commonwealth command, because allowances of one kind and another brought up the former&#39;s emoluments t.o very nearly &#163;2,700, it can be very readily understood how General Burgoyne&#39;s friend was taken back at the idea of a British colonel - local rank, major-general - drawing &#163;2,600 or &#163;2,700 for commanding about 10,000 troops, as compared with &#163;800 for commanding 40,000 men in Canada. The Colonies and the Commonwealth have been magnificently liberal in their offer of emoluments to British soldiers. </para>

            <para>- If we cannot get general officers of experience as commanding general officers, rather than regimental commanders, it is desirable that we should have in the Council of Defence a continuing body that would undergo slight changes when, as the exigencies of political life required, the Minister would be changed from time to time. The Treasurer would be changed from time to time. Possibly some of the staff officers would also be changed from time to time, but still the Council of Defence, although some of its members retired, would remain a continuous body, like the Senate, but without any fear of. a double dissolution. We have been depending on a gentleman from the other end of the world, and apparently the pay did not attract the sort of officer whom the Government sought to obtain two or three years ago, and there we run the risk of getting sooner or later an officer with more ambition than ability, with more eccentricity than solid knowledge, and with a desire to run fads of his own. That is one of the risks which the present system lays us open to. In this respect, let me recall an incident connected with the selection of an officer to command in one of the </para>

            <para>.- I do not say anything regarding <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Redvers</inline> Buller&#39;s  opinion of the officer he sent. But there is always the risk of getting an eccentric rather than a solid man with large military knowledge, who alone should hold the direction of the defences of Australia. Because, with the greatest respect for every layman who has occupied the position of Minister of Defence in .the Commonwealth, or elsewhere in Australia, the Minister, as a layman, cannot be expected, unless in exceptional circumstances, to go against the recommendation of the Commander-in-Chief. There is a great risk of placing the whole defence of the Commonwealth in the hands of one individual, unless he be paramount in his profession. With the greatest possible respect for the colonial soldier, professional or amateur, I recognise the almost impossibility of his deriving a knowledge which would enable him to cope with the different branches of the military service, however excellent he might be in one. A colonial soldier might learn the duties of a cavalry leader, or an infantry leader, or a gunnery officer ; but I fail to see how it is barely possible for one colonial soldier, or one man, unless he be eminent in his profession, to gather and use profitably a knowledge of the various arms of the service, and the varied branches of the Military Department. </para>

            <para>.- I hope there is one, though I do not know exactly where to find him. I am laying down the exact opposite proposition ; I say that in my opinion, an officer may reasonably obtain in Australia a knowledge; of one branch, though I do not say he can gain a knowledge of all branches sufficient to qualify him to assume the responsibility of undivided control. On the other hand, a Council of Defence involves the proposition that each of the leading branches of the service must be represented. Amongst the four &#34;or five officers who will constitute the military section, will necessarily be men who have been trained in the different branches of the profession. Their working together, and exchanging views and knowledge on matters in which they are experts, will give us a body much more likely to give satisfaction in developing the defences of the Commonwealth, than could be obtained by maintaining the practice of having a succession of British officers, who, however capable in their respective spheres, may not all be experienced in the various branches of the service. </para>

            <para>- They are not. Amongst the members of the Defence Forces of Australia are to be found men of good professional and social position, not only amongst the officers, but in the rank J and file. In a regiment in New South Wales which I command, I have had the pleasure of having amongst the non-commissioned officers, and in the private ranks, men of high professional position and attainments who would be the last in the world to accept the discipline, so called, of officers who do not know how to treat them. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson</inline> says, a knowledge of Australian conditions is very necessary in an Inspector-General, and I do not think that the Council of Defence scheme could be launched under much happier auspices. There are many points which I might elaborate, but I think I have said sufficient to show my reasons for supporting the second reading. First of all, the Bill provides for the adoption of a similar method to that followed in the heart of the Empire; and, secondly, there are technical, or, if honorable senators like, professional or military reasons which appeal to me as a man of some little experience, who for many years has been an enthusiast on the subject of defence. I took a deep interest in the subject for years  before I was personally connected with the Defence Forces; indeed, my interest dates from when, as a lad, I lived in New Zealand in the days of the war, and when the Civil Courts were closed, and, under the martial law which prevailed, one could scarcely turn a corner at night without being challenged by a sentry. With militarism in every direction, and the whole community practically a camp, I, perhaps, got into my blood some of those feelings and instincts which make a man a bit of a soldier. </para>

            <para>- I never had occasion to run after the Attorney-General, nor he after me, so that I do not see how the observation is apposite. I aim not in the habit of running away, if that is what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson</inline> is suggesting. Having been for many years giving attention to defence matters, I naturally take great interest in the Bill now submitted, and in the wide departure that is proposed. Last night I suggested to the Attorney-General  that clauses 5 and 6 might be omitted. Since then, however, I have had the pleasure of a chat with the Minister of Defence, and from the explanation given to me by him, I see that one of the clauses, at any rate, need not be contested in this Chamber. As to the other clause, I may possibly ask for an amendment, in order that the Bill  may  be more in consonance with the principal Act. This clause deals with a matter. which was much discussed when the Defence Bill was before us. I hardly understand the reason for inserting such clauses in a Bill which deals with a large question of policy, and not with such little petty details as might be provided for in some other measure. This is a Bill to frame a new military constitution, and, in my opinion, it should not be burdened with comparatively unimportant regimental matters. That, of course, is only an expression of opinion, and may not be of much consequence. I feel quite sure that by my explanation, I shall have relieved honorable senators, . who might otherwise wish to criticise my change of attitude, from the necessity of making any attack upon me. </para>

            <para>- Certainly; and I have given my reasons at, perhaps, undue length. To put the matter briefly, I was first led to consider the change,1 by observing the method which has been adopted in the heart of the Empire; and then, having opened my mind, technical matters followed in train, and caused me- to regard the matter from quite a different point of view from that which 1 took twelve months ago. </para>

I take this opportunity to protest against the habit which the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reporters have of putting words into my mouth I never use in respect of the several &#34;learned&#34; and &#34; gallant &#34; members of this Chamber. It is an a&#39;bsolute waste of time, of printing, and of the services of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reporters, to continually insert these words, which no member of the Senate would ever dream of using. They are redundant and absolutely unnecessary, and the words &#34; honorable senator&#34; should be quite sufficient. This is an extremely difficult subject with which to deal. We have before us four independent documents - the departmental report, Major-General Hutton&#39;s report on the departmental report; the memorandum by the Minister of Defence, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McCay,</inline> an extremely sketchy document; and the Bill to amend the existing Defence Act. </para>

            <para>- The position is this : One type-written copy of his report appears to have been laid upon the table in  another place. I do not think it will be considered any breach of confidence if I say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson</inline> has informed me that, in order to secure a copy of the report, it was necessary for him to get a special copy made at his own expense. I applied for the same document, in order that I might get a type-written copy of it, and I was told that the  Clerk  in another place could not part with it. I then went to the Attorney-General, and asked that he should secure a copy of the document to be laid upon the table of the Senate, and should get it printed. It took the honorable and learned senator some five or six days before he could secure a type-written copy of this report ,&#60;to lay upon the table of the Senate. In the circumstances, I am justified in saying that the report was kept back - whether intentionally or not is another matter. As I pointed out by interjection when the, Attorney General was speaking, the Bill is really all we have to deal with. I pointed out also that practically there is nothing in the Bill but the mere shell of the scheme. All that the Bill contains is provision for an InspectorGeneral, a Director of Naval Forces, a Council of Defence, a Military Board, and a Naval Board. Honorable senators will find that it says nothing whatever of the constitution of these Boards. That is a matter of supreme importance to the Commonwealth, and yet it is left entirely in the hands of the Governor-General in- Council. I think it essential that some direction should be inserted in the Bill dealing with the constitution of these Boards. Parliament in this. Bill is deliberately deprived of any opportunity of dealing with the actual scheme proposed. The AttorneyGeneral has said that it is competent for any honorable senator to move amendments in the Bill. That, I grant, is the case. At the same time, the honorable and learned senator deprecated my avowed intention to move amendments. </para>

            <para>- I said that I proposed to deal in the Bill with the constitution of the Boards, and the AttorneyGeneral said that &#39;he hoped I would not do so. It is true that any honorable senator can move amendments on this Bill, but when the leader of the Government expresses J the opinion that they are thoroughly unnecessary, of what use will it be for any private member to devote his time to the drafting of amendments ? Honorable senators who are not lawyers will find that this work is not easily done, and must take time. We have, in discussing this matter, practically to leave the Bill entirely out of consideration. I take it that, after the experience of the last two or three years, the Senate has at last come round to approve the principle I advocated last year, and which, unfortunately, they did not insist upon on that occasion. I contended that we must have a Council of Defence, and must have Administrative Boards in conducting the defences of the Commonwealth. </para>

            <para>- It has not been the fate of the great reformer who has suggested this scheme. What we have to deal with is not this Bill, but the intentions of the Government in connexion with the constitution of the proposed Boards, and the duties of the Inspector-General. Here we find ourselves at once in a difficulty. We do not know whether the intentions of the Government are contained in the report of the departmental Committee appointed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson.</inline> So far as we know, the Ministerial scheme is not to adopt the report of that Committee. Then we have Major-General Hutton&#39; s criticism upon the  departmental Committee&#39;s report, and on looking at <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McCay&#39;s</inline> memorandum we find that MajorGeneral Hutton&#39;s suggestions are not accepted either. Finally, we have <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McCay&#39;s</inline> memorandum. On analysis, it will be found to be a most unsatisfactory and sketchy document. It adopts to a very large extent the report of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson&#39;s</inline> departmental Committee, but it does not adopt it <inline font-style="italic">in toto.</inline></para>

            <para>- The honorable senator is mistaken ; it does more than that. I.t modifies it considerably. When we come to examine the memorandum, it proves to be most hastily thrown together. It is lacking in essential details, and it bears on its face evidence of extremely hurried preparation. As a matter of fact, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McCay&#39;s</inline> memorandum is the only thing we have before us, and in it the Government are pledged to practically nothing in the way of detail. The Minister of Defence does not touch upon the most essential question of &#39;how much of the departmental Committee&#39;s report he intends to adopt, and how much of it he intends to ignore. It is absolutely essential that this Bill should be made very much more definite before it leaves our hands. It should, in particular, define who are to be the members of the Boards ; it should define their term of office, and any other essential details. I cannot at the moment suggest other essential details, but the two matters I have mentioned are absolutely essential, and should, without doubt, be embodied in the Bill. We might then leave it to the GovernorGeneral in Council to prescribe the powers and functions of the boards which would be created. In dealing with this matter, it is necessary to fall back on the report of the departmental committee, as the source from which the Minister of Defence has drawn his inspiration. Whether the Minister has adopted the report in whole or in part, the Attorney-General has frankly admitted that his inspiration has been derived from that report. Directly we begin to read the report, we find that it is itself based and founded, and even composed, on the report, in three chapters, which was issued by Lord Esher&#39;s Committee. There appears to be scarcely an original sentence or an original idea in the whole of the report. </para>

            <para>- That is as it may be. Nowhere in this report do I find any acknowledgement of the indebtedness of the Committee to Lord Esher&#39;s Committee. In that respect the report offers a startling difference to the report of Lord Esher&#39;s Committee, who in marginal notes acknowledge their indebtedness to all previous Committees. Whenever they quote from the report of either Lord Hartington&#39;s Committee, or any previous Committees which have sat in England to deal with defence questions, they acknowledge their indebtedness. I have the original English documents here before me, so that I am able to speak with absolute authority on these points. Lord Esher&#39;s Committee has been &#39; careful to give reasons in detail for every proposal they put forward, and therefore one is able to compare those reasons with the decision of the departmental Committee in .the Commonwealth, whenever they diverge from the recommendations of the English Committee. </para>

            <para>- I realize that difference at once ; but that comes in when we deal with details. If honorable senators have before them the report of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daw</inline> son&#39;s Committee, and will turn to page 5, they will see that under the heading of &#34; Duties of Inspector-General &#34; are the sentences which I now propose to read. I should explain that I have only had time to deal with a portion of the report. I had intended to deal with thewhole document. I have dealt with that portion under &#34;Duties of Inspector-General,&#34; and I intend to go through the rest of the report and to parallel the other portions in the same careful way as I have done with the paragraphs which I now propose to read. I shall read, in each case, the paragraph from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson&#39;s</inline> report, with the parallel extract from the report of Lord Esher&#39;s Committee - </para>

            <para>- That is perfectlytrue ; but it must be borne in mind that Major-General Hutton said that Lord Esher&#39;s Committee&#39;s report might be good enough for England, but that it was not, in his opinion, suitable for Australia. I differ from him inthat respect, but we must be fair to him. He said, in effect, &#34; It is good enough for England, with her larger military organization, but it is not a suitable scheme for a small army like ours in this Commonwealth.&#34; He is entitled to hold that opinion. I differ from him, but that does not make him wrong or a fool. Then we have <inline font-style="italic">two</inline> original paragraphs - </para>

            <para>- I take exception to that statement. If the honorable senator will look at Lord  Esher&#39;s  report, he will find that the Inspector-General is not expected to go outside the United Kingdom. Evidently the honorable senator has completely forgotten his own State and Western Australia, when he suggests that it would be easier to get about in Australia than in the United Kingdom. It takes as long to get from Melbourne to Perth, as to go from Liverpool to New York. So that that reason can hardly be considered a valid one for depriving the Army Council of power to direct the InspectorGeneral as to his work. </para>

            <para>- The honorable senator is mistaken. There&#39; is no provision for making an inspection in India, and, moreover, the Indian Army is totally distinct form the British Army. The debate has been useful, because we know now the motives which influenced <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson&#39;s</inline> Committee in striking out these, to my mind, extremely vital words.

        <para class="block">I distinctly dissent from that principle. What we have had to fight against in the Military Department all along has been the fact that Parliament has been kept in the dark. From the very first moment that the Minister I am not allowed to mention took control of the Department, report after report was pigeon-holed, and denied to us. The best proof of how unnecessary the refusal on his part was, is that when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson</inline> came into office he found no difficulty in giving any members of the Senate the fullest information in connexion with these matters, and he freely gave me information which I had been refused by previous Ministers. I wish, to place on record my appreciation of the extremely good work he did in that respect, particularly in allowing light to be thrown on the very great deficiency in the matter of guns and field artillery, about which no information could be got. If it is to be an instruction to the Inspector-General that his annual report should contain only matters which he deems it necessary to repeat, Parliament will not get that full information on defence matters which it is entitled to expect. Having, as I hope, established the fact that the report of Lord Esher&#39;s Committee forms the basis of the changes we propose to make in our Defence Department, we now have before us a certain amount of expert advice, which I intend, as shortly as I can, to quote and use for the purpose of analyzing the proposals whichare submitted by the AttorneyGeneral in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McCay&#39;s</inline> memorandum. As it comes first, I propose to commence with the Council of Defence. In this memorandum, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McCay</inline> proposes that the Council of Defence shall consist of the Minister of State for Defence, the Treasurer, the Naval Director, and the Chief of the General Staff. Then there are consultative members, but these may be dismissed altogether, because any person whom the Committee wished to consult would obviously become a consultative member. The expression &#34; consultative member,&#34; is merely brought in as a sop to certain officers and people in the Citizen Forces who are being honored with this very flowery designation&#39;, which will satisfy them and mean nothing. In dealing with this matter of a Council of Defence, Lord </para>

          <para>In considering the constitution of the Defence Committee itself, we are fully alive to the vital necessity for having as its invariable President, the Prime Minister of the day. Under our political institutions, based on the authority of a Parliament with traditions like ours, no body of experts, however highly trained and qualified, would carry sufficient weight and authority to give practical effect to their conclusions, unless the Prime Minister, in whom governing power is vested, were present at their deliberations, and personally committed to their policy. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson&#39;s</inline>Committee, working on that report, expressly included the Prime Minister for that very reason, and the present Government, who drafted in the course of two or three days a memorandum which took three weeks or a fortnight to print, apparently cut out this gentleman without one shred of reason. </para>

We should, however, fail in our duty were we not clearly to define the urgent and vital importance of providing, in some shape or form, a permanent institution, charged with the duties and responsibilities of calling the attention of the Prime Minister of the day to strategic problems of defence, which are never constant, to the actual condition of our armaments, and to the relation which the latter should bear to the former if the King&#39;s Dominions are to remain secure. </para>

          <para>At the outset of our inquiry, therefore, we are driven to the conclusion that no measure of War Office reform will avail, unless it is associated with provision for obtaining and collating for the use of the Cabinet all the information and the expert advice required for the shaping of national policy in war, and for determining the necessary preparations in peace. Such information and advice must necessarily embrace not only the sphere of the War Office, but those of the Admiralty and of other offices of State. </para>

          <para>A committee which contains no permanent nucleus, and which is composed of political and professional members, each preoccupied with administrative duties widely differing, cannot, in out opinion, deal adequately with the complex questions of Imperial defence. Valuable as is the work which this committee has accomplished, the fact remains that there is no one charged with the duty of making a con tinuous study of these questions, of exercising due foresight in regard to the changing conditions produced by external developments, and of drawing from the several departments of State, and arranging in convenient form for the use of the Cabinet such information as may at any moment be required. </para>

          <para>The committee is necessarily a changing body. It is not safe to trust matters affecting national security to the chance of a favorable combination of personal characteristics. We are, therefore, convinced that the addition of a permanent nucleus to the Defence Committee is essential as the only valid guarantee - (1) that vitally important work with which no one is now charged shall be continuously and consistently carried on, and (2) that the Prime Minister shall have at his disposal all the information needed for the due fulfilment of his weighty responsibilities, and, further, we can conceive no other means of focussing questions of national defence under existing conditions without involving constitutional changes which would be undesirable, if not impracticable. </para>

            <para>- In dealing with a question of policy and organization, as much discussion and intelligence is required in providing for 200,000 or 500,000 men, as for 25,000  men.  At any rate, the fact remains that that was the Defence Council in England when Lord  Esher&#39;s  Committee framed their report. That Committee found the Council insufficient, and, for the very cogent reasons &#39; which I have quoted, they urged that a permanent nucleus should be added to the Committee. It is for us to consider how far the three professional members whom <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McCay</inline> proposed to add to the Council can perform the functions of a permanent nucleus; and I submit that they cannot perform the functions. I suggest for the consideration of the Senate, that a military officer and a naval officer such as  are recommended in Lord E sher&#39;s  Committee - not of high rank necessarily, but young men - should be appointed to the Defence Council for two years. As I have said the duty of such officers would be to spend their time permanently preparing and col lating information to place before the meetings of the Council. </para>

            <para>- Those are the persons of whom I aim speaking. It is possible to take that view, but I do not read it so. In any case, there was a distinct recommendation by Lord  Esher&#39;s  Committee in connexion with the Council of Defence, which we have appropriated, and for which no provision whatever has here been made. This is a most serious omission. It is perfectly clear, as Lord  Esher&#39;s  Committee points out, that these gentlemen, owing to their departmental and administrative duties, will be practically debarred from framing schemes. Unless we have a permanent Department of the Defence Committee, occupied solely with that business, defence matters will remain in exactly the same mixed-up condition in which they are to-day. Personally, I still hold the opinion that both political parties in Parliament should be represented on the Council of Defence. I have often aired my views on the subject, and no one can deny that nearly all the trouble in connexion with the Defence Department arises on account of the conflict between the two political parties in Parliament struggling for supremacy, and anxious to secure votes. In these circumstances the conduct of the defence of the Commonwealth must suffer. </para>

            <para>- There are always two very well defined parties, the Government and the Opposition. Since it is proposed that we should amply provide for the representation of the Government on the Council of Defence, I believe that a member of the Senate and a member of the House of Representatives might fairly be taken from amongst those who are in opposition to the Government, and given seats on this Council. If that course were followed, the recommendations of the Council of Defence, when submitted to Parliament, would be received in a very different spirit from that with which Parliament will receive recommendations emanating merely from those who are in power. </para>

            <para>- What I suggest would remove the whole question of defence from the sphere of party politics, and certainly that is what we should aim at. Lord  Esher&#39;s  Committee had nothing to say upon this question, because in England such a question would never arise. The Government in the Parliament of the United Kingdom has usually so strong a majority that the cavilling of the Opposition counts for little or nothing. In recent years it has been found that when Army and Navy votes come before the Parliament of the United Kingdom, the Opposition raise no obstacle of any kind, and the votes are passed almost without discussion. </para>

            <para>- It was because the Government had not made proper provision for the supply of cartridges, and the adverse vote was in condemnation of the laxity of the Secretary of State for War. I have dealt with the principle of the Council of Defence proposed, and I come now to deal with the provisions of the Bill as applied to it. As I have already said, they are entirely inadequate. I hope that the Attorney-General will see his way to add something to clause 7, which will define the constitution of the Council, so that the matter may be dealt with by Parliament, as it ought to be. We can very well leave the functions and powers to be prescribed by the Governor-General in Council, but it is essential that the constitution of the Council should be decided by Parliament. I come now to deal with the Military Board. According to the proposal before us, it is to consist of the Minister of State for Defence, the Chief of General Staff,  Deputy  AdjutantGeneral, Chief of Ordnance, and a finance member, who is called in the Minister&#39;s memorandum a &#34; Civil Member.&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator *</inline> Dawson&#39;s Committee, following much more closely the recommendations of Lord Esher&#39;s  Committee, advise that there should be four so-called military members corresponding to the Chief of- Staff, AdjutantGeneral, Quartermaster-General, and Chief of Ordnance, with the addition of a finance member. I wish to deal first of all with the term &#34; Civil Member,&#34; referred to in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McCay&#39;s</inline> memorandum. This term bears no relation whatever to the term &#34; Civil Member,&#34; as used by Lord Esher&#39; s Committee. The expression, as used in the report of that Committee, provides a definition for the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for War, the official who apparently represents the War Office in a junior capacity in the Parliament of the United Kingdom. No work has hitherto been provided for him, and under the circumstances Lord Esher&#39;s  Committee suggested that he should be called the Civil Member, and should be added to the Committee of Defence. In the Commonwealth we have no parliamentary official occupying a corresponding position. The functions which are set out in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson&#39;s</inline> Committee&#39;s report for the Civil Member are those assigned to the Finance member. It is just as well that this should be thoroughly understood, because the  term &#34; Civil Member &#34; as used in the Minister&#39;s memorandum is most misleading, and the proper term should be &#34; Finance Member.&#34; I cannot help feeling that this term &#34; Civil Member&#34; has been used here with very grave intention, in order to suggest that the finance member should not be a military man. I am given to understand that it is the intention of the Government to make the Permanent Secretary of the Defence Department the Finance member of the Military Board, and it is for that reason that the term &#34; Civil Member &#34; has been used. I strongly protest against any arrangement of that sort being made. </para>

        <para class="block">There is not a single one of these matters which could not be performed by a military man. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> has asked me what grounds I have for supposing that it is the intention of the Government to appoint the Permanent Secretary of the Defence Force to this position.. I have a very strong reason which I overlooked, and that is that it is specifically recommended in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson&#39;s</inline> addendum to his Committee&#39;s report. The honorable senator expressly states that the Finance member of the Military Board should undoubtedly be the Permanent Secretary or permanent head of the Defence Department. I just as strongly affirm that that gentleman should not be appointed the Finance member of the Military Board. My reason is this : The Military members of this Board are all to be appointed for a fouryears&#39; term. The Minister, as we all know, will come and go, and the result will be that the Permanent Secretary of the Department, if he should become a member of the Board, will go on for ever. Major-General Hutton, in dealing with the matter, says, in paragraph 21 of his criticism of the scheme - </para>

            <para>- That is so, but things which are not mentioned sometimes eventuate when it is too late to protest against them. I have no hesitation in saying that the Finance member should be absolutely independent. He should be appointed, as are the Military members, for a term of four years, and he should then return to his regimental duties. What can be more essential than that our military officers should acquire an .intimate acquaintance &#34;with the difficulties of dealing with financial questions, and the restrictions which the Parliament must place upon expenditure? How could any officer better obtain this experience and information than as the Finance member of the Military Board? Again, I fall back upon my authority, and Lord  Esher&#39;s  Committee has a good deal that is most significant to say upon this subject. They say - </para>

          <para>The theory that military officers of all ranksare by the fact of wearing un&#39;iform shorn of all business instincts has inevitably tended to produce the laxity which it is supposed to prevent. When money is doled out in compartments, and no discretion as to allocation is permitted, savings are not likely to accrue. In the cases, however, in which some measure of financial responsibility has been afforded to military officers, as in funds granted for manoeuvres, and in the provision of supplies in th&#39;e military districts, marked regard for economy has &#39; been manifested. There can be no doubt that in proportion as officers are accustomed to financial responsibility the economy which they alone can secure will be effected. </para>
          <para>While, the present system of  fiancial  control is futile in peace, it is ruinous in war. Officers unaccustomed to bear any financial responsibility, and ruled by excessively complex regulations, cannot at once improvise a system for the control of expenditure in the held, when the restraints are suddenly removed. The result, as in South Africa, is the waste of millions. </para>

          <para>The Financial Secretary is now the colleague of the members of the Council, and can no longer occupy the position of an independent critic with special powers of access to the Secretary of State. His responsibility for the efficient and the economical administration of the military force* is co-equal with that of the other members. He has specially assigned duties, but not special responsibility apart from them. Parliament and the country must in future hold the Army Council responsible as a whole, through the Secretary of State, for the efficiency of the forces. The Council is one and  indivisable  with aims and interests shared in common by all members. </para>
        </quote>
        <para>So much for the Finance member. I can see no reason to dispute the carefully-arrived- at conclusion of the Esher Committee. It would be impossible for the Permanent Secretary of the Defence Department to control that Department efficiently, and at the same time discharge all the duties that I have enumerated, as well as act as Secretary to the Military Board, and as Secretary to the Naval Board. I see no reason, however, why he should not act as secretary to both these Boards, because his duties in that respect would be analogous to the duties as Permanent Secretary of the Defence Department ; and as a simple recording officer, his assistance would no doubt toe most valuable to both Boards. But as a member of the executive&#34; of those Boards, he is distinctly out of place. The next question is that of the absence of a Quartermaster-General. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson&#39;s</inline> Committee framed their report, following the lines of the Esher Committee, they included such an officer. But <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McCay</inline> has come along, and has cut the Quartermaster-General out entirely. No reason of any sort is given for the omission. The duties have in the most arbitrary way been divided between the Adjutant-General and the Chief of Ordnance. Four of the Departments which would ordinarily be controlled by the Quartermaster-General, namely, Transport, the Army Service Corps, the Army Medical Corps, and the Veterinary Department, are placed under the control of the DeputyAdjutantGeneral. The other four Departments, namely, Supplies, Clothing, Equipment, and Ordnance Department Stores are placed under the control of the Chief of Ordnance. I pointed out yesterday, and I repeat it, that the Chief of Ordnance must be a highly-trained engineer officer. He must be a man of very special attainments in a very special line. To ask that officer to make himself responsible for buying supplies wholesale, and looking after  clothing &#39; and equipment is .too preposterous for anybody to think of. In addition to that, it is absolutely impossible in any army to separate transport from supplies. Nothing could be more clearly set. out than that fact is in the columns of Lord Esher&#39;s  report, under the heading of &#34; Duties of Quartermaster-General.&#34; I do not, however, quote it; but I do propose to quote a paragraph from Lord  Esher&#39;s  report in that connexion. It is as follows, speaking of the Admiralty: - </para>

Any business man would laugh at the suggestion. Yet, if we follow <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McCay&#39;s</inline> proposal, we should be forced to adopt that very system.

        <para class="block">What we have to ask ourselves is this - is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McCay&#39;s</inline> proposed organization applicable to the necessities of war? Can any one believe it possible that in time of war we can do without a QuartermasterGeneral&#39;s department ? Has the Senate any idea of the organization of the QuartermasterGeneral&#39;s department. If not, all that honorable senators have to do is to turn to MajorGeneral Hutton&#39;s report on the recommendations of the Defence Committee, and there it will be found that at the present moment we have a  Deputy  Quartermaster-General, assisted by two assistants, whose services have practically been shown to be indispensable. Yet the Government propose to do away with that officer, and to throw his work upon two other officers, in spite, not only of MajorGeneral Hutton&#39;s advice - because I understand that people are chary of accepting his advice - but of the carefully-thought-out scheme of the Esher Committee.

            <para>- He may be, but he has not had the experience that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Sydenham Clarke, Lord Esher, and Admiral <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Fisher have had. I think I have made out a good case for the QuartermasterGeneral, and I hope that the Senate will insist on having that officer reinstated as a member of the Council of Defence. I spoke at the commencement of the slovenly, slipshod way in which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McCay&#39;s</inline> memorandum has been drawn up.* Just in passing I wish to justify that statement. In <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McCay&#39;s</inline> schedule we find an officer called the  Deputy  Adjutant-General. T understand that the word &#34; deputy,&#34; directly the office of General Officer Commanding is done away with, is entirely redundant. We find that MajorGeneral Hutton talks, in connexion with the new office, of &#34; the Adjutant-General.&#34; We find that Lord Esher&#39;s Committee talk Of the office of &#34;Adjutant-General.&#34; Yet, because under existing conditions the officer is called a  Deputy  Adjutant-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McCay,</inline> or the office - of course it is not <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McCay</inline> individually - puts down the same title, though it was quite unnecessary to use the word &#34; deputy.&#34; The most important feature in connexion with this Council of Defence has not been sufficiently touched upon by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson&#39;s</inline> Committee, or by any one else. The point is this. These officers are appointed for four years, and it is intended that at the end of <inline font-style="italic">four</inline> years&#39; tenure the officers are to go back to their ordinary routine work outside the office, and that four other men of similar standing are to come in and carry on the work. </para>

In other words, there will be eleven leading officers in the Commonwealth available for interchange. I have already pointed out the ridiculous nature of the provision for consultative members of the Council of Defence. What I said there applies with equal force to the inclusion of representatives of the Citizen Force as consultative members of the Military and Naval Boards. The titles, if they are conferred, will be simply figures of speech, because it is  perfectly  obvious that if it is necessary to consult any people, they will be called in, whether they are called consultative members or not. </para>

            <para>- The honorable senator may be perfectly right. No doubt other persons outside Parliament are of the same opinion as he is, namely, that this constitutes an Advisory Board, but it does not. It is simply an honorary title given to a few men in order to secure their support. There again the provisions in the Bill are entirely inadequate, and if it is taken into Committee to-night, it will be utterly impossible to draft amendments by the morning. I maintain that the constitution of these Boards ought to be clearly set out in the Bill. They are not set out, and the result will be that we shall probably pass the Bill to-morrow morning, and in the course of a few months we shall find that the Government have made arrangements differing perhaps very materially from even the provisions indicated by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McCay,</inline> and which, so far as I am concerned, will be thoroughly unsatisfactory. I now come to the Naval Board, and here we find a most curious reversal of the whole of the principles that nominally governed <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson&#39;s</inline> Committee, when they were dealing with the Military Board. The main objects of the proposed new scheme as were set out in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McCay&#39;s</inline> memorandum are - </para>

        </quote>
        <para class="block">What do we find ? We find that in spite of that the Director of Naval Forces is to combine both administrative and inspecting duties ; indeed from another paragraph it is fair to assume that it is also intended that he shall have a State command. I do not know whether the Attorney-General has made any inquiry on that score, but I called his attention to it when he was making his second reading speech. We might just as well have no system as have a system which is put in force in one respect by one Board, and is entirely ignored by the other Board. Beyond that there is very little to say about the Naval Board. Its construction is entirely out of keeping with the rest of the scheme, and if it is put through on the lines contemplated it cannot avoid being a failure. I now come to the question of the Permanent Secretary of the Defence Department. Lord  Esher&#39;s  Committee have a good deal to say about the Secretary to the War Office, whose position corresponds with that of the Permanent Secretary of our Defence Department. In case it may be suggested that under this re-organization scheme his duties  would become so diminished that he might fairly be asked to take a seat on the Military Board as a defence member, I propose to indicate a few of the duties which he might reasonably be expected to perform. Under Lord Esher&#39;s scheme, and doing nothing else than act as Secretary of the War Office, the following are the principal duties he would have to discharge: - </para>

        <para class="block">It will be remembered that when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson</inline> was in office he ordered an inquiry on several occasions into a most extraordinary leakage which took place iri the Defence Department, showing that the defects occurring at home are equally prevalent here. The question of promotion is dealt with extremely fully in Lord Esher&#39;s report, and has hardly been dealt -with by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson&#39;s</inline> Committee or in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McCay&#39;s</inline> memorandum. This is one of the most important topics with which we could&#39; possibly deal. There is always a feeling that promotions are apt to be made improperly - that influence may be brought to bear in order to secure promotion for men who are not duly entitled to it. Lord Esher&#39;s Committee are very explicit on. the constitution of a Promotion Board ; but I do not see that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.. McCay</inline> makes any proposal in this connexion, except that the Inspector- General is to be the  Chairman  pf such a Board. Nothing whatever is said, however, about the constitution of the Board. Under the circumstances, we are obliged to fall back upon Major-General Hutton, who recommends that the Board shall consist of the Inspector-General, the AdjutantGeneral, and the Commandant of Victoria. Personally, I do not think that such a Board is at all satisfactory, though I have no suggestion to make on that score, being of opinion that any recommendation&#39; should, have come from the Committee. I have not touched on the Inspector-General, chiefly because there is not much exception to be taken to the proposal which has been placed before us. I understand that objections are raised to the presence of the Inspector-General on the Council of Defence, but as the equivalent officer will be on the Council in England I do not see any objection to the .same course, being pursued here. Had Lord Esher&#39;s Committee pointed out that it was impossible, or out of place, for the InspectorGeneral to be on the Council, the objection would have held good here, but in the absence of any direction of the sort I do not see why we should strike out a line for ourselves. </para>

            <para>- The AttorneyGeneral says &#34; Hear, hear,&#34; but I appeal to him, though I am afraid uselessly, to induce the Minister of Defence to mould the scheme more on the lines laid down by Lord Esher. If some reasons were given for the departures, one might be satisfied; but, so far as one can see, there is simply a desire to make an innovation in the proposals of a predecessor. Suggestions are struck out which are essential fo the scheme, and we are simply told, without any proof, that they are unnecessary. </para>

            <para>- It certainly is, when there are no reasons to give ; but the matter is left in an extremely unsatisfactory position. I intended to say a great deal more, but, unfortunately, this legislation has been pushed ahead somewhat unduly, and there has not been opportunity to consider all the questions which arise out of the report. </para>
